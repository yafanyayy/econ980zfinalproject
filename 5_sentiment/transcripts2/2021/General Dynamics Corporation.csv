Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.49 This is, in most respects, a very solid quarter, even though we missed consensus by $0.",1978,"Good morning. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.49 This is, in most respects, a very solid quarter, even though we missed consensus by $0.05. I have more to say about that shortly. Despite the adverse impact of the pandemic, we achieved most of our operational and financial goals added dramatically to our backlog and had a very good cash quarter. The results in comparisons with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. Because of the adverse impact to the economy caused by COVID-19, I'll devote less time to the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and spend more time on the sequential improvement that tells a compelling story of recovery. I'll go through that in some detail as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. 
As we indicated that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest. It is quite remarkable that we came within $0.02 of the very strong pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue is up 11.1%, operating earnings are up 20.6%, net earnings are up 20.1% and earnings per share are up 20.3%. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance even compared to the year-ago quarter, but really good sequentially. For the full year, we had revenue of $37.9 billion, down from 3.6% from the prior year, net earnings of $3.17 billion and earnings per fully diluted shares of $11. Once again modestly below consensus. 
Our business was strengthened by significant growth in the backlog to a year-end record high of $89.5 billion. The same is true of total estimated contract value at $134.7 billion. The total company book-to-bill was 1.1:1 for the year, led by the particularly strong order performance of Electric Boat. The strong order intake across the board positions the company well for 2021 and beyond. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year was stronger than expected with a conversion rate of 91% of net income for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject in his remarks. 
Let me review the quarter, paying particular attention to sequential comparisons and the full year in the context of each group and provide some color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.4 billion is up 23.3% over the third quarter on the strength of the delivery of 40 aircraft, 34 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectations by 3 aircraft, 2 of which delivered after the first of the year for reasons related to customer preference. The third aircraft had a willing customer but was not ready for delivery by year-end. That one is on us. For the full year, revenue of $8.08 billion is off 17.6% from the prior year. Nevertheless, operating earnings are still over $1 billion, far away the industry leader. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $401 million is 41.7% better than the third quarter on the strength of higher revenue and a 220 basis point improvement in operating margin. However, the shortfall against consensus for the quarter and the year is found in the 3 anticipated deliveries that slipped into this year. This should not, in any respect, diminish the outstanding performance of Gulfstream in this environment. Furthermore, margins increased on a sequential basis throughout the year, ending at 16.5% in the fourth quarter. 
At midyear last year, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.4 billion with earnings of $1.13 billion. We finished the year with revenue of $8.1 billion and earnings of $1.08 billion. The entire shortfall is attributable to 127 deliveries versus our expectation of 130. All in all, still within the 125 to 130 deliveries we gave you right after the initial shock to the economy caused by the pandemic became manifest. 
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good, and the pipeline remains quite active. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.96:1 dollar-denominated. For the year, the book-to-bill was 0.88:1. This order activity was, in my view, quite good in the midst of a pandemic-induced depression. We are of the well-considered view that order activity will improve further as travel restrictions are lifted and the economy begins its recovery. 
Let me give you some thoughts on our product portfolio. First, the G500, G600 unit manufacturing costs continued to decline, and we are producing superb quality. We had 92 units of this family of aircraft in service at year-end. Anecdotally, the G500 led the order book in the fourth quarter. 
Next, some in the analyst community have expressed concern about the continuing demand for the G650, which first entered into service 8 years ago. At the end of this year, we had 436 G650 in service, an average of 54 per year. The 650 continues to be in demand, but not at that level. I can add anecdotally that in the fourth quarter, it was a close second to the G500 demand. It remains a strong competitor to anything in the air and remain a strong contributor to our revenue and earnings for the next several years. 
Finally, on the new product development front, all 5 G700 flight test aircraft are flying and have over 1,000 hours of test flight. We appear to be on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter 2022. That will stimulate both revenue and earnings next year. If you've been following our Aerospace R&D spend, you know that there's more to come on this subject. 
Next, Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $1.96 billion is essentially the same as the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $309 million or $25 million or 8.8% ahead of the final quarter of 2019, on the strength of 140 basis point improvement in operating margin to 15.8%. For the full year, revenue of $7.2 billion is up $216 million, a 3.1% increase after 12.3% growth in 2019 despite a revenue decline at ELS driven by COVID shutdowns in Spain earlier in 2020. Operating earnings of $1.04 billion or up $45 million, a 4.5% increase. By the way, this performance is consistent with the initial guidance we provided earlier in the year.  
In the U.S., our Army customers continuing its modernization, which provides steady demand for our combat vehicles and munitions businesses. The fourth quarter had some nice order activity, including a contract for Abrams version 3 with a ceiling of $4.3 billion and additional Stryker SHORAD orders with the ceiling of up to $1.2 billion. Outside the U.S., we are beginning to see increased demand as our NATO allies start to emerge from COVID constrained activity, including over $200 million of Canadian ammunition orders in the quarter.
In short, this group has had quite positive revenue growth for several years now, continued its history of strong margin performance, had very good order activity and has a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. 
Next, Marine Systems. This is once again a good news story. Marine fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion is up $292 million, a compelling 11.4% increase over the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $247 million or up $48 million against a good fourth quarter in 2019. Importantly, there is an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins. The results are much the same sequentially. Revenue was up $452 million, and earnings are up $24 million or 10.8%.  For the full year, revenue was almost $10 billion, up $796 million or 8.7%. Operating earnings for the year of $854 million are up by $69 million or 8.8%. This is the highest quarterly and full year earnings ever for the Marine group.  In our midyear guidance to you, we anticipated revenue of about $9.6 billion and operating earnings of $845 million. We came in above that for both revenue and earnings. 
In response to significant increased demand from our native customer that you can see in these results, we continue to invest in each of our yards, particularly at Electric Boat to prepare for Block 5 and the new Columbia ballistic missile submarine. So suffice it to say that we're poised to support our Navy customers, they increase the size of their fleet and deliver value to our shareholders as we work through this very large backlog and improve our return on invested capital. 
Finally, the Technologies group, which consists of GDIT and Mission Systems is reported together for the first time in a while. You may recall, we used to report this group has been constituted as Information Systems and Technology. This new reporting reflects the way we manage these businesses with Group Executive Vice President, Chris Marelli reporting to me. We have also discovered that in this era of end-to-end solutions melding technology, hardware and software, these business units increasingly go to market together, seeking to provide end-to-end systems and support solutions. We will, however, continue to provide operating transparency by providing company-specific data where appropriate. Jason will have more to say about this in his remarks. This is, of course, the group in the Defense segment that has had the most impact from COVID-19 with the most remote  participation from employees and the most difficulty access in customer locations. With all that said, let's turn to the results and commentary on the group and specific businesses. 
For the quarter, Technologies had revenue of $3.23 billion, off less than 1% sequentially. Operating earnings of $352 million are up $38 million or 12.1% on a 120 basis point improvement in margins. As you would expect, given the environment, revenue for the first full year is off $711 million or 5.3% and earnings are off $100 million or 7.6%. It is well to remember that these revenue and earnings numbers exclude the SATCOM business that was sold in the first half of last year. All considered, the group performance showed good strengths and earnings guidance from us is close. Revenue came in at $350 million below our guidance, $12.65 billion versus $13 billion, but margins, particularly at GDIT, were better, leading our earnings forecast to be on target. From a margin perspective, GDIT was at 7.9%, up 40 basis points sequentially. Mission Systems at 16.2% was up 290 basis points over the last quarter. For the full year, the group's free cash flow exceeded 150% of full year imputed net earnings, the strongest performance within General Dynamics. GDIT's performance was even stronger. It was the best quarter cash performance in its history. The group enjoyed a tremendous order quarter with significant wins by GDIT in 4 major programs, all of which are IDIQ contracts. As a result, under our conservative accounting policy, these awards are found in total estimated contract value rather than an unfunded backlog. Jason will get into this more in his remarks as well. 
Each quarter in the past, I've tried to give you some insight about GDIT. Once again, let me share some thoughts. The fourth quarter was an extension of the momentum GDIT built throughout the year despite COVID headwinds. They remain focused on what they could control in an otherwise turbulent year, supporting customers and their employees while controlling costs, converting cash and winning new business. On the new business front, GDIT won several large deals and key technical focus areas, including cyber, cloud and artificial intelligence. These wins drove GDIT's total estimated contract value up $2 billion or 11% as compared to the third -- both the third quarter and year-end 2019. As you will see in our guidance, GDIT is poised for very nice growth in 2021. 
Let me now turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO, for additional commentary and then return with our guidance for next year. Jason?"

The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, ap",1543,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. 
As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, approximately 220% of net income. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $2.9 billion, a cash conversion rate of 91%, nicely ahead of our anticipated 80% to 85% of net income. To put this in context, our cash from operations for the year of $3.9 billion was less than $20 million shy of the highest annual operating cash flow we've ever had, notwithstanding the impact of COVID on our operations in 2020.  In fact, our free cash performance for the year was just short of achieving our original pre-COVID cash forecast, so really a remarkable outcome. This was the result of outstanding performance across the business to close out the year, most notably in the Aerospace group, which began to draw down its inventory that we've been discussing for some time. And the technologies group, which continues to generate superb cash flows, as Phebe mentioned,   in this case, in excess of 150% of imputed net income for the year. 
And as you'll recall, at this time last year, we negotiated a path forward on our large international contract in Combat Systems, including a revised progress payment schedule that liquidates their receivables balance over the next 3 years. As part of that agreement, we received 2 payments of $500 million each last year and we received the next progress payment earlier this month in accordance with the revised schedule. So that OWC will continue to unwind as we've discussed on past calls. 
Of course, Marine Systems continues with its significant facilities improvements in support of the unprecedented growth on the horizon. To that point, we had capital expenditures of $345 million in the fourth quarter for a full year total of nearly $1 billion or 2.5% of sales. You may recall, we had expected our CapEx to peak in 2020 at roughly 3% of sales due to these shipyard investments. As you might expect, given the impact of the pandemic, we've managed the timing of this CapEx spend prudently, and the result is 3 years, '19, '20 and '21, at roughly 2.5% of sales. This timing fully supports our Columbia and Block V build plant at Electric Boat. We then expect to trend back down and return to the more typical 2% range by 2023, consistent with our previous expectations. 
The net result is that we expect cash performance to continue to improve in 2021 to the 95% to 100% conversion range, with year-over-year growth in free cash flow in 2021 and beyond. We ended the year with a cash balance of just over $2.8 billion and a net debt position of approximately $10.2 billion, reflecting a $1.7 billion reduction in the fourth quarter. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $120 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $477 million. That compares to $110 million and $460 million in the comparable 2019 periods. 
Our next scheduled debt maturities are for $2.5 billion in the second quarter and $500 million in the third quarter of this year. Due to the timing of our cash flows, we may be in the commercial paper market for a transition period. But overall, we expect interest expense to drop to approximately $420 million in 2021. We also paid $315 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.2 billion. And we repurchased 700,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to just over 4 million shares for the year for $600 million or $148 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $480 million in 2020, and we expect that to decrease to approximately $360 million in 2021, the majority of that in the second half. 
Turning to income taxes. We had a 15.4% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full year rate of 15.3%, consistent with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect a full year effective tax rate of around 16%. 
Next, I'd like to alert you to 2 accounting changes that we've made in the fourth quarter, one related to segment reporting and the other related to pensions. The segment change is the one that Phebe alluded to earlier and relates to our GDIT and Mission Systems businesses. As the federal IT services and defense electronics markets have evolved in recent years, we've seen a significant increase in the customers' prioritization of these capabilities and a shift to large-scale end-to-end, highly engineered solutions that require critical mass and a broad array of technology services and hardware offerings to meet these customer demands. And more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated these trends with an expansion of remote connectivity and an added sense of urgency around required technology investments. As you've seen, we've responded to these trends over the past several years to further solidify our position as a market leader in this space, including the combination of our C4 and ISR businesses to form Mission Systems. And of course, the acquisition of CSRA to reposition GDIT as a leader in this market. With these integrations now complete, along with some considerable portfolio shaping and realignment, we are seeing the market dynamics continue to evolve. The 2 businesses share the same defense, intelligence and federal civilian customer base and increasingly go to market together to meet these customers' needs.  In addition, we're seeing considerable commonality and a significant complementary pull-through in their core offerings. So we will now be reporting them as one technology segment to better reflect the way we're running the business as we position them to best compete in this robust market. To be clear, we'll continue to provide transparency into the individual revenues and associated programmatic detail for each business, but of course, that becomes somewhat of a mixed bag as they increasingly engage in joint pursuits. 
With respect to pensions, we've adopted an accelerated method for amortizing actuarial losses for our government pension plans to better align the timing under GAAP with when the costs are allocated to contracts. Because these costs are recovered on our contracts, this change had no impact on our net income or cash flow. However, you'll note some differences between captions on the balance sheet and income statement as this accounting changes flow through the financial statements.  In particular, this reduces our corporate operating earnings, which we expect to be a negative $85 million in 2021 and increases our other income, which is below the line, which we expect to be approximately $90 million in 2021. The impact of these 2 income statement line items is equal and offsetting, so no impact to net income. 
And lastly, a little color on backlog. As of the end of the year, our funded backlog, total backlog and total estimated contract value are all up compared to a year ago. And as Phebe mentioned, at record highs. As an indication of the steady improvement since the peak of the disruption from the pandemic, Aerospace book-to-bill returned to 1x in the quarter, consistent with Phebe's remarks on what we're seeing in terms of Gulfstream demand. Marine Systems had an outstanding quarter with a book-to-bill of over 4x due to the exercise of the $9.5 billion option for the Columbia construction contract providing opportunity for further long-term top and bottom line growth for Marine Systems. 
And a little bit of color on order activity for the Technologies Group for the quarter. They had a very nice quarter with some notable awards, including the final resolution on the DOS program with a potential value of $4.4 billion. The EMIs contract in support of the U.S. Army in Europe, the State Department's GSS 2.0 contract with a potential value of $3.3 billion and a contract with the Air Force to develop a digital engineering environment. Importantly, given the conservative approach we take to reporting backlog, the preponderance of the value associated with these contracts doesn't show up in orders or backlog at the time of award.  In fact, only a portion of the awards shows up even in our IDIQ potential contract value. This is quite different from the way most of the peer group approaches this, so worth spending a moment on it. The way we book these awards is to conservatively estimate initial near-term value in the IDIQ category. Then as the program progresses and the customer exercises orders, that value moves into the backlog and ultimately gets reported as revenue. And over time, incremental amounts of IDIQ value are added to that bucket as our visibility into the program evolves. As a result, over half of the group's annual orders and revenue come out of this potential contract value category. So the headline numbers you see in the firm backlog, the live outstanding performance in the quarter as reflected in the total estimated contract value for the group of just over $41 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2021 and wrap-up remarks."

So let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollout.  In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $8 billion, essentially flat with 2020. Operating marg",668,"With that, I'll turn to our expectations for 2021. So let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollout.  In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $8 billion, essentially flat with 2020. Operating margins will be about 12.5%, leading to operating earnings of $1 billion, maybe slightly more. So what is driving this forecast, and in particular, the lower margins in 2021 when revenue is similar to 2020? You will recall that I told you last quarter, we will deliver 13 fewer G550 as that airplane is no longer in production. This leaves us with 13 fewer aircraft, not including the 3 slips from 2020. So all up, 10 fewer aircraft. This reduction in revenue will be made up by a roughly $500 million increase in services across Jet Aviation and Gulfstream at about 10% lower operating margin. There are a lot of other puts and takes, but this gives you the big picture for the lower anticipated margins. By the way, our forecasted production delivery considers our backlog, our fourth quarter orders and our take on current demand. I fully expect 2022 will have better revenue and earnings, stimulated by the entry into service the G700 in the fourth quarter and improving demand across the product lines as the economy recovers.   
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue of about $7.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million over 2020. We expect the operating margin to be about 14.5% and operating earnings to exceed last year by $20 million or 2%. We look for revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. After several years of good revenue growth, 2021 and 2022 will have modest growth. Growth should resume in 2023 and beyond as several developmental programs move into production. 
The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.3 billion, an increase of over $300 million. Operating margin in 2021 is anticipated to be around 8.3%, driven in large part by increased work on the first 2 cost-plus Columbia submarines, which have conservative initial booking rates. We anticipate growth at each of the yards. The long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work, which will expand significantly. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted revenue line. 
We expect revenue in the Technologies group of $13.2 billion, $580 million more than 2020. This is a growth of 4.5% with GDIT growing at a rate of 7.1%. Mission Systems will be essentially flat with organic growth of 3%, offset by the SATCOM divestiture. We expect earnings of $1.25 billion, about $50 million more than 2020. This implies an overall margin of 9.5% with GDIT returning to 7% or more. 
So for 2021, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $39 billion of revenue, up over $1 billion from 2020 and operating margin at 10.5%. This all rolls up to a forecast range of $11 to $11.05 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years with Q1 about $2.20 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 16% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperformed many operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. 
I should leave you with this one final thought. Our strong cash flow in anticipation of a 95% to 100% conversion rate in 2021, leaves us with the ability to engage in a share repurchase program this year to enhance the EPS figures I have just given you. We will see how that plays out. I'll be more specific about this after the end of the first quarter. Back to you, Howard."

A lot of that was Gulfstream doing a great job getting some of that inventory to start to turn, and so working some of that operating working capital. As Phebe alluded to, GDIT also had an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter. I think we expect to see those trends really continue. I mean, basically, the core fundamental underlying performance of each of the businesses, but then buoy by the further improvement in OWC. The one we talked about or I alluded to briefly on the call is the continued unwinding of the unbilled receivables balance in Combat Systems. I mentioned we did receive the third major progress payment here earlier this month of January. That's encouraging to see that that program continues at pace. And so between that program unwinding, the working down of the working capital over the next couple of years at Gulfstream and of course, the winding down of the CapEx at Marine Systems, we expect to see that year-on-year growth in free cash flow, obviously, to support further capital deployment, at which I'll turn back over to Phebe to address."

And all of our key franchise programs are in the process of modernization, upgrading, and we anticipate that to go forward. If you think about army modernization,  it comes in 2 flavors. One is upgrading a critical or fighting vehicles and equipment to meet the modern battlefield. And if you think about that, the Stryker of today and the Abrams of today are in all respects different than their predecessors. They look the same, but in all other respects, these are increasingly lethal, increasingly capable, agile platforms. And that gives them relevance to the war fight today and the war fight envisioned in the joint forces combat scenarios of the U.S. military. So those modernization upgrades will continue. And then the second category of army modernization is in their new start programs. And they've got a number of them as we look out into the horizon. Again, given our capability set, given our proven long-term delivery, I mean we deliver things on time at cost. That puts us in very good stead, along with the technologies investments we've been making over the last 4, 5, 6 years. We are producing some really powerful platforms that will be critical to the future fight. So I feel good about that on top of in the U.S., our ordinance and armaments business continues to grow. They are critical subcomponents on almost every major weapons missile system in the U.S. So these are very, very strong, high leverage, deep backlog, deep customer intimacy programs in the United States. When you look outside the United States, we are continuing to see growth. We've got the AJAX program that has just begun its testing. So we've got quite a bit of ways to go there. And when you think about our European land system, just to give you a little perspective, there are over 7,000 in-service lab-type vehicles that come out of -- has come out of our European business. That installed base is enormous. And it's an enormous competitive advantage. Some of those systems are older and they need to be upgraded. And we continue to see demand out of multiple parts of Europe. So we expect ELS to grow. And the world hasn't gotten any safer. And that -- the reality of the threat environment drives the demand. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color here."

So we have a -- Howard can give you a pretty definitive list, but Jason could give you a few of just the indicative kinds of programs we're looking at."

And we've seen the Army in working with us, finding innovative and increasingly more fight critical variance of Stryker. So we have the SHORAD and like -- so we have the SHORAD system coming. We are looking at electronic warfare, medical. And there's a whole series of other increasingly, some of them sensitive, Stryker missions. The other thing too is the Strykers have -- their brigades have increased their numbers by about maybe 4%, 5%. So each brigade is going to get over time more Strykers in these various configurations. So that's important to that program. We also see the Abrams continuing its modernization. And then we believe we have additional out-year international opportunities, largely through FMS. So we see some growth in Canada, Morocco, Poland, Czech Republic. So all of that contributes -- that's all within the U.S. All of that contributes to our our assumptions about growth in this portfolio. Outside the United States, I tried to give you some context about the large embedded fleet and the need to upgrade that fleet. And that, along with the Spanish program, we may see some additional vehicles under that Spanish program. It's soon to call that. So we are really assuming that. But those are the elements that we are -- and by the way, there are new programs, developmental programs that are out for competition, and we like where we stand in those. I will just say one thing about MPS. We developed all 12 prototypes for the testing and evaluation. And I believe we are the only ones to do so even within the COVID environment. That's a discipline will do for you, disciplined product excellence and manufacturing operating excellence. So that is the pipeline that we see in our future."

Almost every",471,"Well, let me tell you, I never speak to anybody else's portfolio, but a couple of observations. It's been my experience that the best antidote for budget reductions are well-performing, well-supported programs of record. We have all of those. Almost every single one of our programs are on schedule at or below cost. That is when the budget tiers get their night out, those are almost always the last fall. So that's, I think, a longer perspective to to look at. But look, if you look at the U.S. Navy, submarines are its top priority and the Columbia in particular, And why is that? It's because submarines remain a singular competitive advantage, a critical competitive advantage for the United States with near-peer competitors and peer competitors. So I am quite confident that given my belief that the defense budget is driven by the threat that are key elements of the -- of our Marine group, growth will be nicely supported. We believe that the Navy will continue to need destroyers The DDG-51 is proving to be a very versatile program platform that can take additional missions. And then with our auxiliary yard out at ASCO, with the exception of the nuclear powered carriers, and nuclear submarines, all these navy's fleets needs gas and the gas needs to get there safely, fastly and pumped efficiently, and that's our new oiled program. So with respect to the Army, I gave you a little bit of -- I gave a little bit of color before, but the Army has been quite clear, even in a constrained budget. They will maintain their modernization priorities. They have been both privately and publicly quite articulate about that. And then in terms of the shorter cycle businesses,  in the old days, when you were dialing for dollars as a budget tier, you go to the O&M accounts and start cutting the IT budgets, that's not possible anymore. These IT systems are critical to the mission of these agencies, whether that's within DoD or outside DoD. So that as a source of funds is increasingly less likely. And I think, frankly, insulated, given the criticality of IT and then within -- to the war fight and DoD into other missions. And then within our Mission Systems, there's a beauty to having a diverse portfolio of long franchise programs. And I will tell you that we're quite secure in many of those franchise programs because they are, in some cases, unique and in some cases, tied to high-growth nationally critical areas to think against submarines. So I think it's a height of hubris to assume that any organization is immune from constraints in budget. But performance matters criticality to the war fit matters. And when I look across our portfolio, I'm pretty comfortable that we are in very good stead."

Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.49. This is, in most respects, a very solid quarter even though we missed consensus by $0.",1983,"Good morning. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.49. This is, in most respects, a very solid quarter even though we missed consensus by $0.05. I have more to say about that shortly. 
Despite the adverse impact of the pandemic, we achieved most of our operational and financial goals, added dramatically to our backlog and had a very good cash quarter. The results and comparisons with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. Because of the adverse impact to the economy caused by COVID-19, I'll devote less time to the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and spend more time on the sequential improvement that tells a compelling story of recovery. I'll go through that in some detail as I give you my thoughts on the business segments.  
As we indicated that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest. It is quite remarkable that we came within $0.02 of the very strong pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue is up 11.1%, operating earnings are up 20.6%, net earnings are up 20.1% and earnings per share are up 20.3%. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance even compared to the year-ago quarter, but really good sequentially.
For the full year, we had revenue of $37.9 billion, down from 3.6% from the prior year, net earnings of $3.17 billion and earnings per fully diluted shares of $11, once again, modestly below consensus.  
Our business was strengthened by significant growth in the backlog to a year-end record high of $89.5 billion. The same is true of total estimated contract value at $134.7 billion. The total company book-to-bill was 1.1:1 for the year, led by the particularly strong order performance of Electric Boat. The strong order intake across the board positions the company well for 2021 and beyond. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year was stronger than expected with a conversion rate of 91% of net income for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject in his remarks.  
Let me review the quarter, paying particular attention to sequential comparisons and the full year in the context of each group and provide some color as appropriate.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.4 billion is up 23.3% over the third quarter on the strength of the delivery of 40 aircraft, 34 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectations by 3 aircraft, 2 of which delivered after the 1st of the year for reasons related to customer preference. The third aircraft had a willing customer but was not ready for delivery by year-end. That one is on us. 
For the full year, revenue of $8.08 billion is off 17.6% from the prior year. Nevertheless, operating earnings are still over $1 billion, far away the industry leader. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $401 million is 41.7% better than the third quarter on the strength of higher revenue and a 220 basis point improvement in operating margin. However, the shortfall against consensus for the quarter and the year is found in the 3 anticipated deliveries that slipped into this year. This should not, in any respect, diminish the outstanding performance of Gulfstream in this environment. Furthermore, margins increased on a sequential basis throughout the year, ending at 16.5% in the fourth quarter.  
At midyear last year, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.4 billion with earnings of $1.13 billion. We finished the year with revenue of $8.1 billion and earnings of $1.08 billion. The entire shortfall is attributable to 127 deliveries versus our expectation of 130. All in all, still within the 125 to 130 deliveries we gave you right after the initial shock to the economy caused by the pandemic became manifest.  
On the order front, activity in the quarter was very good, and the pipeline remains quite active. The book-to-bill at Aerospace in the fourth quarter was 0.96:1 dollar-denominated. For the year, the book-to-bill was 0.88:1. This order activity was, in my view, quite good in the midst of a pandemic-induced depression. We are of the well-considered view that order activity will improve further as travel restrictions are lifted and the economy begins its recovery.  
Let me give you some thoughts on our product portfolio. First, the G500 and G600 unit manufacturing costs continued to decline, and we are producing superb quality. We had 92 units of this family of aircraft in service at year-end. Anecdotally, the G500 led the order book in the fourth quarter.  
Next, some in the analyst community have expressed concern about the continuing demand for the G650, which first entered into service 8 years ago. At the end of this year, we had 436 G650 in service, an average of 54 a year. The 650 continues to be in demand, but not at that level. I can add anecdotally that in the fourth quarter, it was a close second to the G500 demand. It remains a strong competitor to anything in the air and will remain a strong contributor to our revenue and earnings for the next several years.  
Finally, on the new product development front, all 5 G700 flight test aircraft are flying and have over 1,000 hours of test flight. We appear to be on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter 2022. That will stimulate both revenue and earnings next year. If you've been following our Aerospace R&D spend, you know that there's more to come on this subject.
Next, Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $1.96 billion is essentially the same as the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $309 million are $25 million or 8.8% ahead of the final quarter of 2019 on the strength of 140 basis point improvement in operating margin to 15.8%.
For the full year, revenue of $7.2 billion is up $216 million, a 3.1% increase after a 12.3% growth in 2019 despite a revenue decline at ELS, driven by COVID shutdowns in Spain earlier in 2020. Operating earnings of $1.04 billion are up $45 million, a 4.5% increase. By the way, this performance is consistent with the initial guidance we provided earlier in the year.    
In the U.S., our Army customer is continuing its modernization, which provides steady demand for our combat vehicles and munitions businesses. The fourth quarter had some nice order activity, including a contract for Abrams version 3 with a ceiling of $4.3 billion and additional Stryker SHORAD orders with the ceiling of up to $1.2 billion.
Outside the U.S., we are beginning to see increased demand as our NATO allies start to emerge from COVID-constrained activity, including over $200 million of Canadian ammunition orders in the quarter. In short, this group has had quite positive revenue growth for several years now, continued its history of strong margin performance, had very good order activity and has a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward.  
Next, Marine Systems. This is once again a good news story. Marine fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion is up $292 million, a compelling 11.4% increase over the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $247 million are up $48 million against a good fourth quarter in 2019. Importantly, there is an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins. The results are much the same sequentially. Revenue was up $452 million, and earnings are up $24 million or 10.8%.
For the full year, revenue was almost $10 billion, up $796 million or 8.7%. Operating earnings for the year of $854 million are up by $69 million or 8.8%. This is the highest quarterly and full year earnings ever for the Marine group.  In our midyear guidance to you, we anticipated revenue of about $9.6 billion and operating earnings of $845 million. We came in above that for both revenue and earnings.
In response to significant increased demand from our Navy customer that you can see in these results, we continue to invest in each of our yards, particularly at Electric Boat to prepare for Block V and the new Columbia ballistic missile submarine. So suffice it to say that we're poised to support our Navy customer as they increase the size of their fleet and deliver value to our shareholders as we work through this very large backlog and improve our return on invested capital.
Finally, the Technologies group, which consists of GDIT and Mission Systems, is reported together for the first time in a while. You may recall, we used to report this group as then constituted as Information Systems and Technology. This new reporting reflects the way we manage these businesses with group Executive Vice President, Chris Marzilli, reporting to me.
We have also discovered that in this era of end-to-end solutions melding technology, hardware and software, these business units increasingly go to market together, seeking to provide end-to-end systems and support solutions. We will, however, continue to provide operating transparency by providing company-specific data where appropriate. Jason will have more to say about this in his remarks. This is, of course, the group in the defense segment that has had the most impact from COVID-19 with the most remote participation from employees and the most difficult to access in customer locations.
With all that said, let's turn to the results and commentary on the group and specific businesses. For the quarter, Technologies had revenue of $3.23 billion, off less than 1% sequentially. Operating earnings of $352 million are up $38 million or 12.1% on a 120 basis point improvement in margins.
As you would expect, given the environment, revenue for the first full year is off $711 million or 5.3%, and earnings are off $100 million or 7.6%. It is well to remember that these revenue and earnings numbers exclude the SATCOM business that we sold in the first half of last year. All considered, the group performance showed good strength, and earnings guidance from us was close.
Revenue came in at $350 million, below our guidance, $12.65 billion versus $13 billion, but margins, particularly at GDIT, were better, leading our earnings forecast to be on target. From a margin perspective, GDIT was at 7.9%, up 40 basis points sequentially. Mission Systems, at 16.2%, was up 290 basis points over the last quarter. For the full year, the group's free cash flow exceeded 150% of full year imputed net earnings, the strongest performance within General Dynamics.
GDIT's performance was even stronger. It was the best quarter cash performance in its history. The group enjoyed a tremendous order quarter with significant wins by GDIT in 4 major programs, all of which are IDIQ contracts. As a result, under our conservative accounting policy, these awards are found in total estimated contract value rather than in unfunded backlog. Jason will get into this more in his remarks as well.
Each quarter in the past, I've tried to give you some insight about GDIT. Once again, let me share some thoughts. The fourth quarter was an extension of the momentum GDIT built throughout the year despite COVID headwinds. They remained focused on what they could control in an otherwise turbulent year, supporting customers and their employees while controlling costs, converting cash and winning new business.
On the new business front, GDIT won several large deals in key technical focus areas, including cyber, cloud and artificial intelligence. These wins drove GDIT's total estimated contract value up $2 billion or 11% as compared to the third -- both the third quarter and year-end 2019. As you will see in our guidance, GDIT is poised for very nice growth in 2021.
Let me now turn the call over to Jason Aiken, our CFO, for additional commentary and then return with our guidance for next year. Jason?"
274561,700964469,2182297,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, appr",1544,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, approximately 220% of net income. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $2.9 billion, a cash conversion rate of 91%, nicely ahead of our anticipated 80% to 85% of net income.
To put this in context, our cash from operations for the year of $3.9 billion was less than $20 million shy of the highest annual operating cash flow we've ever had, notwithstanding the impact of COVID on our operations in 2020. In fact, our free cash performance for the year was just short of achieving our original pre-COVID cash forecast, so really a remarkable outcome. This was the result of outstanding performance across the business to close out the year, most notably in the Aerospace group, which began to draw down its inventory that we've been discussing for some time; and the Technologies group, which continues to generate superb cash flows, as Phebe mentioned, in this case, in excess of 150% of imputed net income for the year. 
And as you'll recall, at this time last year, we negotiated a path forward on our large international contract in Combat Systems, including a revised progress payment schedule that liquidates their receivables balance over the next 3 years. As part of that agreement, we received 2 payments of $500 million each last year, and we received the next progress payment earlier this month in accordance with the revised schedule. So that OWC will continue to unwind, as we've discussed on past calls.  
Of course, Marine Systems continues with its significant facilities improvements in support of the unprecedented growth on the horizon. To that point, we had capital expenditures of $345 million in the fourth quarter for a full year total of nearly $1 billion or 2.5% of sales.
You may recall, we had expected our CapEx to peak in 2020 at roughly 3% of sales due to these shipyard investments. As you might expect, given the impact of the pandemic, we've managed the timing of this CapEx spend prudently, and the result is 3 years, '19, '20 and '21, at roughly 2.5% of sales. This timing fully supports our Columbia and Block V build plan at Electric Boat. We then expect to trend back down and return to the more typical 2% range by 2023, consistent with our previous expectations. The net result is that we expect cash performance to continue to improve in 2021 to the 95% to 100% conversion range with year-over-year growth in free cash flow in 2021 and beyond.
We ended the year with a cash balance of just over $2.8 billion and a net debt position of approximately $10.2 billion, reflecting a $1.7 billion reduction in the fourth quarter. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $120 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $477 million. That compares to $110 million and $460 million in the comparable 2019 periods.  
Our next scheduled debt maturities are for $2.5 billion in the second quarter and $500 million in the third quarter of this year. Due to the timing of our cash flows, we may be in the commercial paper market for a transition period. But overall, we expect interest expense to drop to approximately $420 million in 2021.
We also paid $315 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.2 billion. And we repurchased 700,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to just over 4 million shares for the year for $600 million or $148 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $480 million in 2020, and we expect that to decrease to approximately $360 million in 2021, the majority of that in the second half.  
Turning to income taxes. We had a 15.4% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, resulting in a full year rate of 15.3%, consistent with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect a full year effective tax rate of around 16%.  
Next, I'd like to alert you to 2 accounting changes that we've made in the fourth quarter, one related to segment reporting and the other related to pensions. The segment change is the one that Phebe alluded to earlier and relates to our GDIT and Mission Systems businesses. As the federal IT services and defense electronics markets have evolved in recent years, we've seen a significant increase in the customers' prioritization of these capabilities and a shift to large-scale, end-to-end, highly engineered solutions that require critical mass and a broad array of technology services and hardware offerings to meet these customer demands. And more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated these trends with an expansion of remote connectivity and an added sense of urgency around required technology investments.
As you've seen, we've responded to these trends over the past several years to further solidify our position as a market leader in this space, including the combination of our C4 and ISR businesses to form Mission Systems and, of course, the acquisition of CSRA to reposition GDIT as a leader in this market. With these integrations now complete, along with some considerable portfolio shaping and realignment, we are seeing the market dynamics continue to evolve. The 2 businesses share the same defense, intelligence and federal civilian customer base and increasingly go to market together to meet these customers' needs.
In addition, we're seeing considerable commonality and a significant complementary pull-through in their core offerings. So we will now be reporting them as one technology segment to better reflect the way we're running the business as we position them to best compete in this robust market. To be clear, we'll continue to provide transparency into the individual revenues and associated programmatic detail for each business, but of course, that becomes somewhat of a mixed bag as they increasingly engage in joint pursuits.  
With respect to pensions, we've adopted an accelerated method for amortizing actuarial losses for our government pension plans to better align the timing under GAAP with when the costs are allocated to contracts. Because these costs are recovered on our contracts, this change had no impact on our net income or cash flow. However, you'll note some differences between captions on the balance sheet and income statement as this accounting change has flowed through the financial statement.
In particular, this reduces our corporate operating earnings, which we expect to be a negative $85 million in 2021 and increases our other income, which is below the line, which we expect to be approximately $90 million in 2021. The impact of these 2 income statement line items is equal and offsetting, so no impact to net income.  
And lastly, a little color on backlog. As of the end of the year, our funded backlog, total backlog and total estimated contract value are all up compared to a year ago and, as Phebe mentioned, at record highs. As an indication of the steady improvement since the peak of the disruption from the pandemic, Aerospace book-to-bill returned to 1x in the quarter, consistent with Phebe's remarks on what we're seeing in terms of Gulfstream demand. Marine Systems had an outstanding quarter with a book-to-bill of over 4x due to the exercise of the $9.5 billion option for the Columbia construction contract, providing opportunity for further long-term top and bottom line growth for Marine Systems.  
And a little bit of color on order activity for the Technologies group for the quarter. They had a very nice quarter with some notable awards, including the final resolution on the DEOS program with a potential value of $4.4 billion; the EMITS contract in support of the U.S. Army in Europe; the State Department's GSS 2.0 contract with a potential value of $3.3 billion; and a contract with the Air Force to develop a digital engineering environment. Importantly, given the conservative approach we take to reporting backlog, the preponderance of the value associated with these contracts doesn't show up in orders or backlog at the time of award. In fact, only a portion of the awards shows up even in our IDIQ potential contract value. This is quite different from the way most of the peer group approaches this, so worth spending a moment on it.
The way we book these awards is to conservatively estimate initial near-term value in the IDIQ category. Then as the program progresses and the customer exercises orders, that value moves into the backlog and ultimately gets reported as revenue. And over time, incremental amounts of IDIQ value are added to that bucket as our visibility into the program evolves. As a result, over half of the group's annual orders and revenue come out of this potential contract value category. So the headline numbers you see in the firm backlog belie the outstanding performance in the quarter, as reflected in the total estimated contract value for the group of just over $41 billion.
That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2021 and wrap-up remarks."

So let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a company-wide roll-up.In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $8 billion, essentially flat with 2020. Operating marg",672,"With that, I'll turn to our expectations for 2021. So let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a company-wide roll-up.
In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $8 billion, essentially flat with 2020. Operating margins will be about 12.5%, leading to operating earnings of $1 billion, maybe slightly more. So what is driving this forecast and, in particular, the lower margins in 2021 when revenue is similar to 2020? You will recall that I told you last quarter, we will deliver 13 fewer G550s as that airplane is no longer in production. This leaves us with 13 fewer aircraft, not including the 3 slips from 2020. So all up, 10 fewer aircraft.
This reduction in revenue will be made up by a roughly $500 million increase in services across Jet Aviation and Gulfstream at about 10% lower operating margin. There are a lot of other puts and takes, but this gives you the big picture for the lower anticipated margins. By the way, our forecasted production delivery considers our backlog, our fourth quarter orders and our take on current demand. I fully expect 2022 will have better revenue and earnings, stimulated by the entry into service of the G700 in the fourth quarter and improving demand across the product lines as the economy recovers.    
In Combat Systems, we expect revenue of about $7.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million over 2020. We expect the operating margin to be about 14.5% and operating earnings to exceed last year by $20 million or 2%. We look for revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. After several years of good revenue growth, 2021 and 2022 will have modest growth. Growth should resume in 2023 and beyond as several developmental programs move into production.  
The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.3 billion, an increase of over $300 million. Operating margin in 2021 is anticipated to be around 8.3%, driven in large part by increased work on the first 2 cost-plus Columbia submarines, which have conservative initial booking rates. We anticipate growth at each of the yards. The long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work, which will expand significantly. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted revenue line.  
We expect revenue in the Technologies group of $13.2 billion, $580 million more than 2020. This is a growth of 4.5% with GDIT growing at a rate of 7.1%. Mission Systems will be essentially flat with organic growth of 3%, offset by the SATCOM divestiture. We expect earnings of $1.25 billion, about $50 million more than 2020. This implies an overall margin of 9.5% with GDIT returning to 7% or more.  
So for 2021, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $39 billion of revenue, up over $1 billion from 2020, and operating margin at 10.5%. This all rolls up to a forecast range of $11 to $11.05 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years with Q1 about $2.20 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter.
Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 16% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital.  
I should leave you with this one final thought. Our strong cash flow in 2020 and our anticipation of a 95% to 100% conversion rate in 2021 leaves us with the ability to engage in a share repurchase program this year to enhance the EPS figures I have just given you. We will see how that plays out. I'll be more specific about this after the end of the first quarter.
Back to you, Howard."

So Jon, I think at a macro level, the best way to think about this is we have every expectation that we will see year-over-year increases in our free cash flow. As you saw, we had a nice outperformance of our expectation in the fourth quarter to wrap up a pretty strong 2020. That set us off on this course a little quicker than we expected. A lot of that was Gulfstream doing a great job getting some of that inventory to start to turn, and so working some of that operating working capital. As Phebe alluded to, GDIT also had an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter.
I think we expect to see those trends really continue, I mean, basically, the core fundamental underlying performance of each of the businesses, but then buoyed by the further improvement in OWC. The one we talked about or I alluded to briefly on the call is the continued unwinding of the unbilled receivables balance in Combat Systems. I mentioned we did receive the third major progress payment here earlier this month of January. That's encouraging to see that, that program continues at pace.
And so between that program unwinding, the working down of the working capital over the next couple of years at Gulfstream and, of course, the winding down of the CapEx at Marine Systems, we expect to see that year-on-year growth in free cash flow, obviously, to support further capital deployment, which I'll turn back over to Phebe to address."

And all of our key franchise programs are in the process of modernization, upgrading, and we anticipate that to go forward. If you think about army modernization, it comes in 2 flavors. One is upgrading a critical or fighting vehicles and equipment to meet the modern battlefield. And if you think about that, the Stryker of today and the Abrams of today are in all respects different than their predecessors. They look the same, but in all other respects, these are increasingly lethal, increasingly capable, agile platforms. And that gives them relevance to the war fight today and the war fight envisioned in the joint forces combat scenarios of the U.S. military. So those modernization upgrades will continue.
And then the second category of army modernization is in their new start programs. And they've got a number of them as we look out into the horizon. Again, given our capability set, given our proven long-term delivery, I mean we deliver things on time, at cost, that puts us in very good stead, along with the technologies investments we've been making over the last 4, 5, 6 years. We are producing some really powerful platforms that will be critical to the future fight.
So I feel good about that on top of, in the U.S., our ordinance and armaments business continues to grow. They are critical subcomponents on almost every major weapons missile system in the U.S. So these are very, very strong, high leverage, deep backlog, deep customer intimacy programs in the United States.
When you look outside the United States, we are continuing to see growth. We've got the AJAX program that has just begun its testing, so we've got quite a bit of ways to go there. And when you think about our European land system, just to give you a little perspective, there are over 7,000 in-service, LAV-type vehicles that come out of -- has come out of our European business. That installed base is enormous, and it's an enormous competitive advantage. Some of those systems are older and they need to be upgraded. And we continue to see demand out of multiple parts of Europe. So we expect ELS to grow. And the world hasn't gotten any safer and that the reality of the threat environment drives the demand. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color here."

This business, in particular, I think, is the most relevant to pay attention to that total potential contract value versus the strictly the traditional firm-funded backlog. And the reason is, I think I mentioned this earlier, this business year in and year out, 50% or more, and in fact, I think in 2020, it was 60% of their annual orders and revenue value, comes out of that bucket of value that we articulate as IDIQ/options potential contract value. 
So that's very different than the pure-play platform businesses that have the traditional contracting firm backlog and so on. And so I don't think it can be overlooked.

So we have the SHORAD and like -- so we have the SHORAD system coming. We are looking at electronic warfare, medical, and there's a whole series of other increasingly, some of them sensitive, Stryker missions.
The other thing, too, is the Strykers have -- their brigades have increased their numbers by about maybe 4% or 5%. So each brigade is going to get over time more Strykers in these various configurations. So that's important to that program. We also see the Abrams continuing its modernization. And then we believe we have additional out-year international opportunities, largely through FMS. So we see some growth in Canada, Morocco, Poland, Czech Republic. So all of that contributes -- that's all within the U.S. All of that contributes to our assumptions about growth in this portfolio.
Outside the United States, I tried to give you some context about the large embedded fleet and the need to upgrade that fleet. And that, along with the Spanish program, we may see some additional vehicles under that Spanish program. It's too soon to call that. So we are really assuming that. But those are the elements that we are -- and by the way, there are new programs, developmental programs that are out for competition, and we like where we stand in those. I'm able to say one thing about MPF. We developed all 12 prototypes for the testing and evaluation, and I believe we were the only ones to do so even within the COVID environment. That's what discipline will do for you, discipline, product excellence and manufacturing operating excellence. So that is the pipeline that we see in our future."

It's been my experience that the best antidote for budget reductions are well-performing, well-supported programs of record. We have all of those. Almost every single one of our programs are on schedule at or below cost. That is when the budgeteers get their knives out. Those are almost always the last to fall. So that's, I think, a long-term perspective to look at.
But look, if you look at the U.S. Navy, submarines are its top priority and the Columbia, in particular. And why is that? It's because submarines remain a singular competitive advantage, a critical competitive advantage for the United States with near-peer competitors and peer competitors. So I am quite confident that given my belief that the defense budget is driven by the threat that are key elements of the -- of our Marine group, growth will be nicely supported.
We believe that the Navy will continue to need destroyers. The DDG-51 is proving to be a very versatile program, a platform that can take additional missions. And then with our auxiliary yard out at NASSCO, with the exception of the nuclear-powered carriers and nuclear submarines, all these Navy fleets need gas and the gas needs to get there safely, fastly and pumped efficiently, and that's our new oiler program.
So with respect to the Army, I gave you a little bit -- I gave, call it, a little bit of color before, but the Army has been quite clear. Even in a constrained budget, they will maintain their modernization priorities. They have been both privately and publicly quite articulate about that.
And then in terms of the shorter-cycle businesses, in the old days, when you were dialing for dollars as a budgeteer, you go to the O&M accounts and start cutting the IT budgets, that's not possible anymore. These IT systems are critical to the mission of these agencies, whether that's within DoD or outside DoD. So that as a source of funds is increasingly less likely and I think, frankly, insulated given the criticality of IT. And then within -- to the war fight and DoD and to other missions.
And then within our Mission Systems, there's a beauty to having a diverse portfolio of long franchise programs. And I will tell you that we're quite secure in many of those franchise programs because they are, in some cases, unique and, in some cases, tied to high-growth nationally critical areas, just think again submarines. So I think it's the height of hubris to assume that any organization is immune from constraints in budget. But performance matters, criticality to the war fight matters. And when I look across our portfolio, I'm pretty comfortable that we are in very good stead."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.48 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net income of $708 million.
Revenue is up $640 million or 7.3% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $4 million and net earnings are up $2 million. To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million, and Aerospace is up $196 million. The operating earnings on the defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus. I will have more to say about this a bit later.
The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by a 250 basis point lower margin rate at Aerospace as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense.
From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.18 per share. We have roughly $500 million warrant revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $50 million more in operating earnings, so it's a peer operations fee. I must confess that we also beat our own expectations rather handsomely.
This is in almost all respects, a very solid quarter. It's hard to find something not to like about it. It's a very good start to the year. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash, and then we'll answer your questions.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $220 million, with an 11.7% operating margin. Revenue is almost $200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side. Revenue is also $196 million higher than the year ago quarter. The difference is almost exclusively morphed G500 and G600 deliveries in the year ago quarter. The 11.7% operating margin is lower than the year ago quarter, but consistent with our guidance and sell-side expectations. Finally, we took some mark-to-market charges with respect to our G500 test inventory. Without the charge from a pure operating perspective, performance in the quarter was superb.
Aerospace also had a very strong quarter from an orders perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.34:1. In unit terms, this is the strongest order quarter for the last 2 years, excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 when we launched the G700.
The sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the quarter. The momentum developed in the quarter appears to be rolling over into the second quarter as well. We are experiencing a high level of interest and activity. It is constructive to see this accelerated activity level without the benefit of the removal of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements in many countries outside the U.S. Demand should improve even further when these restrictions are ultimately removed.
Gulfstream experienced a 5.7% increase in service revenue. On the other hand, Jet Aviation's FBOs and certain of its maintenance facilities are recovering more slowly. Jet Aviation service revenue is down around $31 million, coupled with a modest increase in service operating earnings. The FBO and MRO sites will do much better as business travel accelerate. The G500 and G600 continued to perform well.
Margins are improving on a consistent basis and quality is superb. As of the end of last week, we have delivered 104 of these aircraft to customers. The G700 has over 1,400 test hours on the 5 test aircraft and the first fully outfitted G700 is flying. Its interior is absolutely beautiful. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Looking forward, We expect the second quarter to be our most challenging from a delivery perspective. However, we also expect rapid improvement in the third and fourth quarters as we had planned for an increase in production and more delivery.
Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.8 billion, up 6.6% over the year ago quarter. While all 3 companies within the group contributed to the growth, the primary source was increased sales of our 8x8 wheeled combat vehicles to Switzerland and Spain and sales of our 6x6 Eagle vehicles. So all in all, good growth. It is also interesting to observe the Combat Systems revenue has grown in 16 of the last 18 quarters on a quarter over the year-ago quarter basis. Operating earnings at $244 million are up 9.4% on higher volume and a 30 basis point improvement in margin. This was an impressive performance by any reasonable measure.
You may recall that a notable development for this segment in the year ago quarter was the formal signing of the restructured contract on the Canadian international program, which settled all issues. The parties continue to perform on that contract have contemplated. This was helpful to free cash flow last year and continues to be so this year. This risk item appears to be behind us.
Turning to Marine Systems. You may recall that at this time a year ago, I was able to report that revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter in 2019. I am very pleased to report today that first quarter 2021 revenue of $2.48 billion is up 10.6% against first quarter 2020. The growth was led by Block V Virginia class and Columbia class construction volume. We also enjoyed nice increases in ESB and TAO construction volume at NASSCO. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 14 quarters on a quarter versus year-ago quarter basis.
Operating earnings are $200 million in the quarter, up $16 million or 8.7% on an operating margin of 8.1%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. On the order side, I should observe that total backlog was down only $231 million sequentially, leaving a powerful $49.8 billion in total backlog. There was obviously significant order activity in the quarter, including the award of the tenth Block V Virginia Class submarine.
Finally, technologies. This segment had revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, up $95 million from the year ago quarter or 3.1%. The revenue increase was supplied by information technology mostly associated with the ramp-up of new programs. IT alone grew 5% in the quarter. Operating earnings at $306 million or up $8 million or 2.7% on a 9.6% operating margin. This is about 40 basis points ahead of consensus.
EBITDA margin is an impressive 13.3%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. This is a best-in-class EBITDA margin.
Total backlog grew $359 million sequentially, and total estimated contract value remained about the same. There were also some notable items in GDIT's first quarter worth mentioning. On the bid and proposal front, GDIT submitted the highest dollar value of proposals in any quarter since the acquisition of CSRA, 90% of which represent new business opportunities. They ended the quarter with over $30 billion in proposals awaiting customer decision, most of which also represent new business opportunities versus recompetition of existing work.
So good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1:1, and good order prospects on the horizon.
That concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. We will, however, give you a comprehensive update at the end of the second quarter as is our custom.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,710892437,2260430,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million. For",656,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million. For those of you who followed us for some time, You know we've been a fairly significant user of cash in the first quarter for the past several years.
This quarter was a marked improvement from that pattern due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international Combat Systems program, consistent with the contract amendment Phebe referenced earlier. So the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations, and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range.
Looking at capital deployment. I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $134 million in the quarter, or 1.4% of sales. That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full year CapEx to be roughly 2.5% of sales. We also paid $315 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share. And we spent nearly $750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $161 per share. After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from this time last year.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $123 million, up from $107 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in 2021 is due to the incremental debt issued last year in conjunction with the refinancing of maturing notes. We have $3 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we plan to refinance a portion of those notes to achieve a more balanced deployment of capital, but this will still result in a declining debt balance this year and beyond.
During the quarter, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act. As you may be aware, it contains 2 provisions that affect our business. First, it extends the provision of the CARES Act that allows reimbursement of contractor payments to workers who are prevented from working due to COVID-related facility closures. This will continue to benefit our technologies business. Although it does not provide for fee on those costs, so that will have an ongoing dilutive impact on the segment's margins.
Second, the act provides pension funding relief by reducing the amount of required contribution to our pension plans this year by a couple of hundred million dollars. However, this same provision reduces the amount of pension costs we are reimbursed on our U.S. government contracts. As a result, when coupled with the lower tax benefit from the reduced pension contributions, the impact on our 2021 cash flow is immaterial.
We expect the cash benefit from the act to increase modestly over the next couple of years, reinforcing our expectation that free cash flow can exceed 100% of net income over that period. The tax rate in the quarter at 16.2% is consistent with our full year expectation, so no change to our outlook on that front.
Finally, order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole, even as we grew by more than 7% in the quarter. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace & Technologies groups led the way with a 1.3x and 1.1x book-to-bill, respectively. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $89.6 billion. That's up 4.5% over this time last year and total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $131.4 billion, up 6% over the year ago quarter.
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So when the demand begins to increase -- increasingly picks up, and we also see some return to what we had considered our normal production rate and hence, delivery rates. So that will drive margin.

And when we were hitting our apex of margin a couple of years ago, that was, as you recall, an acceleration of the 650 backlog, the salutary effect of better aligning 650 demand with the backlog, so there wasn't too much of a wait for people. but also helping us transition through that period when we were replacing the 4 5500 -- the 4 5550 with 500 and 600.

You'll recall the major moving pieces that we've talked about sort of outside the normal run rates for the business in general have been the elevated inventory level at Gulfstream as we've invested in the new models between test airplanes and the buildup for production and entry into service. That obviously has been a headwind for several years now. We saw that start to turn at the end of last year, a little bit better than we thought was going to happen a little earlier than we thought was going to happen.
And so we -- that helped us outperform our cash flow expectations for 2020. You can think about that for Gulfstream continuing to normalize this year. We'll start to see the 500s and 600s hit that inflection point and no longer be a headwind. But at the same time, keep in mind, we're building up on the 700 as that program moves toward entry into service. So that will become a little more neutral this year and then eventually shift into a tailwind in the 2022 period and beyond.
The other piece is obviously the large international program at Combat Systems, which again was a headwind for several years. That turned with the modification of that contract that Phebe discussed earlier. into a more neutral event last year. So that stabilized last year and becomes a very modest tailwind this year and then becomes a more meaningful tailwind in '22, '23 and a little bit more in '24.
So when you think about the way those 2 pieces are moving, that kind of gets us on a cash flow trajectory from -- if you go back to 2019, we were in the 60-ish percent range, moving toward an expectation of the 80% range last year. We outperformed that a little bit as Gulfstream did a little better. And now we're in the high -- mid- to high 90% range.
The one piece there that's still sort of keeping us out of the 100% range really is the elevated investment profile in CapEx at Marine Systems. So once that normalizes next year, it gets back into the 2% of sales range. You should expect to see us the whole business at large being in the 100 to 100-plus percent range, really with those 2 working capital pieces at Gulfstream and Combat Systems becoming the tailwinds that allow us to get even nicely above 100%.
So that's kind of the trajectory for all those major moving pieces. Hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we're going and the basis for our expectation for the improvement that we see ahead."

That puts our shipbuilding business, particularly submarines in a very good stead.

With respect to our Combat Systems group, unfortunately, but regrettably the case, the hottest theater at the moment is Russia. And so whether we like it or not, that is the reality with which we were faced. And this administration has been very quick to respond appropriately to the Russians. And so you see we believe that Combat Systems is highly aligned with that reality that we're now faced with in Europe.
So all in all, we like our positioning with the new administration's priority. Remember, in particular, the administration and this president has been an advocate of strong national security throughout his long and distinguished career. U.S. national security strategy is driven by the threat or the perception of threat that has not changed. So we will see some changes in relative priority among systems.

We do expect to see some, the extent to which remains to be seen, but some work from home, either in hybrid capacities, or, in some cases, more completely. But I don't see that move as something that is positive and determinative of real performance and execution.
I think what you saw going back to execution through COVID and frankly, this company's performance across its business units during COVID was really a manifestation of the discipline that we have in all of our operating -- on our operating performance and our operating leverage. The more disciplined the company is, the better they were able to adapt to the vagaries and some of the really significant challenges that COVID provided both to the workforce and frankly, the customers and the environment.
So I think that to me, it underscored amplified our operating excellence And I suspect that, that will continue -- an understanding of that will continue to permeate as we go forward, and we will continue to build on that. Operating excellence is never static. It has to get better and better and better. That's what continuous improvement is all about. And frankly, we have a long-standing discipline around that. So I don't think there'll be a structural change in our operating performance, but it's simply undergirds the importance of that discipline that focuses on performance."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.48 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net income of $708 million. Revenue is up $640 million or 7.3% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $4 million, and net earnings are up $2 million.
To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million, and Aerospace is up $196 million. The operating earnings on the defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the Aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus. I will have more to say about this a bit later.
The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. This was driven by a 250 basis point lower margin rate at Aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense.
From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.18 per share. We have roughly $500 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $50 million more in operating earnings. So it's a pure operations beat. I must confess that we also beat our own expectations rather handsomely. This is, in almost all respects, a very solid quarter. It's hard to find something not to like about it. It's a very good start to the year.
So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash, and then we'll answer your questions.
First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $220 million with an 11.7% operating margin. Revenue is almost $200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side. Revenue is also $196 million higher than the year-ago quarter. The difference is almost exclusively more G500 and G600 deliveries than the year-ago quarter. The 11.7% operating margin is lower than the year-ago quarter, but consistent with our guidance and sell-side expectations.
Finally, we took some mark-to-market charges with respect to our G500 test inventory. Without the charge, from a pure operating perspective, performance in the quarter was superb. Aerospace also had a very strong quarter from an orders perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.34:1. In unit terms, this is the strongest order quarter for the last 2 years, excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 when we launched the G700.
The sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the quarter. The momentum developed in the quarter appears to be rolling over into the second quarter as well. We are experiencing a high level of interest and activity. It is constructive to see this accelerated activity level without the benefit of the removal of travel restrictions and quarantine requirements in many countries outside the U.S. Demand should improve even further when these restrictions are ultimately removed.
Gulfstream experienced a 5.7% increase in service revenue. On the other hand, Jet Aviation's FBOs and certain of its maintenance facilities are recovering more slowly. Jet Aviation service revenue is down around $31 million, coupled with a modest increase in service operating earnings. The FBOs and MRO sites will do much better as business travel accelerate.
The G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis, and quality is superb. As of the end of last week, we have delivered 104 of these aircraft to customers. The G700 has over 1,400 test hours on the 5 test aircraft, and the first fully outfitted G700 is flying. Its interior is absolutely beautiful. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Looking forward, we expect the second quarter to be our most challenging from a delivery perspective. However, we also expect rapid improvement in the third and fourth quarters as we had planned for an increase in production and more delivery.
Combat Systems. Combat Systems has revenue of $1.8 billion, up 6.6% over the year-ago quarter. While all 3 companies within the group contributed to the growth, the primary source was increased sales of our 8x8 wheeled combat vehicles to Switzerland and Spain and sales of our 6x6 Eagle vehicles. So all in all, good growth.
It is also interesting to observe that Combat Systems revenue has grown in 16 of the last 18 quarters on a quarter over the year-ago quarter basis. Operating earnings, at $244 million, are up 9.4% on higher volume and a 30 basis point improvement in margin. This was an impressive performance by any reasonable measure.
You may recall that a notable development for this segment in the year-ago quarter was the formal signing of the restructured contract on the Canadian international program, which settled all issues. The parties continue to perform on that contract, as contemplated. This was helpful to free cash flow last year and continues to be so this year. This risk item appears to be behind us.
Turning to Marine Systems. You may recall that at this time a year ago, I was able to report that revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter in 2019. I am very pleased to report today that first quarter 2021 revenue of $2.48 billion is up 10.6% against first quarter 2020. The growth was led by Block V Virginia-class and Columbia-class construction volume. We also enjoyed nice increases in ESB and T-AO construction volume at NASSCO. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 14 quarters on a quarter versus the year-ago quarter basis.
Operating earnings are $200 million in the quarter, up $16 million or 8.7% on an operating margin of 8.1%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. On the order side, I should observe that total backlog was down only $231 million sequentially, leaving a powerful $49.8 billion in total backlog. There was obviously significant order activity in the quarter, including the award of the 10th Block V Virginia-class submarine.
Finally, Technologies. This segment have revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, up $95 million from the year-ago quarter or 3.1%. The revenue increase was supplied by Information Technology, mostly associated with the ramp-up of new programs. IT alone grew 5% in the quarter. Operating earnings at $306 million or up $8 million or 2.7% on a 9.6% operating margin. This is about 40 basis points ahead of consensus.
EBITDA margin is an impressive 13.3%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. This is a best-in-class EBITDA margin. Total backlog grew $359 million sequentially, and total estimated contract value remained about the same.
There were also some notable items in GDIT's first quarter worth mentioning. On the bid and proposal front, GDIT submitted the highest dollar value of proposals in any quarter since the acquisition of CSRA, 90% of which represent new business opportunities. They ended the quarter with over $30 billion in proposals awaiting customer decision, most of which also represent new business opportunities versus recompetition of existing work. So good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon.
That concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. We will, however, give you a comprehensive update at the end of the second quarter, as is our custom.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks, and then we'll take your questions."
274561,710892437,2260921,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million. For",655,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million. For those of you who followed us for some time, you know we've been a fairly significant user of cash in the first quarter for the past several years.
This quarter was a marked improvement from that pattern due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international Combat Systems program, consistent with the contract amendment Phebe referenced earlier. So the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range.
Looking at capital deployment, I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $134 million in the quarter or 1.4% of sales. That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full year CapEx to be roughly 2.5% of sales. We also paid $315 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share. And we spent nearly $750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $161 per share. After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from this time last year.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $123 million, up from $107 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in 2021 is due to the incremental debt issued last year in conjunction with the refinancing of maturing notes. We have $3 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we plan to refinance a portion of those notes to achieve a more balanced deployment of capital, but this will still result in a declining debt balance this year and beyond.
During the quarter, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act. As you may be aware, it contains 2 provisions that affect our business. First, it extends the provision of the CARES Act that allows reimbursement of contractor payments to workers who are prevented from working due to COVID-related facility closures. This will continue to benefit our Technologies business, although it does not provide for fee on those costs. So that will have an ongoing dilutive impact on the segment's margins.
Second, the Act provides pension funding relief by reducing the amount of required contribution to our pension plans this year by a couple of hundred million dollars. However, this same provision reduces the amount of pension costs we are reimbursed on our U.S. government contracts. As a result, when coupled with the lower tax benefit from the reduced pension contributions, the impact on our 2021 cash flow is immaterial.
We expect the cash benefit from the Act to increase modestly over the next couple of years, reinforcing our expectation that free cash flow can exceed 100% of net income over that period. The tax rate in the quarter, at 16.2%, is consistent with our full year expectation, so no change to our outlook on that front.
Finally, order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole, even as we grew by more than 7% in the quarter. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace and Technologies groups led the way with a 1.3x and 1.1x book-to-bill, respectively. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $89.6 billion. That's up 4.5% over this time last year. And total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts, was $131.4 billion, up 6% over the year-ago quarter.
Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A."

So when the demand begins to increase -- increasingly picks up, then we also see some return to what we had considered our normal production rate and, hence, delivery rates.

And as we've talked about many times before, margins at Gulfstream are a whole host -- driven by a whole host of issues, not the least of which is service mix, mix of airplanes.
And when we were hitting our apex of margin a couple of years ago, that was, as you recall, an acceleration of the 650 backlog, which had a salutary effect of better aligning 650 demand with the backlog, so there wasn't too much of a wait for people, but also helping us transition through that period when we were replacing the 450/500 -- the 450/550 with 500 and 600.

You'll recall, the major moving pieces that we've talked about sort of outside the normal run rates for the business in general have been the elevated inventory level at Gulfstream as we've invested in the new models between test airplanes and the buildup for production and entry into service. That obviously has been a headwind for several years now. We saw that start to turn at the end of last year, a little bit better than we thought was going to happen, a little earlier than we thought was going to happen. And so we -- that helped us outperform our cash flow expectations for 2020.
You can think about that for Gulfstream continuing to normalize this year. We'll start to see the 500s and 600s hit that inflection point and no longer be a headwind. But at the same time, keep in mind, we're building up on the 700 as that program moves toward entry into service. So that will become a little more neutral this year and then eventually shift into a tailwind in the 2022 period and beyond.
The other piece is obviously the large international program at Combat Systems, which again was a headwind for several years. That turned with the modification of that contract that Phebe discussed earlier into a more neutral event last year. So that stabilized last year and becomes a very modest tailwind this year and then becomes a more meaningful tailwind in '22, '23 and a little bit more in '24.
So when you think about the way those 2 pieces are moving, that kind of gets us on a cash flow trajectory from -- if you go back to 2019, we were in the 60-ish percent range, moving toward an expectation of the 80% range last year. We outperformed that a little bit as Gulfstream did a little better. And now we're in the high -- mid- to high-90% range. The one piece there that's still sort of keeping us out of the 100% range really is the elevated investment profile in CapEx at Marine Systems.
So once that normalizes, next year, it gets back into the 2% of sales range. You should expect to see us, the whole business at large, being in the 100 to 100-plus percent range really with those 2 working capital pieces at Gulfstream and Combat Systems becoming the tailwinds that allow us to get even nicely above 100%.
So that's kind of the trajectory for all those major moving pieces. Hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we're going and the basis for our expectation for the improvement that we see ahead."

And that included workforce hiring and training, supply chain readiness, facility readiness, construction prototyping, technology readiness, retiring potential known risks or potential risks in new high-end technologies. And then the design maturity that this boat entered into construction with an 83% design completion level and great contrast to Virginia, which has been an exemplary program at 43%.
So all of this prior planning and 14 years of detailed blocking and tackling at every conceivable level has mitigated an awful lot of risk and allowed us to proverbially hit the ground running on Columbia.

And there is nothing like, going back to the earlier comments about execution, there's nothing like performing on schedule and on budget to amplify and provide a bit of an antidote to any potential cuts that come in the future.

We hear a lot of anecdotal evidence that there may be systemic changes emanating from COVID that have to do with work at home and what that might mean for commercial real estate footprint.

We do expect to see some, the extent to which remains to be seen, but some work from home, either in hybrid capacities or, in some cases, more completely. But I don't see that move as something that is positive and determinative of real performance and execution.
I think what you saw, going back to execution through COVID and, frankly, this company's performance across its business units during COVID was really a manifestation of the discipline that we have in all of our operating -- on our operating performance and our operating leverage. The more disciplined the company is, the better they were able to adapt to the vagaries and some of the really significant challenges that COVID provided both to the workforce and, frankly, the customers and the environment.
So I think that to me, it underscored, amplified our operating excellence. And I suspect that, that will continue -- the understanding of that will continue to permeate as we go forward, and we will continue to build on that. Operating excellence is never static. It has to get better and better and better. That's what continuous improvement is all about. And frankly, we have a long-standing discipline around that. So I don't think there'll be a structural change in our operating performance, but it simply undergirds the importance of that discipline that focuses on performance."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Early this morning, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $959 million, and net income of $737 million. Revenue was essent",1656,"Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Early this morning, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $959 million, and net income of $737 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings are up $125 million, and net earnings are up $112 million. Earnings per share are up $0.43.
To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's second quarter by $308 million or 4.2%. The Aerospace is down $352 million, pretty much as planned. Operating earnings on the defense side are up $98 million, or 14.3% and operating earnings in aerospace are up $36 million on a 390 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4%, 140 basis points better than the year ago quarter.
From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.07 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is 20 basis more than anticipated, coupled with a somewhat lower share count. This led to the earnings date.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $596 million or 3.3%, and operating earnings are up $129 million or 7.3%. Overall, margins are up 40 basis points.
The defense numbers are particularly good with revenue up $752 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings up $143 million or 10.3%. On the Aerospace side of the business, revenue on a year-to-date basis is down $156 million or 4.3%, but earnings are up $16 million or 4% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins.
The quarter was also very strong from a cash perspective. Free cash flow of $943 million is 128% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 151% of net income.
In summary, we enjoyed a very good growth in the defense businesses in the quarter and had a very solid quarter from an earnings perspective across the board. The year-to-date results give us a solid start to the year and enable us to raise our forecast for the full year, which I will share with you at the end of these remarks.
So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around cash, backlog taxes and deployment of cash. And then I will provide updated guidance and answer your questions.
First, Aerospace. Let me put the Aerospace results in some recent historical context so as to put our performance into our perspective where it can be understood. As you recall, that in April of last year, we told you we were cutting production as the result of certain supply chain issues. It subsequently became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID-19 that resulted in additional cuts to production. Those production cuts were implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point this quarter. You may also recall that I told you last quarter that the second quarter would be the most challenging for Gulfstream because of these preplanned production cuts.
On the good news side of the story, we had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half. In short, you will see more deliveries, revenue and operating earnings in the second half as a result.
With that, let me turn to the Aerospace results in the quarter. Aerospace had revenue of $1.6 billion and operating earnings of $195 million, with a 12% operating margin. Revenue was $352 million less than the year ago quarter or 17.8% as a result of fewer planned aircraft deliveries. On the other hand, operating earnings are up $36 million or 22.6% on a 390 basis point improvement in margins. From a pure operating perspective, we did very well.
From an order perspective, the quarter border long is spectacular. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 2:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 2.1:1. Even stronger, if expressed in unit terms. This is the strongest order quarter in number of units in quite some time. It was all the more remarkable and that it did not include any fleet sales.
As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter. The pipeline that developed in that quarter rolled over into the second quarter as is audience from these results. We continue to experience a high level of interest activity and a growing pipeline.
From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continue to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis and quality is superb. We have delivered 115 of these aircraft to customers as we speak. The G700 has approximately 1,600 test hours on the 5 test aircraft. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022, but much remains to be accomplished, particularly with respect to the certification of the new Rolls-Royce engine.
Looking forward, we have planned 32 deliveries in the third quarter and 39 in the fourth. If all goes well, we may be able to bring in a few more forward from the first quarter of 2022 to meet current demand.
Turning to Combat Systems. All of the comparisons combat systems quarter-over-quarter sequentially and year-to-date are quite favorable. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.9 billion, up 8.3% over the year ago quarter. While Ordnance and Tactical Systems did well, the primary source of growth was combat vehicles at both land systems and European land systems. So all in all, very good growth. It is also interesting to observe that Combat Systems revenue has grown in 17 of the last 19 quarters on a quarter over the year ago quarter basis.
For the first half of the year, Combat Systems revenue of $3.7 billion, is $257 million or 7.4% over the first half of last year. Operating earnings for the quarter at $266 million are up 11.3% on higher volume and a 40 basis point improvement in margin. For the first half, Combat Systems earnings of $510 million are up $48 million or 10.4% over the last year's first half.
The quarter was also good for Combat Systems from an order perspective with a 1:1 book-to-bill, leaving a modest increase in total backlog Demand for our products, particularly our combat vehicles remain strong with Europe leading the way. Abrams main battle tank demand is also increasing and the Stryker remains the combat vehicle of choice for multiple U.S. Army missions and operations. This was an impressive performance once again by Combat Systems.
Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.54 billion is up $65 million over the year ago quarter. It is also up sequentially in year-to-date. In the quarter, the growth was led by the DDG 51 and TAO volume. Submarine construction was stable with increases in Virginia Block V and Colombia, offset by a decline in Block IV and engineering.
For the first half, revenue is up $302 million or 6.4%. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 15 quarters on a quarter versus the year ago quarter basis. Operating earnings are $210 million in the quarter, up $10 million or 5% on operating margins of 8.3%.
You may recall that we experienced a strike at Bath last year. I am pleased to report that our relationship with the union is strong, and we are both committed to improving Bath performance. NASSCO is coming down the learning curve on the ESG and is nearing completion on the first of the new oilers. Repair was also strong. Electric Boat performance remains strong. And while early in the Colombia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule.
Finally, Technologies. The segment has revenues of $3.16 billion in the quarter, up $98 million from the year ago quarter or 3.2%. The revenue increase supplied by information technology, mostly associated with the ramp-up of new programs was almost 10%. Mission Systems experienced a modest decline in revenue driven by the sale of our space antenna business last year and a shortage of chips for certain products, which we are working to remedy in the second half.
Operating earnings at $308 million are up $61 million or 24.7% on a 9.7% operating margin. EBITDA margin is an impressive 13.7%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line.
Total backlog grew $95 million, so good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon. The book-to-bill at IT was a little better than 1:1, and somewhat less at Mission Systems. This is particularly good performance in light of the continued delays by the customer in making contract awards. In total, GDIT has nearly $34 billion in submittals awaiting customer decision was most representing new work. In addition to these submittals, our first half order book does not reflect approximately $4.6 billion of awards made in GDIT that are now in protest, including 2 sizable contracts challenged by a competitor. These delays are pushing work we anticipated delivering in the second half of 2021 to 2022.
While new award activity has generally been slower, new requests for proposals have remained robust. GDIT's hefty submittals in the first half reflect significant customer demand for modernization and securing IT infrastructure in the wake of COVID. Business has the opportunity to submit another nearly $20 billion in proposals through the end of the year.
This concludes my remarks with respect to a very strong quarter and first half. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks, and then will provide you some guidance."

I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $1.1 billion on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large internati",621,"Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $1.1 billion on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international combat vehicle contract.
Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow, as Phebe noted, was $943 million, or a 128% net earnings conversion. You may recall that for the past several years, our free cash flow has been heavily weighted to the back half of the year. So the strong quarter derisks that profile somewhat and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range.
Looking at capital deployment. I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $172 million in the quarter or 1.9% of sales. That's down from last year, but our full year expectation remains in the range of
[Audio Gap]
million on the repurchase of 3.3 million shares -- That brings year-to-date repurchases to 7.9 million shares at an average price of just under $173 per share. We have 279.5 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. We repaid $2.5 billion of notes that matured in May, in part with proceeds from $1.5 billion in notes we issued in May. We also issued $2 billion of commercial paper during the quarter to facilitate the repayment of those notes and for liquidity phasing purposes, but we expect to fully retire that CP before the end of the year.
After all this, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of just under $3 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, consistent with the end of last quarter and down more than $900 million from this time last year. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $109 million, down from $132 million in the second quarter of 2020. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $232 million, down slightly from $239 million for the same period in 2020.
We repaid another $500 million of notes on July 15, as we continue to bring down our debt balance this year and beyond. At this point, we expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $425 million.
The tax rate in the quarter and the first half at 16.3% is consistent with the full year expectation. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the year.
Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the second quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Phebe mentioned, order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 2x book-to-bill, while Combat and Technologies each recorded a book-to-bill of 1:1 on solid year-over-year revenue growth. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $89.2 billion. That's up over 8% over this time last year. And total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts, was $130.3 billion.
Finally, a quick note on the operating results in the Technologies Group. You'll recall in the second quarter of last year, we recognized a loss of approximately $40 million on an international contract that resulted from scheduled delays caused by COVID-related travel restrictions. We formally closed out this matter with the customer this quarter. And despite the fact that our activity on the contract has been dormant for over a year, the accounting rules required us to reverse approximately $45 million of previously recognized revenue in the quarter. Without this reversal, the Technologies group would have seen organic growth of 6.4% in the quarter.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2021 and wrap-up remarks."

The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I will not repeat. In our own space, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.4%, which is 10 basis points below what we previously forecasted. This will result in an additional $10 million of operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can squeeze out a few more planes in the year.
With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems should have another $100 million of revenue and add another 10 basis points of operating margin. So total revenue of $7.4 billion and operating margin number around 14.6%.
Marine Systems has an additional $300 million and 10 basis points of improved margin. So annual revenue of $10.6 billion with an operating margin around 8.4%. Technology revenue will be down $200 million from our previous forecast that adds 30 basis points of operating margin. So annual revenue of $13 billion with an operating margin of around 9.8%. So on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of about $39.2 billion, and an overall operating margin around 10.6%. This rolls up to EPS around $1.50, $0.45 to $0.50 better than our forecast going into the year.
That concludes my remarks, and it will be a pleasure to take your questions."

And if you think critically about change, what we know is that structural change is almost never apparent prospectively. It almost always is apparent retrospectively. And so I believe that it is premature to assume any pronouncements about structural change.
Now that said, we've seen our customers are the same kinds of customers that we've had historically back in. I think there was some slowing, obviously, there was some slowing of demand last year. And a number of our customers, particularly in the Fortune 500 are on their aircraft replacement cycle, and that remains unchanged.

I think, David, as I alluded to in the remarks, I think the way you think about the strength of the first half and the strength of the activity at Gulfstream is that it somewhat derisks the profile for the second half and getting to that 95% to 100% range. You'll recall over the past several years, we've had a pretty steep slope in the second half on our free cash flow generation with frankly, at times, most, if not all of our free cash flow for the year coming in the second half, if not even most in the fourth quarter.
So that's not anything I would put together by design, and I'm really encouraged by the shift in that slope that we've seen this year. So it does give us, I think, even reinforced confidence to getting to that 95% to 100% range. I think if you think about that range as a percentage of net income and combine that with Phebe's guidance on increasing net income, you can imply increasing free cash flow that number.
And frankly, if I'm going to lean a little forward, I think it could possibly put us toward the top end of that range of the 95% to 100% range. I don't know that I'd want to get out above 100% this year. I think we still look to next year and beyond to be nicely above 100%. But bottom line, I think this reinforces improvement in overall free cash flow and maybe pushes us up towards the higher end of that 95% to 100% range."

And 2, we've seen an increased propensity of many in this -- in the IT industry to protest repeatedly. Early and often seems to be the mantra. So both of those have increased our expectations for when that -- when we can see that growth coming.
But I think I mentioned that we've got about $34 billion in already in customer hands awaiting some sort of decision. And we've got about $20 billion in the pipeline. So all of that drives growth.

I suspect that, that ship and others like it can speed a type of platform that evolves over time to address different kinds of missions. I think that, that's pretty much regular order.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Early this morning, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $959 million and net income of $737 million. Revenue was essenti",1650,"Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Early this morning, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $959 million and net income of $737 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings are up $125 million and net earnings are up $112 million. Earnings per share are up $0.43. 
To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's second quarter by $308 million or 4.2%. The Aerospace is down $352 million, pretty much as planned. Operating earnings on the defense side are up $98 million, or 14.3%, and operating earnings in Aerospace are up $36 million on a 390 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4%, 140 basis points better than the year-ago quarter. 
From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.07 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is 20 basis more than anticipated, coupled with a somewhat lower share count. This led to the earnings bit. 
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $596 million or 3.3%, and operating earnings are up $129 million or 7.3%. Overall, margins are up 40 basis points. 
The defense numbers are particularly good with revenue up $752 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings up $143 million or 10.3%. On the Aerospace side of the business, revenue on a year-to-date basis is down $156 million or 4.3%, but earnings are up $16 million or 4% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. The quarter was also very strong from a cash perspective. Free cash flow of $943 million is 128% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 151% of net income. 
In summary, we enjoyed a very good growth in the defense businesses in the quarter and had a very solid quarter from an earnings perspective across the board. The year-to-date results give us a solid start to the year and enable us to raise our forecast for the full year, which I will share with you at the end of these remarks. 
So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash, and then I will provide updated guidance and answer your questions. 
First, Aerospace. Let me put the Aerospace results in some recent historical context so as to put our performance into our perspective where it can be understood. As you recall that in April of last year, we told you we were cutting production as the result of certain supply chain issues. It subsequently became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID-19 that resulted in additional cuts to production. Those production cuts were implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point this quarter. You may also recall that I told you last quarter that the second quarter would be the most challenging for Gulfstream because of these preplanned production cuts. 
On the good news side of the story, we had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half. In short, you will see more deliveries, revenue and operating earnings in the second half as a result. 
With that, let me turn to the Aerospace results in the quarter. Aerospace had revenue of $1.6 billion and operating earnings of $195 million, with a 12% operating margin. Revenue was $352 million less than the year-ago quarter or 17.8% as a result of fewer planned aircraft deliveries. On the other hand, operating earnings are up $36 million or 22.6% on a 390 basis point improvement in margins. From a pure operating perspective, we did very well. 
From an order perspective, the quarter border long is spectacular. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 2:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 2.1:1, even stronger if expressed in unit terms. This is the strongest order quarter in number of units in quite some time. It was all the more remarkable in that it did not include any fleet sales. 
As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter. The pipeline that developed in that quarter rolled over into the second quarter as is obvious from these results. We continue to experience a high level of interest activity and a growing pipeline. 
From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continue to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis and quality is superb. We have delivered 115 of these aircraft to customers as we speak. The G700 has approximately 1,600 test hours on the 5 test aircraft. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022, but much remains to be accomplished, particularly with respect to the certification of the new Rolls-Royce engine. 
Looking forward, we have planned 32 deliveries in the third quarter and 39 in the fourth. If all goes well, we may be able to bring in a few more forward from the first quarter of 2022 to meet current demand. 
Turning to Combat Systems. All of the comparisons in Combat Systems quarter-over-quarter sequentially and year-to-date are quite favorable. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.9 billion, up 8.3% over the year-ago quarter. While Ordnance and Tactical Systems did well, the primary source of growth was combat vehicles at both Land Systems and European Land Systems. So all in all, very good growth. It is also interesting to observe that Combat Systems revenue has grown in 17 of the last 19 quarters on a quarter over the year-ago quarter basis. 
For the first half of the year, Combat Systems revenue of $3.7 billion, is $257 million or 7.4% over the first half of last year. Operating earnings for the quarter at $266 million are up 11.3% on higher volume and a 40 basis point improvement in margin. For the first half, Combat Systems earnings of $510 million are up $48 million or 10.4% over the last year's first half. 
The quarter was also good for Combat Systems from an order perspective with a 1:1 book-to-bill, leaving a modest increase in total backlog. Demand for our products, particularly our combat vehicles, remain strong with Europe leading the way. Abrams main battle tank demand is also increasing and the Stryker remains the combat vehicle of choice for multiple U.S. Army missions and operations. This was an impressive performance once again by Combat Systems. 
Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.54 billion is up $65 million over the year-ago quarter. It is also up sequentially in year-to-date. In the quarter, the growth was led by the DDG-51 and T-AO volume. Submarine construction was stable with increases in Virginia Block V and Columbia, offset by a decline in Block IV and engineering. 
For the first half, revenue is up $302 million or 6.4%. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 15 quarters on a quarter versus the year-ago quarter basis. Operating earnings are $210 million in the quarter, up $10 million or 5% on operating margins of 8.3%. You may recall that we experienced a strike at Bath last year. I am pleased to report that our relationship with the union is strong, and we are both committed to improving Bath performance. NASSCO is coming down the learning curve on the ESG and is nearing completion on the first of the new oilers. Repair was also strong. Electric both performance remains strong. And while early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule. 
Finally, Technologies. The segment has revenues of $3.16 billion in the quarter, up $98 million from the year-ago quarter or 3.2%. The revenue increase supplied by information technology, mostly associated with the ramp-up of new programs, was almost 10%. Mission Systems experienced a modest decline in revenue driven by the sale of our space antenna business last year and a shortage of chips for certain products, which we are working to remedy in the second half. 
Operating earnings at $308 million are up $61 million or 24.7% on a 9.7% operating margin. EBITDA margin is an impressive 13.7%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. 
Total backlog grew $95 million, so good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon. The book-to-bill at IT was a little better than 1:1, and somewhat less at Mission Systems. This is particularly good performance in light of the continued delays by the customer in making contract awards. In total, GDIT has nearly $34 billion in submittals awaiting customer decision with most representing new work. In addition to these submittals, our first half order book does not reflect approximately $4.6 billion of awards made in GDIT that are now in protest, including 2 sizable contracts challenged by a competitor. These delays are pushing work we anticipated delivering in the second half of 2021 to 2022. 
While new award activity has generally been slower, new requests for proposals have remained robust. GDIT's hefty submittals in the first half reflect significant customer demand for modernization and securing IT infrastructure in the wake of COVID. Business has the opportunity to submit another nearly $20 billion in proposals through the end of the year. 
This concludes my remarks with respect to a very strong quarter and first half. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks, and then he will provide you some guidance."
274561,1673529896,2352808,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter.

I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $1.1 billion on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international combat vehicle contract. 
Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow, as Phebe noted, was $943 million, or a 128% net earnings conversion. You may recall that for the past several years, our free cash flow has been heavily weighted to the back half of the year. So the strong quarter derisks that profile somewhat and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range.
Looking at capital deployment. I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $172 million in the quarter or 1.9% of sales. That's down from last year, but our full year expectation remains in the range of 2.5% of sales. We also paid $336 million in dividends and spent approximately $600 million on the repurchase of 3.3 million shares. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 7.9 million shares at an average price of just under $173 per share. We have 279.5 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. 
We repaid $2.5 billion of notes that matured in May, in part with proceeds from $1.5 billion in notes we issued in May. We also issued $2 billion of commercial paper during the quarter to facilitate the repayment of those notes and for liquidity phasing purposes, but we expect to fully retire that CP before the end of the year.
After all this, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of just under $3 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, consistent with the end of last quarter and down more than $900 million from this time last year. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $109 million, down from $132 million in the second quarter of 2020. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $232 million, down slightly from $239 million for the same period in 2020.
We repaid another $500 million of notes on July 15, as we continue to bring down our debt balance this year and beyond. At this point, we expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $425 million.
The tax rate in the quarter and the first half at 16.3% is consistent with the full year expectation. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the year.
Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the second quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Phebe mentioned, order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 2x book-to-bill, while Combat and Technologies each recorded a book-to-bill of 1:1 on solid year-over-year revenue growth. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $89.2 billion. That's up over 8% over this time last year. And total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts, was $130.3 billion.
Finally, a quick note on the operating results in the Technologies group. You'll recall in the second quarter of last year, we recognized a loss of approximately $40 million on an international contract that resulted from scheduled delays caused by COVID-related travel restrictions. We formally closed out this matter with the customer this quarter. And despite the fact that our activity on the contract has been dormant for over a year, the accounting rules required us to reverse approximately $45 million of previously recognized revenue in the quarter. Without this reversal, the Technologies group would have seen organic growth of 6.4% in the quarter.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2021 and wrap-up remarks."

The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I will not repeat. In our Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.4%, which is 10 basis points below what we previously forecasted. This will result in an additional $10 million of operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can squeeze out a few more planes in the year.
With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems should have another $100 million of revenue and add another 10 basis points of operating margin. So total revenue of $7.4 billion and operating margin number around 14.6%.
Marine Systems has an additional $300 million and 10 basis points of improved margin. So annual revenue of $10.6 billion with an operating margin around 8.4%. Technology revenue will be down $200 million from our previous forecast but adds 30 basis points of operating margin. So annual revenue of $13 billion with an operating margin of around 9.8%. So on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of about $39.2 billion and an overall operating margin around 10.6%. This rolls up to EPS around $11.50, $0.45 to $0.50 better than our forecast going into the year.
That concludes my remarks, and it will be a pleasure to take your questions."

I think, David, as I alluded to in the remarks, I think the way you think about the strength of the first half and the strength of the activity at Gulfstream is that it somewhat derisks the profile for the second half in getting to that 95% to 100% range. You'll recall over the past several years, we've had a pretty steep slope in the second half on our free cash flow generation with frankly, at times, most, if not all of our free cash flow for the year coming in the second half is not even most in the fourth quarter.
So that's not anything I would put together by design, and I'm really encouraged by the shift in that slope that we've seen this year. So it does give us, I think, even reinforced confidence to getting to that 95% to 100% range. I think if you think about that range as a percentage of net income and combine that with Phebe's guidance on increasing net income, you can imply increasing free cash flow to support that number.
And frankly, if I'm going to lean a little forward, I think it could possibly put us toward the top end of that range of the 95% to 100% range. I don't know that I'd want to get out above 100% this year. I think we still look to next year and beyond to be nicely above 100%.

With respect to our auxiliary ships, I think that's -- those tend to be -- and those matter at NASSCO -- and I'm thinking the oilers, the ESB, those tend to be purpose-built ships for a particular mission. 
And then submarines. Submarines remain a pivotal competitive advantage for the United States. And what we have historically focused on and will continue to focus on is integrating any new technologies or capabilities of that submarine. I think it's very important when you're in a complex business like shipbuilding, and particularly submarine design and construction, that you focus on the business of designing and building those ships and ensuring that you can successfully integrate any new capabilities that your customer wants. And we have a long history of that, and I suspect us to continue that for some time to come."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.07 per diluted share on revenue of $9.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net earnings of $860 million. We beat consen",1641,"Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.07 per diluted share on revenue of $9.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net earnings of $860 million. We beat consensus by $0.09 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is up about 40 basis points more than anticipated. This led to the earnings beat.
Revenue is up 1.5% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were up less than 1%. Net earnings are up 3.1% and earnings per share are up 5.9%. This is all reasonably good, but the real story for us is the sequential results. Here, we beat last quarter revenue by 3.8%, operating earnings by 12.6%, net earnings by 16.7%, and EPS by 17.6%.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $733 million or 2.7%. Operating earnings are up $137 million or 4.8%, net earnings are up $140 million, and earnings per share are up $0.64, a strong 8.5%.
We had a powerful quarter from a cash perspective. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.47 billion, that is 171% in net earnings. Free cash flow was $1.275 billion, 148% of net income. This follows a very strong cash quarter performance in the second quarter. In summary, we enjoyed a good quarter in almost all important respects.
So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason give you additional color around cash, backlog and taxes and deployment of cash and then answer your questions. First, Aerospace. At the outset, let me remind you that in April of last year, we announced that we were cutting production as a result of certain supply chain issues. Shortly thereafter, it became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID. That resulted in additional cuts to production. Those production cuts were preplanned and implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point in the second quarter of this year.
We had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half with 32 planned deliveries in the third quarter and 39% in the fourth quarter. In fact, demand accelerated in mid-February, a full 4 months earlier than we had anticipated. This created opportunities but also operations and supply chain challenges for us, particularly for 2022. On balance, it is a rich problem to have.
With that, let me turn to the Aerospace results in the quarter. Aerospace had revenue of $2.07 billion and operating earnings of $262 million, with a 12.7% operating margin. We managed delivery of 31 aircraft as opposed to the 32 planned, 1 slipped into the fourth quarter on customer preference. Revenue is $91 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 4.6% on 1 fewer aircraft delivered.
On the other hand, operating earnings are down $21 million, on a 160 basis point degradation in margins. This was the result of an additional $28 million in G&A expenses driven by higher R&D expense and around a $20 million settlement of a supplier claim related to the allocation of warranties after the end of G550 production. This was offset, but only in part by improved gross margins on delivered aircraft and better margins in the Gulf Street service centers.
The real story here is the quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement. Sales, earnings and margins are ramping up as planned. I will not dwell on these numbers. They are available in the charts attached to the press release. From an order perspective, the quarter boarded on the spectacular. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 1.6:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. The second quarter was the strongest order quarter in the number of units that we have seen in quite some time. This quarter was slightly better.
As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter. The pipeline that developed in that quarter rolled over into the second quarter and increased demand continued through the third quarter. We continue to experience a high level of interest activity and a solid pipeline. As a result of the order activity, Gulfstream backlog this quarter is the highest in the last 6 years.
From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis and quality is excellent. We have delivered 131 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter with 20 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter. These are the metrics of a successful program building further momentum.
The G700 has approximately 1,800 test hours on the 5 test aircraft. The new Rolls-Royce engine is performing well, but much remains to be accomplished. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022 with the G800 to follow in 6 to 9 months.
As I mentioned earlier, we had planned 32 deliveries in the third quarter and came up on short. The slip was attributable to customer preference. We implanted for 39 in the fourth and LAD-1 that slipped into the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we will deliver 40 aircraft in the fourth quarter.
The story in Combat Systems quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date is all about operating excellence and continued strong margin performance. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.745 billion, down 3.1% from the year ago quarter. However, earnings are up 2.2% over the year ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, yet another example of strong operating leverage from Combat Systems.
Further that theme on a year-to-date basis, Combat System revenue was up $201 million or 3.8%, while operating earnings are up a significant 7.4% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. Demand for our combat vehicles remained stable in the U.S. with the brigade of Abrams main battle tanks per year and half of brigade of Strykers per year. Domestic upside is possible from the MPF program where our vehicle is performing well.
In the near term, we are stable internationally, but opportunity rich in the intermediate period with order potential in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark and Switzerland. You may have read in the press about some noise and vibration issues in Ajax that have emerged during the programs test phase. We are working very closely with both the British Army and the Ministry of Defense and are confident that both technical issues can be resolved. In summary, this quarter was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems Group.
Turning to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.64 billion is up $232 million, above 9.6% over the year ago quarter. The current quarter revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly across the 3 shipyards. It is also up sequentially and year-to-date. Year-to-date revenue was up 7.5%. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 16 quarters on a quarter over year ago quarter basis.
Operating earnings are $229 million in the quarter, up $6 million or 2.7% on an operating margin of 8.7%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are up $19 million, on a 40 basis point improvement in margins. Electric Boats performance remained strong, and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule.
We had a particularly strong quarter in our ship repair business, continuing to support our Navy customer. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work, and our programs are well supported in the FY '22 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. The real opportunity given this steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time.
Moving to Technologies. This segment had revenue of $3.120 billion in the quarter, down $130 million from the year ago quarter or 4%. The revenue decrease was attributable to Mission Systems from timing on several programs in part driven by chip shortages. On the other hand, Information Technology grew revenue against the year ago quarter at a rate of 1.4%.
Operating earnings of $327 million are up $13 million or 4.1% on a 10.5% operating margin. EBITDA margin is a truly impressive 14.4%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. This quarter revenues decrease will impact the year, and we now expect revenue to be around $12.6 billion or $400 million less than our second quarter update. Earnings will, however, remain the same on better margins.
Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparator periods. So good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon. The book-to-bill at GDIT was a little better than 1:1 and somewhat less emission systems. The pipeline remains active at both businesses.
From an opportunity perspective, cybersecurity is a top priority throughout the government and the budget calls for tens of billions of dollars in unpiloified in both the defense and civil spaces. This is a significant opportunity for which we are well positioned to support our customers' needs, particularly as more and more customers move toward a 0 trust model.
So that concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter and first 9 months. As we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call, except as I referenced in my remarks about Mission Systems. However, EPS guidance remains unchanged.
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks."

I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $1.5 billion in the quarter, once again on the strength of Gulfstream orders and from continued strong cash performance from our Technology segment.
Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.3 billion or a 148% net earnings conversion. Through the first 9 months, our conversion rate is 91%, approaching our full year outlook for free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. For those of you who followed us for some time, this performance through the first 9 months of the year is better than we've seen in the past several years, and gives us good line of sight to achieving the upper end of our target cash range for the year.
Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $196 million in the quarter or 2% of sales. That puts us a little under the 2% of sales for the first 9 months, so trending somewhat below our forecast for the year. We're still projecting full year CapEx in the range of 2.5% of sales. So that obviously implies an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We also paid $332 million in dividends and spent $117 million on the repurchase of 600,000 shares in the quarter. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 8.5 million shares at an average price of just under $174 per share.
We repaid $500 million of notes that matured in July. And although there were no new issuances, we ended the quarter with $2 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We expect to fully retire that balance before the end of the year. So we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of just over $3.1 billion and a net debt position of $10.5 billion, down more than $800 million from last quarter and down $1.4 billion from this time last year.
With the scheduled CP repayment in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a net debt balance below $10 billion for the first time since 2018. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $99 million, down from $118 million in the third quarter of 2020. That brings the net interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $331 million, down from $357 million for the same period in 2020.
The tax rate in the quarter was 15.3%, bringing our rate to 15.9% for the first 9 months, consistent with our full year outlook, which remains around 16%. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter with a 0.9x book-to-bill for the company as a whole, bringing us to a 1:1 ratio for the first 9 months and a 1.2x ratio for the trailing 12 months. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.6x book-to-bill in the quarter, while technologies recorded a book-to-bill of one-to-one. Foreign exchange rate fluctuation resulted in a $300 million reduction in backlog in the quarter, with the majority of that impact in Combat Systems. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.1 billion, that's up 8% over this time last year, and total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129.6 billion.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Howard to start the Q&A."

So I think it's worthwhile walking through each element here. And first, let's take a look at margins. I'll make some comments that I'd like, Jason, to maybe elucidate a couple of points, and then we'll get into a little bit of earnings. So when you think about margins and the new product development, at present, we have about 3 models in production, soon to be joined by the 700, the 800 replaces the 650 and the 400 comes later.
Importantly, we have all the modern plant property and equipment to do everything we need to do. We need to add some more CapEx to undergird the increase in wing production. Remember, we're doing all of our wings. But here's the important part, and it goes to the design for producibility that we built into these airplanes and the implied productivity that's embedded in that design for producibility.
And remember, too, we are seeing margin improvement in every single one of our airplanes in services. This now tells you -- and again, I think it shines the spotlight on the operating leverage of Gulfstream. But to amplify all of that and really give an additional uplift. Remember, all these aircraft are related. They all have the Symmetry flight deck, the G700 and 800 are the same engine and wings in the same basic fuselage, the G400 and 500, 600 have the same engines or similar engines from the same family from 1 supplier and the same basic fuselage. So this commonality align -- allowed us to design for producibility, which is going to be an uplift to our margins.
Now if we unpack that a little bit, we get an awful lot of questions about R&D. And I'd like to Jason to talk a little bit more and perhaps not for all but for some, a bit of a tutorial on R&D accounting."
274561,1684511021,2413986,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Yes. So to Phebe's point, we get a lot of questions around will this new product investment have any impact on the overall R&D spend and what does that do to margins over time. And as a reminder, we have a long-term steady commitment and demonstrated perf",283,"Yes. So to Phebe's point, we get a lot of questions around will this new product investment have any impact on the overall R&D spend and what does that do to margins over time. And as a reminder, we have a long-term steady commitment and demonstrated performance of investing in Gulfstream's product development and new technologies over time. So I think if you look over a multiyear period, we've averaged company-sponsored R&D in the call it, roughly 1% of sales range, and we don't expect that to change.
Largely, the 800, I wouldn't say it's behind us, but it's been part and parcel to that spend over time. R&D is spent as a period expense over time. As Phebe mentioned, the G400, while a clean sheet airplane is part of the 500 and 600 development. And so the commonality among those helps keep that spend down. And so both of those airplanes are right within that profile of R&D spend. I think to the extent you see any lumpiness in R&D as we did this quarter, and we'll expect to see a little bit next quarter, that has more to do with supply or offsets that we receive. You're probably familiar with those where suppliers contribute to the program development efforts, and those come in lumps and chunks so that tends to create the quarterly perturbations and R&D spend.
But overall, the period expense for these programs, including the 2 that were announced this month, are right inside that line of company-sponsored R&D. So we don't expect that or the, frankly, the introduction once they come to have an overall impact in the margin improvement trajectory that we see for Gulfstream over time."

I think as you can see from the exhibits this morning, working capital was a benefit, call it, in the couple of $300 million or $400 million in the quarter. That is largely from the performance at Gulfstream, the significant order activity that we've seen throughout the year and the quarter as well as the continued sale of the last of the test articles from the 500 and 600 program. So that really is the big benefit in the quarter.
Working capital is still a bit of a headwind year-to-date, just as the business grows and we work through some of that. But I think as you look ahead, we would expect to see working capital to continue to be a benefit in the fourth quarter and beyond as we get back to that 100% conversion level this year. We're approaching that level this year and certainly expect to get above 100% conversion next year. So part of that is the continued demand cadence at Gulfstream. Once we get through the 700 program, we would look to sell off those test articles as well. And then, of course, you've got the ongoing benefits at Combat Systems, you've seen us achieve a regular order on the large international program there in Combat Systems, and that will continue to be a tailwind, really even more of a tailwind, I think, into '22 as well as into '23. So those are some of the major movers.
The other side of it, of course, is where we should be peaking this year in terms of the capital expenditure investment profile in Marine Systems. So that will start to come down next year and return more to the normal historical level we see by 2023.

I personally am fully cognizant of the sacrifices they made, and I'm proud of the courage they showed.
Now let me turn to the mandate. As you well know, as a federal contractor, we are covered by the executive order on the mandate. The corporate office mandate has been fully executed. Two of our largest businesses are in the process of executing the mandate and many others are set to implement accordingly.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.07 per diluted share on revenue of $9.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net earnings of $860 million. We beat consen",1642,"Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.07 per diluted share on revenue of $9.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net earnings of $860 million. We beat consensus by $0.09 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is up about 40 basis points more than anticipated. This led to the earnings beat.
Revenue is up 1.5% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were up less than 1%. Net earnings are up 3.1%, and earnings per share are up 5.9%. This is all reasonably good, but the real story for us is the sequential results. Here, we beat last quarter revenue by 3.8%, operating earnings by 12.6%, net earnings by 16.7%, and EPS by 17.6%.
On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $733 million or 2.7%. Operating earnings are up $137 million or 4.8%, net earnings are up $140 million, and earnings per share are up $0.64, a strong 8.5%.
We had a powerful quarter from a cash perspective. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.47 billion. That is 171% in net earnings. Free cash flow was $1.275 billion, 148% of net income. This follows a very strong cash quarter performance in the second quarter. In summary, we enjoyed a good quarter in almost all important respects.
So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason give you additional color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then answer your questions. 
First, Aerospace. At the outset, let me remind you that in April of last year, we announced that we were cutting production as a result of certain supply chain issues. Shortly thereafter, it became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID. That resulted in additional cuts to production. Those production cuts were preplanned and implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point in the second quarter of this year.
We had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half with 32 planned deliveries in the third quarter and 39% in the fourth quarter. In fact, demand accelerated in mid-February, a full 4 months earlier than we had anticipated. This created opportunities but also operations and supply chain challenges for us, particularly for 2022. On balance, it is a rich problem to have.
With that, let me turn to the Aerospace results in the quarter. Aerospace had revenue of $2.07 billion and operating earnings of $262 million, with a 12.7% operating margin. We managed delivery of 31 aircraft as opposed to the 32 planned, 1 slipped into the fourth quarter on customer preference. Revenue is $91 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 4.6% on 1 fewer aircraft delivered.
On the other hand, operating earnings are down $21 million on a 160 basis point degradation in margins. This was the result of an additional $28 million in G&A expenses driven by higher R&D expense and around a $20 million settlement of a supplier claim related to the allocation of warranties after the end of G550 production. This was offset, but only in part, by improved gross margins on delivered aircraft and better margins in the Gulfstream service centers.
The real story here is the quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement. Sales, earnings and margins are ramping up as planned. I will not dwell on these numbers. They are available in the charts attached to the press release. From an order perspective, this quarter boarded on the spectacular. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 1.6:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. The second quarter was the strongest order quarter in the number of units that we have seen in quite some time. This quarter was slightly better.
As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter. The pipeline that developed in that quarter rolled over into the second quarter and increased demand continued through the third quarter. We continue to experience a high level of interest activity and a solid pipeline. As a result of the order activity, Gulfstream backlog this quarter is the highest in the last 6 years.
From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis, and quality is excellent. We have delivered 131 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter with 20 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter. These are the metrics of a successful program building further momentum.
The G700 has approximately 1,800 test hours on the 5 test aircraft. The new Rolls-Royce engine is performing well, but much remains to be accomplished. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the G800 to follow in 6 to 9 months.
As I mentioned earlier, we had planned 32 deliveries in the third quarter and came up on short. The slip was attributable to customer preference. We had planned for 39 in the fourth and LAD-1 that slipped into the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we will deliver 40 aircraft in the fourth quarter.
The story in Combat Systems quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date is all about operating excellence and continued strong margin performance. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.745 billion, down 3.1% from the year ago quarter. However, earnings are up 2.2% over the year ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, yet another example of strong operating leverage from Combat Systems.
Further that theme on a year-to-date basis, Combat System revenue was up $201 million or 3.8%, while operating earnings are up a significant 7.4% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. Demand for our combat vehicles remained stable in the U.S., with a brigade of Abrams main battle tanks per year and half a brigade of Strykers per year. Domestic upside is possible from the MPF program where our vehicle is performing well.
In the near term, we are stable internationally but opportunity rich in the intermediate period with order potential in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark and Switzerland. You may have read in the press about some noise and vibration issues in Ajax that have emerged during the programs test phase. We are working very closely with both the British Army and the Ministry of Defense and are confident that both technical issues can be resolved. In summary, this quarter was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems Group.
Turning to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.64 billion is up $232 million, above 9.6% over the year ago quarter. The current quarter revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly across the 3 shipyards. It is also up sequentially and year-to-date. Year-to-date revenue was up 7.5%. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 16 quarters on a quarter over year ago quarter basis.
Operating earnings are $229 million in the quarter, up $6 million or 2.7% on an operating margin of 8.7%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are up $19 million, on a 40 basis point improvement in margins. Electric Boats performance remained strong, and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule.
We had a particularly strong quarter in our ship repair business, continuing to support our Navy customer. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work, and our programs are well supported in the FY '22 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. The real opportunity given this steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time.
Moving to Technologies. This segment had revenue of $3.120 billion in the quarter, down $130 million from the year ago quarter or 4%. The revenue decrease was attributable to Mission Systems from timing on several programs in part driven by chip shortages. On the other hand, Information Technology grew revenue against the year ago quarter at a rate of 1.4%.
Operating earnings of $327 million are up $13 million or 4.1% on a 10.5% operating margin. EBITDA margin is a truly impressive 14.4%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. This quarter revenues decrease will impact the year, and we now expect revenue to be around $12.6 billion or $400 million less than our second quarter update. Earnings will, however, remain the same on better margins.
Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparator periods, so good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon. The book-to-bill at GDIT was a little better than 1:1 and somewhat less in Mission Systems. The pipeline remains active at both businesses.
From an opportunity perspective, cybersecurity is a top priority throughout the government and the budget calls for tens of billions of dollars in unclassified spending in both the defense and civil spaces. This is a significant opportunity for which we are well positioned to support our customers' needs, particularly as more and more customers move toward a 0 trust model.
So that concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter and first 9 months. As we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call, except as I referenced in my remarks about Mission Systems. However, EPS guidance remains unchanged.
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks."

I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter.

I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $1.5 billion in the quarter, once again on the strength of Gulfstream orders and from continued strong cash performance from our Technology segment.
Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.3 billion or a 148% net earnings conversion. Through the first 9 months, our conversion rate is 91%, approaching our full year outlook for free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. For those of you who followed us for some time, this performance through the first 9 months of the year is better than we've seen in the past several years and gives us good line of sight to achieving the upper end of our target cash range for the year.
Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $196 million in the quarter or 2% of sales. That puts us a little under the 2% of sales for the first 9 months, so trending somewhat below our forecast for the year. We're still projecting full year CapEx in the range of 2.5% of sales. So that obviously implies an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We also paid $332 million in dividends and spent $117 million on the repurchase of 600,000 shares in the quarter. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 8.5 million shares at an average price of just under $174 per share.
We repaid $500 million of notes that matured in July. And although there were no new issuances, we ended the quarter with $2 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We expect to fully retire that balance before the end of the year. So we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of just over $3.1 billion and a net debt position of $10.5 billion, down more than $800 million from last quarter and down $1.4 billion from this time last year.
With the scheduled CP repayment in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a net debt balance below $10 billion for the first time since 2018. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $99 million, down from $118 million in the third quarter of 2020. That brings the net interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $331 million, down from $357 million for the same period in 2020.
The tax rate in the quarter was 15.3%, bringing our rate to 15.9% for the first 9 months, consistent with our full year outlook, which remains around 16%. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter, with a 0.9x book-to-bill for the company as a whole, bringing us to a 1:1 ratio for the first 9 months and a 1.2x ratio for the trailing 12 months. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.6x book-to-bill in the quarter, while technologies recorded a book-to-bill of one-to-one. 
Foreign exchange rate fluctuation resulted in a $300 million reduction in backlog in the quarter, with the majority of that impact in Combat Systems. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.1 billion. That's up 8% over this time last year, and total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129.6 billion.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Howard to start the Q&A."

And first, let's take a look at margins. I'll make some comments that I'd like, Jason, to maybe elucidate a couple of points, and then we'll get into a little bit of earnings. So when you think about margins and the new product development, at present, we have about 3 models in production, soon to be joined by the 700. The 800 replaces the 650, and the 400 comes later.
Importantly, we have all the modern plant property and equipment to do everything we need to do. We need to add some more CapEx to undergird the increase in wing production. Remember, we're doing all of our wings. But here's the important part, and it goes to the design for producibility that we built into these airplanes and the implied productivity that's embedded in that design for producibility.
And remember, too, we are seeing margin improvement in every single one of our airplanes in services. This now tells you -- and again, I think it shines the spotlight on the operating leverage of Gulfstream. But to amplify all of that and really give an additional uplift, remember, all these aircraft are related. They all have the Symmetry flight deck. The G700 and 800 are the same engine and wings and the same basic fuselage. The G400 and 500, 600 have the same engines or similar engines from the same family from 1 supplier and the same basic fuselage. So this commonality align -- allowed us to design for producibility, which is going to be an uplift to our margins.
Now if we unpack that a little bit, we get an awful lot of questions about R&D. And I'd like Jason to talk a little bit more, and perhaps not for all but for some, a bit of a tutorial on R&D accounting."
274561,1684511021,2414242,"General Dynamics Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Yes. So to Phebe's point, we get a lot of questions around will this new product investment have any impact on the overall R&D spend and what does that do to margins over time.

So to Phebe's point, we get a lot of questions around will this new product investment have any impact on the overall R&D spend and what does that do to margins over time. And as a reminder, we have a long-term steady commitment and demonstrated performance of investing in Gulfstream's product development and new technologies over time. So I think if you look over a multiyear period, we've averaged company-sponsored R&D in the call it, roughly 1% of sales range, and we don't expect that to change.
Largely, the 800, I wouldn't say it's behind us, but it's been part and parcel to that spend over time. R&D is spent as a period expense over time. As Phebe mentioned, the G400, while a clean sheet airplane is part of the 500 and 600 development, and so the commonality among those helps keep that spend down. And so both of those airplanes are right within that profile of R&D spend. I think to the extent you see any lumpiness in R&D as we did this quarter, and we'll expect to see a little bit next quarter, that has more to do with supplier offsets that we receive. You're probably familiar with those where suppliers contribute to the program development efforts. And those come in lumps and chunks, so that tends to create the quarterly perturbations and R&D spend.
But overall, the period expense for these programs, including the 2 that were announced this month, are right inside that line of company-sponsored R&D. So we don't expect that or the -- frankly, the introduction once they come to have an overall impact in the margin improvement trajectory that we see for Gulfstream over time."

I think as you can see from the exhibits this morning, working capital was a benefit, call it, in the couple of $300 million or $400 million in the quarter. That is largely from the performance at Gulfstream, the significant order activity that we've seen throughout the year and the quarter as well as the continued sale of the last of the test articles from the 500 and 600 program. So that really is the big benefit in the quarter.
Working capital is still a bit of a headwind year-to-date, just as the business grows and we work through some of that. But I think as you look ahead, we would expect to see working capital to continue to be a benefit in the fourth quarter and beyond as we get back to that 100% conversion level this year. We're approaching that level this year and certainly expect to get above 100% conversion next year. So part of that is the continued demand cadence at Gulfstream. Once we get through the 700 program, we would look to sell off those test articles as well. 
And then, of course, you've got the ongoing benefits at Combat Systems. You've seen us achieve a regular order on the large international program there in Combat Systems. And that will continue to be a tailwind, really even more of a tailwind, I think, into '22 as well as into '23. So those are some of the major movers.
The other side of it, of course, is where we should be peaking this year in terms of the capital expenditure investment profile in Marine Systems. So that will start to come down next year and return more to the normal historical level we see by 2023.

I personally am fully cognizant of the sacrifices they made, and I'm proud of the courage they showed.
Now let me turn to the mandate. As you well know, as a federal contractor, we are covered by the executive order on the mandate. The corporate office mandate has been fully executed. Two of our largest businesses are in the process of executing the mandate, and many others are set to implement accordingly.

And the customer base is pretty much our typical customer base. There may be incremental adds here and there, but I would argue that we see that in both the 700 and 800 and frankly, the rest of that portfolio to the extent that there are incremental here and there. And this tend to be high net worth individuals or some new Fortune 1000 or 500 companies. But I think there's nothing particularly notable here in terms of being exceptional outside the norm. Other than there's a lot of good interest here. We've taken a good number of orders."

But I think, importantly, all of our major and frankly all of our programs were well supported, and some are beneficiaries of  increased spending on the part of the Congress. So all in all, we had no particular surprises, by the way, up or down. So we were quite comfortable on how this budget is being played out."

I think the demand that we're seeing is, I tried to reiterate before, is across our existing customer base. The Fortune 1000 is back in force. There are, as I noted, new entrants into that market as some companies have increased their profitability over the last 2 years. And there are additional high net worth individuals who have entered into the market. 
So I think that the data -- and I can only speak for Gulfstream. The data would suggest that given our attractive product mix as strong, as I noted earlier, strong economy and the fact that our customers are back and broad-based demand, I'm not worried at the moment about sustainability. These are -- Gulfstream is in and business jet market is in a cyclical market, driven in part no small measure by the economy. But we have been the most resilient in terms of demand through most economic cycles. So again, I think we are [ very resilient ] and we've got a good pipeline going forward."
