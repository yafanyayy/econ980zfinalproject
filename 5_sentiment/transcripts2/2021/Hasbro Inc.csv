The Hasbro team met the distinct and unique challenges of 2020 with tremendous resilience and excellence. They leveraged the breadth of our portfolio, the global footprint of our business and the diverse and amazing talent in our company to lead our organization through the year. 
I cannot say enough about the quality of the people that I have the honor to work with every day. As consumers of all ages found themselves at home, they sought ways to connect and find joy. Hasbro is uniquely qualified to meet this need for every demographic. Our brands, toys, games and content are valuable as they bring happiness and enjoyment to so many in this unprecedented global environment. 
After a very challenging June quarter, our performance improved in the second half of the year. Throughout the year, we advanced our commercial and retailer programs and supply chain capabilities to meet consumer demand while managing expenses and cash. 
We grew Hasbro's operating profit margin and finished the year with $1.45 billion in cash on our balance sheet. We finished 2020 with growth in revenues and adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter despite a tough comparison with the successful theatrical releases a year ago. 
The 2020 holiday season was extended, starting earlier with strong consumer demand in October and November but seeing some challenges for key weeks in December. The period then ended with strong point-of-sale growth, and this momentum has continued and accelerated into January. 
The comparison with Frozen was extremely challenging due to our success in December 2019. If we exclude Frozen from the data, Hasbro's POS grew 4% for the fourth quarter across the G11. We also gained share and recorded the fastest point-of-sale growth on Amazon in the toy and game market in the U.S. and top European markets during the fourth quarter. 
For the full year, we delivered $1.8 billion in gaming revenue, an increase of 15%. Franchise Brands, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY each had their best year ever. DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS did as well, and classic games like JENGA, Operation and CONNECT 4, to name a few of many, had stellar years. Our gaming business grew in all regions but Latin America. 
The result reflects the ability of our supply chain, marketing and commercial teams to pivot and meet the demand of consumers as they change their behaviors at pace. Gaming has long been a priority investment category for Hasbro. Our brands and our teams lead this market, and we have clear growth plans in both face-to-face and digital gaming for the coming years. You'll hear more from Chris Cox, President of Wizards of the Coast; and Eric Nyman, Chief Consumer Officer, at our virtual investor event on February 25. 
To meet the high consumer demand in gaming and other categories, we leveraged our global retail network and investments in new channels. By year-end, the team drove more than $1 billion in e-comm revenues and a 43% increase from last year and representing just under 30% of our global revenues. This translated to close to a 10 percentage point increase. Pure-play and omnichannel retailers led this growth, and omnichannel made significant strides to double their e-comm revenue for the year. 
Our teams work closely with retailers to expand their online offerings as many added click and collect to their capabilities during the year. With channel support and innovative tailored product, Hasbro also grew revenues with the fan channel last year. We augmented this with our own D2C capabilities, leveraging Hasbro Pulse to create authentic fan experiences. While Pulse is a small but growing piece of our revenue today, it is a unique experience that we're leveraging for continued growth and unmatched connections with the important fan community. 
In addition to our global retail network, our global supply chain capabilities and our evolving geographic manufacturing supplier base were essential to meeting demand. Due to COVID and changing consumer behaviors, we had disruptions from production to logistics, but the team worked tirelessly to meet the demand and successfully execute the year. 
We added new e-comm capabilities and identified opportunities to further enhance those going forward. We continued to diversify our manufacturing, reducing our reliance on any one country, ending 2020 with approximately 55% of production in China. 
To support new brand development and deeper brand engagement, we onboarded the eOne team and their expansive capabilities and brands in storytelling. While live-action TV and film production were limited much of the year, we made substantial progress developing Hasbro IP for entertainment that we expect will lead to enhanced revenues and earnings power across multiple income streams. 
After returning to live-action production in the third quarter, eOne revenues and profit increased versus 2019 for the last quarter of the year as deliveries resume to our broadcast partners. Over the course of 2020, we completed production on 59 series across scripted and unscripted television and 5 future films. 
With COVID-19 protocols in place, production continues around the world. While the near-term theatrical landscape remains uncertain, we see a path to its return, and the opportunities in streaming and linear now and into the future are clear and compelling for both viewership and merchandise. 
The combination of Hasbro's portfolio and eOne's expertise is unlocking opportunity to expand our brands and launch new ones. This takes time and investment, but we have established a robust and deep slate and a road map to drive growth in our business for years to come. 
Our teams are also on track to launch Hasbro-developed, -marketed and -distributed toy and game lines for the leading preschool brands, PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS later this year. To further support our portfolio, we have fully integrated our consumer products organizations to drive immersive brand experiences across categories. With Hasbro's global retailer reach and brand category expertise as well as retailers in the licensed consumer products space reopening and operating, we are expanding these brands. 
This is further enhanced by Hasbro IP like My Little Pony, which has been reinvented under the eOne family brand's team leadership and is relaunching later this year. The eOne team will share more on our progress and plans at our event on February 25. 
2020 showcased how story and character executed via streaming platforms drives merchandise. Hasbro's Star Wars product revenues grew nearly 70% last year, despite it being a first year without a theatrical release since 2014. This growth was driven by the strength of the Disney+ global rollout of The Mandalorian. 
All regions grew versus prior year with the strongest growth in Europe, North America and Australia. The Child products were a significant driver of the business, including The Child animatronic edition, our signature holiday item and the #1 item in the plush category in North America and several other markets in the fourth quarter according to NPD. The success of this line helped Hasbro achieve the #1 position in the plush supercategory across the G11 for 2020. 
Even without The Child items, Hasbro Star Wars lines grew significantly behind increasing fan engagement globally in black series and the vintage collection, a reemergence of our kids business, fueled by light sabers and our new vehicle line mission fleet and a resurgence in casual pop culture fans in Star Wars overall. Hasbro's commercial and brand teams are executing meaningful global merchandise programs for streaming properties and supporting significant future partner brand initiatives, including with Disney+ for Star Wars, MARVEL and Disney Princess and Frozen as well as Hasbro-led streaming initiatives for our portfolio from children through adults. 
At the center of everything we did last year and in every year is our community of Hasbro employees and stakeholders. 2020 reminded us that living our purpose and values is imperative to continuing our legacy as a responsible corporate citizen. 
To drive this forward, we recently appointed Catherine Bellevue, a long-standing Hasbro leader in our CSR practice, as our first Chief Purpose Officer. I strongly believe Hasbro has both the opportunity and responsibility to lead as a corporate citizen across all aspects of our business. 
As we look to the coming year, we continue to see consumers and retailers turning to our categories and Hasbro. We have amazing new lines coupled with planned increases in theatrical, television and streaming entertainment to drive the business. Investments in innovation and new growth drivers, including digital gaming and entertainment, will come to market. We believe we will grow in 2021 as we continue navigating through COVID-19 while leveraging our unparalleled portfolio of brands and capabilities in consumer products, gaming and entertainment. 
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,700848106,2198039,"Hasbro, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2021",2021-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

The Hasbro team did amazing work in 2020, delivering a good year, prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and our communities while navigating retail and supply chain disruptions. The team never lost focus on strengthening an already solid balance sheet while managing the business for profit and cash generation in the near term and investing for future growth. 
On a full year revenue decline of 8%, operating profit declined only 1%, and operating profit margin increased 110 basis points to 15.1%. A strong fourth quarter aided this full year result as operating profit margin grew 480 basis points on 4% revenue growth in the final period of the year. 
I'm particularly proud of the work we did to manage working capital. Hasbro generated $976 million in operating cash flow last year, ending 2020 with $1.45 billion in cash. We paid part of our term loan earlier than anticipated and reduced $123 million of this long-term debt. We're progressing and paying down our debt and remain headed toward returning to our targeted 2 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA. 
We also returned $373 million in quarterly dividends during the year. Combined with today's notice of the May dividend payment, the Board has already declared the first 2 quarterly payments for this year. 
Throughout 2020, our treasury and commercial teams worked hand-in-hand, supporting global retailers as their businesses changed without warning. In some instances, to meet rising demand and others, to manage shutdowns. 
DSOs declined 17 days on a pro forma basis to 74, reflecting both strong collections and a geographic shift in customer base to those with shorter terms. Consumer demand and inventory management drove inventory down 11% with lower positions in all regions led by the U.S. 
Days sales and inventory were down 38 days year-over-year. Retail inventory at year-end was of good quality and level, increasing slightly in the U.S. as supply continued to improve, while declining in most of the markets. Importantly, retailers were well positioned to meet the strong uptick in demand this January in major markets like the U.S. and Europe. 
With live-action TV and film production limited, this activity returned during the third quarter. As a result, our full year 2020 cash spend on content was $439 million, slightly below the expected low end. As production has returned and we managed COVID-19 protocols to safely keep them up and running, our cash spend on content across scripted and unscripted live action, animated TV and film in 2021 is planned to be in the range of $675 million to $750 million. 
While managing a rapidly changing business environment, the Hasbro and eOne teams made significant progress toward both the business and financial goals of our integration. Brian spoke to much of the business progress, which contributed to approximately $30 million of cost savings. This is ahead of the plan we shared at Toy Fair last year and puts us well on our way to our goal of $130 million in synergies by the end of 2022. This is just the beginning of unlocking incremental revenue and profit from the acquisition as we further develop existing brands and launch new ones to extend the reach and value of our consumer products, gaming and entertainment initiatives. 
Looking at our performance, our fourth quarter revenue and operating profit growth is discussed in our earnings release and presentation today. I will focus my commentary on the full year 2020 and provide an outlook for certain items for 2021. 
In the U.S. and Canada segment, revenues grew 4%, and operating profit increased 30% or 420 basis points due to gains in Franchise Brands led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Hasbro Gaming. Operating profit increased on favorable product mix, partially offset by higher freight costs for increased domestic shipments in the U.S. and higher product development and other costs at Wizards of the Coast to support future game launches. At our investor event, Chris Cox will share more details about Wizards' plans in this area. 
International segment revenue and operating profit declined primarily due to declines in Latin America and Asia. European revenues were flat. Hasbro Gaming revenue increased as did MAGIC: THE GATHERING. The International segment operating profit declined as a result of lower revenues, partially offset by lower spending, most notably in advertising and marketing as well as lower royalties. 
As we discussed throughout the year, Latin America was challenging. The toy and game market declined. Retailers were closed. E-comm is underdeveloped, and we reduced our inventory at retail. This impacted 2020 revenue and margins, and we're now better positioned to stabilize the business and drive profit improvement this year. 
Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment revenue declined led by entertainment as compared to 2019, which included the Transformers Bumblebee film revenue as well as declines in licensed consumer products. Operating profit increased behind growth in higher-margin licensed digital gaming and cost savings. 
eOne segment revenue declined from pro forma 2019 due to both lower TV and film revenue from COVID-19-related live-action production and theater shutdowns as well as lower family brand revenue from retail disruption. Operating profit for the eOne segment decreased due to the decline in revenues, partially offset by lower advertising and royalty expense. 
For Hasbro overall, gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization, increased 140 basis points. Product mix, led by Wizards of the Coast and gaming, resulted in a slightly lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. This, combined with the reduction in program amortization, drove the improvement. 
To better help you understand the components of cost of sales, we included the 2020 breakdown in our earnings presentation today. The improvements were partially offset by additional markdowns in Latin America and Asia to reduce inventory levels at retail. 
For 2021, we anticipate cost of sales to decline as a percentage of revenue, but this is expected to be more than offset by a return to more normal levels of program amortization in the 9% to 10% range. Royalties were down slightly as a percentage of revenue, reflecting mix. 
We anticipate several theatrical launches, in addition to streaming content and innovation across our lines, to support our Partner Brand portfolio. But in 2021, it's expected to decrease slightly as a percentage of the total. 
Advertising in 2020 was lower than historical levels, reflecting both the decision to not advertise during periods when consumers were unable to shop and lower theatrical and entertainment events, which would traditionally have P&A support from eOne. In 2021, we anticipate more normal levels of activity and ad spend to be in the 8% to 9% of revenue range. 
Intangible amortization, excluding acquisition amortization for eOne, came in at the forecasted $47 million and is planned to decline to approximately $32 million in the coming year as certain property rights are now fully amortized. For 2020, SG&A totaled 22.8% of revenues, up from 21%. We took aggressive cost-saving actions, which lowered spending meaningfully. But this overall decline was offset by higher costs, in part resulting from the pandemic, namely in freight and bad debt as well as depreciation and investments at Wizards for gaming development. In 2021, some of the spending will return. 
SG&A dollars should increase but is expected to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue. We're closely watching the freight environment, which impacts both cost of sales and SG&A. We've been able to meet demand despite challenges in shipping and port congestion, but the cost of doing so is increasing and does not appear to be reversing at least in the -- not in the next few months. 
As we pay down debt, including the $300 million note due in May, interest expense should decline to approximately $188 million from $201 million. For 2020, our underlying tax rate, absent intangible amortization associated with the eOne acquisition, onetime charges and ordinary discrete items, is 21%. The fourth quarter underlying tax rate was 18%, which includes ordinary discrete tax benefits of roughly 6%. The discrete benefit in the quarter was primarily due to tax planning associated with the eOne integration and other ongoing planning. Based on currently enacted tax law, we expect our underlying tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 21%, excluding expected further integration charges and the amortization of the eOne acquisition intangible. 
As we look ahead, the last year has reinforced the core tenets of Hasbro's advantage: the value of brands in play, of connecting and competing through gaming, the enjoyment from watching and sharing a story and our desire to make everyone's life better in all that we do. The investments we made to drive these businesses in innovation; in digital gaming, talent and development; in our entertainment studio; in e-comm and our supply chain were instrumental in our ability to operate. 
We shared with you today a view to 2021, but it's important to recognize that we continue to operate through a pandemic, where things are at times unpredictable and don't develop as we expect. We have great confidence in our teams and our brands, our gaming launches and in our entertainment plan for the coming year to grow revenue and earnings. 
We're looking forward to sharing more about our long-term plans at our investor event on February 25. And Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

MARVEL has been a perennial strength in the portfolio. The teams have been working on major innovation in product. And yes, we will be taking advantage of and partnership with all the work Disney has done to put certain content on the streaming platform and Disney+. I hope you saw some of the trailers last night in the big game and then also the theatrical launches. 
What's really great is that we have hit a tipping point that we had believed would occur around this time, where enough people are watching a streamed show over a given period, where we're able to eventize that effort and then get our retailers on board for major merchandising, promotions and linear footage in store as well as actually, more importantly, the e-commerce play between content to commerce with short-form content, leading to purchases and all kinds of virtual feature shop. So yes, MARVEL has been a perennial strength. The business held up very well last year, although we didn't see growth, and we believe that we have the opportunity. 
If you look at a business like Star Wars, where we benefited from just stream content, it's been the business that's the size of a business back to a day when we have theatrical, and yet we have no theatrical and has grown substantially behind The Mandalorian. And it's not just The Child product. We have dozens of other products, [ 4 ], Black Series, the kids business is up, our vehicle business behind mission fleet is up. If we look at our own experience with Transformers and War for Cybertron, which is our animated series on Netflix dedicated to more of the older kid in the fan community, it's driven that business in a major way with Transformers results quite strong, POS good and really linking all of that to our e-comm and omnichannel effort. So yes, we have a major play this year, and we're very excited about the combination of stream content as well as film content."

On PEPPA and PJ, the teams have marketed and developed product lines. They worked hand in glove with the eOne team that have led to creative on PEPPA and PJ. We're in the nice season on PEPPA. It is the most watched YouTube show for preschoolers. We have the show distributed everywhere and new content coming that lines up really well with the product line. 
For PJ, we're in the fourth season we're already developing and we'll have this season and again, a really robust product line. Order of magnitude for both of those, Steph, we're probably looking at 50, 5-0 developed products for each PEPPA and PJ that will come in the fourth quarter. 
But it's really important to note there are a lot of categories that our licensees also create in that product line -- in those product lines that are really valuable and bring new play and play experiences to kids, consumers, fans all around the world. And so there'll continue to be licensees on those businesses. 
In fact, the combined consumer products team between eOne and Hasbro are building even more robust consumer products programs, given that Hasbro has much bigger global footprint than some of our core toy and game licensees have had over time. So we're really looking at this financially. We get the benefit of bringing in and in-housing major parts of, but not the entirety of the license business for PEPPA and PJ. We are then driving the retail connectivity to enable our consumer products licensees to do even a better job as we go around the world. 
We've seen those smaller license-type product shops with kids apparel and backpacks and back-to-school and bedding and footwear reopening because remember, not all of the product is just sold at the essential stores or hypermarkets or the omnichannel mass market stores in this category around the world. And so the reopening has also helped. 
Last point I make is over the fourth quarter, we've seen some great results for both brands and particularly for PJ. Coming out of the holiday, our licensees were able to work with more reopened stores. We've seen great takeaway for both brands, and PJ is coming out quite strongly, so is PEPPA. And we feel very good then about the financial opportunity over the years to build a very robust PJ and PEPPA business, but even more importantly, to have a much bigger foothold in a category where Hasbro didn't compete as broadly in preschool. And so the team is also working on -- we'll talk more about it, new properties and new IP that they will also launch using their immense expertise and storytelling. And Deb, you want to do the first one?"

Thanks, Brian. As we think about like the carryforward from what has been going on at eOne, as we know, animation could continue, and it was largely uninterrupted with maybe some hiccups as we first all went remote to try to get things up and running where they could. But animation has largely been able to continue. So you're actually seeing that in what we've been progressing to date so far. So it really is that live-action film and TV. 
And as we got into the end of the third quarter, we started to be able to get the production up and running in most markets. And that's why, indeed, we saw growth in Entertainment One in the fourth quarter. And we're on track to get that done. 
If we look at the full year content spend that we're projecting for 2021, just a very small percent of that relates to the 2020 carryover. But we expect to be able to finish and deliver that production in 2020. But we've gotten the question in the past, does that mean you're going to have to spend twice as much? A lot of it has moved forward, and a lot of it comes on during the year. A lot of it's unscripted. Brian talked about all the progress that's being made on other brands, but there's also progress being made on other production as well. So we do expect that we'll be able to finish that ongoing programming in 2021 and deliver it."

So -- and Brian, it's good -- that's a follow-up. So thanks for that. It was perfect from the last question because in the near term, when you think about just the entertainment component of what we've brought in, there is some pressure on profit because if you think about all the costs that we are incurring ourselves as businesses with COVID-19 protocols and everything else to keep people up and safe and do things the right way, there is some cost pressure in the near term. We see that profitability expanding over time. But in the near term, that is going to add some cost pressure. 
And as we get up and ready to launch in the latter half of the year our product around PJ and PEPPA, we've got a -- there's additional tooling expense and things like that, that ramp up. And we want to make it really successful as well as advertising around those brands now. They're such terrific brands as they are and that continued relationship we're having with licensees. 
So we see that profitability in the near term being impacted a bit by some of these initial costs, but over time, certainly growing into a range of what you'd expect to see on the toy and game and sourcing side from the more traditional Hasbro business of the past. And we see that entertainment profitability growing over time as well once we're able to incorporate some of these costs and as Brian said earlier, actually incorporate the Hasbro IP because that helps to make it even more profitable over time."

If you look at consumer products in that category, licensing and digital, our digital gaming business was up quite considerably during that period, digital gaming. Playing was up for global gamers over the year. As you know, it was a tailwind, and we're seeing a lot of new third-party games that are being quite successful. We also see some perennial games like YAHTZEE with Buddies! that continues to perform at a very high level from Scopely. So that's a category that has done quite well. 
We've talked about before that in consumer products, the closure of a lot of the smaller retailers over a period during 2020, where you are selling children's apparel or other types of children's products, clearly put a challenge against those revenues in the short term. But we're seeing those retailers reopening. And as I indicated in the fourth quarter, we're starting to see some momentum back into those businesses as well as in the toy business that are being sold there as well as at major mass market retailers. 
So consumer products, we believe, has an opportunity for growth as we go forward. As we add more Hasbro IP certainly in 2021, we are building an event around the new My Little Pony animated feature film, which we're all very excited about. And that should be a very robust program, both for Hasbro-developed product as well as consumer products. And we kind of march forward from -- we'll march forward from there.

We'll give some more color to that on the 25th at our Investor Day to try to size that out from everyone. 
But from a profitability standpoint, as Brian said, as those retailers that handle our license business come up and running, that's a fairly high profit margin business. And as they're able to get back on their feet and get back out there that and digital gaming, we see that impacting profitability favorably as we move forward."

So look, I think you saw some very robust growth from the toy industry in 2020. And I think that NPD and other sources are kind of reevaluating what they think growth should look like for 2021. There's been some more modest expectations present",510,"Sure. Yes. So look, I think you saw some very robust growth from the toy industry in 2020. And I think that NPD and other sources are kind of reevaluating what they think growth should look like for 2021. There's been some more modest expectations presented by some of the third parties. 
Our belief is that we should be able to grow in line or ahead of the toy industry numbers for the year 2021 for a number of reasons. We have great innovations. If I look at the way we finished the year where we had great product, we didn't have product rolled out everywhere. But if you take the U.S. business, for example, in the fourth quarter, it grew 16% with 30% growth in Franchise Brands. Every one of our Franchise Brands was up with the exception of My Little Pony, and we've already talked about how we're restating that this year. 
We saw double-digit growth for all our Franchise Brands except for Transformers. So we really exit the year in a major market where we had all the inventory, where NERF was growing and other brands were growing. 
We've entered 2021, Dave, and through January, our POS is up nearly 30%, 28%. And so again, it's not a holiday size sales, but it is that growth in POS. The consumer demand continues around games category and toy and game categories. Many of the categories that we're selling last year are selling again this year. 
At the tail end of last year, we were out of stock in certain games. I mean, we just couldn't keep Operation Pet Scan in stock. We couldn't keep The Child, the product in stock and some MONOPOLY products in stock. So we're again, getting back into inventory, but seeing very robust growth. 
And for that reason, because of our innovation, because of our e-comm capabilities and clearly seeing e-comm running way ahead of brick-and-mortar. I mean our e-comm POS in the full year last year was up 33%, and then the fourth quarter was up 19%. 
So brand for brand, I think we'll grow ahead of industry in toy and game. I think consumer products over time should grow faster as we mix shift into more Hasbro IP. The margin expands as we get more from Wizards of the Coast, and also as digital gaming goes beyond those early days where we do have depreciation and marketing expense. But launching those games, I expect to become more profitable over time. 
And then, of course, eOne is enabling us to create profitable entertainment versus where Hasbro was historically, where entertainment was somewhat of a marketing expense. And we viewed the sales of products as the reward for the investments in the entertainment. 
So I would say that's how the year we look at setting up. And really, think of it as 3 very clear business units, all with different profit and revenue profiles between consumer products with toy and game, our Wizards business with digital and our entertainment business obviously led by eOne."

I don't anticipate us being able to have that kind of a working capital benefit again in 2021.

But also, we're able to get things out there and get revenue from it as well. And we see that moving over time back to levels that we saw certainly in 2020. But in the near term, we expect our operating cash flow to be in the $600 million to $750 million range."

So the gross margin will look a bit different than it would if it was pure royalty revenue coming through, and we'll have some additional costs. 
In the near term, from a profitability standpoint, as we've invested in the start-up launch costs and start-up tooling and things like that, you're going to see profitability not be that far off, but not see that growth potential that it has in the future as we drive revenue growth in the brands.

So as we look at the business, Mike, there's a several-fold elements that we're really bringing to bear here. Number one, we're actually -- because we are behind these products now and we're developing bespoke Hasbro product lines that are expansive, as I mentioned, dozens of new items, very well received already by global retailers and an expectation of great distribution and support, our consumer products program will actually expand. We'll have some of our core licensees, who were doing certain parts of our toy business, expand into other categories that they are quite expert in. We'll have our other parts of our consumer products business expand as well as the geographic footprint. Now that we have a team that's married up between Hasbro experts and historical eOne experts and some new blood as well, I think we get a much more robust consumer products program. 
We're also seeing incredible new eOne content. As Deb mentioned, the animation had continued over the COVID period. We're able to produce animation at distance. And so you're going to see a lot of new content that is really, really engaging for our audience where the PEPPA PIG example is a top viewed show on almost every format, including YouTube. And they're bringing bespoke new content that ties directly to the play patterns that are being expressed in our products as well as our consumer products. 
And over time, beyond the holiday, this holiday period, we will have Hasbro products in the market for this holiday period as well as new consumer products that will come in for the fall. So both of those things happen. 
[indiscernible] considerable revenues as an opportunity. The opportunity, of course, is to go beyond that a few fold and then several fold. And really, one of the pieces of opportunity that we saw from the very beginning as we began to talk to eOne was a growth in preschool, particularly around character and story and Hasbro's opportunity to be a major player in the preschool arena around great storytelling, great character and great innovation tied altogether. And we're seeing that. 
And then in addition, eOne has also been fully in development and has great support for some new IP that I won't talk about now, let them talk about later, where we'll have new IP from these storytellers in the preschool and lifestyle space. And that should grow our presence across the dimensions I've just discussed as we go forward."

I think that it had a bit to do if I read some of the macro experts talking on the economic side, the consumer waiting to see if there were some additional checks and support that was going to be coming during that period of time. We saw, frankly, a dwindling down of some inventories around some of our brands during that time for a few of our key games like I talked about The Child products and MONOPOLY and also in Bop It!, Operation and some other brands where our fill rates did fall during those couple of weeks as we were really right ahead of Christmas. 
And on NERF, we've seen great growth in NERF. NERF was up in the U.S., and NERF was up on the fourth quarter and for the full year in the U.S. But we didn't have enough products to make NERF grow everywhere. We expect NERF to grow in 2021 because we see the compilation of all of the NERF initiatives. But again, I just think there were a few places where we had a bit of tempering a little bit from the consumer and then a little bit on a few of our product categories, not a lot, but a few. 
Then if you take the comp during that time, most importantly, the comp during that time, our POS is slightly down if you exclude Frozen. Remember, a year ago, we told you, Frozen was the largest headwind for the fourth quarter for Hasbro, up against an incredible success in 2019. If you took Frozen out, our POS actually goes up to mid-single digits in growth globally during the fourth quarter. So that's just, again, in that period of time. So that's why we just described that. 
Then what happened is Christmas week was very strong. Weeks following Christmas have been incredibly strong. And in January, we're actually seeing an acceleration. I think as people get gift cards and as people who weren't together for the holidays, it's presents and other gifting, gift cards and other formats, we're just seeing an immense amount of consumption of Hasbro brands and products, lots of strong launches coming as we move our way through the first quarter. So that's why I say it's a broader, longer holiday season. And clearly given COVID and openings and closures, just it demands some additional description."

I mean, like Brian mentioned earlier, we were able to fully integrate our consumer products licensing teams. However, there's still some other groups that we haven't been able to fully integrate yet. We're working on -- We just -- it was not in our original timing. But 2/3 of that was actually coming from product in-sourcing. So that timing hasn't really changed yet. We're beginning to in-source that product for this fall for this holiday season.

Well, look, we've said all along that we thought we were entering an era that would be right for opportunity for us as we came together with eOne, and we're seeing that. Clearly, as many studios have also launched their streaming platforms, they need great content, and they're using their own brands and IP to service their own streaming platforms, which leads a lot of world-class streamers and other platforms open for business and looking for world-class IP from people like -- or companies like Hasbro. 
And eOne is expert at developing IP for a global group of broadcasters, streamers, linear and terrestrial. So we see a real opportunity. It marries directly to the fact that we have the broadest portfolio in our business. We have brands that stretch from kids and fans and families, certainly, but we also have brands that stretch into great adult gaming and lifestyle gaming. 
So we're busy developing DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS across a number of dimensions. We'll have future iterations of Transformers in a number of different places. We have new creative stewardship that will add [indiscernible] great new storytelling in Power Rangers and several other big Hasbro IP areas. I'm going to let the team talk more about that later this month. 
But we see the opportunity to go through multiple windows. We still see the opportunity to have a theatrical followed by a stream window or a simultaneous window between streaming and a theatrical -- a shorter theatrical window. I think a lot of the nomenclature and conversation around all of those windows are shifting and changing as we speak. And our team is expert at ensuring that around the world, we'll get the opportunity to eventize our properties and programming with streamers and theatrically and then move through the waterfall of opportunities and windows so that we're able to maximize the return on the entertainment investment while also driving ubiquity for the story and character and the play patterns that will be reflected in the consumer products and the gaming that we're executing in support of those initiatives."

Some things may get delayed depending on what's happening on the set, but everything is up and running now. 
One of the things that's really important to remember, I'm glad you asked about cadence, because you think about before the world changed in March of last year, we actually had a great hit in 1917 from eOne. So that really drove a big impact to the first quarter of last year when you kind of think about the theatrical still being open. 
So now as we look at the cadence, we see it progressing throughout the year? And as you know, I know, Devin, the entertainment and revenue recognition could be a little -- I use my favorite accounting term, Brian [indiscernible] me when I say this, but a little lumpier than what you might see in a traditional [indiscernible] business. But we just look at the fourth quarter when eOne was able to get up and get into production and have those deliveries being made, they were able to grow revenue. 
So we see that with an impact in the near term because of something like 1917 in theatrical distribution. But as Brian said, we're excited about being able to take advantage of theatrical as well as streaming by providing this great content over time."

Having said that, we're working in partnership with our partners at Disney. They're actively looking at all the windowing. I think you've started to see, like last night, hopefully, on the football game. You saw the trailer for Raya and the Last Dragon, I think it was great, and we're very excited about that. In May, movie, Black Widow we'll be supporting. Ghostbusters comes in June. We've got Venom later in June. [ Chengxi ] is right now scheduled for July. We've got our own My Little Pony movie coming in the September window. Snake Eyes is slated for October, and then you have Eternals and Spider-Man that will be in the fourth quarter. 
And the team is actively working on a regular basis. Some of those may be more shorter theatrical windows. We talked about the fact that, that works, particularly work on a premeditated basis where the strategy can be put out up in front, and we can work with our retailers. And then, Gerrick, I'll also mentioned that there's a lot of streaming content that will be coming -- that we also feel has a great opportunity, particularly we were talking earlier, just about the robust nature of the MARVEL brands and business. 
And so Raya is also a stream piece of content that will come in March, WandaVision, the Falcon and the Winter soldier, that was a great trailer. And then you have a couple of different new Star Wars initiatives coming from streaming in the back half of 2021. So the team is around all of that. They have been building great innovative products for full exploitation there as well as for Hasbro IP like My Little Pony and for Snake Eyes. And we just constantly are working in partnership with our studio brethren to ensure that we understand the way they want to execute their programs. 
And frankly, we're doing the exact same thing with My Little Pony and with Snake Eyes. We want to make sure we're maximizing the opportunity, given where we believe audiences will be at that point in the year.

The Hasbro team met the distinct and unique challenges of 2020 with tremendous resilience and excellence. They leveraged the breadth of our portfolio, the global footprint of our business and the diverse and amazing talent in our company to lead our organization through the year.  
I cannot say enough about the quality of the people that I have the honor to work with every day. As consumers of all ages found themselves at home, they sought ways to connect and find joy. Hasbro is uniquely qualified to meet this need for every demographic. Our brands, toys, games and content are valuable as they bring happiness and enjoyment to so many in this unprecedented global environment.  
After a very challenging June quarter, our performance improved in the second half of the year. Throughout the year, we advanced our commercial and retailer programs and supply chain capabilities to meet consumer demand while managing expenses and cash.  
We grew Hasbro's operating profit margin and finished the year with $1.45 billion in cash on our balance sheet. We finished 2020 with growth in revenues and adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter despite a tough comparison with the successful theatrical releases a year ago.  
The 2020 holiday season was extended, starting earlier with strong consumer demand in October and November but seeing some challenges for key weeks in December. The period then ended with strong point-of-sale growth, and this momentum has continued and accelerated into January.  
The comparison with Frozen was extremely challenging due to our success in December 2019. If we exclude Frozen from the data, Hasbro's POS grew 4% for the fourth quarter across the G11. We also gained share and recorded the fastest point-of-sale growth on Amazon in the toy and game market in the U.S. and top European markets during the fourth quarter.  
For the full year, we delivered $1.8 billion in gaming revenue, an increase of 15%. Franchise Brands, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY each had their best year ever. Dungeons & Dragons did as well, and classic games like JENGA, Operation and CONNECT 4, to name a few of many, had stellar years. Our gaming business grew in all regions but Latin America. The result reflects the ability of our supply chain, marketing and commercial teams to pivot and meet the demand of consumers as they change their behaviors at pace. 
Gaming has long been a priority investment category for Hasbro. Our brands and our teams lead this market, and we have clear growth plans in both face-to-face and digital gaming for the coming years. You'll hear more from Chris Cox, President of Wizards of the Coast; and Eric Nyman, Chief Consumer Officer, at our virtual investor event on February 25.  
To meet the high consumer demand in gaming and other categories, we leveraged our global retail network and investments in new channels. By year-end, the team drove more than $1 billion in e-comm revenues and a 43% increase from last year and representing just under 30% of our global revenues. This translated to close to a 10 percentage point increase. Pure-play and omnichannel retailers led this growth, and omnichannel made significant strides to double their e-comm revenue for the year.  
Our teams work closely with retailers to expand their online offerings as many added click and collect to their capabilities during the year. With channel support and innovative tailored product, Hasbro also grew revenues with the fan channel last year. We augmented this with our own D2C capabilities, leveraging Hasbro Pulse to create authentic fan experiences. While Pulse is a small but growing piece of our revenue today, it is a unique experience that we're leveraging for continued growth and unmatched connections with the important fan community.  
In addition to our global retail network, our global supply chain capabilities and our evolving geographic manufacturing supplier base were essential to meeting demand. Due to COVID and changing consumer behaviors, we had disruptions from production to logistics, but the team worked tirelessly to meet the demand and successfully execute the year.  
We added new e-comm capabilities and identified opportunities to further enhance these going forward. We continued to diversify our manufacturing, reducing our reliance on any one country, ending 2020 with approximately 55% of production in China.  
To support new brand development and deeper brand engagement, we onboarded the eOne team and their expansive capabilities and brands in storytelling. While live-action TV and film production were limited much of the year, we made substantial progress developing Hasbro IP for entertainment that we expect will lead to enhanced revenues and earnings power across multiple income streams.  
After returning to live-action production in the third quarter, eOne revenues and profit increased versus 2019 for the last quarter of the year as deliveries resume to our broadcast partners. Over the course of 2020, we completed production on 59 series across scripted and unscripted television and 5 feature films.  
With COVID-19 protocols in place, production continues around the world. While the near-term theatrical landscape remains uncertain, we see a path to its return and the opportunities in streaming and linear, now and into the future, are clear and compelling for both viewership and merchandise.  
The combination of Hasbro's portfolio and eOne's expertise is unlocking opportunity to expand our brands and launch new ones. This takes time and investment, but we have established a robust and deep slate and a road map to drive growth in our business for years to come.  
Our teams are also on track to launch Hasbro-developed, -marketed and -distributed toy and game lines for the leading preschool brands, PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS later this year. To further support our portfolio, we have fully integrated our consumer products organizations to drive immersive brand experiences across categories With Hasbro's global retailer reach and brand category expertise as well as retailers in the licensed consumer products space reopening and operating, we are expanding these brands.  
This is further enhanced by Hasbro IP like My Little Pony, which has been reinvented under the eOne family brand's team leadership and is relaunching later this year. The eOne team will share more on our progress and plans at our event on February 25.  
2020 showcased how story and character executed via streaming platforms drives merchandise. Hasbro's Star Wars product revenues grew nearly 70% last year, despite it being a first year without a theatrical release since 2014. This growth was driven by the strength of the Disney+ global rollout of The Mandalorian.  
All regions grew versus prior year with the strongest growth in Europe, North America and Australia. The Child products were a significant driver of the business, including The Child Animatronic Edition, our signature holiday item and the #1 item in the plush category in North America and several other markets in the fourth quarter according to NPD. The success of this line helped Hasbro achieve the #1 position in the plush super category across the G11 for 2020.  
Even without The Child items, Hasbro's Star Wars lines grew significantly behind increasing fan engagement globally in Black Series and The Vintage Collection, a reemergence of our kids business fueled by lightsabers and our new vehicle line, Mission Fleet, and a resurgence in casual pop culture fans in Star Wars overall. Hasbro's commercial and brand teams are executing meaningful global merchandise programs for streaming properties and supporting significant future partner brand initiatives, including with Disney+ for Star Wars, Marvel and Disney Princess and Frozen as well as Hasbro-led streaming initiatives for our portfolio from children through adults. 
At the center of everything we did last year and in every year is our community of Hasbro employees and stakeholders. 2020 reminded us that living our purpose and values is imperative to continuing our legacy as a responsible corporate citizen. To drive this forward, we recently appointed Kathrin Belliveau, a long-standing Hasbro leader in our CSR practice, as our first Chief Purpose Officer. I strongly believe Hasbro has both the opportunity and responsibility to lead as a corporate citizen across all aspects of our business.  
As we look to the coming year, we continue to see consumers and retailers turning to our categories and Hasbro. We have amazing new lines coupled with planned increases in theatrical, television and streaming entertainment to drive the business. Investments in innovation and new growth drivers, including digital gaming and entertainment, will come to market. We believe we will grow in 2021 as we continue navigating through COVID-19 while leveraging our unparalleled portfolio of brands and capabilities in consumer products, gaming and entertainment.  
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"

The Hasbro team did amazing work in 2020, delivering a good year, prioritizing the health and safety of our employees and our communities while navigating retail and supply chain disruptions. The team never lost focus on strengthening an already solid balance sheet while managing the business for profit and cash generation in the near term and investing for future growth.  
On a full year revenue decline of 8%, operating profit declined only 1%, and operating profit margin increased 110 basis points to 15.1%. A strong fourth quarter aided this full year result as operating profit margin grew 480 basis points on 4% revenue growth in the final period of the year.  
I'm particularly proud of the work we did to manage working capital. Hasbro generated $976 million in operating cash flow last year, ending 2020 with $1.45 billion in cash. We paid part of our term loan earlier than anticipated and reduced $123 million of this long-term debt. We're progressing and paying down our debt and remain headed toward returning to our targeted 2 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA. We also returned $373 million in quarterly dividends during the year. Combined with today's notice of the May dividend payment, the Board has already declared the first 2 quarterly payments for this year.  
Throughout 2020, our treasury and commercial teams worked hand-in-hand, supporting global retailers as their businesses changed without warning. In some instances, to meet rising demand and others, to manage shutdowns.  
DSOs declined 17 days on a pro forma basis to 74, reflecting both strong collections and a geographic shift in customer base to those with shorter terms. Consumer demand and inventory management drove inventory down 11% with lower positions in all regions led by the U.S.  
Days sales and inventory were down 38 days year-over-year. Retail inventory at year-end was of good quality and level, increasing slightly in the U.S. as supply continued to improve, while declining in most other markets. Importantly, retailers were well positioned to meet the strong uptick in demand this January in major markets like the U.S. and Europe.  
With live-action TV and film production limited, this activity returned during the third quarter. As a result, our full year 2020 cash spend on content was $439 million, slightly below the expected low end. As production has returned and we managed COVID-19 protocols to safely keep them up and running, our cash spend on content across scripted and unscripted live action, animated TV and film in 2021 is planned to be in the range of $675 million to $750 million.  
While managing a rapidly changing business environment, the Hasbro and eOne teams made significant progress toward both the business and financial goals of our integration. Brian spoke to much of the business progress, which contributed to approximately $30 million of cost savings. This is ahead of the plan we shared at Toy Fair last year and puts us well on our way to our goal of $130 million in synergies by the end of 2022. This is just the beginning of unlocking incremental revenue and profit from the acquisition as we further develop existing brands and launch new ones to extend the reach and value of our consumer products, gaming and entertainment initiatives.  
Looking at our performance, our fourth quarter revenue and operating profit growth is discussed in our earnings release and presentation today. I will focus my commentary on the full year 2020 and provide an outlook for certain items for 2021.  
In the U.S. and Canada segment, revenues grew 4%, and operating profit increased 30% or 420 basis points due to gains in Franchise Brands led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Hasbro Gaming. Operating profit increased on favorable product mix, partially offset by higher freight costs for increased domestic shipments in the U.S. and higher product development and other costs at Wizards of the Coast to support future game launches. At our investor event, Chris Cox will share more details about Wizards' plans in this area.  
International segment revenue and operating profit declined primarily due to declines in Latin America and Asia. European revenues were flat. Hasbro Gaming revenue increased as did MAGIC: THE GATHERING. The International segment operating profit declined as a result of lower revenues, partially offset by lower spending, most notably in advertising and marketing as well as lower royalties.  
As we discussed throughout the year, Latin America was challenging. The toy and game market declined, retailers were closed, e-comm is underdeveloped, and we reduced our inventory at retail. This impacted 2020 revenue and margins, and we're now better positioned to stabilize the business and drive profit improvement this year.  
Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment revenue declined led by entertainment as compared to 2019, which included the Transformers Bumblebee film revenue as well as declines in licensed consumer products. Operating profit increased behind growth in higher-margin licensed digital gaming and cost savings.  
eOne segment revenue declined from pro forma 2019 due to both lower TV and film revenue from COVID-19-related live-action production and theater shutdowns as well as lower family brand revenue from retail disruption. Operating profit for the eOne segment decreased due to the decline in revenues, partially offset by lower advertising and royalty expense.  
For Hasbro overall, gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization, increased 140 basis points. Product mix, led by Wizards of the Coast and gaming, resulted in a slightly lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. This, combined with the reduction in program amortization, drove the improvement.  
To better help you understand the components of cost of sales, we included the 2020 breakdown in our earnings presentation today. The improvements were partially offset by additional markdowns in Latin America and Asia to reduce inventory levels at retail.  
For 2021, we anticipate cost of sales to decline as a percentage of revenue, but this is expected to be more than offset by a return to more normal levels of program amortization in the 9% to 10% range. Royalties were down slightly as a percentage of revenue, reflecting mix.  
We anticipate several theatrical launches, in addition to streaming content and innovation across our lines, to support our Partner Brand portfolio. But in 2021, it's expected to decrease slightly as a percentage of the total.  
Advertising in 2020 was lower than historical levels, reflecting both the decision to not advertise during periods when consumers were unable to shop and lower theatrical and entertainment events, which would traditionally have P&A support from eOne. In 2021, we anticipate more normal levels of activity and ad spend to be in the 8% to 9% of revenue range.  
Intangible amortization, excluding acquisition amortization for eOne, came in at the forecasted $47 million and is planned to decline to approximately $32 million in the coming year as certain property rights are now fully amortized. For 2020, SD&A totaled 22.8% of revenues, up from 21%. We took aggressive cost-saving actions, which lowered spending meaningfully. But this overall decline was offset by higher costs, in part resulting from the pandemic, namely in freight and bad debt as well as depreciation and investments at Wizards for gaming development. In 2021, some of the spending will return.  
SD&A dollars should increase but is expected to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue. We're closely watching the freight environment, which impacts both cost of sales and SD&A. We've been able to meet demand despite challenges in shipping and port congestion, but the cost of doing so is increasing and does not appear to be reversing at least in the -- not in the next few months.  
As we pay down debt, including the $300 million note due in May, interest expense should decline to approximately $188 million from $201 million. For 2020, our underlying tax rate, absent intangible amortization associated with the eOne acquisition, onetime charges and ordinary discrete items, is 21%. 
The fourth quarter underlying tax rate was 18%, which includes ordinary discrete tax benefits of roughly 6%. The discrete benefit in the quarter was primarily due to tax planning associated with the eOne integration and other ongoing planning. Based on currently enacted tax law, we expect our underlying tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 21%, excluding expected further integration charges and the amortization of the eOne acquisition intangible.  
As we look ahead, the last year has reinforced the core tenets of Hasbro's advantage: the value of brands in play; of connecting and competing through gaming; the enjoyment from watching and sharing a story; and our desire to make everyone's life better in all that we do. The investments we made to drive these businesses in innovation; in digital gaming; talent and development; in our entertainment studio; in e-comm; and our supply chain, were instrumental in our ability to operate.  
We shared with you today a view to 2021, but it's important to recognize that we continue to operate through a pandemic, where things are at times unpredictable and don't develop as we expect. We have great confidence in our teams and our brands, our gaming launches and in our entertainment plan for the coming year to grow revenue and earnings.
We're looking forward to sharing more about our long-term plans at our investor event on February 25. And Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

Marvel has been a perennial strength in the portfolio. The teams have been working on major innovation in product. And yes, we will be taking advantage of, in partnership with all the work Disney has done to put certain content on the streaming platform, on Disney+. I hope you saw some of the trailers last night in the big game and then also the theatrical launches.  
What's really great is that we have hit a tipping point that we had believed would occur around this time, where enough people are watching a streamed show over a given period, where we're able to eventize that effort and then get our retailers on board for major merchandising, promotions and linear footage in store as well as -- actually, more importantly, the e-commerce play between content to commerce with short-form content, leading to purchases and all kinds of virtual feature shops. So yes, Marvel has been a perennial strength. The business held up very well last year, although we didn't see growth, and we believe that we have the opportunity.  
If you look at a business like Star Wars, where we benefited from just stream content, it's been the business that's the size of a business back to a day when we had theatrical, and yet we have no theatrical and has grown substantially behind The Mandalorian. And it's not just The Child product. We have dozens of other products, 4, Black Series, the kids business is up, our vehicle business behind Mission Fleet is up. If we look at our own experience with Transformers and War for Cybertron, which is our animated series on Netflix dedicated to more of the older kid in the fan community, it's driven that business in a major way with Transformers results quite strong, POS good and really linking all of that to our e-comm and omnichannel effort. 
So yes, we have a major play this year, and we're very excited about the combination of stream content as well as film content."

On PEPPA and PJ, the teams have marketed and developed product lines. They've worked hand in glove with the eOne team that have led the creative on PEPPA and PJ. We're on the 9th season on PEPPA. It is the most watched YouTube show for preschoolers. We have the show distributed everywhere and new content coming that lines up really well with the product line.  
For PJ, we're in the fourth season. We're already developing and we'll have the 5th season. And again, a really robust product line. Order of magnitude for both of those, Steph. We're probably looking at 50, 5-0 developed products for each PEPPA and PJ that will come in the fourth quarter. But it's really important to note there are a lot of categories that our licensees also create in that product line -- in those product lines that are really valuable and bring new play and play experiences to kids, consumers, fans all around the world. 
And so there'll continue to be licensees on those businesses. In fact, the combined consumer products team between eOne and Hasbro are building even more robust consumer products programs, given that Hasbro has much bigger global footprint than some of our core toy and game licensees have had over time. 
So we're really looking at this financially. We get the benefit of bringing in and in-housing major parts of, but not the entirety of the license business for PEPPA and PJ. We are then driving the retail connectivity to enable our consumer products licensees to do even a better job as we go around the world. We've seen those smaller license-type product shops with kids apparel and backpacks and back-to-school and bedding and footwear reopening. Because remember, not all of the product is just sold at the essential stores or hypermarkets or the omnichannel mass market stores in this category around the world. And so the reopening has also helped. 
Last point I make is over the fourth quarter, we've seen some great results for both brands and particularly for PJ. Coming out of the holiday, our licensees were able to work with more reopened stores. We've seen great takeaway for both brands, and PJ is coming out quite strongly, so is PEPPA. And we feel very good then about the financial opportunity over the years to build a very robust PJ and PEPPA business, but even more importantly, to have a much bigger foothold in a category where Hasbro didn't compete as broadly in preschool. 
And so the team is also working on -- we'll talk more about it, new properties and new IP that they will also launch using their immense expertise in storytelling. And Deb, you want to do the first one?"

Thanks, Brian. As we think about like the carryforward from what has been going on at eOne, as we know, animation could continue, and it was largely uninterrupted with maybe some hiccups as we first all went remote to try to get things up and running where they could. But animation has largely been able to continue. So you're actually seeing that in what we've been progressing to date so far. So it really is that live-action film and TV.
And as we got into the end of the third quarter, we started to be able to get the production up and running in most markets. And that's why, indeed, we saw growth in Entertainment One in the fourth quarter. And we're on track to get that done.  
If we look at the full year content spend that we're projecting for 2021, just a very small percent of that relates to the 2020 carryover. But we expect to be able to finish and deliver that production in 2020. But we've gotten the question in the past, does that mean you're going to have to spend twice as much? A lot of it has moved forward, and a lot of it comes on during the year. A lot of it is unscripted.

So we see that profitability in the near term being impacted a bit by some of these initial costs, but over time, certainly growing into a range of what you'd expect to see on the toy and game and sourcing side from the more traditional Hasbro business of the past. And we see that entertainment profitability growing over time as well once we're able to incorporate some of these costs and as Brian said earlier, actually incorporate the Hasbro IP because that helps to make it even more profitable over time."

If you look at consumer products in that category, licensing and digital, our digital gaming business was up quite considerably during that period, digital gaming. Playing was up for global gamers over the year. As you know, it was a tailwind, and we're seeing a lot of new third-party games that are being quite successful. We also see some perennial games like YAHTZEE with Buddies! that continues to perform at a very high level from Scopely. So that's a category that has done quite well. 
We've talked about before that in consumer products, the closure of a lot of the smaller retailers over a period during 2020, where you were selling children's apparel or other types of children's products, clearly put a challenge against those revenues in the short term. But we're seeing those retailers reopening. And as I indicated in the fourth quarter, we're starting to see some momentum back into those businesses as well as in the toy business that are being sold there as well as at major mass market retailers. 
So consumer products, we believe, has an opportunity for growth as we go forward. As we add more Hasbro IP certainly in 2021, we are building an event around the new My Little Pony animated feature film, which we're all very excited about. And that should be a very robust program, both for Hasbro-developed product as well as consumer products. And we kind of march forward from -- we'll march forward from there.

The only other thing I would add is, as you think about the digital games coming out under Wizards of the Coast brand, so we've had Arena in the past, and Brian mentioned earlier, we've got a few games launching this year, a few digital gaming launches this year, those carry a bit of initial depreciation around them that we wouldn't have seen as much of that this year because we've been working on it. We capitalize those costs. We'll give some more color to that on the 25th at our Investor Day to try to size that out from everyone. 
But from a profitability standpoint, as Brian said, as those retailers that handle our license business come up and running, that's a fairly high profit margin business. And as they're able to get back on their feet and get back out there, that and digital gaming, we see that impacting profitability favorably as we move forward."

So look, I think you saw some very robust growth from the toy industry in 2020. And I think that NPD and other sources are kind of reevaluating what they think growth should look like for 2021.

And I think that NPD and other sources are kind of reevaluating what they think growth should look like for 2021. There's been some more modest expectations presented by some of the third parties. 
Our belief is that we should be able to grow in line or ahead of the toy industry numbers for the year 2021 for a number of reasons. We have great innovations. If I look at the way we finished the year where we had great product, we didn't have product rolled out everywhere. But if you take the U.S. business, for example, in the fourth quarter, it grew 16% with 30% growth in Franchise Brands. Every one of our Franchise Brands was up with the exception of My Little Pony, and we've already talked about how we're restaging that this year. We saw double-digit growth for all our Franchise Brands except for Transformers. So we really exit the year in a major market where we had all the inventory, where NERF was growing and other brands were growing. 
We've entered 2021, Dave, and through January, our POS is up nearly 30%, 28%. And so again, it's not a holiday-size sales, but it is that growth in POS. The consumer demand continues around games category and toy and game categories. Many of the categories that were selling last year are selling again this year. At the tail end of last year, we were out of stock in certain games. I mean, we just couldn't keep Operation Pet Scan in stock. We couldn't keep The Child, the Bop It! product in stock and some MONOPOLY products in stock. So we're again, getting back into inventory, but seeing very robust growth. 
And for that reason, because of our innovation, because of our e-comm capabilities and clearly seeing e-comm running way ahead of brick-and-mortar, I mean, our e-comm POS in the full year last year was up 33%, and then the fourth quarter was up 19%. So brand for brand, I think we'll grow ahead of industry in toy and game. I think consumer products over time should grow faster as we mix shift into more Hasbro IP. The margin expands as we get more from Wizards of the Coast, and also as digital gaming goes beyond those early days where we do have depreciation and marketing expense for launching those games, they expect to become more profitable over time. 
And then, of course, eOne is enabling us to create profitable entertainment versus where Hasbro was historically, where entertainment was somewhat of a marketing expense and we viewed the sales of products as the reward for the investments in the entertainment. 
So I would say that's how in the year, we look at setting up. And really, think of it as 3 very clear business units, all with different profit and revenue profiles between consumer products with toy and game, our Wizards business with digital and our entertainment business obviously led by eOne."

I don't anticipate us being able to have that kind of a working capital benefit again in 2021. But as we see each piece of our business performing, we do expect that our operating cash flow can average about $600 million to $750 million in the near term, falling someplace within that range as we are investing more in launch costs than investing a bit more in content than what we talked about in the past. 
But also, we're able to get things out there and get revenue from it as well. And we see that moving over time back to levels that we saw certainly in 2020. But in the near term, we expect our operating cash flow to be in the $600 million to $750 million range."

So you're 100% correct, you would have seen that coming in as royalty revenue in the past. There will be some costs against that, but mostly it would flow through and impact the gross margin. 
When you see it coming into the Hasbro revenue, it will come in like wholesale revenue like the rest of our business, and we'll have additional cost of sales applied against it. So the gross margin will look a bit different than it would if it was pure royalty revenue coming through, and will have some additional costs. 
In the near term, from a profitability standpoint, as we've invested in the start-up launch costs and start-up tooling and things like that, you're going to see profitability not be that far off, but not see that growth potential that it has in the future as we drive revenue growth in the brands.

So as we look at the business, Mike, there's several-fold elements that we're really bringing to bear here. Number one, we're actually -- because we are behind these products now and we're developing bespoke Hasbro product lines that are expansive, as I mentioned, dozens of new items, very well received already by global retailers and an expectation of great distribution and support, our consumer products program will actually expand. We'll have some of our core licensees, who were doing certain parts of our toy business, expand into other categories that they are quite expert in. We'll have our other parts of our consumer products business expand as well as the geographic footprint. Now that we have a team that's married up between the Hasbro experts and the historical eOne experts and some new blood as well, I think we get a much more robust consumer products program. 
We're also seeing incredible new eOne content. As Deb mentioned, the animation had continued over the COVID period. We're able to produce animation at distance. And so you're going to see a lot of new content that is really, really engaging for our audience where the PEPPA PIG example is a top viewed show on almost every format, including YouTube. And they're bringing bespoke new content that ties directly to the play patterns that are being expressed in our products as well as our consumer products. 
And over time, beyond the holiday, this holiday period, we will have Hasbro products in the market for this holiday period as well as new consumer products that will come in for the fall. So both of those things happen. 
To land considerable revenues as an opportunity, the opportunity, of course, is to go beyond that a few fold and then several fold. And really, one of the pieces of opportunity that we saw from the very beginning as we began to talk to eOne was a growth in preschool, particularly around character and story and Hasbro's opportunity to be a major player in the preschool arena around great storytelling, great character and great innovation tied altogether. And we're seeing that. 
And then in addition, eOne has also been fully in development and has great support for some new IP that I won't talk about now, let them talk about later, where we'll have new IP from these storytellers in the preschool and lifestyle space. And that should grow our presence across the dimensions I've just discussed as we go forward."

Really, it was just an interesting observation. As we look at the holiday, we've probably had a more intense longer holiday than we've had in prior years because, of course, the holiday kicked off in October as we all discussed around third quarter earnings. And there was a ton of promotion and lots of toy orientation, toy and game orientation during that time. And our POS was incredibly strong in October, November and even into December. 
As we got into just 2 weeks right before December, and I've seen this expressed in other consumer products categories as well, there was a bit of a pause that we saw in some of our businesses. I think that it had a bit to do, if I read some of the macro experts talking on the economic side, the consumer waiting to see if there were some additional checks and support that was going to be coming during that period of time. We saw, frankly, a dwindling down of some inventories around some of our brands during that time for a few of our key games, like I talked about The Child products and MONOPOLY and also in Bop It!, Operation and some other brands where our fill rates did fall during those couple of weeks as we were really right ahead of Christmas. 
And on NERF, we've seen great growth in NERF. NERF was up in the U.S., and NERF was up on the fourth quarter and for the full year in the U.S. But we didn't have enough products to make NERF grow everywhere. We expect NERF to grow in 2021 because we see the compilation of all of the NERF initiatives. But again, I just think there were a few places where we had a bit of tempering, a little bit from the consumer and then a little bit on a few of our product categories. Not a lot, but a few.
Then if you take the comp during that time, most importantly, the comp during that time, our POS was slightly down if you exclude Frozen. Remember, a year ago, we told you, Frozen was the largest headwind for the fourth quarter for Hasbro, up against an incredible success in 2019. If you took Frozen out, our POS actually goes up to mid-single digits in growth globally during the fourth quarter. So that's just, again, in that period of time. So that's why we just described that. 
Then what happened is Christmas week was very strong. Weeks following Christmas have been incredibly strong. And in January, we're actually seeing an acceleration. I think as people get gift cards and as people who weren't together for the holidays had sent presents and other gifting, gift cards and other formats, we're just seeing an immense amount of consumption of Hasbro brands and products, lots of strong launches coming as we move our way through the first quarter. 
So that's why I say it's a broader, longer holiday season. And clearly given COVID and openings and closures, it just -- it demands some additional description."

However, there's still some other groups that we haven't been able to fully integrate yet. We're working on -- we just -- it was not in our original timing. But 2/3 of that was actually coming from product in-sourcing, so that timing hasn't really changed yet. We're beginning to in-source that product for this fall for this holiday season. So we'll have a better insight to whether to grow that number or not as we progress through 2021, but it was a bit of an acceleration."

Well, look, we've said all along that we thought we were entering an era that would be ripe for opportunity for us as we came together with eOne, and we're seeing that. Clearly, as many studios have also launched their streaming platforms, they need great content, and they're using their own brands and IP to service their own streaming platforms, which leads a lot of world-class streamers and other platforms open for business and looking for world-class IP from people like -- or companies like Hasbro. 
And eOne is expert at developing IP for a global group of broadcasters, streamers, linear and terrestrial. So we see a real opportunity. It marries directly to the fact that we have the broadest portfolio in our business. We have brands that stretch from kids and fans and families, certainly, but we also have brands that stretch into great adult gaming and lifestyle gaming. 
So we're busy developing Dungeons & Dragons across a number of dimensions. We'll have future iterations of Transformers in a number of different places. We have new creative stewardship that will add heft and great, new storytelling in Power Rangers and several other big Hasbro IP areas. I'm going to let the team talk more about that later this month. 
But we see the opportunity to go through multiple windows. We still see the opportunity to have a theatrical followed by a stream window or a simultaneous window between streaming and a theatrical -- a shorter theatrical window. I think a lot of the nomenclature and conversation around all of those windows are shifting and changing as we speak. 
And our team is expert at ensuring that around the world, we'll get the opportunity to eventize our properties and programming with streamers and theatrically, and then move through the waterfall of opportunities and windows so that we're able to maximize the return on the entertainment investment while also driving ubiquity for the story and character and the play patterns that will be reflected in the consumer products and the gaming that we're executing in support of those initiatives."

Some things may get delayed depending on what's happening on the set, but everything is up and running now. 
One of the things that's really important to remember, I'm glad you asked about cadence, because you think about before the world changed in March of last year, we actually had a great hit in 1917 from eOne. So that really drove a big impact to the first quarter of last year when you kind of think about the theatrical still being open. 
So now as we look at the cadence, we see it progressing throughout the year. And as you know, I know, Devin, the entertainment and revenue recognition could be a little -- I'll use my favorite accounting term. Brian laughs at me when I say this, but a little lumpier than what you might see in the traditional toy and game business. But we just look at the fourth quarter when eOne was able to get up and get into production and have those deliveries being made, they were able to grow revenue. 
So we see that with an impact in the near term because of something like 1917 in theatrical distribution. But as Brian said, we're excited about being able to take advantage of theatrical as well as streaming by providing this great content over time."

And I think that people feel there'll be an inflection point sometime summer to fall where more moviegoers will be back into theaters. 
Having said that, we're working in partnership with our partners at Disney. They're actively looking at all the windowing. I think you've started to see, like last night, hopefully, on the football game, you saw the trailer for Raya and the Last Dragon. I think it was great, and we're very excited about that. In May, movie, Black Widow we'll be supporting. Ghostbusters comes in June. We've got Venom later in June. Shang-Chi is right now scheduled for July. We've got our own My Little Pony movie coming in the September window. Snake Eyes is slated for October, and then you have Eternals and Spider-Man that will be in the fourth quarter. 
And the team is actively working on a regular basis. Some of those may be more shorter theatrical windows. We talked about the fact that, that works, particularly worked when it's on a premeditated basis where the strategy can be put out up in front, and we can work with our retailers. 
And then, Gerrick, I'll also mention that there's a lot of streaming content that will be coming, that we also feel has a great opportunity, particularly with what we were talking earlier, just about the robust nature of the Marvel brands and business. And so Raya is also a stream piece of content that will come in March, WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, that was a great trailer. And then you have a couple of different new Star Wars initiatives coming from streaming in the back half of 2021. 
So the team is around all of that. They have been building great innovative products for full exploitation there as well as for Hasbro IP like My Little Pony and for Snake Eyes. And we just constantly are working in partnership with our studio brethren to ensure that we understand the way they want to execute their programs. 
And frankly, we're doing the exact same thing with My Little Pony and with Snake Eyes. We want to make sure we're maximizing the opportunity, given where we believe audiences will be at that point in the year. And I think at that -- at this point, I'm getting the high sign that we need to wrap things up. Maybe there's one last question you might have."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The first quarter was an excellent start to the year with growth in both sell-in and point-of-sale for our Consumer Products segment, robust engagement from gamers driving double-digit growth in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment, and we remain on track to deliver our full year expected revenue growth in Entertainment. I want to recognize and thank the Hasbro employees around the world who continue to work through a pandemic and were able to deliver such a high quality quarter with revenue momentum, profit improvement and strong cash generation. 
This quarter marked the first with our new reporting segment structure, which provides a clearer view of the drivers of Hasbro revenues profit, margin and cash generation. As we shared at our investor event in February, our Brand Blueprint succeeds as we create value from our 3 businesses, Hasbro consumer products, including toys and games, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming and Entertainment. 
Each has a growth plan that drives that segment but also drives growth across Hasbro. Our teams and expanding capabilities are enabling us to unlock the full potential of our brands and company. Deb will speak to the quarterly segment performance in more detail shortly. It is clear our unique portfolio of brands and capabilities is driving long-term, sustainable, profitable and cash-generative growth while we invest to build bigger, better brands across a much bigger universe that includes toys and games but also spans Digital Gaming and Entertainment revenues. With double-digit year-over-year growth in both Consumer Products and Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, these businesses are up nearly 20% from the first quarter 2019 pre COVID. Importantly, the quality of this growth is impressive as we have added $120 million in operating profit dollars between the 2 segments. 
We continue to see consumers choosing Hasbro brands as evidenced by the 9% point-of-sale growth globally and nearly 20% point-of-sale increase in the U.S. This doesn't reflect most of MAGIC: THE GATHERING or DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and doesn't yet reflect Hasbro's line of PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS toys and games. Hasbro Franchise Brands, revenue increased 24%, with gains in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, NERF, TRANSFORMERS and BABY ALIVE. NERF revenue increased in all regions with high single-digit POS led by the U.S. and Europe. Innovation for consumers of all ages is driving this growth, including DINOSQUAD, which released in March, Elite 2.0 and our high-performance Ultra line, which have now fully set around the world, continued strength in our licensed Fortnite business and the March launch of the Rival Curve Shot. We have more innovation coming with the NERF Hyper line and the newly announced NERF Roblox for fans of the massively popular game. 
TRANSFORMERS revenue growth was led by gains in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, and global point-of-sale was up nearly 40%. Innovation and storytelling are essential to driving transformers, and the eOne team is expanding the reach and relevance of the brand through world-class entertainment across platforms and demographics. We delivered our latest War for Cybertron content in partnership with Netflix on December 30 supported by new products that drove first quarter's performance. War for Cybertron Chapter 3 will be airing this summer and, in partnership with Paramount, the next feature in the theatrical TRANSFORMERS franchise is slated for 2022.
TRANSFORMERS continued to be the top brand performer on Hasbro's Pulse in the first quarter, delivering the much anticipated HasLab Unicom. The brand kept the momentum to start Q2. In partnership with Robison, during Hasbro Pulse Fan Fest earlier this month, we unveiled a $700 auto converting Optimus Prime robot, which sold out in presale in less than 10 hours. 
E-com revenues increased 70% in the quarter. COVID continues to shift consumer shopping behaviors, accelerating the shift to digital for Hasbro, our pure-play e-com retailers and our omnichannel retailers as supported by their investments in technology and services like curbside pickup. For the quarter, revenue in the total gaming category, including MAGIC and MONOPOLY, increased 7% as gaming continued to be a focal point for players, consumers and retailers. 
Throughout last year, robust demand drove high point of sale and revenue growth. In the Consumer Products segment, this surge in gaming demand began around week 12 of last year. If we look at the U.S. this year, heading into that same week, our games' point of sale was up more than 30%. Once we hit week 12 point-of-sale slowed. Despite the tough comparison, underlying game demand is healthy and point of sale is more than 30% higher than 2019 pre-COVID levels. We have many new games both this spring and for the holiday and availability of classic games to continue meeting the high levels of gaming demand. 
Within Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS both posted double-digit revenue increases. Fueling this growth is both tabletop and physical play as well as the team's continued expansion in digital. MAGIC was up against an exceptionally good first quarter shipment number last year. Based on release strength and timing, we continue to expect the second quarter to be the biggest for MAGIC and Wizards this year. Arena revenue was also higher, including a late first quarter release on mobile. DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Digital Gaming revenue also increased. Dark Alliance is slated for release in June, and the game is receiving positive early. 
Partner Brand revenues grew 3% behind strong growth in Hasbro products for Star Wars as well as continued strength in products for The Mandalorian. as well as growth in Marvel led by momentum in the Spider-Man franchise across all consumer segments and new products for Marvel Studios, the Falcon and the Winter Soldier unveiled at quarter end that will be fully distributed in the second quarter. 
Shifting to our Entertainment business, our eOne team has more than 200 projects in development across TV, film and animation, featuring more than 30 Hasbro IPs. As we spoke to earlier this year, we had theatrical revenues in the first quarter last year, but do not this year due to COVID-related closures. We're also planning for television deliveries to be later this year versus last. We remain on track for our target to reach 2019 TV and Film revenue levels this year. 
With our partners at Paramount, the G.I. Joe Snake Eyes movie release is now set for July 23, and the brand team continues to drive engagement and demand with fans through product and events, including our Pulse initiatives. The eOne team is also shepherding the relaunch of MY LITTLE PONY with new content across digital and broadcast networks with Pony Life and the release of the CG animated film on Netflix this September. 
We are currently in preproduction for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Live Action feature with a new release date of March 3, 2023, and an amazingly talented cast and crew. During the quarter, the team wrapped principal production on 2 films, All the Old Knives and Arthur, the King and are currently in post production on both. In scripted TV, cruel Summer completed filming and premiered last week on Freeform and we continued deliveries of season 3 of the. In unscripted, we have a robust slate of shows in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. underway with more than 40 active productions. 
We announced yesterday an agreement to sell the eOne music business for $385 million. We continue to focus on the core strategic elements of our Brand Blueprint as a play and entertainment company. While we plan to continue working with the music group, including music supervision and music rights exploitation across several brands, music was not the primary driver of our acquisition of eOne. This transaction will allow the team to continue investing to grow and unlock value for its many talented artists and partners. I want to recognize the leadership of Chris Taylor, his dedicated team and the entire organization. We thank them for their countless contributions and look forward to working with them on various projects well into the future. We plan to use the net proceeds from the sale to accelerate deleveraging and for general corporate purposes. 
The first quarter's results are a good start toward achieving our target, double-digit revenue growth this year. The team did an excellent job delivering profit growth, strong cash generation, paying our dividend and reducing our debt profile. We have tremendous innovation and content coming this year, and we look forward to sharing more details as the year progresses. I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,709715246,2258891,"Hasbro, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We began 2021 with a very good first quarter, which demonstrates the strength of our portfolio, our focus on driving profitable revenue growth and progress toward our commitment to strengthening our balance sh",1050,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We began 2021 with a very good first quarter, which demonstrates the strength of our portfolio, our focus on driving profitable revenue growth and progress toward our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet as our goal remains to return to our stated target of 2 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Revenue grew 1%, including a positive $18 million impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted operating profit grew 15%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% and  adjusted earnings per share were $1. 
Our continued focus on working capital was evident. We generated operating cash flow of $378 million and ended the quarter with $1.43 billion in cash after paying off $300 million in debt, which was due in May and paying our quarterly dividend. Receivables; declined with improved collection and the quality of receivables improved. DSO was 66 days versus 79 last year. Inventory was also down, decreasing 7% absent FX. We remain in a very healthy financial position as we invest to profitably grow. 
As Brian mentioned, this is the first quarter we've reported under our new operating segment. Consumer Products segment revenues grew 14% behind growth in Franchise Brands, Emerging Brands and Partner Brands. Hasbro Gaming, excluding MAGIC and MONOPOLY, was down just slightly versus the difficult comparison with last year's strong performance. 
Revenue grew in each geographic region led by the U.S. and Europe, along with growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Retail inventories declined in most markets, including the U.S. and Latin America, and the quality of inventory is good. Licensed Consumer Products revenue also increased in the quarter with strong demand for our brands. Foreign exchange had a favorable $9 million impact on the segment. Operating profit for this segment increased $42 million on higher revenue, somewhat offset by increases in royalties and advertising as well as higher freight costs. Profit was up throughout the segment with North America, Europe and Latin America contributing the most to profit improvement. 
Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenues gained 15% in the quarter. Both major brands in this segment, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, contributed to growth. Foreign exchange had a favorable $4 million impact. Operating profit grew with higher revenue, which was partially offset by increased product development as previously capitalized digital game development is now being expensed as well as higher advertising spend to support the mobile launch of Magic Arena and the upcoming launch of Dark Alliance. Operating profit margin was essentially flat but we expect the expense cadence to impact future quarters more significantly. 
Entertainment segment revenues declined 32% primarily due to the TV and Film business. Foreign exchange had a favorable $5 million impact in the quarter. As Brian discussed, and we shared with you earlier in the year, the comparison to last year when theaters were open was challenging. Given the nature of Entertainment delivery timing, we'll have revenue variances quarter-to-quarter but our full year plan remains to deliver double-digit growth in the segment. beginning with growth in the second quarter. 
Operating profit declined on lower revenue. The lower program amortization and advertising contributed to higher operating profit margin for the segment. Our cash spend on content across scripted and unscripted live action, animated TV and film is planned to be in the range of $675 million to $750 million for the full year. In the first quarter, we spent approximately $147 million of that plan. 
Looking at our overall Hasbro P&L, gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization, increased 90 basis points. This improvement resulted from a reduction in program amortization as a percent of revenue, the favorable impact of growth in Wizards and fewer closeout sales. Cost of sales increased both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, including higher freight costs as we spoke to earlier this year. 
Freight capacity continues to be very limited and more expensive across all markets. We have been actively managing transportation to minimize the impact. This includes using more air freight at a higher cost than our initial plan. In addition to higher freight costs, we, like most other companies have seen significant increases in resin, packaging material and metal prices. We are proactively mitigating such cost pressures with our vendors but the trends have accelerated in recent months. We have covered this increase year-to-date but recently communicated to our customers price increases for Hasbro toy and game products to help further mitigate the higher input costs. 
Product development increased 60 basis points, reflecting ongoing Digital Gaming investments. Magic Arena on mobile was the first of several games scheduled for release this year with additional games slated for release in future periods. Advertising declines were driven by lower promotional spend in eOne due to lack of theatrical releases this quarter. We increased advertising spending at Wizards in support of digital gaming launches and increased advertising in the Consumer Products segment. SD&A included higher freight and warehousing costs, along with higher stock compensation and phased bonus expense partially offset by declines from cost savings and integration initiatives. During the second quarter, based on the value allocated to the eOne music business at purchase, we anticipate recording a noncash pretax loss of approximately $125 million to $135 million from the sale. This amount includes expected transaction costs. 
The first quarter underlying tax rate was 19.5%. And based on currently enacted tax law, we expect our underlying tax rate for 2021 and to be approximately 21% or slightly higher, excluding the amortization of the eOne acquisition intangibles. Other income net was $30.1 million. This includes a $25.6 million gain or $0.19 per share from a legal settlement realized in the first quarter of this year. Adjusting for that gain, other income was slightly lower year-over-year. 
We are very pleased with the quality of the first quarter and how it positions us to deliver our plan for the year. The team has continued to navigate the ongoing impacts of the pandemic to deliver strong results for the business while managing the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Our plans are in place to continue innovating, continue telling compelling stories and continue creating the experiences that bring people together to drive our business in 2021 and beyond. Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

In fact, by Q2, we expect to see the growth that we've been talking about. And our expectation for the full year remains the same, which is the Entertainment business should grow double digits in revenue and return on television and film revenues to the levels that we saw back in 2019. As we move beyond that, as we look at long-term plans, we clearly believe in the continued growth of eOne's business over the longer term, and we're really seeing the Hasbro IP begin to take hold. In fact, right now, we're already on preproduction with a planned launch of production in the next few months on the D&D, Dungeons & Dragons film. We've got TRANSFORMERS both television and film, MY LITTLE PONY. The feature animated CG film comes out in September on Netflix. POWER RANGERS, we have both the TV series and film that we'll talk about going to a platform very shortly. We have some great creative stewards on a brand like risk that will be coming in a future period. So the Hasbro IPs are being actively developed and the television and film's well under production. We do continue to use COVID protocols right now, and we believe those will dissipate as the situation continues to get better. But we feel very good about the Entertainment business for 2021 and beyond."

So we're confident that, that segment can continue to deliver as well. And together, we can -- it can all deliver double-digit revenue growth for us for the year. But as we said in February, we're targeting operating margins in line with last year's adjusted level of around 15%. Demand has been strong and that helped support it, but the impact of freight and input cost increases has become more pronounced over the past several months, and we do have plans in place to help mitigate those costs, including price increases for the second half of the year, and we're actively working with our vendors, suppliers and customers. So for the full year, our plans continue to show that we should be in line with operating margins around last year's adjusted level of 15%."

We have really seen an acceleration of Magic Arena in the first quarter. We went to the full mobile launch just at the end of the quarter at March It's available both on Android and iOS and Arena is up 24% versus a year ago, where we've now seen about 3.5 billion games played collectively since the beginning of the launch. The average per hour use and gameplay for the week is now back to trending at 9 hours per week. As you know, we're launching a whole array of card sets that are simultaneously for MAGIC analog and digital. And we really saw great success in the first quarter around. In fact, that launch, which was early February was the biggest winter set of all time for MAGIC and Time Spiral was also in the quarter, and that was also very successful. 
As we move forward now with Magic Arena up on both iOS and Android, we'll be entering second quarter, in fact, just launching in April on the 23rd. Strixhaven, which is a brand-new world for MAGIC: THE GATHERING, the big new card release that will come in June. Modern Horizons will really drive Q2's business, and there's a lot of excitement around that. And then by July, we have another release coming for the brand. So we're really seeing an acceleration of downloads. In fact, it's as good or even better than the team had anticipated. People are really enjoying the play. It's translated very well to the mobile format, and we'll continue to monitor and look at what appears to be an accelerating MAGIC business. 
The NFT is a real opportunity for us. As you know, we have so many brands that really operate on multiple demographic levels, whether it's TRANSFORMERS or the MAGIC and D&D brands, brands like G.I. Joe, and we have a team that's leading our effort out of the West Coast. We have our arms around this and see multiple opportunities on the NFT side, and you'll hear more about that as we move forward. But we are actively developing our opportunity here, and we do see it as substantial."

But again, for the full year, we have a plan in place that gets us double-digit revenue growth, very robust sales. The teams executed across multiple platforms and productions. And increasingly, Hasbro IP comes into the mix. There's a number of unscripted shows for Hasbro IP that I didn't mention but are also underway. And so we feel very good about that business. We had said all along that in Q1 a year ago, we were still receiving theatrical revenues, and it happened to be a very big theatrical quarter for us. And clearly, just given the timing of closures, we would be up against those revenues this year. And we had mentioned that in our Investor Day as well as our first quarter conference call. So again, the team is doing an excellent job. They are really engaged in developing Hasbro IP and delivering a whole array of very entertaining shows and upcoming movies for the marketplace."

And the releases -- the release cadence this year gives us an expectation that the second quarter will be the biggest quarter of the year -- it's our current expectation anyway, of the year for Withers. So Q1 of last year had some revenues pulled forward to avoid COVID logistical issues, but they -- obviously, they comp very well because of the strength of releases. The momentum is there and the spring set timing will be in Q2 of this year versus Q1 of last year. So that, with some incremental game launches in the second quarter which don't have a comp on the digital side, that's what kind of gives us the belief of the second quarter being higher than the other quarters. And if we look back on that business, we can see it fluctuates from time to time. And the digital revenue, as that ramps, will have depreciation that goes with that. So while Arena, we started to have -- Arena Mobile, we started to have some expense, in the first quarter, you'll see a bit more of that ramping with those digital games being developed. And that's why we continue to believe that full year operating profit margin for that segment is expected to be more in line with the 2019 levels for the full year of 38 7 versus the 46 4 that we had last year."

It's accelerating in that effort. In fact, analog tabletop has performed incredibly well. And let me remind you that the analog and tabletop business is performing incredibly well while people can't get together locally in their local favorite hobby shops or local gaming shops to play the game. In fact, about a year ago, if you looked at the hobby shops, you would have seen about 40% of global hobby shops had some capability to fulfill or either curbside pickup or some kind of e-com. And today, that's well over 80%, and we've tried to help foster those capabilities and building card sets and releases that would be enabling local hobby shops to really participate. But we do expect an additional tailwind on the analog business when we're starting to see that as markets begin to reopen and people can begin to get back together again. So that's obviously a major contributor to people being able to play and also the opportunity to continue to share an individual gamer's passion with new gamers to the game. People get invited to come along and learn how to play MAGIC all the time. So yes, it's expansive. No, there is no cannibalization. And in fact, Magic Arena is just allowing people to play at a distance who had never been able to reconnect with friends or family before and not necessarily be in their neighborhood.

Obviously, if you look at the games business, and I described this a bit in the remarks, our games business up until week 12 was up 30%. And then, obviously, we hit where COVID really accelerated a year ago, and so games finished the quarter at minus 5% in POS. However, underlying POS during this period is still up 30% versus the 2019 pre-COVID level. So we're still seeing that robust gaming demand. Secondly, our toy business, POS has been incredibly strong through this period and double digits up for -- post Q1. 
The other thing that's really important to note is that this is a period of time where we can actually supply product whereas a year ago, the POS was being generated from inventories retailers had on hand as our games factories in Massachusetts and Ireland had been closed for 8 weeks. So we now were able to supply demand. We weren't able to supply a year ago. And similarly, supply chain disruptions had caused us to be unable to supply product during Q2 last year. Despite good strong POS, it was really coming from inventories on hand more than our ability to replenish. So we're seeing Q2 shape up quite well from a demand perspective. 
And also early on, I'll comment from a shipments perspective. We are really seeing continued strength around the product categories. growth in our franchise brands has really been robust around the world. In North America, Franchise Brands in Q1 grew 37%. We're really seeing our partner brands grow, our e-com POS was up 34% in the first quarter with even higher numbers for several brands, Disney Princess, was incredibly strong with POS up more than 60% in the first quarter, and that's continuing as the team has launched a whole array of new innovative products. So again, it's going to be a  bit of a strange comparison on POS in Q2 as compared to a year ago. But the ability to supply product against real demand is very evident, and we're executing on that."

The growth and robust sales increases we're seeing across our business are really important again to the consumer.

A few of our major retailers are already lining up around those kinds of plans and then additional opportunities and big promotional windows occurring at the beginning of Q4.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The first quarter was an excellent start to the year with growth in both sell-in and point-of-sale for our Consumer Products segment, robust engagement from gamers driving double-digit growth in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment, and we remain on track to deliver our full year expected revenue growth in Entertainment. I want to recognize and thank the Hasbro employees around the world who continue to work through a pandemic and were able to deliver such a high quality quarter with revenue momentum, profit improvement and strong cash generation. 
This quarter marked the first with our new reporting segment structure, which provides a clearer view of the drivers of Hasbro revenues, profit, margin and cash generation. As we shared at our investor event in February, our Brand Blueprint succeeds as we create value from our 3 businesses, Hasbro Consumer Products, including toys and games; Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming; and Entertainment.  
Each has a growth plan that drives that segment but also drives growth across Hasbro. Our teams and expanding capabilities are enabling us to unlock the full potential of our brands and company. Deb will speak to the quarterly segment performance in more detail shortly. It is clear our unique portfolio of brands and capabilities is driving long-term, sustainable, profitable and cash-generative growth while we invest to build bigger, better brands across a much bigger universe that includes toys and games but also spans Digital Gaming and Entertainment revenues. With double-digit year-over-year growth in both Consumer Products and Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, these businesses are up nearly 20% from the first quarter 2019 pre-COVID. Importantly, the quality of this growth is impressive as we have added $120 million in operating profit dollars between the 2 segments.  
We continue to see consumers choosing Hasbro brands as evidenced by the 9% point-of-sale growth globally and nearly 20% point-of-sale increase in the U.S. This doesn't reflect most of MAGIC: THE GATHERING or DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and doesn't yet reflect Hasbro's line of PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS toys and games. Hasbro Franchise Brands' revenue increased 24%, with gains in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, NERF, TRANSFORMERS and BABY ALIVE. NERF revenue increased in all regions with high single-digit POS, led by the U.S. and Europe. Innovation for consumers of all ages is driving this growth, including DinoSquad, which released in March, Elite 2.0 and our high-performance Ultra line, which have now fully set around the world; continued strength in our licensed Fortnite business; and the March launch of the Rival Curve Shot. We have more innovation coming with the NERF Hyper line and the newly announced NERF Roblox for fans of the massively popular game. 
TRANSFORMERS revenue growth was led by gains in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, and global point-of-sale was up nearly 40%. Innovation and storytelling are essential to driving transformers, and the eOne team is expanding the reach and relevance of the brand through world-class entertainment across platforms and demographics. We delivered our latest War for Cybertron content in partnership with Netflix on December 30, supported by new products that drove first quarter's performance. War for Cybertron Chapter 3 will be airing this summer and, in partnership with Paramount, the next feature in the theatrical TRANSFORMERS franchise is slated for 2022. 
TRANSFORMERS continued to be the top brand performer on Hasbro's Pulse in the first quarter, delivering the much anticipated HasLab Unicron. The brand kept the momentum to start Q2. In partnership with Robosen, during Hasbro Pulse Fan Fest earlier this month, we unveiled the $700 Auto-Converting Optimus Prime Robot, which sold out in presale in less than 10 hours.  
E-com revenues increased 70% in the quarter. COVID continues to shift consumer shopping behaviors, accelerating the shift to digital for Hasbro. Our pure-play e-com retailers and our omnichannel retailers have supported by their investments in technology and services like curbside pickup. For the quarter, revenue in the total gaming category, including MAGIC and MONOPOLY, increased 7% as gaming continued to be a focal point for players, consumers and retailers. Throughout last year, robust demand drove high point of sale and revenue growth. In the Consumer Products segment, this surge in gaming demand began around week 12 of last year. If we look at the U.S. this year, heading into that same week, our games' point of sale was up more than 30%. Once we hit week 12, point-of-sale slowed. Despite the tough comparison, underlying game demand is healthy and point of sale is more than 30% higher than 2019 pre-COVID levels. We have many new games both this spring and for the holiday and availability of classic games to continue meeting the high levels of gaming demand.  
Within Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS both posted double-digit revenue increases. Fueling this growth is both tabletop and physical play as well as the team's continued expansion in digital. MAGIC was up against an exceptionally good first quarter shipment number last year. Based on release strength and timing, we continue to expect the second quarter to be the biggest for MAGIC and Wizards this year. Arena revenue was also higher, including a late first quarter release on mobile. DUNGEONS & DRAGONS' licensed Digital Gaming revenue also increased. Dark Alliance is slated for release in June, and the game is receiving positive early buzz.
Partner Brand revenues grew 3% behind strong growth in Hasbro products for Star Wars as well as continued strength in products for The Mandalorian as well as growth in Marvel, led by momentum in the Spider-Man franchise across all consumer segments, and new products for Marvel Studios, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier unveiled at quarter end that will be fully distributed in the second quarter. 
Shifting to our Entertainment business, our eOne team has more than 200 projects in development across TV, film and animation, featuring more than 30 Hasbro IPs. As we spoke to earlier this year, we had theatrical revenues in the first quarter last year, but do not this year due to COVID-related closures. We're also planning for television deliveries to be later this year versus last. We remain on track for our target to reach 2019 TV and Film revenue levels this year.  
With our partners at Paramount, the G.I. Joe Snake Eyes movie release is now set for July 23, and the brand team continues to drive engagement and demand with fans through product and events, including our Pulse initiatives. The eOne team is also shepherding the relaunch of MY LITTLE PONY with new content across digital and broadcast networks with Pony Life and the release of the CG animated film on Netflix this September. We are currently in preproduction for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Live Action feature with a new release date of March 3, 2023, and an amazingly talented casting crew. During the quarter, the team wrapped principal production on 2 films, All the Old Knives and Arthur the King and are currently in post production on both. In scripted TV, Cruel Summer completed filming and premiered last week on Freeform, and we continued deliveries of Season 3 of The Rookie. In unscripted, we have a robust slate of shows in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. underway with more than 40 active productions. 
We announced yesterday an agreement to sell the eOne Music business for $385 million. We continue to focus on the core strategic elements of our Brand Blueprint as a play and entertainment company. While we plan to continue working with the music group, including music supervision and music rights exploitation across several brands, music was not the primary driver of our acquisition of eOne. This transaction will allow the team to continue investing to grow and unlock value for its many talented artists and partners. I want to recognize the leadership of Chris Taylor, his dedicated team and the entire organization. We thank them for their countless contributions and look forward to working with them on various projects well into the future. We plan to use the net proceeds from the sale to accelerate deleveraging and for general corporate purposes.  
The first quarter's results are a good start toward achieving our target, double-digit revenue growth this year. The team did an excellent job delivering profit growth, strong cash generation, paying our dividend and reducing our debt profile. We have tremendous innovation and content coming this year, and we look forward to sharing more details as the year progresses. I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,709715246,2259109,"Hasbro, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

We began 2021 with a very good first quarter, which demonstrates the strength of our portfolio, our focus on driving profitable revenue growth and progress toward our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet as our goal remains to return to our stated target of 2 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Revenue grew 1%, including a positive $18 million impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted operating profit grew 15%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% and adjusted earnings per share were $1.  
Our continued focus on working capital was evident. We generated operating cash flow of $378 million and ended the quarter with $1.43 billion in cash after paying off $300 million in debt, which was due in May and paying our quarterly dividend. Receivables declined with improved collection and the quality of receivables improved. DSO was 66 days versus 79 last year. Inventory was also down, decreasing 7%, absent FX. We remain in a very healthy financial position as we invest to profitably grow.  
As Brian mentioned, this is the first quarter we've reported under our new operating segments. Consumer Products segment revenues grew 14% behind growth in Franchise Brands, Emerging Brands and Partner Brands. Hasbro Gaming, excluding MAGIC and MONOPOLY, was down just slightly versus the difficult comparison with last year's strong performance.  
Revenue grew in each geographic region led by the U.S. and Europe, along with growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Retail inventories declined in most markets, including the U.S. and Latin America, and the quality of inventory is good. Licensed Consumer Products revenue also increased in the quarter with strong demand for our brands. Foreign exchange had a favorable $9 million impact on the segment. Operating profit for this segment increased $42 million on higher revenue, somewhat offset by increases in royalties and advertising as well as higher freight costs. Profit was up throughout the segment with North America, Europe and Latin America contributing the most to profit improvement.  
Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenues gained 15% in the quarter. Both major brands in this segment, MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, contributed to growth. Foreign exchange had a favorable $4 million impact. Operating profit grew with higher revenue, which was partially offset by increased product development as previously capitalized digital game development is now being expensed as well as higher advertising spend to support the mobile launch of Magic Arena and the upcoming launch of Dark Alliance. Operating profit margin was essentially flat, but we expect the expense cadence to impact future quarters more significantly.  
Entertainment segment revenues declined 32%, primarily due to the TV and film business. Foreign exchange had a favorable $5 million impact in the quarter. As Brian discussed, and we shared with you earlier in the year, the comparison to last year when theaters were open was challenging. Given the nature of entertainment delivery timing, we'll have revenue variances quarter-to-quarter, but our full year plan remains to deliver double-digit growth in the segment, beginning with growth in the second quarter. Operating profit declined on lower revenue. The lower program amortization and advertising contributed to higher operating profit margin for the segment. 
Our cash spend on content across scripted and unscripted live action, animated TV and film is planned to be in the range of $675 million to $750 million for the full year. In the first quarter, we spent approximately $147 million of that plan. 
Looking at our overall Hasbro P&L, gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization, increased 90 basis points. This improvement resulted from a reduction in program amortization as a percent of revenue, the favorable impact of growth in Wizards and fewer closeout sales. Cost of sales increased both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue, including higher freight costs as we spoke to earlier this year. Freight capacity continues to be very limited and more expensive across all markets. We have been actively managing transportation to minimize the impact. This includes using more air freight at a higher cost than our initial plan. In addition to higher freight costs, we, like most other companies, have seen significant increases in resin, packaging material and metal prices. We are proactively mitigating such cost pressures with our vendors, but the trends have accelerated in recent months. We have covered this increase year-to-date but recently communicated to our customers price increases for Hasbro toy and game products to help further mitigate the higher input costs. 
Product development increased 60 basis points, reflecting ongoing digital gaming investments. Magic Arena on mobile was the first of several games scheduled for release this year with additional games slated for release in future periods. Advertising declines were driven by lower promotional spend in eOne due to lack of theatrical releases this quarter. We increased advertising spending at Wizards in support of digital gaming launches and increased advertising in the Consumer Products segment. SD&A included higher freight and warehousing costs, along with higher stock compensation and phased bonus expense, partially offset by declines from cost savings and integration initiatives.  
During the second quarter, based on the value allocated to the eOne Music business at purchase, we anticipate recording a noncash pretax loss of approximately $125 million to $135 million from the sale. This amount includes expected transaction costs.  
The first quarter underlying tax rate was 19.5%. And based on currently enacted tax law, we expect our underlying tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 21% or slightly higher, excluding the amortization of the eOne acquisition intangibles. Other income net was $30.1 million. This includes a $25.6 million gain or $0.19 per share from a legal settlement realized in the first quarter of this year. Adjusting for that gain, other income was slightly lower year-over-year. 
We are very pleased with the quality of the first quarter and how it positions us to deliver our plan for the year. The team has continued to navigate the ongoing impacts of the pandemic to deliver strong results for the business while managing the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Our plans are in place to continue innovating, continue telling compelling stories and continue creating the experiences that bring people together to drive our business in 2021 and beyond. Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

Mike, on the first question, we're really seeing an array of TV series that are in production for eOne as well as a number of films. We talked about that on our prepared remarks. And we're beginning those deliveries, including The Rookie, Cruel Summer, which just launched on Freeform, a couple of films and increasing television deliveries throughout the year. In fact, by Q2, we expect to see the growth that we've been talking about. And our expectation for the full year remains the same, which is the Entertainment business should grow double digits in revenue and return on television and film revenues to the levels that we saw back in 2019. 
As we move beyond that, as we look at long-term plans, we clearly believe in the continued growth of eOne's business over the longer term, and we're really seeing the Hasbro IP begin to take hold. In fact, right now, we're already on preproduction with a planned launch of production in the next few months on the D&D, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS film. We've got TRANSFORMERS both television and film, MY LITTLE PONY. The feature animated CG film comes out in September on Netflix. POWER RANGERS, we have both the TV series and film that we'll talk about going to a platform very shortly. We have some great creative stewards on a brand like Risk that will be coming in a future period. So the Hasbro IPs are being actively developed in the television and films well under production. We do continue to use COVID protocols right now, and we believe those will dissipate as the situation continues to get better. But we feel very good about the Entertainment business for 2021 and beyond."

So we're confident that, that segment can continue to deliver as well. And together, we can -- it can all deliver double-digit revenue growth for us for the year. But as we said in February, we're targeting operating margins in line with last year's adjusted level of around 15%. 
Demand has been strong and that helped support it, but the impact of freight and input cost increases has become more pronounced over the past several months, and we do have plans in place to help mitigate those costs, including price increases for the second half of the year, and we're actively working with our vendors, suppliers and customers. So for the full year, our plans continue to show that we should be in line with operating margins around last year's adjusted level of 15%."

We have really seen an acceleration of Magic Arena in the first quarter. We went to the full mobile launch just at the end of the quarter at March 25. It's available both on Android and iOS, and Arena is up 24% versus a year ago, where we've now seen about 3.5 billion games played collectively since the beginning and the launch. The average per hour use and gameplay for the week is now back to trending at 9 hours per week. 
As you know, we're launching a whole array of card sets that are simultaneously for MAGIC analog and digital. And we really saw great success in the first quarter around Kaldheim. In fact, that launch, which was early February was the biggest winter set of all time for MAGIC, and Time Spiral was also in the quarter, and that was also very successful. 
As we move forward now with Magic Arena up on both iOS and Android, we'll be entering second quarter, in fact, just launching in April, on the 23rd, Strixhaven, which is a brand-new world for MAGIC: THE GATHERING; the big new card release that will come in June, Modern Horizons, will really drive Q2's business, and there's a lot of excitement around that. And then by July, we have another release coming for the brand. So we're really seeing an acceleration of downloads. In fact, it's as good or even better than the team had anticipated. People are really enjoying the play. It's translated very well to the mobile format, and we'll continue to monitor and look at what appears to be an accelerating MAGIC business. 
The NFT is a real opportunity for us. As you know, we have so many brands that really operate on multiple demographic levels, whether it's TRANSFORMERS or the MAGIC and D&D brands, brands like G.I. Joe. And we have a team that's leading our effort out of the West Coast. We have our arms around this and see multiple opportunities on the NFT side, and you'll hear more about that as we move forward. But we are actively developing our opportunity here, and we do see it as substantial."

And then, Brian, on your comments on the Entertainment business growing back to that '19 level for the year, can you help us think about the cadence by quarter?

But again, for the full year, we have a plan in place that gets us double-digit revenue growth, very robust sales. The teams executed across multiple platforms and productions. And increasingly, Hasbro IP comes into the mix. There's a number of unscripted shows for Hasbro IP that I didn't mention but are also underway. 
And so we feel very good about that business. We had said all along that in Q1 a year ago, we were still receiving theatrical revenues, and it happened to be a very big theatrical quarter for us. And clearly, just given the timing of closures, we would be up against those revenues this year. And we had mentioned that in our Investor Day as well as our first quarter conference call. So again, the team is doing an excellent job. They are really engaged in developing Hasbro IP and delivering a whole array of very entertaining shows and upcoming movies for the marketplace."

And the releases -- the release cadence this year gives us an expectation that the second quarter will be the biggest quarter of the year, it's our current expectation anyway, of the year for Wizards. So Q1 of last year had some revenues pulled forward to avoid COVID logistical issues, but they -- obviously, they comp very well because of the strength of releases. The momentum is there and the spring set timing will be in Q2 of this year versus Q1 of last year. 
So that, with some incremental game launches in the second quarter which don't have a comp on the digital side, that's what kind of gives us the belief of the second quarter being higher than the other quarters. And if we look back on that business, we can see it fluctuates from time to time. And the digital revenue, as that ramps, will have depreciation that goes with that. So while Arena, we started to have -- Arena mobile, we started to have some expense in the first quarter, you'll see a bit more of that ramping with those digital games being developed. And that's why we continue to believe that full year operating profit margin for that segment is expected to be more in line with the 2019 levels for the full year of 38.7% versus the 46.4% that we had last year."

And today, that's well over 80%, and we've tried to help foster those capabilities and building card sets and releases that would be enabling local hobby shops to really participate. But we do expect an additional tailwind on the analog business when we're starting to see that as markets begin to reopen and people can begin to get back together again. So that's obviously a major contributor to people being able to play and also the opportunity to continue to share an individual gamer's passion with new gamers to the game. People get invited to come along and learn how to play MAGIC all the time. So yes, it's expansive. No, there is no cannibalization. And in fact, Magic Arena is just allowing people to play at a distance who had never been able to reconnect with friends or family before and not necessarily be in their neighborhood. So all-in net positive."

Obviously, if you look at the games business, and I described this a bit in the remarks, our games business up until week 12 was up 30%. And then, obviously, we hit where COVID really accelerated a year ago, and so games finished the quarter at minus 5% in POS. However, underlying POS during this period is still up 30% versus the 2019 pre-COVID level. So we're still seeing that robust gaming demand. Secondly, our toy business POS has been incredibly strong through this period and double digits up for -- post Q1. 
The other thing that's really important to note is that this is a period of time where we can actually supply product whereas a year ago, the POS was being generated from inventories retailers had on hand as our games factories in Massachusetts and Ireland had been closed for 8 weeks. So we now were able to supply demand. We weren't able to supply a year ago. And similarly, supply chain disruptions had caused us to be unable to supply product during Q2 last year. Despite good strong POS, it was really coming from inventories on hand more than our ability to replenish. So we're seeing Q2 shape up quite well from a demand perspective. 
And also early on, I'll comment from a shipments perspective. We are really seeing continued strength around the product categories. Growth in our franchise brands has really been robust around the world. In North America, Franchise Brands in Q1 grew 37%. We're really seeing our Partner Brands grow, our e-com POS was up 34% in the first quarter with even higher numbers for several brands. Disney Princess was incredibly strong with POS up more than 60% in the first quarter, and that's continuing as the team has launched a whole array of new innovative products. So again, it's going to be a bit of a strange comparison on POS in Q2 as compared to a year ago. But the ability to supply product against real demand is very evident, and we're executing on that."

So again, a very good position for the company, and we look at all of our opportunities. But you're right, we've entered an era where there's unprecedented spending on content and an unprecedented desire for great brands with great story, and eOne is expert at that."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team delivered an excellent second quarter, highlighting the power of our portfolio and the benefits of supercharging our blueprint across consumer products, wizards",1240,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team delivered an excellent second quarter, highlighting the power of our portfolio and the benefits of supercharging our blueprint across consumer products, wizards and digital gaming and entertainment. Each segment grew revenues and profit on an adjusted basis in the second quarter.
Overall revenue was up 54% from last year and 9% higher compared to pro forma second quarter 2019. Demand for Hasbro brands, products and content remains strong. The team is executing extremely well to meet consumer, retailer and audience demand in a dynamic environment, while driving significant profit and cash generation.
As communicated earlier this year, we are on track to grow revenues, adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA this year. This includes revenue growth in all segments to achieve double-digit revenue growth for Hasbro. We also continue to believe we can reach an adjusted operating margin level approximately in line with last year's adjusted level of 15.1%. We delivered 2 quarters of excellent results so far. And given these results in favorable mix, year-to-date adjusted operating margin is 570 basis points higher versus last year's first half.
We successfully established price increases that go into effect during the third quarter and provide an offset to the rising input and freight costs in the business. These supply chain pressures are meaningful, but given the strength in our business, the actions we have taken, combined with our global footprint, we continue to believe we can meet our full year targets. The team is doing tremendous work from manufacturing, to logistics, to partnering with our retailers to ensure there is product to meet demand. It is not easy, and we'll work through challenges every day. Deb will speak to this further.
Each brand category grew in the quarter, as did 6 of our 7 franchise brands. MONOPOLY declined slightly versus a very robust quarter last year. Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands were each up versus second quarter 2019. Partner Brands and the TV/Film/Entertainment categories were essentially flat with 2 years ago as theatrical releases and content production is returning. 
Wizards generated a standout performance this quarter, led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Demand for Magic is at all-time highs, including 2 record releases in the quarter, Strixhaven and Modern Horizons 2. As player begins to return to stores and play communities, we're seeing an uptick in sales on our backlist product as well. The high demand is tempered only by supply chain challenges as the collectible trading card space has seen significant demand for production capacity and materials.
The launch of MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena on mobile exceeded our expectations and is attracting new arena players. Hybrid players who engage in both desktop and mobile show increased engagement and spend. Digital remains an important driver for our business, and our overall digital portfolio is performing at record levels. We take a holistic approach and are pleased with the direction of our digital transformation.
For DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, which grew in both analog and digital this past quarter, the launch of Dark Alliance did not meet our expectations or that of our players. We'll continue to invest in improving the gameplay in downloadable content. Dark Alliance was a modest investment for us, and we do not anticipate any material effect to Wizards' results. We continue to invest robustly in digital.
Wizards is on track for another record year. And while much of that growth was front-half loaded, we expect growth in the second half of the year behind the positive third quarter release slate.
Turning to our Consumer Products business. Each region grew toy and game revenues, as did licensing, which is beginning to recover. The strength of our brand portfolio more than offset the difficult comparisons in games. As expected, point-of-sale declined in the mid-single digits versus high single-digit growth last year, which was led by the extraordinary growth in the games category. Hasbro point-of-sale for toys in the second quarter was up, while games was down. For the U.S., where we have the most comprehensive data, point-of-sale is up 10% when compared to 2019, with similar gains in both toy and games categories. The quarterly year-over-year comparisons are key, but the trajectory is positive.
E-com revenue, including omnichannel retailers, continued to grow in the mid-teens and physical shopping improved as most stores are open this year versus last. According to Profitero, Hasbro had the leading share of Prime Day toy and game sales in several countries. Channel growth was widespread with the largest growth in mass retailers, toy specialty and sand channels.
We have significant product launches backed by robust multichannel marketing campaigns slated for the second half, including new NERF launches to continue driving the brand after successful Dino Squad and hyper launches in the second quarter. Hasbro's Peppa Pig and P.J. Mask line will be on shelf in the coming weeks. With 100 new products, new entertainment and the support of Hasbro's global retail partners, these brands are poised to reach more families than ever.
We're also relaunching MY LITTLE PONY in the third quarter. There's an all-new cast of ponies and product in support of the September Netflix premier of the CGI movie, MYLITTLEPONY, A New Generation. We will further support the franchise with additional series and specials in coming periods.
Audiences are returning to theaters, and we're supporting several key films, including in partnerships with Paramount, Snake Eyes, G. I. Joe Origins, that premiered this past weekend; Marvel Studio's Black Widow that released earlier this month; as well as Marvel Studio's Spider-Man, No Way Home and Ghostbusters -- Sony's Ghostbusters Afterlife. Entertainment is the catalyst that unlocks the next level of value in our portfolio. E1 is the production. Television in, both scripted and unscripted, led growth this quarter, along with Family Brands revenue from content sales and YouTube advertising. Our entertainment business grew significantly in the quarter, and we continue to target a similar level of revenue for the segment this year versus 2019, absent the second half of the year music revenues.
In television, Cruel Somewhere premiered very high ratings on Freeform and was picked up by the network for a second season. ABC renewed the Rookie for a fourth season, and we have commenced production. Apple TV Plus brought worldwide rights to our production, Have Come From Away, which is in post production for release this fall.
Additional film releases to come include Kit Clifford, the Big Red Dog with Paramount; and Stillwater, directed by Tom McCarthy and starring Matt Damon. In Unscripted TV, our slate remains robust, with close to 40 active productions for Canada, the U.S. and U.K. The eOne team continues to develop and move into production of Hasbro IP. Of more than 200 projects in development across TV, film and animation, more than 30 Hasbro brands are being developed. Among the many active projects were in production on the Dungeons & Dragons live-action feature to premier in 2023, and we began principal photography with Paramount on the live action Transformers, Rise of the Beast coming June 2022.
Hasbro is well positioned for the coming quarters and years with the industry's best brand portfolio, backed by unmatched capabilities in consumer products, gaming and entertainment. Our global team of Hasbro employees and partners continues exceeding expectations to execute and deliver outstanding results during these dynamic times.
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,1673182837,2350813,"Hasbro, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2021",2021-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

The second quarter was another very good quarter for Hasbro. The team executed at a high level to drive revenue growth, profit and margin improvement, manage a complex supply chain, while reducing debt and delivering a strong balance sheet. 
Revenues were up significantly versus last year, but importantly, also up compared to the second quarter of 2019, which did not have an impact from COVID. Each segment grew revenues and profits on an adjusted basis year-over-year. As Brian said, we're tracking to our full year goals, and our outlook is in line with our prior guidance.
The strength of our balance sheet and the sale of the music business, which was completed early in the third quarter, enabled us to pay off $250 million of long-term debt prior to quarter end and another $100 million in July. Through today, we've retired $650 million of debt this year and are evaluating incremental opportunities for further reductions.
At quarter end, cash on hand was $1.2 billion, and we're making good progress toward our goal of returning to our target of 2 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA and maintaining our investment-grade rating. Receivables declined further in the quarter. DSOs were 60 days, a reduction of 37 days compared to Q2 2020 and down 24 days from pro forma Q2 2019. These are the lowest levels of DSOs in a very long time. This improvement is the result of higher sales, combined with improved collections and excellent work between the commercial and treasury teams across our business.
Inventory decreased versus second quarter last year when sell into retailers was limited. Inventory remains below 2019 levels and of good quality. Retail inventory increased in markets where we were understocked last year, including the U.S. and Europe, and we continue to reduce our levels in certain markets like Latin America, which is helping improve profit in that region year-over-year.
My discussion will be based on adjusted results, which excludes several items outlined in our release today, including a $101.8 million charge related to a loss on eOne Music assets held for sale and related pretax transaction costs of $9.5 million.
Within our segments, Consumer Products revenue grew 33% behind gains in franchise brands, emerging brands and partner brands. While overall Hasbro gaming grew in the segment, it declined compared to the strong demand last year. Revenue grew in each geographic region. Licensed consumer products revenue increased, again, this quarter behind franchise and entertainment-backed brands as licensed categories in the retail environment are improving. Foreign exchange had a favorable $19.1 million impact on the segment. Operating profit for this segment increased $63.1 million.
Similar to the first quarter, the higher revenue was partially offset by increases in royalties from partner brand growth, higher advertising to drive the business throughout the year and increased freight costs. Profit was up throughout the segment, with North America, Europe and Latin America contributing the most to profit improvements.
Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment revenues increased 118% in the quarter. MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Dungeons & Dragons contributed to this growth. Foreign exchange had a favorable $7.2 million impact. With the higher revenues, operating profit grew, increasing $118.8 million and 780 basis points in operating margin. The increased revenue more than offset higher expenses to support new game launches, including investing in future gains, advertising and marketing to support game launches and depreciation related to capitalized game development. We've said previously that based on release schedules, we expected the second quarter to be the largest for this business, and the team outperformed our expectations.
Based on the release schedule for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a record revenue year for Wizards with operating margins closer to 2019 levels. Entertainment segment revenues grew 47% with growth in scripted and unscripted television, animated content and YouTube revenues. Foreign exchange had a favorable $8.8 million impact in the quarter. These results helped us on the path to reaching 2019 levels of revenue, excluding the music business over the second half of the year, given it will no longer be in our results. Adjusted operating profit was up, but margin declined with higher expenses as eOne returns to more normal levels of operation.
Our cash spend on content across scripted and unscripted live-action animated TV and film is planned to be in the range of $675 million to $750 million for the full year. Through the second quarter, we spent approximately $308 million of that plan.
Looking at our overall Hasbro P&L, robust revenue growth and favorable mix drove significant improvement in operating profit dollars and a 1,060 basis point increase in adjusted operating profit margin to 16% this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled in the quarter versus last year.
Gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization, increased 80 basis points from growth across the business, including high gross margin revenues from Wizards of the Coast. Cost of sales increased in dollars on the higher revenues, but declined as a percent of revenue, reflecting the favorable mix of Wizards' revenue and improved profit in the Consumer Products business. While other factors positively for its gross margin, freight and input costs are significantly higher this year than last. One example is ocean freight costs, what we're projecting are, on average, that cost will be more than 4x higher this year versus last.
As Brian mentioned, we're implementing price increases during the third quarter that should be fully realized by the fourth quarter. We expect this to offset the rising cost of freight and commodities we continue to see across the business. We're also working to ensure product availability during the holiday season. We may experience some shifts in delivery dates and timing of revenue, but we're leveraging our global footprint and scale to meet demand. This includes sourcing more products earlier out of multiple countries, increasing the number of ocean carriers we work with and utilizing more ports to expedite the delivery of our product from their origin to destination points, along with many other tactics to manage through anticipated port congestion and ocean capacity constraints expected in the second half of the year.
Program amortization increased in the quarter, reflecting the higher entertainment deliveries. This is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10% of revenue for the full year 2021. We continue to expect gross margin to decline slightly for the full year. Product development increased $29 million, led by investments in future analog and digital games at Wizards. As a percentage of revenue, this declined 20 basis points. Advertising expense increased $33 million to support new digital game launches, along with the higher support of our toy and game business as planned for this year versus last. This line also declined as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points.
Reflecting the sale of the music business, we now expect intangible amortization related to the eOne acquisition to be approximately $86 million for the full year 2021 or approximately $20 million each of the third and fourth quarters. As a reminder, we exclude this expense of adjusted earnings and EPS.
SG&A reflects higher expenses as the business returns to pre-COVID levels, with higher levels of marketing and sales expense, increased depreciation associated with capitalized digital gains, increased compensation and higher freight costs. Despite these high expenses, SG&A declined as a percentage of revenue by 540 basis points.
The underlying tax rate in the quarter was 23.2% compared to 20.6% last year. The higher rate is due to the mix of income, but we expect the full year underlying rate to remain at approximately 21%, excluding the amortization of the eOne acquisition intangible. The all-in GAAP effective rate in the quarter was mainly driven by 2 discrete events, including the impact of the music sale and the remeasurement of our U.K. net deferred tax liability. This was offset by a benefit resulting from tax planning and normal discrete items.
Our second quarter showcased the benefit of our deep portfolio of brands and capabilities backed by a tremendous team and solid execution. For the remainder of the year, we will be delivering tremendous innovation in a robust content slate, while navigating the global supply environment to deliver a successful holiday season.
Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

As we've said, we continue to expect that throughout the rest of the year, we'll have solid operating profit margins and that we can achieve the guidance we set out at the beginning of the year to grow revenue double digits and operating profit margins to be in line with a year ago.
Over the longer term, in the medium term, we do expect that we can have -- grow our operating margin levels greater than 16% on a full year basis and have cash generation close to that $1 billion level that we saw a year ago. So excited about what the teams are doing, how they're working and how they're driving profitability and products.
As you know, this year, there are some pressures that are existing out there on the cost side. We've taken pricing that we think will cover all of that, and we expect it to cover it right now. But we still expect there'll be some fluctuation in operating profit level for the rest of the year. But over the long term, no reason why we won't exceed that 16% level in the future."

And as we look at the business, clearly, Q2 is an important inflection point for the company and for stakeholders. As we return to growth in our Entertainment business, we're seeing the momentum in our Wizards of the Coast business and, of course, continue to see very strong consumer product sales.
For the fall, we are lining up with Peppa and P.J. launches. It's great to see those brands in growth mode in Q2. Consumer products returning on those businesses, and Peppa is the second Netflix has and a really robust array of products -- great innovative products from our team as well as an array of consumer products that come from any number of licensees.
Great, big movie sized marketing campaign and a lot of excitement with a whole new core cast with lots of content to follow. In addition to that, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS has its live action film in production. Currently, the team is doing a tremendous job in delivering that film. That will be for first quarter 2023, and I've already seen a plan along with the team for consumer products and licensing were out to our global retailers and their entertainment councils. And it's really the shape of things to come as we activate more Hasbro IP and begin to take them into content, stand them up with great storytelling and begin to activate them across the flywheel and the blueprint.
Then of course, you're seeing Wizards really in the early stages of unlocking the opportunity there as we begin to achieve that doubling of the size of the business and start to set some new objectives and targets for that brand -- those brands and that business as we go forward.
So overall, this is a very good and important time for us. As we've said, we would return to growth. And it helps us to be as confident as we are in our full year goals and objectives as well as our medium range guidance that we provided."

And we also have a similar amount for Q4, including a new show for Showtime called Yellow Jackets, that come from a way movie that will be up here on Apple TV on the fall, the fourth season of the Rookie as well as getting the Family Brands revenues for the new seasons of Peppa, PJ and we will get paid for the MY LITTLE PONY movie primarily in the third quarter as we deliver it to Netflix.
So I'd say we have a very robust slate of entertainment coming, lots of Hasbro IP in development, and we're very excited about the return to growth for eOne as we had projected."

And it's really part of that virtual circle that we're seeing within the Magic business. Also just to remind you, as we think about the cadence for the full year, we have 2 major releases in Q3 and just 1 major release in Q4 this year. And a year ago, Magic's biggest quarter was Q3 followed by Q4.
So we have seen great growth in Magic Arena, and we continue to see that where people are playing both Magic Arena and MAGIC: THE GATHERING that it's really adding to the engagement and players playing. And as we are seeing a return to more in-store and in-person play, that's also a tailwind to the business."

Well, as we talked a little bit about this earlier, but I can certainly add some more color. If you think about our consumer products business, while we see the consumer products licensing business coming back, as retail starts to open, you will also see some pressures on freight costs and moving things around. Now we've taken price increases for that. But you think about all the product that's kind of moving in the second half of the year.
So if you go back and look over time, there are some pressures on certain of the quarters operating profit for that. When you think about the entertainment business, as Brian mentioned, we're very excited for MY LITTLE PONY to launch on Netflix and be able to access all those subscribers. But with that comes the amortization of the cost of the film itself. So when you think about that, that's also going to be coming through in the second half of the year as well as some of the other entertainment initiatives that we've talked about out there.
Wizards, we said earlier in our prepared remarks, they actually outperformed our expectations for the first half of the year. We'll continue to have -- or for the second quarter. We'll continue to have amortization of our administrative around amortization, depreciation of the gains that we have that are being launched out there in that as well. And that's why last year was just such an exceptional year for Wizards from an operating standpoint, we think that it will be closer to those 2019 levels than 2020 levels this year. So when you add all of that up, it's just those different puts and takes over the last part of -- the latter part of the year is what gets us back to our operating profit guidance around the same levels as a year ago."

So starting with D&D and the titles, we are going to have an array of new development in titles. Some come from third-parties like, Boulders Gate, which has performed quite well, and we'll go wide in the next period, probably in 2022.
We have a number of games that we have in development. Some will have more modest budgets and some have larger budgets as we continue to invest in digital. While the underlying games in D&D have really grown that Drew, and we're just seeing great play, both in face-to-face role playing as well as digital role playing. It's really a new area for us as people are playing more online and really building that brand quite considerably.
So again, we feel very good about the slate that we have coming up and the momentum we have in brands like Magic and Arena. And as we said, the launch of Dark Alliance was really about listening to the players, giving them more of what they want, more downloadable content, more satisfactory, more immersive game play. And look, that's part of the process. And we're fully prepared to continue to invest behind the games.
As we think about consumer products, clearly, for the year-to-date period, if you look at the industry data, it was up double digits. But in the second quarter, it was up single digits. Clearly, Hasbro outperformed. And as we go forward, we'll have some different compares for Q3 and 4 last year as we began to return to greater levels of sales and being able to supply product. Remember, the big 8-week wall of supply was from mid-March to about mid to end of May last year.
So no, we do believe we can continue to see growth in our Consumer Products business. But taken in total, we are happy to reiterate our guidance for the full year, recognizing that there have been so many questions about the supply chain and about our ability to supply a product that we felt that we're able to supply product. We are able through an immense amount of work on behalf of the supply chain team to add ports, to add tactics and strategies, to add new ocean carriers and to achieve the objectives we set out for the company, which was growth across our business in each of the operating groups of the business and ultimately, with the opportunity to achieve double-digit revenue growth for the full year."

So let me comment, and then Deb can comment further on the cost side. On the execution side, what I'll tell you is our retailers have been incredible partners and not just in the United States where they're amazing partners, but around the world. We have been incredibly resourceful in finding several new ports and ways of bringing in product, working with our retailers. And the great news about our business and the categories where we're competing is they're in very high demand. And we are seeing that high demand with an array of new innovation, with entertainment returning not only for our portfolio but also for the Marvel and Star Wars portfolio. The Princess business is performing very strongly.
So our retailers are making good investments in these categories where our consumers are purchasing incremental product and are certainly participating in toys and games sales across the board. So again, the fact that we have a very rich mix of new innovative product in our toy business, the NERF business was up considerably and up in every region, for example, the PLAY-DOH business was up and is a major contributor to the growth in the quarter. And the PLAY-DOH business was up, and we continue to see double-digit growth in our online and omnichannel business taken together.
So again, the good news is we have categories of products that are in high demand with gamers and players, with families and fans engaging in our brands in an increasing manner. Deb, do you want to talk cost side?"

We do expect, as Brian said, there is great demand for the products that they are bringing in. So as we bring it in and pass it through to our retailer as well, we had an exceptional -- I will say, an exceptional DSO from a receivable standpoint this year. And so much of that was dependent on the mix of our revenue and when we ship items in the quarter and the great work that our teams did on collection.
So while I wouldn't expect our DSOs to be at the same level from an DSI standpoint, I do expect our inventory levels to still be in line. With reasonable amounts, our retail inventory is good. We've increased retail inventory in the places where we couldn't have inventory a year ago, we just couldn't get it and we couldn't ship it. So retailers were selling out of everything.
So I think our inventory will be in good shape on our books. It will be in good shape on our retailers' books, I think our receivables will be in good shape. So we don't anticipate any unusual draws on our working capital for the full year. And in fact, we still expect our operating cash flows for the full year to be in that $600 million to $750 million level for the full year, kind of getting back to that $1 billion level over the medium term."

The team secured more ports, and we've got more shipping lanes than we've had in the past.
And so I'm going to be a little less focused on exactly where the inventories come in, but rather that we have the inventories to meet the demand that we need for the second half of the year, recognizing we also have a number of new entertainment initiatives, including the MY LITTLE PONY film, several from our partners at Marvel, additional Star Wars content coming for the second half of the year. Princess is performing at a very high level. And then, of course, we get into the holidays, and the team has an array of new games lined up there as well.
So again, you're right, there could be some shifting around as -- it's a little different than past years where direct import could play a bigger role than it has in the past. But again, working with our retailers around the world, we feel -- most importantly, we want to meet the high demand."

Let me comment on the supply a little bit first. What we just wanted to make sure again that people understood that while we were using certain printing expertise and capabilities, we had to expand our global footprint for capabilities because the brand is expanding, because gamers are increasingly discovering and rediscovering the brand, are playing at an increasing rate and are also sharing more, bringing in new players more than ever before.
And I think the magic of Magic is that, in fact, it is that great flywheel where players play face-to-face and the card game that contributes to engagement that Magic Arena, as you know, has the release cadence that marries to the card releases of the analog game. And so again, they really contribute to one another, and they're synergistic with one another. It's not as if one detracts from the other or takes time away from the other. In fact, it just gives people more opportunity to play, and they play with different players, whether they're friends or acquaintances at a distance and they play in mobile and online, or whether they're playing face-to-face increasingly returning to our global hobby shops, which have performed quite well, thanks to our support and support of others through the pandemic."

So as Deb indicated in her remarks, we expect to see that Wizards will continue to see some growth, but our big quarter for the year was Q2.

So if there's a comparison challenge in revenues, and we don't yet know exactly where we'll end up, given the level of engagement that we're seeing in the brand right now, probably the most challenging comparison will be in Q4 relative to a year ago.

And that's why if you look at the blended mix, the operating margin for the year, on average, comes down a little bit as digital enters more of the mix of offerings.
But again, long term, as you pay for the initial development, as you pay for your marketing campaigns, you start to get more and more of the benefit of the underlying and consistent game play. And that's what we're seeing in arena. So it's a profitable part of the business. Obviously has some costs associated with it. The analog card business does not bear.
I don't know, Deb, if you want to comment further on that? And then as we go forward, I would also say digital is going to be a growing part of the business, but I also expect, and we're seeing it, that the analog businesses for both D&D and for Magic continue to grow. So perhaps the universe continues to grow, and therefore, as a percent of total digital increases, but maybe by not as much as one would expect.
The other thing to note is that within D&D, there's this digital role playing area that we're really investing in. And so it's kind of a partially analog, partially digital, and we think this is a great opportunity for the brand as we go forward.
So we're charting a course beyond doubling the size of the business. it will include a good array and a very robust slate of new digital games coming at different price points. It will also include both first-party games as well as third-party games.

I'll comment, and then she also talk a bit about this. What we really are seeing, obviously, is early on, we saw a necessity to raise prices as we saw the steps the team was needing to take a supply chain and logistics in order to execute our year. And that's very consistent with so many consumer product categories across the board where we're seeing the snapback in demand in this transitory return to try to find production and capabilities.
I think the holiday should be incredibly good, and very, very solid with great new innovations coming from several of our brands. We have big launches coming in the second half of the year from the MY LITTLE PONY. New lineup behind the brand new film and new cash to several of our partner brands, Peppa Pig and PJ Mask, an array of new games and again, lots of new innovation and new game and toy to play for global consumers.

What we talked earlier about ocean freight in some of our prepared remarks, and we're seeing those costs are over 4x higher than what we had been experiencing earlier in the earlier or last year even. So we expect a lot of those costs to continue. However, as Brian said, the team is doing just a tremendous job, actually getting the product, and that's what's important, right? So we expect between that and some increased input costs that our gross margin -- we continue to expect our gross margin to be slightly down from a year ago. And just as a reminder, that's cost of sales, plus program amortization because we're in the great situation that we can actually provide content now and release things theatrically. So we expect that program amortization to go up as well. But between cost of sales and that, we do expect our gross margin to be slightly down from a year ago, but we do expect the price increases that we've taken to offset our increased costs."

We're working with our global retail partners on what that will exactly look like. But because of the demand in the product categories that we are offering, we have a lot of great partnership and we do expect that we'll get our products to market recognize that the price increases we're taking will cover the incremental costs that we're experiencing. And those cost increases are around the world, and they'll be a little different in each of the regions, just depending on foreign exchange and the way that they will hit the P&L, but they're just intended to cover our cost increases, to maintain our gross margins and to hit the operating margin that we believe we can achieve for the full year."

So I would expect perhaps about -- over time, about 80% of the product lines of Peppa and PJ to be inside, but with another 20% continuing to be licensed in those categories with additional consumer products, licensing opportunities.
Peppa and PJ enjoy on our P&L, the Consumer Products P&L, enjoy Hasbro high-teens operating profit margin. So on average, higher than company average operating margins, which is very consistent with Hasbro IP on the toy and game side and then obviously, much higher on the consumer product side.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team delivered an excellent second quarter, highlighting the power of our portfolio and the benefits of supercharging our blueprint across consumer products, wizards",1241,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team delivered an excellent second quarter, highlighting the power of our portfolio and the benefits of supercharging our blueprint across consumer products, wizards and digital gaming and entertainment. Each segment grew revenues and profit on an adjusted basis in the second quarter. 
Overall revenue was up 54% from last year and 9% higher compared to pro forma second quarter 2019. Demand for Hasbro brands, products and content remains strong. The team is executing extremely well to meet consumer, retailer and audience demand in a dynamic environment, while driving significant profit and cash generation. 
As communicated earlier this year, we are on track to grow revenues, adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA this year. This includes revenue growth in all segments to achieve double-digit revenue growth for Hasbro. We also continue to believe we can reach an adjusted operating margin level approximately in line with last year's adjusted level of 15.1%. We delivered 2 quarters of excellent results so far. And given these results and favorable mix, year-to-date adjusted operating margin is 570 basis points higher versus last year's first half. 
We successfully established price increases that go into effect during the third quarter and provide an offset to the rising input and freight costs in the business. These supply chain pressures are meaningful, but given the strength in our business, the actions we have taken, combined with our global footprint, we continue to believe we can meet our full year targets. The team is doing tremendous work from manufacturing, to logistics, to partnering with our retailers to ensure there is product to meet demand. It is not easy, and we'll work through challenges every day. Deb will speak to this further. 
Each brand category grew in the quarter, as did 6 of our 7 franchise brands. MONOPOLY declined slightly versus a very robust quarter last year. Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands were each up versus second quarter 2019. Partner Brands and the TV/Film/Entertainment categories were essentially flat with 2 years ago as theatrical releases and content production is returning.
Wizards generated a standout performance this quarter, led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Demand for Magic is at all-time highs, including 2 record releases in the quarter, Strixhaven and Modern Horizons 2. As player begins to return to stores and play communities, we're seeing an uptick in sales on our backlist product as well. The high demand is tempered only by supply chain challenges as the collectible trading card space has seen significant demand for production capacity and materials. 
The launch of MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena on mobile exceeded our expectations and is attracting new arena players. Hybrid players who engage in both desktop and mobile show increased engagement and spend. Digital remains an important driver for our business, and our overall digital portfolio is performing at record levels. We take a holistic approach and are pleased with the direction of our digital transformation. 
For Dungeons & Dragons, which grew in both analog and digital this past quarter, the launch of Dark Alliance did not meet our expectations or that of our players. We'll continue to invest in improving the game play and downloadable content. Dark Alliance was a modest investment for us, and we do not anticipate any material effect to Wizards' results. We continue to invest robustly in digital. 
Wizards is on track for another record year. And while much of that growth was front-half loaded, we expect growth in the second half of the year behind the positive third quarter release slate. 
Turning to our Consumer Products business. Each region grew toy and game revenues, as did licensing, which is beginning to recover. The strength of our brand portfolio more than offset the difficult comparisons in games. As expected, point-of-sale declined in the mid-single digits versus high single-digit growth last year, which was led by the extraordinary growth in the games category. Hasbro point-of-sale for toys in the second quarter was up, while games was down. For the U.S., where we have the most comprehensive data, point-of-sale is up 10% when compared to 2019, with similar gains in both toy and games categories. The quarterly year-over-year comparisons are choppy, but the trajectory is positive. 
E-com revenue, including omnichannel retailers, continued to grow in the mid-teens and physical shopping improved as most stores are open this year versus last. According to Profitero, Hasbro had the leading share of Prime Day toy and game sales in several countries. Channel growth was widespread with the largest growth in mass retailers, toy specialty and sand channels. 
We have significant product launches backed by robust multichannel marketing campaigns slated for the second half, including new NERF launches to continue driving the brand after successful DinoSquad and Hyper launches in the second quarter. Hasbro's Peppa Pig and PJ MASKS line will be on shelf in the coming weeks. With 100 new products, new entertainment and the support of Hasbro's global retail partners, these brands are poised to reach more families than ever. 
We're also relaunching MY LITTLE PONY in the third quarter. There's an all-new cast of ponies and product in support of the September Netflix premier of the CGI movie, My Little Pony: A New Generation. We will further support the franchise with additional series and specials in coming periods. 
Audiences are returning to theaters, and we're supporting several key films, including in partnerships with Paramount, Snake Eyes: G. I. Joe Origins that premiered this past weekend; Marvel Studio's Black Widow that released earlier this month; as well as Marvel Studio's Spider-Man: No Way Home and Ghostbusters -- Sony's Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Entertainment is the catalyst that unlocks the next level of value in our portfolio. eOne is the production. Television in, both scripted and unscripted, led growth this quarter, along with Family Brands revenue from content sales and YouTube advertising. Our entertainment business grew significantly in the quarter, and we continue to target a similar level of revenue for the segment this year versus 2019, absent the second half of the year music revenues. 
In television, Cruel Summer premiered to very high ratings on Freeform and was picked up by the network for a second season. ABC renewed the Rookie for a fourth season, and we have commenced production. Apple TV Plus bought worldwide rights to our production of Come From Away, which is in post-production for release this fall.
Additional film releases to come include Clifford, the Big Red Dog with Paramount; and Stillwater, directed by Tom McCarthy and starring Matt Damon. In Unscripted TV, our slate remains robust, with close to 40 active productions for Canada, the U.S. and U.K. The eOne team continues to develop and move into production of Hasbro IP of more than 200 projects in development across TV, film and animation, more than 30 Hasbro brands are being developed. Among the many active projects were in production on the Dungeons & Dragons live-action feature to premier in 2023, and we began principal photography with Paramount on the live action Transformers: Rise of the Beast coming June 2022.
Hasbro is well positioned for the coming quarters and years with the industry's best brand portfolio, backed by unmatched capabilities in consumer products, gaming and entertainment. Our global team of Hasbro employees and partners continues exceeding expectations to execute and deliver outstanding results during these dynamic times.
I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,1673182837,2350947,"Hasbro, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2021",2021-07-26,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

The second quarter was another very good quarter for Hasbro. The team executed at a high level to drive revenue growth, profit and margin improvement, manage a complex supply chain, while reducing debt and delivering a strong balance sheet. 
Revenues were up significantly versus last year, but importantly, also up compared to the second quarter of 2019, which did not have an impact from COVID. Each segment grew revenues and profits on an adjusted basis year-over-year. As Brian said, we're tracking to our full year goals, and our outlook is in line with our prior guidance.
The strength of our balance sheet and the sale of the music business, which was completed early in the third quarter, enabled us to pay off $250 million of long-term debt prior to quarter end and another $100 million in July. Through today, we've retired $650 million of debt this year and are evaluating incremental opportunities for further reductions.
At quarter end, cash on hand was $1.2 billion, and we're making good progress toward our goal of returning to our target of 2 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA and maintaining our investment-grade rating. Receivables declined further in the quarter. DSOs were 60 days, a reduction of 37 days compared to Q2 2020 and down 24 days from pro forma Q2 2019. These are the lowest levels of DSOs in a very long time. This improvement is the result of higher sales, combined with improved collections and excellent work between the commercial and treasury teams across our business.
Inventory decreased versus second quarter last year when sell into retailers was limited. Inventory remains below 2019 levels and of good quality. Retail inventory increased in markets where we were understocked last year, including the U.S. and Europe, and we continue to reduce our levels in certain markets like Latin America, which is helping improve profit in that region year-over-year.
My discussion will be based on adjusted results, which excludes several items outlined in our release today, including a $101.8 million charge related to a loss on eOne Music assets held for sale and related pretax transaction costs of $9.5 million.
Within our segments, Consumer Products revenue grew 33% behind gains in franchise brands, emerging brands and partner brands. While overall Hasbro gaming grew in the segment, it declined compared to the strong demand last year. Revenue grew in each geographic region. Licensed consumer products revenue increased, again, this quarter behind franchise and entertainment-backed brands as licensed categories in the retail environment are improving. Foreign exchange had a favorable $19.1 million impact on the segment. Operating profit for this segment increased $63.1 million.
Similar to the first quarter, the higher revenue was partially offset by increases in royalties from partner brand growth, higher advertising to drive the business throughout the year and increased freight costs. Profit was up throughout the segment, with North America, Europe and Latin America contributing the most to profit improvements.
Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment revenues increased 118% in the quarter. MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Dungeons & Dragons contributed to this growth. Foreign exchange had a favorable $7.2 million impact. With the higher revenues, operating profit grew, increasing $118.8 million and 780 basis points in operating margin. The increased revenue more than offset higher expenses to support new game launches, including investing in future gains, advertising and marketing to support game launches and depreciation related to capitalized game development. We've said previously that based on release schedules, we expected the second quarter to be the largest for this business, and the team outperformed our expectations.
Based on the release schedule for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a record revenue year for Wizards, with operating margins closer to 2019 levels. Entertainment segment revenues grew 47%, with growth in scripted and unscripted television, animated content and YouTube revenues. Foreign exchange had a favorable $8.8 million impact in the quarter. These results have us on the path to reaching 2019 levels of revenue, excluding the music business over the second half of the year, given it will no longer be in our results. Adjusted operating profit was up, but margin declined with higher expenses as eOne returns to more normal levels of operation.
Our cash spend on content across scripted and unscripted live-action animated TV and film is planned to be in the range of $675 million to $750 million for the full year. Through the second quarter, we spent approximately $308 million of that plan.
Looking at our overall Hasbro P&L, robust revenue growth and favorable mix drove significant improvement in operating profit dollars and a 1,060 basis point increase in adjusted operating profit margin to 16% this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled in the quarter versus last year.
Gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization, increased 80 basis points from growth across the business, including high gross margin revenues from Wizards of the Coast. Cost of sales increased in dollars on the higher revenues, but declined as a percent of revenue, reflecting the favorable mix of Wizards' revenue and improved profit in the Consumer Products business. While other factors positively for its gross margin, freight and input costs are significantly higher this year than last. One example is ocean freight costs, what we're projecting are, on average, that cost will be more than 4x higher this year versus last.
As Brian mentioned, we're implementing price increases during the third quarter that should be fully realized by the fourth quarter. We expect this to offset the rising cost of freight and commodities we continue to see across the business. We're also working to ensure product availability during the holiday season. We may experience some shifts in delivery dates and timing of revenue, but we're leveraging our global footprint and scale to meet demand. This includes sourcing more products earlier out of multiple countries, increasing the number of ocean carriers we work with and utilizing more ports to expedite the delivery of our product from their origin to their destination points, along with many other tactics to manage through anticipated port congestion and ocean capacity constraints expected in the second half of the year.
Program amortization increased in the quarter, reflecting the higher entertainment deliveries. This is expected to be in the range of 9% to 10% of revenues for the full year 2021. We continue to expect gross margin to decline slightly for the full year. Product development increased $29 million, led by investments in future analog and digital games at Wizards. As a percentage of revenue, this declined 20 basis points. Advertising expense increased $33 million to support new digital game launches, along with the higher support of our toy and game business as planned for this year versus last. This line also declined as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points.
Reflecting the sale of the music business, we now expect intangible amortization related to the eOne acquisition to be approximately $86 million for the full year 2021 or approximately $20 million each of the third and fourth quarters. As a reminder, we exclude this expense of adjusted earnings and EPS.
SG&A reflects higher expenses as the business returns to pre-COVID levels, with higher levels of marketing and sales expense, increased depreciation associated with capitalized digital gains, increased compensation and higher freight costs. Despite these high expenses, SG&A declined as a percentage of revenue by 540 basis points.
The underlying tax rate in the quarter was 23.2% compared to 20.6% last year. The higher rate is due to the mix of income, but we expect the full year underlying rate to remain at approximately 21%, excluding the amortization of the eOne acquisition intangible. The all-in GAAP effective rate in the quarter was mainly driven by 2 discrete events, including the impact of the music sale and the remeasurement of our U.K. net deferred tax liability. This was offset by a benefit resulting from tax planning and normal discrete items.
Our second quarter showcased the benefit of our deep portfolio of brands and capabilities backed by a tremendous team and solid execution. For the remainder of the year, we will be delivering tremendous innovation in a robust content slate, while navigating the global supply environment to deliver a successful holiday season.
Brian and I are now happy to take your questions."

Do you expect to see some of the margin benefits continue to progress through the back half? 
And then Brian, my question for you is just a bigger picture. Now that you've gotten the blueprint enhanced, capabilities around the blueprint, can you give us a few examples for the back half? Maybe it's Peppa or MY LITTLE PONY, how you expect to fully exploit the capabilities? And what we should be looking for in the marketplace as evidence of that?"

The team delivered tremendous revenue and operating profit margins for the quarter, I mean really good job all the way around. As we've said, we continue to expect that throughout the rest of the year, we'll have solid operating profit margins and that we can achieve the guidance we set out at the beginning of the year to grow revenue double digits and operating profit margins to be in line with a year ago.
Over the longer term, in the medium term, we do expect that we can have -- grow our operating margin levels greater than 16% on a full year basis and have cash generation close to that $1 billion level that we saw a year ago. So excited about what the teams are doing, how they're working and how they're driving profitability and products.
As you know, this year, there are some pressures that are existing out there on the cost side. We've taken pricing that we think will cover all of that, and we expect it to cover it right now. But we still expect there'll be some fluctuation in operating profit level for the rest of the year. But over the long term, no reason why we won't exceed that 16% level in the future."

And as we look at the business, clearly, Q2 is an important inflection point for the company and for stakeholders. As we return to growth in our Entertainment business, we're seeing the momentum in our Wizards of the Coast business and, of course, continue to see very strong consumer product sales.
For the fall, we are lining up with Peppa and PJ launches. It's great to see those brands in growth mode in Q2. Consumer products returning on those businesses, and Peppa is the second-most viewed preschool brand in the world and that content consumption really goes unabated as we are in Season 9 on that brand and in Season 4 and PJ Masks with lots of new content to come. The MY LITTLE PONY film is coming in September. It's on Netflix. It will be a beneficiary of the 200 million subscribers that Netflix has and a really robust array of products, great innovative products from our team as well as an array of consumer products that come from any number of licensees.
Great, big movie-sized marketing campaign and a lot of excitement with a whole new core cast with lots of content to follow. In addition to that, Dungeons & Dragons has its live action film in production. Currently, the team is doing a tremendous job in delivering that film. That will be for first quarter 2023, and I've already seen a plan along with the team for consumer products and licensing. We're out to our global retailers and their entertainment councils, and it's really the shape of things to come as we activate more Hasbro IP and begin to take them into content, stand them up with great storytelling and begin to activate them across the flywheel and the blueprint.
Then of course, you're seeing Wizards really in the early stages of unlocking the opportunity there as we begin to achieve that doubling of the size of the business and start to set some new objectives and targets for that brand -- those brands and that business as we go forward.
So overall, this is a very good and important time for us. As we've said, we would return to growth. And it helps us to be as confident as we are in our full year goals and objectives as well as our medium range guidance that we provided."

If you take it in total, in fact, the family brands were up in the second quarter, if you look at like Peppa Pig and PJ Masks, and that's taken in total, where you have consumer products plus entertainment coming from the 2 different divisions.
As we look at Q3 and 4, we do expect with production returning, we're seeing a great array of deliveries. We expect growth in Q3 and Q4 for the eOne business. We have a number of television series in production for delivery in Q3. And we also have a similar amount for Q4, including a new show for Showtime called Yellowjackets, that come from a way -- movie that will be up here on Apple TV on the fall, the fourth season of the Rookie as well as getting the Family Brands revenues for the new seasons of Peppa, PJ, and we will get paid for the MY LITTLE PONY movie primarily in the third quarter as we deliver it to Netflix.

So we have seen great growth in Magic Arena, and we continue to see that where people are playing both Magic Arena and MAGIC: THE GATHERING that it's really adding to the engagement and players playing.

Well, as we talked a little bit about this earlier, but I can certainly add some more color. If you think about our consumer products business, while we see the consumer products licensing business coming back, as retail starts to open, you will also see some pressures on freight costs and moving things around. Now we've taken price increases for that. But you think about all the product that's kind of moving in the second half of the year.
So if you go back and look over time, there are some pressures on certain of the quarters operating profit for that. When you think about the entertainment business, as Brian mentioned, we're very excited for MY LITTLE PONY to launch on Netflix and be able to access all those subscribers. But with that comes the amortization of the cost of the film itself. So when you think about that, that's also going to be coming through in the second half of the year as well as some of the other entertainment initiatives that we've talked about out there.
Wizards, we said earlier in our prepared remarks, they actually outperformed our expectations for the first half of the year. We'll continue to have -- or for the second quarter. We'll continue to have amortization of our administrative around amortization, depreciation of the gains that we have that are being launched out there in that as well. And that's why last year was just such an exceptional year for Wizards from an operating standpoint. We think that it will be closer to those 2019 levels than 2020 levels this year. So when you add all of that up, it's just those different puts and takes over the last part of -- the latter part of the year is what gets us back to our operating profit guidance around the same levels as a year ago."

And then, I guess, separately, Brian, you mentioned that Dark Alliance fell short of your expectations. Can you just discuss what happened there? And in the past, you've indicated that launching new titles was important to doubling the size of Wizards. I mean it sounds like you're pacing ahead of that. Should we expect new titles to be similar in size, the Dark Alliance going forward or more robust production budgets for new games?"

We have a number of games that we have in development. Some will have more modest budgets and some have larger budgets as we continue to invest in digital. While the underlying games in D&D have really grown that Drew, and we're just seeing great play, both in face-to-face role playing as well as digital role playing. It's really a new area for us as people are playing more online and really building that brand quite considerably.
So again, we feel very good about the slate that we have coming up and the momentum we have in brands like Magic and Arena. And as we said, the launch of Dark Alliance was really about listening to the players, giving them more of what they want, more downloadable content, more satisfactory, more immersive game play. And look, that's part of the process. And we're fully prepared to continue to invest behind the games.
As we think about consumer products, clearly, for the year-to-date period, if you look at the industry data, it was up double digits. But in the second quarter, it was up single digits. Clearly, Hasbro outperformed. And as we go forward, we'll have some different compares for Q3 and 4 last year as we began to return to greater levels of sales and being able to supply product. Remember, the big 8-week wall of supply was from mid-March to about mid to end of May last year.
So no, we do believe we can continue to see growth in our Consumer Products business. But taken in total, we are happy to reiterate our guidance for the full year, recognizing that there have been so many questions about the supply chain and about our ability to supply a product that we felt that we're able to supply product. We are able through an immense amount of work on behalf of the supply chain team to add ports, to add tactics and strategies, to add new ocean carriers and to achieve the objectives we set out for the company, which was growth across our business in each of the operating groups of the business and ultimately, with the opportunity to achieve double-digit revenue growth for the full year."

And we are seeing that high demand with an array of new innovation, with entertainment returning not only for our portfolio but also for the Marvel and Star Wars portfolio. The Princess business is performing very strongly.
So our retailers are making good investments in these categories where our consumers are purchasing incremental product and are certainly participating in toys and games sales across the board. So again, the fact that we have a very rich mix of new innovative product in our toy business, the NERF business was up considerably and up in every region, for example, the PLAY-DOH business was up and is a major contributor to the growth in the quarter. And the PLAY-DOH business was up, and we continue to see double-digit growth in our online and omnichannel business taken together.

So while I wouldn't expect our DSOs to be at the same level from an DSI standpoint, I do expect our inventory levels to still be in line. With reasonable amounts, our retail inventory is good. We've increased retail inventory in the places where we couldn't have inventory a year ago. We just couldn't get it, and we couldn't ship it. So retailers were selling out of everything.
So I think our inventory will be in good shape on our books. It will be in good shape on our retailers' books, I think our receivables will be in good shape.

Look, I think our first objective is to ensure that gamers and the people engaging in our toys and games business have the product that they're looking for and that our retailers have product to support these major initiatives that we have. I do believe that there could be some shifting between Q3 and 4. We're out to source product and to bring it in via any number of new carriers. The team secured more ports, and we've got more shipping lanes than we've had in the past.
And so I'm going to be a little less focused on exactly where the inventories come in, but rather that we have the inventories to meet the demand that we need for the second half of the year, recognizing we also have a number of new entertainment initiatives, including the MY LITTLE PONY film, several from our partners at Marvel, additional Star Wars content coming for the second half of the year. Princess is performing at a very high level. And then, of course, we get into the holidays, and the team has an array of new games lined up there as well.
So again, you're right, there could be some shifting around as -- it's a little different than past years where direct import could play a bigger role than it has in the past. But again, working with our retailers around the world, we feel -- most importantly, we want to meet the high demand."

Let me comment on the supply a little bit first. What we just wanted to make sure again that people understood that while we were using certain printing expertise and capabilities, we had to expand our global footprint for capabilities because the brand is expanding, because gamers are increasingly discovering and rediscovering the brand, are playing at an increasing rate and are also sharing more, bringing in new players more than ever before.
And I think the magic of Magic is that, in fact, it is that great flywheel where players play face-to-face and the card game that contributes to engagement that Magic Arena, as you know, has the release cadence that marries to the card releases of the analog game. And so again, they really contribute to one another, and they're synergistic with one another. It's not as if one detracts from the other or takes time away from the other. In fact, it just gives people more opportunity to play, and they play with different players, whether they're friends or acquaintances at a distance and they play in mobile and online, or whether they're playing face-to-face increasingly returning to our global hobby shops, which have performed quite well, thanks to our support and support of others through the pandemic."

And look, let me walk you through a little bit of detail on that. So we have 2 major releases coming in Q3, one is called, The Adventures in the Forgotten Realms, and that's actually a very exciting set because it's a crossover with Dungeons & Dragons, and that will come out -- actually just coming out about now.
And then we have a second release in Innistrad coming in Q3. We have one major release for Q4. So as Deb indicated in her remarks, we expect to see that Wizards will continue to see some growth, but our big quarter for the year was Q2. And let me remind you, last year, Q3 was the largest quarter followed by Q4.
So if there's a comparison challenge in revenues, and we don't yet know exactly where we'll end up, given the level of engagement that we're seeing in the brand right now, probably the most challenging comparison will be in Q4 relative to a year ago. But again, the momentum in the business remains. We are ahead of our plan to double the size of that business. and it will come down to what really takes place in the Q4 period."

So I don't know that I can comment specifically on family budgets, but what I can say is that people are spending money in the Consumer Product categories that we're offering, from NERF to PLAY-DOH to play school to our partner brands in Marvel, Star Wars and Princess and of course, several other brands in the portfolio."

But obviously, as Deb described, with the cost that we amortized, profitability is below the analog business. And that's why if you look at the blended mix, the operating margin for the year, on average, comes down a little bit as digital enters more of the mix of offerings.
But again, long term, as you pay for the initial development, as you pay for your marketing campaigns, you start to get more and more of the benefit of the underlying and consistent game play. And that's what we're seeing in arena. So it's a profitable part of the business. Obviously has some costs associated with it. The analog card business does not bear.
I don't know, Deb, if you want to comment further on that? And then as we go forward, I would also say digital is going to be a growing part of the business, but I also expect, and we're seeing it, that the analog businesses for both D&D and for Magic continue to grow. So perhaps the universe continues to grow, and therefore, as a percent of total digital increases, but maybe by not as much as one would expect.
The other thing to note is that within D&D, there's this digital role-playing area that we're really investing in. And so it's kind of a partially analog, partially digital, and we think this is a great opportunity for the brand as we go forward.
So we're charting a course beyond doubling the size of the business. It will include a good array and a very robust slate of new digital games coming at different price points. It will also include both first-party games as well as third-party games. We're lining up some great studios to produce games for us as well with our teams embedded with them to ensure just great game play and brand continuity. But Deb, do you want to comment?"

We have big launches coming in the second half of the year from the MY LITTLE PONY.

Peppa and PJ enjoy on our P&L, the Consumer Products P&L, enjoy Hasbro high-teens operating profit margin. So on average, higher than company average operating margins, which is very consistent with Hasbro IP on the toy and game side and then obviously, much higher on the consumer product side.

I'm Rich Stoddart Interim CEO at Hasbro. Before we officially begin the remarks on the call today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the passing of our beloved leader and friend, Brian Goldn",1283,"Thank you, Debbie, and welcome to everyone joining us today. I'm Rich Stoddart Interim CEO at Hasbro. Before we officially begin the remarks on the call today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the passing of our beloved leader and friend, Brian Goldner. I know many of you share in our sadness for his untimely passing. Brian was not only an accomplished CEO, he was a true visionary who transformed an almost 100-year-old toy and game company into a leading global play and entertainment company, but his impact can be felt well beyond Hasbro. He changed the game completely. He believed in the power of a story, seeing the potential for omnichannel storytelling and content built on powerful brands. 
He architected a compelling road map for Hasbro's growth in the Brand Blueprint strategy, and was so proud of where it has taken Hasbro, but even more so in its power and future potential now with eOne as an integrated part of the family. I had the privilege to work together with Brian and the Hasbro team for the last 7 years, and serve on the company Board, most recently as Lead Independent Director. During that time, the company transformed its talent its culture, its brands and its potential as it executed the Brand Blueprint. In my new role as interim CEO, I will continue to work with a talented leadership team Brian put in place over the last 13 years, along with the powerful culture at Hasbro to supercharge the blueprint and build on the company's strong momentum. 
Hasbro is performing at a high level and with a clear, well-understood strategy. To ensure our success continues, I will be focused on 5 key priorities: supporting the amazing people at Hasbro; ensuring they have what they need to succeed while advancing our purpose-driven culture; executing the Brand Blueprint. This strategy is central to continuing Hasbro's transformation as a global play and entertainment company. 
We are beginning to see the full Blueprint execution come to life with significant potential to grow revenue and profit in the years ahead. Accelerating the growth of our Entertainment and Wizards of the Coast businesses, where we have unique and distinct advantages in the market and a differentiated business model relative to our competitors, delivering the guidance established for the year while helping the organization manage through supply chain challenges and continuing to drive strong cash generation in the business to pay down debt and fund the dividend. This should sound familiar to many of you as it is what the leadership team has been focused on as well. It's fitting that the strong third quarter results reflect the power of the Blueprint with significant growth in Entertainment as it returns to pre-pandemic levels, with another strong quarter in both tabletop and digital gaming from Wizards of the Coast, and with only a small decline in our Consumer Products business as we work to meet robust demand for Hasbro brands despite supply chain disruption. 
The diversification of the business enabled us to deliver a very strong quarter with 11% revenue growth, 6% adjusted operating profit growth, 5% gains in adjusted EBITDA and earnings and to generate significant cash. Deb will speak shortly in more detail to the third quarter performance. 
A clear proof point of the Brand Blueprint strategy and the omnichannel storytelling opportunity for our brands is in the success of the CGI animated feature, MY LITTLE PONY: A New Generation, which debuted on Netflix September 24. In its first weekend, the movie reached #1 on Netflix in the kid's top 10 across 86 countries. It also reached the #1 spot for movies regardless of genre or target demo in 20 countries, including the U.K., Germany, Brazil and Mexico. The success of the film was made possible by the collaboration and partnership of the talented brand teams at Hasbro with the teams at eOne, who together created a beautiful engaging film for fans around the world to enjoy. The film's success is also a testament to their agility to successfully market and launch a picture originally planned for theatrical release, on a streaming platform. The movie success builds deeper connections with consumers, driving incredible engagement on social media across Instagram and TikTok. 
The brand's relaunch powered by an all-new main 5 cast of ponies drove revenue growth for the franchise for the second straight quarter and the first positive quarter since the fourth quarter of 2017. Third quarter point-of-sale momentum began to rebound as the merchandise tied to the brand introduction and movie began to hit shelves. In the 4 weeks leading up to the movie, POS was up mid-single digits globally, and the week following the movie resulted in global POS gains of more than 150%. This trend has remained very strong in the weeks following. 
The movie launch was further supported with a robust licensing program, including a dedicated MY LITTLE PONY shop on Amazon and cross-category campaigns at several major global retailers. We've seen a favorable response from retailers and consumers, and the entertainment plan is only beginning as we are supporting the film with a robust content road map from eOne, including Netflix specials and new series as well as digital content in the coming year. 
Another significant milestone this quarter was the launch of Hasbro's PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS toy and games lines in markets around the world. Brought into the Hasbro portfolio via the eOne acquisition, these brands significantly strengthened Hasbro's presence in the preschool market. We developed deep lines for each brand as well as expanding their licensed consumer products presence. Each of these launches are off to strong starts and contributed to growth in the quarter. But they, among many other brand campaigns, were limited in their upside in the short term due to the supply chain challenges global companies are facing. In the third quarter, we had orders for approximately $100 million, which did not ship by quarter end. The vast majority of this has already been delivered in the fourth quarter. These factors were more than offset by the contribution of our Entertainment business, which is up substantially versus last year's third quarter, and up versus 2019, as well as the continuing momentum in the Wizards of the Coast business through our differentiated strategy, they delivered the revenue and profit growth for the quarter. 
As we look to the fourth quarter and the holiday season, there was strong demand for Hasbro toys and games. We are expertly managing the supply chain to ensure the shelves will be filled with Hasbro products this holiday. As a result, we believe we will grow revenue in the fourth quarter through the combination of our 3 business segments, and deliver full year double-digit revenue growth in the range of 13% to 16%, along with adjusted operating profit margins in line with last year's adjusted rate of approximately 15%. 
Before turning the call to Deb, I want to touch briefly on the plan for naming a permanent CEO. Our Board is and always has been actively engaged in succession planning for the CEO and other senior executive roles. This work provides a strong foundation for the naming of a new long-term leader for Hasbro and is well underway. Until that time, I am working closely with the outstanding group of talented individuals making up our senior management team. 
In addition to Deb, joining me today for the Q&A portion, we have Chris Cocks, President and COO of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming; Eric Nyman, Chief Consumer Officer and COO of Hasbro Consumer Products; and Darren Throop, CEO of eOne. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,1683272866,2412524,"Hasbro, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","On behalf of Hasbro employees globally, I would like to thank Rich for stepping up at this time for us, our Board, our shareholders and our company.

The past couple of weeks have been difficult for all of us at Hasbro. Brian is missed, but the impact he made is unmistakable. We heard from so many of you remarking on Brian's leadership and your positive personal interactions with him. Thank you for sharing these memories with us. .
Brian empowered me and the executive team to run Hasbro, and together we are, and we'll continue doing that. Brian was proud of our third quarter results. They showcased the strength of Hasbro's unique business model with growth in Entertainment and at Wizards in both tabletop and digital gaming. Our results also show the strength of our global teams as they expertly manage through supply chain disruptions, and position us for growth in the fourth quarter and for the year. Brian believed as we do in investing to grow to unlock Hasbro's full potential and create value for our shareholders. Our priorities remain the same, and we are executing against those priorities. 
The quarter highlighted our focus on delevering our balance sheet as we repaid an additional $400 million of debt, bringing our year-to-date total to $972.5 million of long-term debt retired. We also paid the dividend, which has been maintained following the eOne acquisition, and throughout the pandemic. At quarter end, cash on hand was $1.2 billion, and we continue to make significant progress toward our goal of returning to our target of 2 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA and maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
For the quarter, revenue grew 11% versus last year and 6% versus pro forma 2019. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MY LITTLE PONY, PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS were among our largest revenue gaining properties globally in the quarter, further supported by significant Entertainment deliveries. These include MY LITTLE PONY: A New Generation for Netflix, Yellowjackets for Showtime; Fear the Walking Dead for international markets; Come from Away in Finch for Apple TV as well as the rookie for ABC. Entertainment segment revenues grew 76%, with gains in scripted and unscripted television live action and animated film and animated content. 
This performance has us well on the way to reach 2019 levels of Entertainment revenue for the full year, excluding the music business over the second half of the year. The segment delivered adjusted operating profit of $42.1 million or 12.9% operating profit margin, up from an adjusted loss of $3.6 million last year. We're developing over 200 projects across film and TV, including content for over 30 Hasbro brands for the coming years. Year-to-date through September, we've invested approximately $526 million in content development, and continue to anticipate a full year spend range of $675 million to $750 million. 
For the fourth quarter, we have significant deliveries planned including [ Gray Male ], a new scripted program for Netflix; additional episodes of the [ Rookie ] and Yellowjackets, and the films [ Clifford: The Big Red Dog ] and Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris. Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenues increased 32%, and Wizards had a great third quarter, and we expect the business to deliver its goal of doubling from its 2018 revenue by the end of 2021, 2 years ahead of plan. 
MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS led this growth, both in the quarter and over the past few years, with gains in both tabletop and digital gaming revenues. It was the second largest quarter in Wizards' history behind only Q2 of this year. Among the MAGIC releases in the quarter, our third quarter premier set adventures in the Forgotten Realms, launched July 23, and became our first co-branded premier set. [ Sands ] of both MAGIC and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS embrace the product, and it's on track to be our best selling summer release of all time. 
Importantly, our digital investments are driving revenue growth. MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena Mobile continues to grow. It's a meaningful source of new players, and our leases were bolstered by their engagement in the game. Our licensed Digital Gaming business also delivered strong growth in the quarter. Operating profit in the segment increased on the higher revenues. Investments in future game development and support of new game launches as well as increased digital gaming depreciation, reduced operating profit margin from last year. 
Consumer Products revenue declined 3%. There is strong demand for our brands, but we were unable to fulfill approximately $100 million of product we had orders for during the quarter. Including these missed shipments, revenue would have increased 5%. In September, we shipped the most volume ever domestically in a single month. And through today, we've shipped the majority of what we didn't deliver in the third quarter. This achievement is remarkable given it was accomplished in the middle of a global pandemic, with unprecedented supply chain challenges across the globe. 
As we shared last quarter, we took steps early to mitigate risk, including activating alternate ports in China and the U.S., expanding our shipping capacity, working closely with customers to provide support where we can, and prioritize supply based on inventory and customer needs, and in certain instances using air freight to ensure delivery. The team has done an amazing job and continues to work nonstop. 
Global point of sale declined mid-single digits. As we improve our in-stock levels and see the effects of a significant increase in advertising spend and [ auto vile ] execution, we expect significant improvement. Within Consumer Products, Hasbro Gaming revenues grew in the quarter, led by demand across our gaming portfolio. And Emerging Brands revenue was up, fueled by our toy and game launches of PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS. In our franchise brands, Rich already spoke to the success of MY LITTLE PONY, and how this positions us well in the relaunch of the brand. TRANSFORMERS revenue increased in the quarter. The final chapter of the [ War for Cybertron Trilogy ] launched July 29 on Netflix, driving continued demand in our generation fan product. We also celebrated a new milestone for the TRANSFORMERS franchise when Universal Studios, Beijing, opened TRANSFORMERS Metro base, the first-ever TRANSFORMERS themed land. 
In partnership with Paramount production on TRANSFORMERS, Rise of The Beast continues for theatrical release next summer. Partner Brand revenue declined, but Hasbro products for the Marvel portfolio grew, including Marvel Legends and the new preschool product line launch supporting [ Spity ] and His Amazing Friends. We also introduced new products to support Marvel Studios Disney+ Series, and the theatrical release of Marvel Studios, [ Chengxi ] and the Legend of the 10 rings. Blockbusters revenue increased with the primary launch of the toy line in August for the feature film goes busters [ After Life ] from Sony Pictures coming to Theater's November 19. 
Operating profit for the Consumer Products segment decreased $15.8 million, reflecting the lower revenue and incremental expense for freight and related costs. Price increases to mitigate the higher expenses in shipping and input costs went into effect in most markets in August, and will be fully implemented for the fourth quarter. 
Looking at our overall Hasbro P&L, gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization declined 130 basis points. This reflected essentially flat cost of sales dollars. Given favorable mix and growth in Entertainment, cost of sales declined 340 basis points as a percent of revenue. The robust entertainment revenue growth drove an associated increase in program amortization of 470 basis points. Product development increased $17 million led by incremental investments in future tabletop and digital games at Wizards and our ongoing commitment to innovation across the business. Advertising expense increased $26 million, including promotional activity and support of the MY LITTLE PONY movie and advertising behind new Wizards game launches. We have aggressive advertising plans for this holiday season, shifting more dollars this year into the fourth quarter to drive point of sale. We will, however, closely match this expense with inventory availability. 
Adjusted SG&A increased $35 million, and continues to reflect higher expenses as the business returns to pre-COVID levels. This includes higher freight costs, incremental marketing and sales expense, increased depreciation associated with capitalized digital games and increased compensation. Despite these higher expenses, as G&A remained flat as a percentage of revenue. The adjusted underlying tax rate for the quarter was 23.4% compared to 19.9% a year ago. The rate is mainly driven by a change in the mix of income. We continue to expect the full year underlying rate to remain at approximately 21%. 
Our balance sheet is strong. In addition to our cash position and lower debt, DSOs were 68 days, a reduction of 5 days compared to Q3 2020, reflecting both higher revenue and good collections despite shipping a large volume of product late in the quarter. Inventory increased slightly year-over-year but declined absent FX. At quarter end, we have lessened finished goods on hand than typical and significantly more in-transit inventory. In general, total transit times have nearly doubled across all lanes. And on certain lanes, transit times are as much as 50 days longer compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance has us on track to meet our guidance for double-digit revenue growth, which we now are expecting in the range of 13% to 16% for the full year, and maintaining an adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%. 
We have orders to support the high end of the revenue growth range but there are supply chain factors out of our control, which could impact our ability to fully achieve the upside. I am incredibly proud of how the organization has come together this year. Despite many obstacles, our results showcase the strength of our business, our strategy and our team. Our leadership team is now happy to take your questions."

It is a responsibility of the Board to think through. And that work that they've been doing, I think, provides a very strong foundation for the naming of a new long-term CEO, and that process is well underway. 
I will say the commitment and belief in the Brand Blueprint as the strategy for Hasbro go forward is greater than it's ever been. I think what you saw in this quarter is just the beginning of the potential of the Blueprint to drive this company forward. I'll say -- use the Brian is -- I guess right now to say this is not a point of arrival for Hasbro -- or not a point of departure for Hasbro, it's a point of -- sorry, not a point of arrival but a point of departure, right?

But the important thing is we've got everything in place, so there will be Hasbro toys and games on the shelves this holiday season. 
The team has put a lot of process in place. some of which includes air freight. Our air freight expense was much higher in the third quarter than it typically is, and we do expect it to be higher in the fourth quarter. We don't intend to take additional price increases this year. So what we have built in is what is there to cover our costs. So overall, we still are in firm belief that we can hit our guidance of double-digit revenue growth at 13% to 16%. We have orders for the high end, but some things will be beyond our control.

To follow up on earlier question, even top end of guidance for Q4 would imply perhaps less than 10% operating profit margin. First, is my calculation correct? And I know there are some moving parts like Prime Day comps and MAGIC card release sort of cadence. But could you perhaps spend a few minutes going over kind of puts and takes?

And as a matter of fact, the $100 million that shifted from Q3 into Q4, we talked about most of that's already been delivered. And in fact, if you look at just our inventory, never mind retail inventory, 40% of our inventory balance at the end of the quarter was in transit. So that's here now, and we can ship that. So we're very excited about the opportunity. We have plenty of things on the water. We are going to continue to use air freight for the quarter, and the team has done a terrific job, actually making sure that we will have full shelves of products, Hasbro toys and games for the holiday season. .
That being said, some of that costs a bit more. And we've also talked a bit about advertising. It's very important that the consumer comes and takes away that product. So in an effort to make sure that the POS is there that we're reaching the consumer will have higher advertising expense in the quarter as well. So some of the puts and takes, some of the costs are going to be a bit higher which is why we said we believe our overall gross margin will be more in line with 2019 -- pro forma 2019 than 2020 because of the excellent deliveries that we expect on the Entertainment side, the good mix from our Wizards of the Coast business, but also our Consumer Products business, which does have some pressures on the cost side as well. 
So all of those things brought together, which is the beauty of our portfolio, and our advanced business strategy. We have 3 businesses that work together that are going to allow us to achieve that revenue growth and operating profit margins that are in line with a year ago at about 15%. That being said, we also believe in our medium-term guidance that there is no inherent reason why we can't have operating profit margins over 16%. And we're well on our way to managing that. We're just dealing with some short-term issues that the rest of the world are dealing with as well."

Our capital allocation priorities really are the same. First and foremost, we invest in our own business. You see that in the growth in Entertainment this quarter. You see it in the growth in Wizards. You see it behind all the wonderful innovation in our Consumer Products business. So we do believe in investing in ourselves first. Beyond that, we are committed to getting back to the 2 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Right now, that is the right place for us. 
We believe that lets us keep investing for the future and continuing the growth trajectory that Hasbro has been on. And then thirdly, we will return excess cash to our shareholders. We have had maintained our dividend even after the acquisition of eOne. We maintained our dividend throughout the pandemic. That's important to us and to our Board as well.

As we roll into 2022, we see strong cadence of continued production, both on returning series, but also on new series. Obviously, since the acquisition, we've been really working hard on Hasbro content. I think it was mentioned before in the call, there's over 30 brands in development, and there's multiple entertainment streams being developed against those brands. Meaning in some regards, like for TRANSFORMERS, for instance, we've got a feature film in production. We've also got animated content coming and other programs planned for TRANSFORMERS. And you'll see that across the entire Hasbro portfolio.

So it's a matter of, I think, the -- all industries are facing a bit of this right now. But we do have the opportunity to reinvent our product line -- the majority of our product line every year, and therefore, we can just take cost out of it as we do that.

So we want our retailers to have predictability for their season as well. However, they set the ultimate price to the consumer, and there'll be plenty of Hasbro toys and games for the consumer to buy this holiday season. ."

I'm Rich Stoddart, Interim CEO at Hasbro. Before we officially begin the remarks on the call today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the passing of our beloved leader and friend, Brian Gold",1283,"Thank you, Debbie, and welcome to everyone joining us today. I'm Rich Stoddart, Interim CEO at Hasbro. Before we officially begin the remarks on the call today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the passing of our beloved leader and friend, Brian Goldner. I know many of you share in our sadness for his untimely passing. Brian was not only an accomplished CEO, he was a true visionary who transformed an almost 100-year-old toy and game company into a leading global play and entertainment company, but his impact can be felt well beyond Hasbro. He changed the game completely. He believed in the power of a story, seeing the potential for omnichannel storytelling and content built on powerful brands. He architected a compelling road map for Hasbro's growth in the Brand Blueprint strategy, and was so proud of where it has taken Hasbro, but even more so in its power and future potential now with eOne as an integrated part of the family. 
I had the privilege to work together with Brian and the Hasbro team for the last 7 years, and serve on the company Board, most recently as Lead Independent Director. During that time, the company transformed its talent, its culture, its brands and its potential as it executed the Brand Blueprint. In my new role as interim CEO, I will continue to work with a talented leadership team Brian put in place over the last 13 years, along with the powerful culture at Hasbro to supercharge the Blueprint and build on the company's strong momentum.  
Hasbro is performing at a high level and with a clear, well-understood strategy. To ensure our success continues, I will be focused on 5 key priorities: supporting the amazing people at Hasbro; ensuring they have what they need to succeed while advancing our purpose-driven culture; executing the Brand Blueprint. This strategy is central to continuing Hasbro's transformation as a global play and entertainment company. We are beginning to see the full Blueprint execution come to life with significant potential to grow revenue and profit in the years ahead. Accelerating the growth of our Entertainment and Wizards of the Coast businesses, where we have unique and distinct advantages in the market and a differentiated business model relative to our competitors. Delivering the guidance established for the year while helping the organization manage through supply chain challenges and continuing to drive strong cash generation in the business to pay down debt and fund the dividend. 
This should sound familiar to many of you as it is what the leadership team has been focused on as well. It's fitting that the strong third quarter results reflect the power of the Blueprint with significant growth in Entertainment as it returns to pre-pandemic levels, with another strong quarter in both tabletop and Digital Gaming from Wizards of the Coast, and with only a small decline in our Consumer Products business as we work to meet robust demand for Hasbro brands despite supply chain disruption.  
The diversification of the business enabled us to deliver a very strong quarter with 11% revenue growth, 6% adjusted operating profit growth, 5% gains in adjusted EBITDA and earnings and to generate significant cash. Deb will speak shortly in more detail to the third quarter performance.  
A clear proof point of the Brand Blueprint strategy and the omnichannel storytelling opportunity for our brands is in the success of the CGI animated feature, MY LITTLE PONY: A New Generation, which debuted on Netflix September 24. In its first weekend, the movie reached #1 on Netflix in the kid's top 10 across 86 countries. It also reached the #1 spot for movies regardless of genre or target demo in 20 countries, including the U.K., Germany, Brazil and Mexico. The success of the film was made possible by the collaboration and partnership of the talented brand teams at Hasbro with the teams at eOne, who together created a beautiful engaging film for fans around the world to enjoy. The film's success is also a testament to their agility to successfully market and launch a picture originally planned for theatrical release on a streaming platform. The movie's success builds deeper connections with consumers, driving incredible engagement on social media across Instagram and TikTok.  
The brand's relaunch powered by an all-new main 5 cast of ponies drove revenue growth for the franchise for the second straight quarter and the first positive quarter since the fourth quarter of 2017. Third quarter point-of-sale momentum began to rebound as the merchandise tied to the brand introduction and movie began to hit shelves. In the 4 weeks leading up to the movie, POS was up mid-single digits globally, and the week following the movie resulted in global POS gains of more than 150%. This trend has remained very strong in the weeks following.  
The movie launch was further supported with a robust licensing program, including a dedicated MY LITTLE PONY shop on Amazon and cross-category campaigns at several major global retailers. We've seen a favorable response from retailers and consumers, and the entertainment plan is only beginning as we are supporting the film with a robust content road map from eOne, including Netflix specials and new series as well as digital content in the coming year.  
Another significant milestone this quarter was the launch of Hasbro's PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS toy and games lines in markets around the world. Brought into the Hasbro portfolio via the eOne acquisition, these brands significantly strengthened Hasbro's presence in the preschool market. We developed deep lines for each brand as well as expanding their licensed consumer products presence. Each of these launches are off to strong starts and contributed to growth in the quarter. But they, among many other brand campaigns, were limited in their upside in the short term due to the supply chain challenges global companies are facing. In the third quarter, we had orders for approximately $100 million, which did not shift by quarter end. The vast majority of this has already been delivered in the fourth quarter. 
These factors were more than offset by the contribution of our Entertainment business, which is up substantially versus last year's third quarter, and up versus 2019, as well as the continuing momentum in the Wizards of the Coast business. Through our differentiated strategy, they delivered the revenue and profit growth for the quarter.  
As we look to the fourth quarter and the holiday season, there is strong demand for Hasbro toys and games. We are expertly managing the supply chain to ensure the shelves will be filled with Hasbro products this holiday. As a result, we believe we will grow revenue in the fourth quarter through the combination of our 3 business segments, and deliver full year double-digit revenue growth in the range of 13% to 16%, along with adjusted operating profit margins in line with last year's adjusted rate of approximately 15%.  
Before turning the call to Deb, I want to touch briefly on the plan for naming a permanent CEO. Our Board is and always has been actively engaged in succession planning for the CEO and other senior executive roles. This work provides a strong foundation for the naming of a new long-term leader for Hasbro and is well underway. Until that time, I am working closely with the outstanding group of talented individuals making up our senior management team.  
In addition to Deb, joining me today for the Q&A portion, we have Chris Cocks, President and COO of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming; Eric Nyman, Chief Consumer Officer and COO of Hasbro Consumer Products; and Darren Throop, CEO of eOne.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,1683272866,2412695,"Hasbro, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. On behalf of Hasbro employees globally, I would like to thank Rich for stepping up at this time for us, our Board, our shareholders and our company. The past couple of weeks have been difficult for all of us at Hasbro. Brian is mis",1636,"Good morning, everyone. On behalf of Hasbro employees globally, I would like to thank Rich for stepping up at this time for us, our Board, our shareholders and our company. The past couple of weeks have been difficult for all of us at Hasbro. Brian is missed, but the impact he made is unmistakable. We heard from so many of you remarking on Brian's leadership and your positive personal interactions with him. Thank you for sharing these memories with us. . 
Brian empowered me and the executive team to run Hasbro, and together we are, and will continue doing that. Brian was proud of our third quarter results. They showcased the strength of Hasbro's unique business model with growth in Entertainment and at Wizards in both tabletop and digital gaming. Our results also show the strength of our global teams as they expertly manage through supply chain disruptions, and position us for growth in the fourth quarter and for the year. Brian believed, as we do, in investing to grow to unlock Hasbro's full potential and create value for our shareholders. Our priorities remain the same, and we are executing against those priorities.  
The quarter highlighted our focus on delevering our balance sheet as we repaid an additional $400 million of debt, bringing our year-to-date total to $972.5 million of long-term debt retired. We also paid the dividend, which has been maintained following the eOne acquisition and throughout the pandemic. At quarter end, cash on hand was $1.2 billion, and we continue to make significant progress toward our goal of returning to our target of 2 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA and maintaining our investment-grade rating.  
For the quarter, revenue grew 11% versus last year and 6% versus pro forma 2019. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MY LITTLE PONY, PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS were among our largest revenue gaining properties globally in the quarter, further supported by significant Entertainment deliveries. These include MY LITTLE PONY: A New Generation for Netflix, Yellowjackets for showtime; Fear the Walking Dead for international markets; Come from Away and Finch for Apple TV as well as The Rookie for ABC. Entertainment segment revenues grew 76%, with gains in scripted and unscripted television, live action and animated film, and animated content.  
This performance has us well on the way to reach 2019 levels of Entertainment revenue for the full year, excluding the music business over the second half of the year. The segment delivered adjusted operating profit of $42.1 million or 12.9% operating profit margin, up from an adjusted loss of $3.6 million last year. We're developing over 200 projects across film and TV, including content for over 30 Hasbro brands for the coming years. Year-to-date through September, we've invested approximately $526 million in content development, and continue to anticipate a full year spend range of $675 million to $750 million.  
For the fourth quarter, we have significant deliveries planned including Graymail, a new scripted program for Netflix; additional episodes of The Rookie and Yellowjackets, and the films [ Clifford the Big Red Dog  and Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris. 
Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenues increased 32%. Wizards had a great third quarter, and we expect the business to deliver its goal of doubling from its 2018 revenue by the end of 2021, 2 years ahead of plan.  
MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS led this growth, both in the quarter and over the past few years, with gains in both tabletop and digital gaming revenues. It was the second largest quarter in Wizards' history behind only Q2 of this year. Among the MAGIC releases in the quarter, our third quarter premier set, Adventures in the Forgotten Realms, launched July 23, and became our first co-branded premier set. Fans of both MAGIC and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS embrace the product, and it's on track to be our best selling summer release of all time.  
Importantly, our digital investments are driving revenue growth. MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena Mobile continues to grow. It's a meaningful source of new players, and our leases were bolstered by their engagement in the game. 
Our licensed Digital Gaming business also delivered strong growth in the quarter. Operating profit in the segment increased on the higher revenues. Investments in future game development and support of new game launches as well as increased digital gaming depreciation reduced operating profit margin from last year.  
Consumer Products revenue declined 3%. There is strong demand for our brands, but we were unable to fulfill approximately $100 million of product we had orders for during the quarter. Including these missed shipments, revenue would have increased 5%. In September, we shipped the most volume ever domestically in a single month. And through today, we've shipped the majority of what we didn't deliver in the third quarter. This achievement is remarkable given it was accomplished in the middle of a global pandemic, with unprecedented supply chain challenges across the globe.  
As we shared last quarter, we took steps early to mitigate risk, including activating alternate ports in China and the U.S., expanding our shipping capacity, working closely with customers to provide support where we can, and prioritize supply based on inventory and customer needs, and, in certain instances, using air freight to ensure delivery. The team has done an amazing job and continues to work nonstop.  
Global point of sale declined mid-single digits. As we improve our in-stock levels and see the effects of a significant increase in advertising spend and [ auto vile ] execution, we expect significant improvement. 
Within Consumer Products, Hasbro Gaming revenues grew in the quarter, led by demand across our gaming portfolio, and Emerging Brands revenue was up, fueled by our toy and game launches of PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS. In our franchise brands, Rich already spoke to the success of MY LITTLE PONY, and how this positions us well in the relaunch of the brand. TRANSFORMERS' revenue increased in the quarter. The final chapter of the War for Cybertron Trilogy launched July 29 on Netflix, driving continued demand in our generation fan product. We also celebrated a new milestone for the TRANSFORMERS franchise when Universal Studios, Beijing, opened TRANSFORMERS Metro base, the first-ever TRANSFORMERS themed land. In partnership with Paramount production on TRANSFORMERS, Rise of The Beast continues for theatrical release next summer. 
Partner Brand revenue declined, but Hasbro products for the Marvel portfolio grew, including Marvel Legends and the new preschool product line launch supporting Spidey and His Amazing Friends. We also introduced new products to support Marvel Studios Disney+ Series, and the theatrical release of Marvel Studios, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Ghostbusters revenue increased with the primary launch of the toy line in August for the feature film Ghostbusters: Afterlife from Sony Pictures coming to theaters November 19.  
Operating profit for the Consumer Products segment decreased $15.8 million, reflecting the lower revenue and incremental expense for freight and related costs. Price increases to mitigate the higher expenses in shipping and input costs went into effect in most markets in August, and will be fully implemented for the fourth quarter.  
Looking at our overall Hasbro P&L, gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization declined 130 basis points. This reflected essentially flat cost of sales dollars. Given favorable mix and growth in Entertainment, cost of sales declined 340 basis points as a percent of revenue. The robust Entertainment revenue growth drove an associated increase in program amortization of 470 basis points. Product development increased $17 million led by incremental investments in future tabletop and digital games at Wizards and our ongoing commitment to innovation across the business. 
Advertising expense increased $26 million, including promotional activity and support of the MY LITTLE PONY movie and advertising behind new Wizards game launches. We have aggressive advertising plans for this holiday season, shifting more dollars this year into the fourth quarter to drive point of sale. We will, however, closely match this expense with inventory availability.  
Adjusted SG&A increased $35 million, and continues to reflect higher expenses as the business returns to pre-COVID levels. This includes higher freight costs, incremental marketing and sales expense, increased depreciation associated with capitalized digital games and increased compensation. Despite these higher expenses, SG&A remained flat as a percentage of revenue. The adjusted underlying tax rate for the quarter was 23.4% compared to 19.9% a year ago. The rate is mainly driven by a change in the mix of income. We continue to expect the full year underlying rate to remain at approximately 21%.  
Our balance sheet is strong. In addition to our cash position and lower debt, DSOs were 68 days, a reduction of 5 days compared to Q3 2020, reflecting both higher revenue and good collections despite shipping a large volume of product late in the quarter. 
Inventory increased slightly year-over-year but declined absent FX. At quarter end, we have lessened finished goods on hand than typical and significantly more in-transit inventory. In general, total transit times have nearly doubled across all lanes. And on certain lanes, transit times are as much as 50 days longer compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
Our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance has us on track to meet our guidance for double-digit revenue growth, which we now are expecting in the range of 13% to 16% for the full year and maintaining an adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%. 
We have orders to support the high end of the revenue growth range but there are supply chain factors out of our control, which could impact our ability to fully achieve the upside. 
I am incredibly proud of how the organization has come together this year. Despite many obstacles, our results showcase the strength of our business, our strategy and our team. Our leadership team is now happy to take your questions."

It is a responsibility of the Board to think through. And that work that they've been doing, I think, provides a very strong foundation for the naming of a new long-term CEO, and that process is well underway. 
I will say the commitment and belief in the Brand Blueprint as the strategy for Hasbro go forward is greater than it's ever been. I think what you saw in this quarter is just the beginning of the potential of the Blueprint to drive this company forward. I'll say -- use of Brian isn't, I guess right now to say this is not a point of arrival for Hasbro -- or it's not a point of departure for Hasbro, it's a point of -- sorry, not a point of arrival but a point of departure, right? This is the beginning of the Blueprint proving itself out in the world.

And I'm like, okay, I'm not going to fell for another brand. I'll just go with that for now. But the important thing is we've got everything in place, so there will be Hasbro toys and games on the shelves this holiday season. 
The team has put a lot of process in place, some of which includes air freight. Our air freight expense was much higher in the third quarter than it typically is, and we do expect it to be higher in the fourth quarter. We don't intend to take additional price increases this year. So what we have built in is what -- is there to cover our costs. So overall, we still are in firm belief that we can hit our guidance of double-digit revenue growth at 13% to 16%. We have orders for the high end, but some things will be beyond our control.

And in fact, if you look at just our inventory, never mind retail inventory, 40% of our inventory balance at the end of the quarter was in transit. So that's here now, and we can ship that. So we're very excited about the opportunity. We have plenty of things on the water. We are going to continue to use air freight for the quarter, and the team has done a terrific job, actually making sure that we will have full shelves of products, Hasbro toys and games for the holiday season. 
That being said, some of that costs a bit more. And we've also talked a bit about advertising. It's very important that the consumer comes and takes away that product. So in an effort to make sure that the POS is there that we're reaching the consumer will have higher advertising expense in the quarter as well. So some of the puts and takes, some of the costs are going to be a bit higher which is why we said we believe our overall gross margin will be more in line with 2019 -- pro forma 2019 than 2020 because of the excellent deliveries that we expect on the Entertainment side, the good mix from our Wizards of the Coast business, but also our Consumer Products business, which does have some pressures on the cost side as well. 
So all of those things brought together, which is the beauty of our portfolio, and our advanced business strategy. We have 3 businesses that work together that are going to allow us to achieve that revenue growth and operating profit margins that are in line with a year ago at about 15%. That being said, we also believe in our medium-term guidance that there is no inherent reason why we can't have operating profit margins over 16%. And we're well on our way to managing that. We're just dealing with some short-term issues that the rest of the world are dealing with as well."

Our capital allocation priorities really are the same. First and foremost, we invest in our own business. You see that in the growth in Entertainment this quarter. You see it in the growth in Wizards. You see it behind all the wonderful innovation in our Consumer Products business. So we do believe in investing in ourselves first. Beyond that, we are committed to getting back to the 2 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Right now, that is the right place for us. 
We believe that lets us keep investing for the future and continuing the growth trajectory that Hasbro has been on. And then thirdly, we will return excess cash to our shareholders. We have had maintained our dividend even after the acquisition of eOne. We maintained our dividend throughout the pandemic. That's important to us and to our Board as well.

As we roll into 2022, we see strong cadence of continued production, both on returning series, but also on new series. Obviously, since the acquisition, we've been really working hard on Hasbro content. I think it was mentioned before in the call, there's over 30 brands in development, and there's multiple entertainment streams being developed against those brands. Meaning in some regards, like for TRANSFORMERS, for instance, we've got a feature film in production. We've also got animated content coming and other programs planned for TRANSFORMERS, and you'll see that across the entire Hasbro portfolio.

So it's a matter of, I think, the -- all industries are facing a bit of this right now. But we do have the opportunity to reinvent our product line -- the majority of our product line every year, and therefore, we can just take cost out of it as we do that.

I'm Rich Stoddart, Interim CEO at Hasbro. Before we officially begin the remarks on the call today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the passing of our beloved leader and friend, Brian Gold",1283,"Thank you, Debbie, and welcome to everyone joining us today. I'm Rich Stoddart, Interim CEO at Hasbro. Before we officially begin the remarks on the call today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the passing of our beloved leader and friend, Brian Goldner. I know many of you share in our sadness for his untimely passing.
Brian was not only an accomplished CEO, he was a true visionary who transformed an almost 100-year-old toy and game company into a leading global play and entertainment company, but his impact can be felt well beyond Hasbro. He changed the game completely. He believed in the power of a story, seeing the potential for omnichannel storytelling and content built on powerful brands. He architected a compelling road map for Hasbro's growth in the Brand Blueprint strategy, and was so proud of where it has taken Hasbro, but even more so in its power and future potential now with eOne as an integrated part of the family. 
I had the privilege to work together with Brian and the Hasbro team for the last 7 years, and serve on the company Board, most recently as Lead Independent Director. During that time, the company transformed its talent, its culture, its brands and its potential as it executed the Brand Blueprint. In my new role as interim CEO, I will continue to work with a talented leadership team Brian put in place over the last 13 years, along with the powerful culture at Hasbro to supercharge the Blueprint and build on the company's strong momentum.  
Hasbro is performing at a high level and with a clear, well-understood strategy. To ensure our success continues, I will be focused on 5 key priorities: supporting the amazing people at Hasbro; ensuring they have what they need to succeed while advancing our purpose-driven culture; executing the Brand Blueprint. This strategy is central to continuing Hasbro's transformation as a global play and entertainment company. We are beginning to see the full Blueprint execution come to life with significant potential to grow revenue and profit in the years ahead.
Accelerating the growth of our Entertainment and Wizards of the Coast businesses, where we have unique and distinct advantages in the market and a differentiated business model relative to our competitors. Delivering the guidance established for the year while helping the organization manage through supply chain challenges and continuing to drive strong cash generation in the business to pay down debt and fund the dividend. 
This should sound familiar to many of you as it is what the leadership team has been focused on as well. It's fitting that the strong third quarter results reflect the power of the Blueprint with significant growth in Entertainment as it returns to pre-pandemic levels, with another strong quarter in both tabletop and Digital Gaming from Wizards of the Coast, and with only a small decline in our Consumer Products business as we work to meet robust demand for Hasbro brands despite supply chain disruption.
The diversification of the business enabled us to deliver a very strong quarter with 11% revenue growth, 6% adjusted operating profit growth, 5% gains in adjusted EBITDA and earnings and to generate significant cash. Deb will speak shortly in more detail to the third quarter performance.
A clear proof point of the Brand Blueprint strategy and the omnichannel storytelling opportunity for our brands is in the success of the CGI animated feature, MY LITTLE PONY: A New Generation, which debuted on Netflix September 24. In its first weekend, the movie reached #1 on Netflix in the kid's top 10 across 86 countries. It also reached the #1 spot for movies regardless of genre or target demo in 20 countries, including the U.K., Germany, Brazil and Mexico.
The success of the film was made possible by the collaboration and partnership of the talented brand teams at Hasbro with the teams at eOne, who together created a beautiful engaging film for fans around the world to enjoy. The film's success is also a testament to their agility to successfully market and launch a picture originally planned for theatrical release on a streaming platform. The movie's success builds deeper connections with consumers, driving incredible engagement on social media across Instagram and TikTok.
 
The brand's relaunch powered by an all-new main 5 cast of ponies drove revenue growth for the franchise for the second straight quarter and the first positive quarter since the fourth quarter of 2017. Third quarter point-of-sale momentum began to rebound as the merchandise tied to the brand introduction and movie began to hit shelves. In the 4 weeks leading up to the movie, POS was up mid-single digits globally, and the week following the movie resulted in global POS gains of more than 150%. This trend has remained very strong in the weeks following.
The movie launch was further supported with a robust licensing program, including a dedicated MY LITTLE PONY shop on Amazon and cross-category campaigns at several major global retailers. We've seen a favorable response from retailers and consumers, and the entertainment plan is only beginning as we are supporting the film with a robust content road map from eOne, including Netflix specials and new series as well as digital content in the coming year.  
Another significant milestone this quarter was the launch of Hasbro's PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS toy and games lines in markets around the world. Brought into the Hasbro portfolio via the eOne acquisition, these brands significantly strengthened Hasbro's presence in the preschool market. We developed deep lines for each brand as well as expanding their licensed consumer products presence.
Each of these launches are off to strong starts and contributed to growth in the quarter. But they, among many other brand campaigns, were limited in their upside in the short term due to the supply chain challenges global companies are facing. In the third quarter, we had orders for approximately $100 million, which did not shift by quarter end. The vast majority of this has already been delivered in the fourth quarter. 
These factors were more than offset by the contribution of our Entertainment business, which is up substantially versus last year's third quarter, and up versus 2019, as well as the continuing momentum in the Wizards of the Coast business. Through our differentiated strategy, they delivered the revenue and profit growth for the quarter.
As we look to the fourth quarter and the holiday season, there is strong demand for Hasbro toys and games. We are expertly managing the supply chain to ensure the shelves will be filled with Hasbro products this holiday. As a result, we believe we will grow revenue in the fourth quarter through the combination of our 3 business segments, and deliver full year double-digit revenue growth in the range of 13% to 16%, along with adjusted operating profit margins in line with last year's adjusted rate of approximately 15%.
Before turning the call to Deb, I want to touch briefly on the plan for naming a permanent CEO. Our Board is and always has been actively engaged in succession planning for the CEO and other senior executive roles. This work provides a strong foundation for the naming of a new long-term leader for Hasbro and is well underway. Until that time, I am working closely with the outstanding group of talented individuals making up our senior management team.
In addition to Deb, joining me today for the Q&A portion, we have Chris Cocks, President and COO of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming; Eric Nyman, Chief Consumer Officer and COO of Hasbro Consumer Products; and Darren Throop, CEO of eOne.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,1683272866,2423167,"Hasbro, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. On behalf of Hasbro employees globally, I would like to thank Rich for stepping up at this time for us, our Board, our shareholders and our company. The past couple of weeks have been difficult for all of us at Hasbro. Brian is mis",1632,"Good morning, everyone. On behalf of Hasbro employees globally, I would like to thank Rich for stepping up at this time for us, our Board, our shareholders and our company. The past couple of weeks have been difficult for all of us at Hasbro. Brian is missed, but the impact he made is unmistakable. We heard from so many of you remarking on Brian's leadership and your positive personal interactions with him. Thank you for sharing these memories with us.
Brian empowered me and the executive team to run Hasbro, and together we are, and will continue doing that. Brian was proud of our third quarter results. They showcased the strength of Hasbro's unique business model with growth in Entertainment and at Wizards in both tabletop and digital gaming. Our results also show the strength of our global teams as they expertly manage through supply chain disruptions, and position us for growth in the fourth quarter and for the year. Brian believed, as we do, in investing to grow to unlock Hasbro's full potential and create value for our shareholders. Our priorities remain the same, and we are executing against those priorities.
The quarter highlighted our focus on delevering our balance sheet as we repaid an additional $400 million of debt, bringing our year-to-date total to $972.5 million of long-term debt retired. We also paid the dividend, which has been maintained following the eOne acquisition and throughout the pandemic. At quarter end, cash on hand was $1.2 billion, and we continue to make significant progress toward our goal of returning to our target of 2 to 2.5x debt to EBITDA and maintaining our investment-grade rating.
For the quarter, revenue grew 11% versus last year and 6% versus pro forma 2019. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MY LITTLE PONY, PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS were among our largest revenue gaining properties globally in the quarter, further supported by significant Entertainment deliveries. These include MY LITTLE PONY: A New Generation for Netflix, Yellowjackets for showtime; Fear the Walking Dead for international markets; Come from Away and Finch for Apple TV as well as The Rookie for ABC. Entertainment segment revenues grew 76%, with gains in scripted and unscripted television, live action and animated film, and animated content.
This performance has us well on the way to reach 2019 levels of Entertainment revenue for the full year, excluding the music business over the second half of the year. The segment delivered adjusted operating profit of $42.1 million or 12.9% operating profit margin, up from an adjusted loss of $3.6 million last year. We're developing over 200 projects across film and TV, including content for over 30 Hasbro brands for the coming years. Year-to-date through September, we've invested approximately $526 million in content development, and continue to anticipate a full year spend range of $675 million to $750 million.
For the fourth quarter, we have significant deliveries planned including Graymail, a new scripted program for Netflix; additional episodes of The Rookie and Yellowjackets, and the films, Clifford the Big Red Dog and Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris.
Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenues increased 32%. Wizards had a great third quarter, and we expect the business to deliver its goal of doubling from its 2018 revenue by the end of 2021, 2 years ahead of plan.
MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS led this growth, both in the quarter and over the past few years, with gains in both tabletop and digital gaming revenues. It was the second largest quarter in Wizards' history behind only Q2 of this year. Among the MAGIC releases in the quarter, our third quarter premier set, Adventures in the Forgotten Realms, launched July 23, and became our first co-branded premier set. Fans of both MAGIC and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS embrace the product, and it's on track to be our best-selling summer release of all time.
Importantly, our digital investments are driving revenue growth. MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena Mobile continues to grow. It's a meaningful source of new players, and our leases were bolstered by their engagement in the game. 
Our licensed Digital Gaming business also delivered strong growth in the quarter. Operating profit in the segment increased on the higher revenues. Investments in future game development and support of new game launches as well as increased digital gaming depreciation reduced operating profit margin from last year.
Consumer Products revenue declined 3%. There is strong demand for our brands, but we were unable to fulfill approximately $100 million of product we had orders for during the quarter. Including these missed shipments, revenue would have increased 5%. In September, we shipped the most volume ever domestically in a single month. And through today, we've shipped the majority of what we didn't deliver in the third quarter. This achievement is remarkable given it was accomplished in the middle of a global pandemic, with unprecedented supply chain challenges across the globe.
As we shared last quarter, we took steps early to mitigate risk, including activating alternate ports in China and the U.S., expanding our shipping capacity, working closely with customers to provide support where we can, and prioritize supply based on inventory and customer needs, and, in certain instances, using air freight to ensure delivery. The team has done an amazing job and continues to work nonstop.
Global point of sale declined mid-single digits. As we improve our in-stock levels and see the effects of a significant increase in advertising spend and out of aisle execution, we expect significant improvement.
Within Consumer Products, Hasbro Gaming revenues grew in the quarter, led by demand across our gaming portfolio, and Emerging Brands revenue was up, fueled by our toy and game launches of PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS. In our franchise brands, Rich already spoke to the success of MY LITTLE PONY, and how this positions us well in the relaunch of the brand. TRANSFORMERS' revenue increased in the quarter. The final chapter of the War for Cybertron Trilogy launched July 29 on Netflix, driving continued demand in our generation fan product.
We also celebrated a new milestone for the TRANSFORMERS franchise when Universal Studios, Beijing, opened TRANSFORMERS Metro base, the first-ever TRANSFORMERS themed land. In partnership with Paramount production on TRANSFORMERS, Rise of The Beast continues for theatrical release next summer.
Partner Brand revenue declined, but Hasbro products for the Marvel portfolio grew, including Marvel Legends and the new preschool product line launch supporting Spidey and His Amazing Friends. We also introduced new products to support Marvel Studios Disney+ Series, and the theatrical release of Marvel Studios, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Ghostbusters revenue increased with the primary launch of the toy line in August for the feature film Ghostbusters: Afterlife from Sony Pictures coming to theaters November 19.
Operating profit for the Consumer Products segment decreased $15.8 million, reflecting the lower revenue and incremental expense for freight and related costs. Price increases to mitigate the higher expenses in shipping and input costs went into effect in most markets in August, and will be fully implemented for the fourth quarter.  
Looking at our overall Hasbro P&L, gross margin, including cost of sales and program amortization declined 130 basis points. This reflected essentially flat cost of sales dollars.
Given favorable mix and growth in Entertainment, cost of sales declined 340 basis points as a percent of revenue. The robust Entertainment revenue growth drove an associated increase in program amortization of 470 basis points. Product development increased $17 million led by incremental investments in future tabletop and digital games at Wizards and our ongoing commitment to innovation across the business.
Advertising expense increased $26 million, including promotional activity and support of the MY LITTLE PONY movie and advertising behind new Wizards game launches. We have aggressive advertising plans for this holiday season, shifting more dollars this year into the fourth quarter to drive point of sale. We will, however, closely match this expense with inventory availability.
Adjusted SG&A increased $35 million, and continues to reflect higher expenses as the business returns to pre-COVID levels. This includes higher freight costs, incremental marketing and sales expense, increased depreciation associated with capitalized digital games and increased compensation. Despite these higher expenses, SG&A remained flat as a percentage of revenue. The adjusted underlying tax rate for the quarter was 23.4% compared to 19.9% a year ago. The rate is mainly driven by a change in the mix of income. We continue to expect the full year underlying rate to remain at approximately 21%.
Our balance sheet is strong. In addition to our cash position and lower debt, DSOs were 68 days, a reduction of 5 days compared to Q3 2020, reflecting both higher revenue and good collections despite shipping a large volume of product late in the quarter. 
Inventory increased slightly year-over-year but declined absent FX. At quarter end, we have lessened finished goods on hand than typical and significantly more in-transit inventory. In general, total transit times have nearly doubled across all lanes. And on certain lanes, transit times are as much as 50 days longer compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
Our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance has us on track to meet our guidance for double-digit revenue growth, which we now are expecting in the range of 13% to 16% for the full year and maintaining an adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%. 
We have orders to support the high end of the revenue growth range but there are supply chain factors out of our control, which could impact our ability to fully achieve the upside.
I am incredibly proud of how the organization has come together this year. Despite many obstacles, our results showcase the strength of our business, our strategy and our team. Our leadership team is now happy to take your questions."

So as I said in my remarks, the search for the permanent CEO is not something that is just beginning now. The Board is and always has been thinking about succession as a matter, of course. It is a responsibility of the Board to think through. And that work that they've been doing, I think, provides a very strong foundation for the naming of a new long-term CEO, and that process is well underway. 
I will say the commitment and belief in the Brand Blueprint as the strategy for Hasbro go forward is greater than it's ever been. I think what you saw in this quarter is just the beginning of the potential of the Blueprint to drive this company forward. I'll say -- use of Brian isn't, I guess right now to say this is not a point of arrival for Hasbro -- or it's not a point of departure for Hasbro, it's a point of -- sorry, not a point of arrival but a point of departure, right? This is the beginning of the Blueprint proving itself out in the world.

And I'm like, okay, I'm not going to fell for another brand. I'll just go with that for now. But the important thing is we've got everything in place, so there will be Hasbro toys and games on the shelves this holiday season.
The team has put a lot of process in place, some of which includes air freight. Our air freight expense was much higher in the third quarter than it typically is, and we do expect it to be higher in the fourth quarter. We don't intend to take additional price increases this year. So what we have built in is what -- is there to cover our costs.
So overall, we still are in firm belief that we can hit our guidance of double-digit revenue growth at 13% to 16%. We have orders for the high end, but some things will be beyond our control. And we believe that we can achieve operating profit levels in line with last year for the full year as well."

Maybe though, Chris, I'll just ask you if you want to comment any further on Eric's question?"

Yes, the MAGIC business had a very strong Q3, and has overall, had a very strong 2021. By the end of Q3, in fact, MAGIC is already bigger this year than it was in all of 2020, which was a record year for us. Arena is a major contributor to that. Mobile has been a terrific source of new users for the brand, and we see a very healthy crossover between users who come on board digitally, who migrate to tabletop, and likewise, tabletop players who want to play some more MAGIC and play, both on mobile and PC.
And so I think the combination of those factors plus the segmentation we've been driving in our business has done an excellent job in terms of growing our overall user base, enhancing our engagement with fans and driving our average revenue per user."

And in fact, if you look at just our inventory, never mind retail inventory, 40% of our inventory balance at the end of the quarter was in transit. So that's here now, and we can ship that. So we're very excited about the opportunity. We have plenty of things on the water. We are going to continue to use air freight for the quarter, and the team has done a terrific job, actually making sure that we will have full shelves of products, Hasbro toys and games for the holiday season. 
That being said, some of that costs a bit more. And we've also talked a bit about advertising. It's very important that the consumer comes and takes away that product. So in an effort to make sure that the POS is there that we're reaching the consumer will have higher advertising expense in the quarter as well. So some of the puts and takes, some of the costs are going to be a bit higher which is why we said we believe our overall gross margin will be more in line with 2019 -- pro forma 2019 than 2020 because of the excellent deliveries that we expect on the Entertainment side, the good mix from our Wizards of the Coast business, but also our Consumer Products business, which does have some pressures on the cost side as well. 
So all of those things brought together, which is the beauty of our portfolio, and our advanced business strategy. We have 3 businesses that work together that are going to allow us to achieve that revenue growth and operating profit margins that are in line with a year ago at about 15%. That being said, we also believe in our medium-term guidance that there is no inherent reason why we can't have operating profit margins over 16%. And we're well on our way to managing that. We're just dealing with some short-term issues that the rest of the world are dealing with as well."

First and foremost, we invest in our own business. You see that in the growth in Entertainment this quarter. You see it in the growth in Wizards. You see it behind all the wonderful innovation in our Consumer Products business. So we do believe in investing in ourselves first. Beyond that, we are committed to getting back to the 2 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Right now, that is the right place for us. 
We believe that lets us keep investing for the future and continuing the growth trajectory that Hasbro has been on. And then thirdly, we will return excess cash to our shareholders. We have had maintained our dividend even after the acquisition of eOne. We maintained our dividend throughout the pandemic. That's important to us and to our Board as well.

Obviously, since the acquisition, we've been really working hard on Hasbro content. I think it was mentioned before in the call, there's over 30 brands in development, and there's multiple entertainment streams being developed against those brands. Meaning in some regards, like for TRANSFORMERS, for instance, we've got a feature film in production. We've also got animated content coming and other programs planned for TRANSFORMERS, and you'll see that across the entire Hasbro portfolio.

So it's a matter of, I think, the -- all industries are facing a bit of this right now. But we do have the opportunity to reinvent our product line -- the majority of our product line every year, and therefore, we can just take cost out of it as we do that.

We feel confident that there will be plenty of Hasbro toys and games here for the holidays. And I think that's the headline we want to stress. We've already talked about the headwind of $100 million shifting from Q3 to Q4. And I do want to highlight, as Deb mentioned, the majority of that has already shipped to our customers around the world, which is really just highlighting that this is a phasing issue, not an issue of lost orders or lost sales. 
With regards to mitigation, we are proud of our teams. We took several steps to mitigate some of the challenges that we saw happening earlier in the year. We activated new ports in both China and the U.S. We've added multiple ocean carrier contracts to increase capacity around the world. We've expanded our trucker capacity as well, which helps move products to warehouses all over the world. And we're ready for Q4 with plans lined up to meet as much demand as possible to deliver peak shipments during the peak season. So I feel we're ready to go, and we appreciate the question."

That would be very disruptive to our retail partners as well as if you think about the cost of running a company to implement something like that at this point is very difficult, right?
So we want our retailers to have predictability for their season as well. However, they set the ultimate price to the consumer, and there'll be plenty of Hasbro toys and games for the consumer to buy this holiday season."
