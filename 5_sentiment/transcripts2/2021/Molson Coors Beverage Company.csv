But in many respects are consider us lucky. The revitalization plan we put in place in October of 2019 positioned our company well to weather the storms of 2020. Our business was leaner and more nimble, which put us in a better position to conserve resources as the circumstances dictated and to deploy them effectively as the circumstances allowed. And the results bear that out. 
When you consider what we set out to do under our revitalization plan, we accomplished an incredible amount in 2020, and that has given us a tremendous springboard for 2021. Our 2 largest brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite are our core, grew 6.1% and 8.6% in the U.S. off-premise, respectively. Our above-premium brands in the U.S. reached a record high percentage of the portfolio in the second half of 2020. 
Beyond beer, our first follow into nonalcohol cannabis beverages through the trust joint venture has netted the #1 dollar share spot in the entire Canadian cannabis beverage market. We increased our production capacity for our fast-growing sales by approximately 400%, and we approximately doubled our annual investments in our home count communities. That is the story of Molson Coors in 2020. 
Now you may be wondering why I have such confidence, especially if you only look at our consolidated top line results in the fourth quarter. But that number alone does not tell the full story. If you only look at that piece of data, you'll miss it. Our top line results in the fourth quarter were overwhelmingly due to losses resulting from government restrictions in the European on-premise channel. 
To put it more bluntly, Europe alone accounts for 92% of our fourth quarter top line decline. But those results are not reflective of the performance we've seen across the rest of the business. And the story is very different in our largest market. And how different? 
In the fourth quarter, Molson Coors grew net sales revenue in the United States. We grew the top line in the United States. Our plan is working. So let's look deeper at our results in 2020 and what we have in-store for 2021. 
Our first pillar under the revitalization plan was to build on the strength of our iconic core. In the U.S., our largest beer, Coors Lite and Miller Lite, delivered 6.1% and 8.6% expected growth in the off premise. Again grew share in the premium line beer segment, and they finished 2020 with stronger brand health. We're pleased but not satisfied with those results. 
So in 2021, we are going to put even more marketing behind these 2 iconic brands. And we're thinking big, as you may have noticed around the big game last weekend. And again, I want to point something out here. We are demonstrating our ability to grow in and expand beyond beer while strengthening our core brands. We are demonstrating we can do both. 
The revitalization plan was specifically designed to free up resources so we can meaningfully invest behind our core, our growth in above-premium and our expansion beyond beer. In the second half of 2020, above-premium products hit a record higher portion of our U.S. portfolio relative to any prior year comparable period. We doubled our share of sales in the U.S. moving towards our double-digit share goal by the end of this year. Busy has been a top 10 growth BRAM for nearly 6 straight market. This is incredible growth has been accomplished with basically just 1 pan. But in a few weeks, we plan to add more firepower to that brand with a second variety pack. And a few weeks later, we plan to launch [indiscernible] a lineup, we believe, is tailor-made for VIs given its unique antioxidant vitamin C attributes. 
And we are excited about the opportunity for Corso, which launched at the end of September. We are seeing promising signs, including repeat rates that are stronger than bud light felter and corona seltzer at the same point during their launch. 
In 2021, we have strong plans to accelerate marketing support behind closeted as well as its commitment to help Save Americas rivers. And that's just the beginning. We are about to launch Topacio hard self, which is getting a lot of attention from retailers and distributors alike. 
Topacio Mineral water is beloved in the biggest markets throughout the United Spaces, especially in Texas, a high potential market. Quickly on appeals, we plan to bring Topacio Ranch water to market. And again, we see this brand is best positioned to take advantage of the range water craze that has been inspired by Topacio mineral water enthusiasts, mixing up branch water at home. And still to come is Proofpoint, our first spirited Salter. When all 4 selfers are in market later this spring, we believe we will boast the strongest, most differentiated cell to lineup in the United States. And while we started behind others in the United States, in Canada and Europe, we are early entrants in the hard sale category. In the next couple of weeks, we are taking both Miller and Coors sales into Canada. 
In Europe, building on an existing brand partnership already in markets, the launch of our own threefold brand sales is planned for March, and we will be leading the development of the category across Central and Eastern Europe with an owned brand in the second quarter. In above-premium bars, we have high expectations for Blue Moon light score, which ended 2020 as the #1 new beer in the United States per Nielsen. We've expanded hedge production capacity by approximately 400% and we're putting more marketing muscle behind it, and we believe this is a brand that's going to continue to rise for quite some time. 
Our regional craft portfolio in the United States grew 17% for Nielsen in 2020, outpacing the craft segment once again. And next month, we will be taking Hot Berry National in the U.S. and Canada. It's our first national IPO, we believe it will be another driver of growth for our above-premium portfolio. And do not forget about Yingli. This for a newly formed joint venture plans to bring yingling to 1 of America's biggest beer drinking states, Texas. The reception has already been incredible and there is significant upside potential with yingling as the joint venture begins its westwood expansion. 
At the beginning of last year, we changed our name to the Molson Coors Beverage company, and it wasn't just worse. By the end of the year, our [indiscernible] strategy came into focus, repiloting our own brands with our partner, LIVON. We've taken equity investments in other opportunities, including 2 with Legendary Non Alk Innovative Lance Collins, we signed distribution agreements to enter the fast-growing spaces like RTD copy with Lacoon and energy drinks with ZOE through our new energy drink partnership with the leadership team led by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Zora is getting very positive reaction from retailers and distributors. The Rock isn't just putting his name on this. He's personally making calls to retailers, and we're bringing that to market this spring. We think Zalo could be a game changer in the energy drink space. Trust Canada, our Canadian cannabis joint venture with HEXO launched their beverage portfolio in August. And by December, they jumped the #1 dollar share position with  of the top 5 cannabis beverage SKUs in Canada. And trust U.S.A. is building on that through their first lineup of hemp-derived CBD beverages in Colorado which entered the market in December. 
We are learning a lot about the exciting category following the launch. This entire lineup is a tremendous growth opportunity for our business. It will be a driving force behind our goal to build our emerging growth division into a $1 billion revenue business by 2023. And as a reminder, that ambition does not include our hard seltzer. 
And we recently announced our first entry into the fast-growing RTD cocktail space through an exclusive equity and distribution agreement with super bird and above-premium tKDA based Paloma. Last year, we also made major investments to help our business grow the top line. We invested in our e-commerce capabilities all around the globe with more staff and more robust digital capabilities. And it paid off last year with 230% growth in e-commerce in the U.S. alone. We expanded our sell to production capacity by approximately 400%. And we also expanded our life sky production capacity by approximately 400%. We completed a CE can production line capable of manufacturing approximately 750 million SKM annually. 
And on the topic of plans, I'm really pleased to say that our packaging material supply has vastly improved with glass bottles, paperboard and tall cans with all returning to low material availability. In fact, our Coors Lite can inventory is higher than it was at this point last year. 
And our industry standard can fly is improving. We have sourced cans from 4 continents and work closely with our suppliers to keep up with a very high rate of consumer demand and we expect to return to normal material availability by the end of this quarter. We will continue investing in our capabilities throughout the year. It's work to grow our ability to produce higher-margin above-premium products. Last but certainly not least, is how we are supporting our people and our communities. This one is particularly important to me. But I took over a fee -- I made it clear that I want Molson Coors at a people's first culture. That approach guided our decision-making throughout the last year. The work in this space is never done, but we are making important progress. 
Last summer, we set a goal of increasing the representation among people of color in the United States by 25% by the end of 2023 across the country among salaried employees and in leadership positions. Each where market availability shows we have room for improvement. We have made progress towards that goal, and we expect to continue to do so. We also increased our support for organizations dedicated to quality, empowerment, racial justice and community building and provided nearly 3 million meals to families in our hometown community struggling with food and security. But we must do more. 
So today, I'm proud to announce that not only will we recommit to mating last year's investments in our communities. We have also committed to spend a total of $1 billion with diverse suppliers over the next 3 years. This is a commitment that benefits all of us. A wider base with talented suppliers with different backgrounds and life experiences will be a benefit to our company. And the diverse suppliers to earn our business will be able to turn in, in turn, hire more talented employees into their businesses. 
Last summer, we said that Molson Coors response to addressing racial injustice would not just be a moment in time. Passing things, set aside and forgotten as other priorities took over. That would be unacceptable. Our commitment to investing in our communities and striving for equal opportunity for all people will not fit. 
Even with the unforeseeable challenges of last year, we built on the strength of our iconic core. The second half of 2020, we achieved a record high portion of our U.S. portfolio and above-premium products. We expanded beyond the Bureau we invested in our capabilities, we supported our people and our communities, and we are not about to stop down. 
When I took over this role, I told you that we would plan and invest to grow our top line. We're going to follow through on this. And we're on the pathway there. Folks, this is our revitalization plan in action. I know there have been questions about whether or not we can execute all of this, but no one has to wonder any longer. We are doing it right now today. And now I'll turn it over to Tracy, who can provide you with more detail on our financial performance and our outlook for 2021. Tracey?"

The coronavirus pandemic had a significant impact on our 2020 financial performance, primarily due to the on-premise restrictions and lockdown. Our Europe business was the most impacted, particularly in the U.K. where our business skews heavily towards the on-premise and drove revenue and EBITDA declines in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. 
In fact, Europe, which accounted for only 15% of our revenue in 2020, contributed to 61% of revenue decline and 83% of our EBITDA decline for the year. And 92% of the revenue decline and 56% of our EBITDA decline for the fourth quarter. Despite these incredible challenges in 2020, we are proud of our resilience and the financial performance as we have navigated through this unprecedented time. 
Now let me take you through our full year performance, and then I'll touch on our quarterly results before moving on to our outlook. Recapping the year, consolidated net sales revenue decreased 8.7% in constant currency, of which North America was down 4.3%. While Europe was down 28.4% on a constant currency basis. 
While we delivered net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the U.S. This was more than offset by volume declines and unfavorable channel mix, principally driven by varying degrees of on-premise restrictions throughout much of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic, which also drove packaging material constraints due to the unprecedented can demand. Brand volumes declined 7.8% and financial volumes declined 8.9%. 
The North American shipment trends improved in the second half of the year as certain packaging material constraints ease and we built distributor inventory. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew 1.1% in constant currency due to pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the U.S. The success of our above-premium innovations, including [indiscernible] Roman Life Sky and Coors Salsa, help drive U.S. NSFR hectoliter up 2.3% for the year. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 2.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation, including higher transportation costs, volume deleverage and mix impact from premiumization in North America, partially offset by cost savings. Higher can sourcing costs in North America contributed to the higher cost inflation. After the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, we aggressively began forcing additional aluminum plans from all over the world to support our core brands to address unprecedented off famous demand. Also, we saw a tightening of the freight market throughout the year, which has led to higher transportation costs. 
Underlying MG&A decreased 9.9% on a constant currency basis as we quickly took action, pivoting spend away from the areas impacted by the coronavirus pandemic particularly live entertainment events and sporting events due to shortened or delayed season, such as the delayed start of the NHL season into 2021. 
In the second half of the year, we began to progressively increase marketing spend, particularly in social and TV media, stepping up support behind our new innovations, such as Vizi, Zoomon Lica and Coors in alignment with additional supply coming online as well as continuing  iconic core brands. MG&A declines were also driven by targeted cost mitigation actions and significant cost savings in the first year of our revitalization cost savings program. In aggregate, we delivered approximately $270 million across MG&A and cost of goods sold, facing us on track to meet our $600 million target in total gross savings. 
These reductions were offset by innovation spend and citing lower incentive compensation and a nonrecurring vendor benefit in the prior year, which we referenced last quarter. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 10% on a constant currency basis. Underlying free cash flow was $1.3 billion for the year, a decrease of $104 million from the prior year driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash taxes, partially offset by favorable working capital. 
The working capital benefit was driven by the deferral of approximately $150 million in tax payments from various government funds or payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic. Of which we currently anticipate the majority to be paid in 2021 as they become due. 
Capital expenditures incurred were $530 million for the year. With improved liquidity and strong cash management, we were able to accelerate certain investments in expanding our production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives. In addition to the strong free cash flow performance, we made tremendous strides in improving our financial flexibility, including continuing to pay down debt, favorably amending our U.S. revolving credit facility and suspending our dividend in May for the remainder of 2020. We reduced our net debt position by $1.1 billion in 2020 and and reduced our trailing 12-month net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.5x as we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where, again, Europe, due to the on-premise lockdown, had a significant and disproportionate impact on our results. Consolidated net sales revenue declined 8.3% in constant currency, principally due to financial volume declines as a result of the on-premise restrictions, along with corresponding negative channel mix partially offset by net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the U.S. 
North America net sales revenue was down 1% in constant currency. However, in the U.S., despite increased on-premise restrictions and aluminum can supply constraints, we delivered net sales revenue growth of 1.9% in the quarter. And we continue to build distributor inventory in the U.S., with brand volumes down 6.2% compared to domestic shipment declines of 2.3%. Growth in the U.S. business was more than offset by lower volumes and negative mix in Canada and to a lesser degree, Latin America as a result of the on-premise restrictions. 
In Europe, net sales revenue was down 39.4% in constant currency, driven by volume declines and negative mix due to increased on-premise restrictions with the most meaningful in the U.K., which experienced a return to almost total on-premise lockdown for November and the historically strong month of December. And with the subdued nature of many festive celebrations during the fourth quarter, we did not see a big shift of volume into the off premise. 
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.7% in constant currency, reflecting net pricing growth in North America and Europe, more than offsetting the negative mix effects of the various market dynamics and consumer shifts caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
In the U.S., net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased a 4.2%, driven by favorable sales mix from new innovations and strong net pricing growth. While in Europe, net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis decreased 8.2% due to unfavorable mix, particularly driven by the higher-margin U.K. business, which more than offset pricing increases. 
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 6.4% on a constant currency basis, as we saw a greater impact on freight inflation and U.S. mix premiumization in Q4 compared to the full year. MG&A in the quarter increased 5.8% on a constant currency basis, due to higher planned marketing spend to support our core brands with key innovations as well as fat in lower incentive compensation and a nonrecurring vendor benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019. The this was partially offset by cost savings and lower discretionary spend. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 33.6% on a constant currency basis, disproportionately driven by Europe. 
Given the length and severity of the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on our Europe business as well as the protracted recovery currently expected in certain on-premise markets we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $1.5 billion in our Europe segment. We also recognized a $39.6 million of asset impairment charges in our North American segment. These charges are noncash and are not included in underlying results. 
So this takes me to our financial outlook. As you may recall, on March 27 of last year, we withdrew our guidance due to the uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic. While uncertainty remains in an effort to help enhance visibility we have determined to reinstate our practice of providing guidance. 
We have also determined to adjust the metrics provided, which includes adding guidance for net sales revenue a metric which aligns with our revitalization plan goals for driving top line growth as well as net debt to underlying EBITDA leverage ratio given our commitment to remaining investment grade. 
We are very proud of our performance and agility in navigating the coronavirus pandemic and executing against our revitalization plan, but recognize that headwinds remain. The pandemic continues to impact our business due to on-premise losses across all our geographies and disproportionately so in Europe as well as Canada. We expect domestic shipment trends in the U.S. to continue to be higher than brand volume trends in the third quarter as we continue to build inventories heading into the peak season. 
For the year, we maintain our annual goal of shipping to consumption in the U.S. In Europe, we continue to experience significant lockdowns and expect third quarter volumes will be materially impacted versus the prior year period, similar to what was experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
For 2021, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth. 2021 is intended to be a year of investment as we continue to deliver our revitalization plan and grow towards long-term growth. Rising sales increasing year-over-year marketing spend to build on the strength of our core brands and support our successful 2020 launches, including Blue Moon Life far, busy and Coor Salter and new innovations to come as well as investing in further expanding our capabilities to drive productivity and efficiencies. 
We expect significant increases in spend beginning in the second quarter versus the prior year comparable quarter. While we continue to expect revitalization pay and savings as a distaste, given this increased investment, along with cost headwinds related to higher inflation, including transportation costs and continued premiumization of our portfolio. We anticipate 2021 underlying EBITDA to be approximately flat compared to the prior year. 
We anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, net interest expense of $270 million, plus or minus 5% and an effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. 
We enter 2021 with greatly improved financial flexibility, better enabling us to not only continue to invest in our business, but to continue to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders in 2021. As I mentioned, we significantly reduced our net debt position by $1.1 billion in 2020 and reduced our leverage ratio to 3.5x as of December 31, 2020. 
We are proud of this progress and are establishing a target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.25x by the end of 2021 and below 3x by the end of 2022. And we currently anticipate that our Board of Directors will be in a position to reinstate a dividend in the second half of this year. We are doing all of this while continuing our commitment to maintaining and in time, upgrading our investment-grade rating. 
Given the operating environment, we are pleased with our 2020 financial performance, which underscores our strong progress against our revitalization fab and the resilience of our company and our people who have announced to successfully navigate and overcome challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. While these challenges have created some near-term fluctuations in financial and operating results, we are confident we're on the right path of driving towards long-term revenue and underlying EBITDA growth. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress. So with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

Ook, we don't provide guidance on in month depletions, lots of ups and downs. But from a European point of view, as Tracy said in their opening remarks, the on-premise remains in lock down. And so we expect the first quarter volumes in Europe and particularly in the United Kingdom to be challenged. From a from a U.S. point of view, the lockdowns remain, although it does vary from from state to state. And we do see a loosening of on-premise restrictions, both in North America and in Europe as we progress into Q2 and further on into the year. From a from a supply point of view, just reiterate my comments in the script that our Coors light can suppliers much improved and our inventory levels are actually higher than they were at the same time last year. So we're well positioned to to take advantage of the brand health strength of Coors Life."

It naturally signals a less confident outlook and ability to return to levels of profitability, perhaps you previously thought, at least within a reasonable amount of time when you're doing the discounted cash flow model. So Gavin, would be good to get your updated views on your outlook for this business, strategic fit within the portfolio and how you're thinking about the cost structure given this less constructive outlook. And then, Tracy, for you, relatedly, not to get too much in the weeds with this, but I'm just trying to understand the margins in the quarter. So the top line pressure in the second quarter was worse than the fourth. But the margin performance was clearly a lot more pressure. The decremental margins in the second quarter about 25%, closer to 6% to 8% in the fourth quarter. It just seemed like there is a better ability to sort of flex down MG&A in the second quarter than there was in the fourth. I think it would be useful for folks if you could maybe spend a little bit of time on that."

And I'll pass it on. Thanks, Kevin. I'll talk about Europe and performance specifically. Look, I mean, the on-premise restrictions in Q4 were fairly draconian. There was somewhat of a scatter gun approach across Europe, which is made a little harder for us to plan and react to, particularly on the cost line. When you compare Q4 versus Q2, the impact for Q4 was particularly pronounced because December has historically been a very strong month for the on-premise in the U.K. given the holidays. And of course, you can't be outdoors that much comfortably in the fourth quarter as much as you can be in the second quarter. It's also a seasonally lower trading period in Central and Eastern Europe. So we saw similar declines in the second and fourth quarters from a volume perspective, but the on-premise restrictions in the second quarter were more uniform. So it made it easier for us to plan. Certainly, the the lockdowns, as I said earlier, have continued into the first quarter. We did make some conscious decisions in Q4, Kevin, to invest behind our core brands, not only in the United States but also in Europe and in particular, in in Central Europe. We've got some strong brand, strong and healthy brands, and we wanted to make sure we positioned ourselves for sustainable recovery in 2021. So that explains why the MG&A in Europe was a little higher than you might have been expecting. We were investing behind our brands. What else question there?"

And then my if I can just jump in on the margins. So yes, in Europe in Q4, we focused our marketing investment on specific brands and markets where we have capacity and we needed to ensure that we were competitive in context of share of voice and brand health metrics. And so the investments that we made in Q4 in Europe were to support the ongoing performance of our National Champion brands and our premiumization. And then also just to note, we were cycling comparatively much lighter spend in Q4 of 2019 in Central Europe. So that would account for some of the margin differences."

Hanks, Kaumil. Yes, a lot in there, let me try and give you some context. Obviously, the reality is the situation remains fluid in various markets by market. In the third quarter of last year, we did see some on-premise reopenings pretty much across the board in the countries in which we operate. And during the fourth quarter, we saw a return to much more severe on-premise restrictions as most countries went back into strict lockdowns, and there was no benefit of outdoor dining given the climate in terms of our major markets in the U.K., the government operated a tiered system of restrictions in October, and then they followed that up with a national lockdown in November. They've returned to a tiered system in December, but pretty much the U.K. is locked down as we speak. In North America, Canada was particularly impacted more than the U.S. from a lockdown point of view, it was a stricter lockdown. And then we really did see vary pictures across the United States. Depending on which state. So from an on-premise performance point of view in the United States, it's been fairly stable for a while now. There's no big spike up or down. In terms of market share, we think that the consumer moving to big and trusted brands will benefit us in all the markets in which we operate and where we have seen reopenings, we've seen that play through from a from a market share point of view. So I think we will be net beneficiaries when that takes place. I mean, obviously, in our both premium portfolio, we were very pleased with our performance in above-premium in the fourth quarter, and that's in the face of Blue Moon and Peroni, which is strong on-premise brands being obviously challenged because of the lack of on-premise. And we expect that when the on-premise comes back more fully, that those 2 brands will be big beneficiaries of it. If you look at the U.K., which is our largest -- which is the market which has the largest on-premise exposure, we've demonstrated a sustained track record of growing our share in the on-premise in the U.K. Well, for at least 5 years pre pandemic. We've grown our share in the on premise. As we've driven to be first choice for our customers. In fact, just learned this week that we were #1 again with our customers in the Net Promoter Score survey across the trade in 2020. So we've got contracts to supply many of our competitors in both the retail and wholesale models. Our customers value the service that we bring through our own brands and also our wholesale brands. And so we believe we're well positioned to gain share in the U.K. market when it reopens. I think I got all your questions there, Kaumil?"

Et me try and give you some color there, Kaumil. Obviously, we've been very clear about the objective in our revitalization plan of driving our above-premium portfolio and our beyond Beer portfolio. Almost all of the deals we've done come at above-premium margins. So that was 2 of the 5 focus areas in our revitalization plan that we announced in October of 2019. And and we're going to continue building on that. You could see the results of that in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter with a positive mix, which we generated. We generated another quarter above 200 basis points of positive mix, which is continuing to reflect our growth and performance in above premium. For Nielsen, we actually grew share of above-premium despite the on-premise challenges, which brands like Blue Moon and Peroni have experienced. We think that yes, we obviously put out the ambition of getting to $1 billion revenue for our emerging growth division, which is going to require that many of our partnerships that we've just announced, like our Zora partnership like Oman. So on our are successful. And they're coming off a standing start of 0 because we didn't have them before. I'd also point you to the fact that we actually grew the top line in the very market where concerns have been expressed about our ability to execute. We grew the top line in the fourth quarter. Despite all these deals that we've done and the challenges that we faced. And we're going to build on that in 2021. There is a lot of excitement from retail and from our distributors with the deals that we've done particularly brands like Zora and Topo Chico, a lot of excitement, and that will continue to improve our above-premium mix."

The other behavioral change, which we've obviously experienced in 2020 is the growth of e-commerce sales. Many consumers of alcoholic beverages that didn't realize you can buy a beer online, and they do now. And we've seen a 230% increase in our online sales. And I think the back trend will stay, and that's why we're making investments in our e-commerce capabilities."

Look, I mean, our revitalization plan, which we announced in October 2019 required us to do both, and that was our -- that's our plan, and it remains our plan. Investing behind our iconic core brands and investing behind a both premium and investing behind our Beyond courtier portfolio is the plan. Tracy mentioned in the guidance, approximately flat EBITDA, and that's really the revitalization planning coming to life with our big investments behind both millerite and Coors like, which we'll see more spend this year. We'll put more spend behind our above-premium portfolio with Blue Moon Light Sky and Blue Moon. We'll put more money behind ourselves as. We will have 4 shelters in market this year. We only had two. One was launched in April. The other one was launched in September. This year, we're going to have 4 as we strive to get to the 10% market share. And we're going to be investing behind our new ventures like like Zola and local and also our angling joint venture. In terms of actual performance, Bonnie, Coors Light and Miller Lite have performed really well. In spite of the headwinds, which they've got. We've made numerous pivots from a marketing point of view to meet the changed circumstances. And when necessary, we put marketing money behind it in the fourth quarter, for example. From a media perspective, we shifted our media to places like social gaming, podcasts, online, video and so on. And and from a creative point of view, we've created a new credit, which has resonated with consumers. We've actually created 40 pieces of new creatives since March. A lot of that has been behind Miller Lite and Coors Light. I mean just some examples of that would be our fair well work out party for millages and then our campaign to get some florist into the profitable hall of fame with with Coors Light and you can see the benefits of that with both of those brands. I mean, Coors light, drove significant share growth in the first half of the year. It did slow down in the third quarter because of the inventory supply constraints, which we had, which we're now through because our inventory is higher than it was at the same time last year for Coors Light. And in December, we saw the best industry share trend we've seen in years outside of the entry load loading for March for Coors Light. So it's -- the made till campaign platform is working, and we're excited about it. And Miller lite share trends have been strong. Now obviously, as I said in my opening remarks, we're not satisfied with the performance until and we intend to put more money behind it. So that's a very long-winded way of saying, it's both. It's not overall. We're not sacrificing 1 for the other. We believe that we can do more than one thing at one time, and we believe that we're demonstrating it because the market where we've had the most concern about our execution capability is the U.S., and we've grown our top line. We grew our margin. Strong pricing, strong brand mix. This is the revitalization plan in action. It's not a series of one-offs. It's all part of a single strategy, and that's the revitalization plan, which is specifically aimed to drive top line growth, and we believe we will do that in 2021."

As soon as appropriate to reinstate the dividend and as I said in the guidance, that's something that we do anticipate our Board will be in a position to reinstate in the back half of this year.

As our revitalization plan requires us to do more than 1 thing at a time. It does both. And I think our fourth quarter is a fine example of that. We grew our top line in the U.S. We grew our net sales revenue per hectoliter meaningfully. We had positive brand mix and we demonstrated that we could deal with complexity. I mean, the structure that we put in place in our company was designed to deal with complexity. We've got a team that focuses on the core brands and very pleased with what they've done with Coors Light and Miller Lite and our other legacy iconic brands. And then we've got a team that focuses on beyond beer that's executing against that. So it's exactly as we laid out the revitalization plan, and we're demonstrating that we can do that in our largest market. In terms of the $1 billion revenue ambition for emerging growth, it does it does encompass a number of areas in the emerging growth. So we're not coming from a standing start. We do have all our craft companies in that area. We have our Non ALK division. We have our cannabis THC infused beverages, RTDs and our CBD business. It also includes all of our Latin America exports and license markets. So in order to get to $1 billion, we're going to have to grow our top line for the emerging growth division by 50% to give you some idea of the base that we're coming off.

But in many respects, I consider us lucky. The revitalization plan we put in place in October of 2019 positioned our company well to weather the storms of 2020. Our business was leaner and more nimble, which put us in a better position to conserve resources as the circumstances dictated and to deploy them effectively as the circumstances allowed. And the results bear that out.
When you consider what we set out to do under our revitalization plan, we accomplished an incredible amount in 2020, and that has given us a tremendous springboard for 2021. Our 2 largest brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, our iconic core, grew 6.1% and 8.6% in the U.S. off-premise, respectively. Our above premium brands in the U.S. reached a record high percentage of the portfolio in the second half of 2020.
Beyond beer, our first follow into nonalcoholic cannabis beverages through the trust joint venture has netted the #1 dollar share spot in the entire Canadian cannabis beverage market. We increased our production capacity for our fast-growing seltzers by approximately 400%, and we approximately doubled our annual investments in our hometown communities. That is the story of Molson Coors in 2020.
Now you may be wondering why I have such confidence, especially if you only look at our consolidated top line results in the fourth quarter. But that number alone does not tell the full story. If you only look at that piece of data, you'll miss it. Our top line results in the fourth quarter were overwhelmingly due to losses resulting from government restrictions in the European on-premise channel.
To put it more bluntly, Europe alone accounts for 92% of our fourth quarter top line decline. But those results are not reflective of the performance we've seen across the rest of the business. And the story is very different in our largest market. And how different? In the fourth quarter, Molson Coors grew net sales revenue in the United States. We grew the top line in the United States. Our plan is working. So let's look deeper at our results in 2020 and what we have in store for 2021.
Our first pillar under the revitalization plan was to build on the strength of our iconic core. In the U.S., our largest beers, Coors Light and Miller Lite, delivered 6.1% and 8.6% expected growth in the off premise. It again grew share in the premium light beer segment, and they finished 2020 with stronger brand health. We're pleased but not satisfied with those results.
So in 2021, we are going to put even more marketing behind these 2 iconic brands. And we're thinking big, as you may have noticed around the big game last weekend. And again, I want to point something out here. We are demonstrating our ability to grow in seltzers and expand beyond beer while strengthening our core brands. We are demonstrating we can do both.
The revitalization plan was specifically designed to free up resources so we can meaningfully invest behind our core, our growth in above premium and our expansion beyond beer. In the second half of 2020, above premium products hit a record higher portion of our U.S. portfolio relative to any prior year comparable period. We doubled our share of seltzers in the U.S. moving towards our double-digit share goal by the end of this year. Vizzy has been a top 10 growth brand for nearly 6 straight months. But this incredible growth has been accomplished with basically just 1 pack. But in a few weeks, we plan to add more firepower to that brand with a second variety pack. And a few weeks later, we plan to launch Vizzy Lemonade, a lineup we believe is tailor-made for Vizzy given its unique antioxidant vitamin C attributes.
And we are excited about the opportunity for Coors Seltzer, which launched at the end of September. We are seeing promising signs, including repeat rates that are stronger than Bud Light seltzer and Corona seltzer at the same point during their launch.
In 2021, we have strong plans to accelerate marketing support behind Coors Seltzer as well as its commitment to help save Americas' rivers. And that's just the beginning. We are about to launch Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which is getting a lot of attention from retailers and distributors alike. Topo Chico mineral water is beloved in the biggest markets throughout the United Spaces, especially in Texas, a high potential market. Quickly on [ uphills ], we plan to bring Topo Chico ranch water to market. And again, we see this brand is best positioned to take advantage of the ranch water craze that has been inspired by Topo Chico mineral water enthusiasts, mixing up ranch water at home. And still to come is Proof Point, our first spirited seltzer.
When all 4 seltzers are in market later this spring, we believe we will boast the strongest, most differentiated seltzer lineup in the United States. And while we started behind others in the United States, in Canada and Europe, we are early entrants in the hard seltzer category. In the next couple of weeks, we are taking both Vizzy and Coors Seltzer into Canada.
In Europe, building on an existing brand partnership already in markets, the launch of our own threefold brand seltzer is planned for March, and we will be leading the development of the category across Central and Eastern Europe with an owned brand in the second quarter.
In above premium beers, we have high expectations for Blue Moon LightSky, which ended 2020 as the #1 new beer in the United States per Nielsen. We've expanded its production capacity by approximately 400%. We're putting more marketing muscle behind it, and we believe this is a brand that's going to continue to rise for quite some time.
Our regional craft portfolio in the United States grew 17% for Nielsen in 2020, outpacing the craft segment once again. And next month, we will be taking Hop Valley national in the U.S. and Canada. It's our first national IPO, we believe it will be another driver of growth for our above premium portfolio. And do not forget about Yuengling. This formed a newly formed joint venture plans to bring Yuengling to one of America's biggest beer drinking states, Texas. The reception has already been incredible, and there is significant upside potential with Yuengling as the joint venture begins its Westwood expansion.
At the beginning of last year, we changed our name to the Molson Coors Beverage Company, and it wasn't just worse. By the end of the year, our non alc strategy came into focus, repiloting our own brands with our partner, L.A. Libations, we've taken equity investments in other opportunities, including 2 with legendary non alc innovator Lance Collins, we signed distribution agreements to enter the fast-growing spaces like RTD coffee with La Colombe and energy drinks with ZOA through our new energy drink partnership with the leadership team led by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.
ZOA is getting very positive reaction from retailers and distributors. The Rock isn't just putting his name on this. He's personally making calls to retailers, and we're bringing that to market this spring. We think ZOA could be a game changer in the energy drink space.
Truss Canada, our Canadian cannabis joint venture with HEXO, launched their beverage portfolio in August. And by December, they jumped to the #1 dollar share position with 4 of the top 5 cannabis beverage SKUs in Canada. And Truss U.S.A. is building on that through their first lineup of hemp-derived CBD beverages in Colorado which entered the market in December. We are learning a lot about the exciting category following the launch.
This entire lineup is a tremendous growth opportunity for our business. It will be a driving force behind our goal to build our emerging growth division into a $1 billion revenue business by 2023. And as a reminder, that ambition does not include our hard seltzers. And we recently announced our first entry into the fast-growing RTD cocktail space through an exclusive equity and distribution agreement with Superbird and above premium tequila-based Paloma.
Last year, we also made major investments to help our business grow the top line. We invested in our e-commerce capabilities all around the globe with more staff and more robust digital capabilities. And it paid off last year with 230% growth in e-commerce in the U.S. alone. We expanded our seltzer production capacity by approximately 400%. And we also expanded our LightSky production capacity by approximately 400%. We completed a sleek can production line capable of manufacturing approximately 750 million sleek cans annually.
And on the topic of cans, I'm really pleased to say that our packaging material supply has vastly improved with glass bottles, paperboard and tall cans with all returning to normal material availability. In fact, our Coors Light can inventory is higher than it was at this point last year. And our industry standard can supply is improving. We have sourced cans from 4 continents and work closely with our suppliers to keep up with a very high rate of consumer demand, and we expect to return to normal material availability by the end of this quarter. We will continue investing in our capabilities throughout the year as we work to grow our ability to produce higher-margin above premium products.
Last but certainly not least, is how we are supporting our people and our communities. This one is particularly important to me. When I took over as CEO, I made it clear that I want Molson Coors as a people-first culture. And that approach guided our decision-making throughout the last year. The work in this space is never done, but we are making important progress.
Last summer, we set a goal of increasing the representation among people of color in the United States by 25% by the end of 2023 across the country among salaried employees and in leadership positions, each where market availability shows we have room for improvement. We have made progress towards that goal, and we expect to continue to do so. We also increased our support for organizations dedicated to equality, empowerment, racial justice and community building and provided nearly 3 million meals to families in our hometown community struggling with food and security.
But we must do more. So today, I'm proud to announce that not only will we recommit to matching last year's investments in our communities, we have also committed to spend a total of $1 billion with diverse suppliers over the next 3 years. This is a commitment that benefits all of us. A wider base with talented suppliers with different backgrounds and life experiences will be a benefit to our company. And the diverse suppliers who earn our business will be able to turn in -- in turn, hire more talented employees into their businesses.
Last summer, we said that Molson Coors' response to addressing racial injustice would not just be a moment in time. Passing things, set aside and forgotten as other priorities took over. That would be unacceptable. Our commitment to investing in our communities and striving for equal opportunity for all people will not fade.
Even with the unforeseeable challenges of last year, we built on the strength of our iconic core. The second half of 2020, we achieved a record high portion of our U.S. portfolio and above premium products. We expanded beyond the beer aisle. We invested in our capabilities. We supported our people and our communities, and we are not about to stop now.
When I took over this role, I told you that we would plan and invest to grow our top line. We're going to follow through on this, and we're on the pathway there. Folks, this is our revitalization plan in action. I know there have been questions about whether or not we can execute all of this, but no one has to wonder any longer. We are doing it right now today.
And now I'll turn it over to Tracey, who can provide you with more detail on our financial performance and our outlook for 2021. Trace?"
263765,700823319,2206439,"Molson Coors Beverage Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone.

The coronavirus pandemic had a significant impact on our 2020 financial performance, primarily due to the on-premise restrictions and lockdowns. Our Europe business was the most impacted, particularly in the U.K. where our business skews heavily towards the on-premise and drove revenue and EBITDA declines in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020.
In fact, Europe, which accounted for only 15% of our revenue in 2020, contributed to 61% of revenue decline and 83% of our EBITDA decline for the year. And 92% of the revenue decline and 56% of our EBITDA decline for the fourth quarter. Despite these incredible challenges in 2020, we are proud of our resilience and the financial performance as we have navigated through this unprecedented time.
Now let me take you through our full year performance, and then I'll touch on our quarterly results before moving on to our outlook. Recapping the year, consolidated net sales revenue decreased 8.7% in constant currency, of which North America was down 4.3%, while Europe was down 28.4% on a constant currency basis.
While we delivered net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the U.S., this was more than offset by volume declines and unfavorable channel mix, principally driven by varying degrees of on-premise restrictions throughout much of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic, which also drove packaging material constraints due to the unprecedented can demand. Brand volumes declined 7.8% and financial volumes declined 8.9%.
North American shipment trends improved in the second half of the year as certain packaging material constraints ease and rebuilt distributor inventory. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew 1.1% in constant currency due to pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the U.S. The success of our above premium innovations, including Vizzy, Blue Moon LightSky and Coors Seltzer, help drive U.S. net sales per hectoliter up 2.3% for the year.
Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 2.8% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation, including higher transportation costs, volume deleverage and mixed impact from premiumization in North America, partially offset by cost savings. Higher can sourcing costs in North America contributed to the higher cost inflation. After the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, we aggressively began sourcing additional aluminum cans from all over the world to support our core brands to address unprecedented off famous demand. Also, we saw a tightening of the freight market throughout the year, which has led to higher transportation costs.
Underlying MG&A decreased 9.9% on a constant currency basis as we quickly took action, pivoting spend away from the areas impacted by the coronavirus pandemic particularly live entertainment events and sporting events due to shortened or delayed season, such as the delayed start of the NHL season into 2021.
In the second half of the year, we began to progressively increase marketing spend, particularly in social and TV media, stepping up support behind our new innovations, such as Vizzy, Blue Moon LightSky and Coors Seltzer in alignment with additional supply coming online as well as continuing to support our core Coors Light, Miller Lite and other iconic core brands. MG&A declines were also driven by targeted cost mitigation actions and significant cost savings in the first year of our revitalization cost savings program.
In aggregate, we delivered approximately $270 million across MG&A and cost of goods sold, facing us on track to meet our $600 million target in total gross savings. These reductions were offset by innovation spend and cycling lower incentive compensation and a nonrecurring vendor benefit in the prior year, which we referenced last quarter.
As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 10% on a constant currency basis. Underlying free cash flow was $1.3 billion for the year, a decrease of $104 million from the prior year driven by lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash taxes, partially offset by favorable working capital. The working capital benefit was driven by the deferral of approximately $150 million in tax payments from various government funds or payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic, of which we currently anticipate the majority to be paid in 2021 as they become due.
Capital expenditures incurred were $550 million for the year. With improved liquidity and strong cash management, we were able to accelerate certain investments in expanding our production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives.
In addition to the strong free cash flow performance, we made tremendous strides in improving our financial flexibility, including continuing to pay down debt, favorably amending our U.S. revolving credit facility and suspending our dividend in May for the remainder of 2020. We reduced our net debt position by $1.1 billion in 2020 and reduced our trailing 12-month net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.5x as we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where, again, Europe, due to the on-premise lockdown, had a significant and disproportionately negative impact on our results. Consolidated net sales revenue declined 8.3% in constant currency, principally due to financial volume declines as a result of the on-premise restrictions, along with corresponding negative channel mix partially offset by net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the U.S.
North America net sales revenue was down 1% in constant currency. However, in the U.S., despite increased on-premise restrictions and aluminum can supply constraints, we delivered net sales revenue growth of 1.9% in the quarter. And we continue to build distributor inventory in the U.S., with brand volumes down 6.2% compared to domestic shipment declines of 2.3%. Growth in the U.S. business was more than offset by lower volumes and negative mix in Canada and to a lesser degree, Latin America as a result of the on-premise restrictions.
In Europe, net sales revenue was down 39.4% in constant currency, driven by volume declines and negative mix due to increased on-premise restrictions with the most meaningful in the U.K., which experienced a return to almost total on-premise lockdown for November and the historically strong month of December. And with the subdued nature of many festive celebrations during the fourth quarter, we did not see a big shift of volume into the off premise.
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.7% in constant currency, reflecting net pricing growth in North America and Europe, more than offsetting the negative mix effects of the various market dynamics and consumer shifts caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In the U.S., net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.2%, driven by favorable sales mix from new innovations and strong net pricing growth. While in Europe, net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis decreased 8.2% due to unfavorable mix, particularly driven by the higher-margin U.K. business, which more than offset pricing increases.
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 6.4% on a constant currency basis, as we saw a greater impact on freight inflation and U.S. mix premiumization in Q4 compared to the full year. MG&A in the quarter increased 5.8% on a constant currency basis, due to higher planned marketing spend to support our core brands and key innovations as well as spike in lower incentive compensation and a nonrecurring vendor benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019. This was partially offset by cost savings and lower discretionary spend. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 33.6% on a constant currency basis, disproportionately driven by Europe.
Given the length and severity of the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on our Europe business as well as the protracted recovery currently expected in certain on-premise markets, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $1.5 billion in our Europe segment. We also recognized a $39.6 million of asset impairment charges in our North American segment. These charges are noncash and are not included in underlying results.
So this takes me to our financial outlook. As you may recall, on March 27 of last year, we withdrew our guidance due to the uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic. While uncertainty remains, in an effort to help enhance visibility, we have determined to reinstate our practice of providing guidance. We have also determined to adjust the metrics provided, which includes adding guidance for net sales revenues, a metric which aligns with our revitalization plan goals for driving top line growth as well as net debt to underlying EBITDA leverage ratio given our commitment to remaining investment grade.
We are very proud of our performance and agility in navigating the coronavirus pandemic and executing against our revitalization plan, but recognize that headwinds remain. The pandemic continues to impact our business due to on-premise losses across all our geographies and disproportionately so in Europe as well as Canada. We expect these domestic shipment trends in the U.S. to continue to be higher than brand volume trends in the third quarter as we continue to build inventories heading into the peak season.
For the year, we maintain our annual goal of shipping to consumption in the U.S. In Europe, we continue to experience significant lockdowns and expect third quarter volumes will be materially impacted versus the prior year period, similar to what was experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020.
For 2021, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth. 2021 is intended to be a year of investment as we continue to deliver our revitalization plan and drive towards long-term growth. This entails increasing year-over-year marketing spend to build on the strength of our core brands and support our successful 2020 launches, including Blue Moon LightSky, Vizzy and Coors Seltzer and new innovations to come as well as investing in further expanding our capabilities to drive productivity and efficiencies.
We expect significant increases in spend beginning in the second quarter versus the prior year comparable quarter. While we continue to expect revitalization plan savings as I discussed, given this increased investment, along with cost headwinds related to higher inflation, including transportation costs and continued premiumization of our portfolio, we anticipate 2021 underlying EBITDA to be approximately flat compared to the prior year. We anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, net interest expense of $270 million, plus or minus 5% and an effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%.
We entered 2021 with greatly improved financial flexibility, better enabling us to not only continue to invest in our business, but to continue to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders in 2021. As I mentioned, we significantly reduced our net debt position by $1.1 billion in 2020 and reduced our leverage ratio to 3.5x as of December 31, 2020. 
We are proud of this progress and are establishing a target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.25x by the end of 2021 and below 3x by the end of 2022.
And we currently anticipate that our Board of Directors will be in a position to reinstate a dividend in the second half of this year. We are doing all of this while continuing our commitment to maintaining anytime upgrading our investment-grade rating.
Given the operating environment, we are pleased with our 2020 financial performance, which underscores our strong progress against our revitalization plans and the resilience of our company and our people who have united to successfully navigate and overcome challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. While these challenges have created some near-term fluctuations in financial and operating results, we are confident we're on the right path of driving towards long-term revenue and underlying EBITDA growth. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress.
So with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

And so we expect the first quarter volumes in Europe and particularly in the United Kingdom to be challenged.
From a U.S. point of view, the lockdowns remain, although it does vary from state to state. And we do see a loosening of on-premise restrictions, both in North America and in Europe as we progress into Q2 and further on into the year. From a supply point of view, just reiterate my comments in the script that our Coors Light can suppliers much improved and our inventory levels are actually higher than they were at the same time last year. So we're well positioned to take advantage of the brand health strength of Coors Light."

So Gavin, it would be good to get your updated views on your outlook for this business, strategic fit within the portfolio and how you're thinking about the cost structure given this less constructive outlook.
And then, Tracey, for you, relatedly, not to get too much in the weeds with this, but I'm just trying to understand the margins in the quarter. So the top line pressure in the second quarter was worse than the fourth, but the margin performance was clearly a lot more pressured. The decremental margins in the second quarter about 25%, closer to 60% in the fourth quarter. It just seemed like there is a better ability to sort of flex down MG&A in the second quarter than there was in the fourth. I think it would be useful for folks if you could maybe spend a little bit of time on that."

Look, I mean, the on-premise restrictions in Q4 were fairly draconian. There was somewhat of a scatter gun approach across Europe, which has made a little harder for us to plan and react to, particularly on the cost line. And then when you compare Q4 versus Q2, the impact for Q4 was particularly pronounced because December has historically been a very strong month for the on-premise in the U.K. given the holidays. And of course, you can't be outdoors that much comfortably in the fourth quarter as much as you can be in the second quarter. It's also a seasonally lower trading period in Central and Eastern Europe. So we saw similar declines in the second and fourth quarters from a volume perspective, but the on-premise restrictions in the second quarter were more uniform. So it made it easier for us to plan. Certainly, the lockdowns, as I said earlier, have continued into the first quarter.
We did make some conscious decisions in Q4, Kevin, to invest behind our core brands, not only in the United States but also in Europe and in particular, in Central Europe. We've got some strong brand -- strong and healthy brands, and we wanted to make sure we positioned ourselves for sustainable recovery in 2021. So that explains why the MG&A in Europe was a little higher than you might have been expecting. We were investing behind our brands. What else is the question there?"

Obviously, the reality is the situation remains fluid in various markets by market. In the third quarter of last year, we did see some on-premise reopenings pretty much across the board in the countries in which we operate. And during the fourth quarter, we saw a return to much more severe on-premise restrictions as most countries went back into strict lockdowns, and there was no benefit of outdoor dining given the climate. In terms of our major markets in the U.K., the government operated a tiered system of restrictions in October, and then they followed that up with a national lockdown in November. They've returned to a tiered system in December, but pretty much the U.K. is locked down as we speak.
In North America, Canada was particularly impacted more than the U.S. from a lockdown point of view, it was a stricter lockdown. And then we really did see varied pictures across the United States, depending on which state. So from an on-premise performance point of view in the United States, it's been fairly, fairly stable for a while now. There's no big spike up or down.
In terms of market share, we think that the consumer moving to big and trusted brands will benefit us in all the markets in which we operate and where we have seen reopenings, we've seen that play through from a market share point of view. So I think we will be net beneficiaries when that takes place. I mean, obviously, in our above premium portfolio, we were very pleased with our performance in above premium in the fourth quarter, and that's in the face of Blue Moon and Peroni, which is strong on-premise brands being obviously challenged because of the lack of on-premise. And we expect that when the on-premise comes back more fully, that those 2 brands will be big beneficiaries of it.
If you look at the U.K., which is our largest -- which is the market which has the largest on-premise exposure, we've demonstrated a sustained track record of growing our share in the on-premise in the U.K. Well, for at least 5 years pre pandemic, we've grown our share in the on-premise as we've driven to be first choice for our customers. In fact, just learned this week that we were #1 again with our customers in the Net Promoter Score survey across the trade in 2020.
So we've got contracts to supply, many of our competitors in both the retail and wholesale models. Our customers value the service that we bring through our own brands and also our wholesale brands. And so we believe we're well positioned to gain share in the U.K. market when it reopens. I think I got all your questions there, Kaumil."

Almost all of the deals we've done come at above premium margins. So that was 2 of the 5 focus areas in our revitalization plan that we announced in October of 2019, and we're going to continue building on that. You could see the results of that in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter with a positive mix, which we generated. We generated another quarter above 200 basis points of positive mix, which is continuing to reflect our growth and performance in above premium. For Nielsen, we actually grew share of above premium despite the on-premise challenges, which brands like Blue Moon and Peroni have experienced.
We think that yes, we obviously put out the ambition of getting to $1 billion revenue for our emerging growth division, which is going to require that many of our partnerships that we've just announced, like our ZOA partnership, La Colombe and so on are successful. And they're coming off a standing start of 0 because we didn't have them before.
I'd also point you to the fact that we actually grew the top line in the very market where concerns have been expressed about our ability to execute. We grew the top line in the fourth quarter despite all these deals that we've done and the challenges that we faced. And we're going to build on that in 2021. There is a lot of excitement from retail and from our distributors with the deals that we've done particularly brands like ZOA and Topo Chico, a lot of excitement, and that will continue to improve our above premium mix.

The other behavioral change, which we've obviously experienced in 2020 is the growth of e-commerce sales. Many consumers of alcoholic beverages, they didn't realize you can buy a beer online, and they do now. And we've seen a 230% increase in our online sales.

Investing behind our iconic core brands and investing behind above premium and investing behind our beyond beer portfolio is the plan. Tracey mentioned in the guidance, approximately flat EBITDA, and that's really the revitalization planning coming to life with our big investments behind both Miller Lite and Coors Light, which we'll see more spend this year. We'll put more spend behind our above premium portfolio with Blue Moon LightSky and Blue Moon. We'll put more money behind our seltzers. We will have 4 seltzers in market this year. We only had 2. One was launched in April. The other one was launched in September. This year, we're going to have 4 as we strive to get to the 10% market share. And we're going to be investing behind our new ventures like ZOA and La Colombe and also our Yuengling joint venture.
In terms of actual performance, Bonnie, Coors Light and Miller Lite have performed really well in spite of the headwinds, which they've got. We've made numerous pivots from a marketing point of view to meet the changed circumstances. And when necessary, we put marketing money behind it in the fourth quarter, for example.
From a media perspective, we shifted our media to places like social gaming, podcasts, online, video and so on. And from a creative point of view, we've created a new creative, which has resonated with consumers. We've actually created 40 pieces of new creatives since March. A lot of that has been behind Miller Lite and Coors Light. I mean just some examples of that would be our Farewell Work Holiday Party for Miller Lite and then our campaign to get some florist into the Pro Football Hall of Fame with Coors Light, and you can see the benefits of that for -- with both of those brands.
I mean Coors Light drove significant share growth in the first half of the year. It did slow down in the third quarter because of the inventory supply constraints, which we had, which we're now through because our inventory is higher than it was at the same time last year for Coors Light. And in December, we saw the best industry share trend we've seen in years outside of the pantry loading for March for Coors Light. So it's -- the ""Made to Chill"" campaign platform is working, and we're excited about it. And Miller Lite share trends have been strong.
Now obviously, as I said in my opening remarks, we're not satisfied with the performance until and we intend to put more money behind it. So that's a very long-winded way of saying, it's both. It's not either/or. We're not sacrificing one for the other. We believe that we can do more than one thing at one time, and we believe that we're demonstrating it because the market where we've had the most concern about our execution capability is the U.S., and we've grown our top line. We grew our margin. Strong pricing, strong brand mix. This is the revitalization plan in action. It's not a series of one-offs. It's all part of a single strategy, and that's the revitalization plan, which is specifically aimed to drive top line growth, and we believe we will do that in 2021."

However, obviously, there's a bit of a disconnect in terms of how the public markets are viewing your outlook and prospects. Just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of share buybacks at some point. I know you talked about a very significant deleveraging, bringing the dividend back. How does the potential for share buybacks play into this if this disconnect continues?
And also maybe, Tracey, remind us about your cash tax rate, which I believe, remains very advantaged kind of roughly what that level is and how long it stays at that depressed or lower level."

Our focus has been on improving our leverage ratio because of the commitment to maintain our investment-grade rating as well as investing in our business to deliver the revitalization plan, which is around top line growth. So as always, we had looked at our capital allocation basket. We had a look at what gives us the highest -- or what gives our shareholders the highest rate of return. We ran through everything to our PACC model to make those decisions. But our intention is to continue to pay down our debt to improve our leverage ratio. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it is important for us, and we said this on the Q3 call as well. As soon as appropriate to reinstate the dividend and as I said in the guidance, that's something that we do anticipate our Board will be in a position to reinstate in the back half of this year.
So just in terms of the tax cash question. So yes, we do still get a benefit from the step-up as we did with the MillerCoors acquisition. And that does still run for another few years, Rob. But yes..."

As our revitalization plan requires us to do more than one thing at a time, it does both. And I think our fourth quarter is a fine example of that. We grew our top line in the U.S. We grew our net sales revenue per hectoliter meaningfully. We had positive brand mix and we demonstrated that we could deal with complexity. I mean the structure that we put in place in our company was designed to deal with complexity. We've got a team that focuses on the core brands and very pleased with what they've done with Coors Light and Miller Lite and our other legacy iconic brands.

We do have all our craft companies in that area. We have our non alc division. We have our cannabis THC infused beverages, RTDs and our CBD business.

Let me start by stating the obvious. The first quarter was not the quarter we expected to have. That reality was driven by 3 events: cybersecurity incident that caused the global system outage; a freak winter storm in Texas that forced utility companies to shut off power to major businesses, including our Fort Worth brewery; and government pandemic restrictions that shut down the entire on-premise channel in the U.K. and severely restricted much of the on-premise in Canada. 
To say that all of these events happening in a single quarter is unprecedented would be an understatement. But while we can't control the weather, across the business, we executed well on what was in our control. That's true of how we responded to each event. Our team quickly implemented contingency plans to boost production and get our core brands back to a stable inventory per for Memorial Day. And right now, we are shipping over 1 million barrels a week in the United States for the first time in nearly a year. But most importantly, it's true of how we are executing on our revitalization plan. 
During the first quarter, Coors Light and Miller Lite outperformed the combination of Bud Light and Michelob Ultra in U.S. industry share performance versus the prior year according to IRR. Our U.S. above premium portfolio grew brand volumes versus the prior year and continue to gain industry share according to IRR, and we took substantial steps towards our hard seltzer ambition. 
Our Truss joint ventures nonalcoholic cannabis beverages are holding strong as the #1 dollar share spot in the entire Canadian cannabis beverage market. As expected, the availability of our 12-ounce standard cans returned to normal levels. And we continued working to protect the environment through 2 significant initiatives in the United Kingdom. 
So let's look deeper at each area. That starts with our core. where we continue to see improving brand volume trends for Coors Light and Miller Lite in North America over the past quarter, thus trailing off strong performance in 2020. But the performance is even more impressive when you look at our biggest brands and our biggest family of brands. Coors Light finished the quarter with its strongest category share performance since Q1 of 2017, and Coors Banquet posted its best quarterly volume performance in over 4 years in the United States. We're building on that strong performance in the Coors family of brands with the launch of Coors Pure in March, our first USDA certified organic beer brand. And we had a strong Q1 in Panama with over a 50% increase in brand volumes with Coors Light's explosive triple-digit growth leading the way. 
However, it comes to our plans to aggressively grow our above-premium portfolio. As you know, we have big ambitions for hard seltzers this year, and the first quarter was a big one. And as we sit here today, our share of the U.S. hard seltzer segment is over 50% higher than it was at the beginning of the year. In a single week, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer sold at jumped to a 3.2 share of the U.S. hard seltzer category. despite only launching in 16 markets and have achieved a 20 share in Texas. Now I know it's early days, but that is a stunning fact that speaks to the opportunity with this brand. 
And it's not alone in our portfolio. Vizzy was a IRR top 10 U.S. industry growth brand in Q1. We are building on that with the brand's second variety pack, which launched in March, and the new Vizzy Lemonade, which launched several weeks later. They are both performing well. And in fact, Vizzy Lemonade is the second fastest turning hard lemonade seltzer in the market. 
We made significant headway with our hard seltzer in Canada and in Europe as well. After just over a monthly market, Vizzy Coors Seltzer are top 5 hard seltzer and brands with some of the leading Canadian retailers. In the U.K., our new Three Fold hard seltzer brand is launched, while our new brand Wai in Central and Eastern Europe is launching in the coming weeks. 
In above premium beers, Blue Moon LightSky, the #1 new item in U.S. beer last year is currently the #1 share gainer in U.S. craft beer in 2021. And Hop Valley has made its official national debut in the U.S. and Canada. It's our first national IPA in the U.S., and we believe it will be another driver of growth for our above premium portfolio. 
When it comes to our plans to expand beyond beer, last year, we made a lot of news as we took on a number of partnerships to build a competitive portfolio. This year, it's all about executing on those plans. ZOA gives us a strong entry into the $16 billion U.S. energy and performance space and is positioned to take a meaningful share of the category within a matter of months. It's just now beginning to hit shelves. But by Memorial Day, we expect ZOA will have over 80,000 points of distribution. And by the end of summer, that number is expected to climb to nearly 150,000. 
La Colombe alone gives us the #1 above premium player in the RTD coffee space, and I'm excited to report that we are ahead of plan on all of our distribution targets. Truss Canada, our Canadian cannabis joint venture with HEXO is holding strong as the #1 dollar share position with 6 of the top 10 cannabis beverage SKUs in Canada. And our Truss USA joint venture is building on that through their first lineup of hemp-derived CBD beverages in Colorado. And we have now entered the fast-growing RTD cocktail space through an exclusive equity and distribution agreement with Superbird in above-premium tequila-based Paloma. This entire lineup represents tremendous growth for our business and is helping us drive our emerging growth division towards a $1 billion revenue business by 2023. 
Last, but certainly not least, is how we are investing in our capabilities, our people and our communities. We have long been recognized as a leader for our environmental efforts. And several weeks ago, we became the first major U.K. brewer to operate entirely by renewable energy. Soon, every one of the 1 billion pounds of beer we produce annually in the U.K. will be made with 100% renewable energy. 
And we didn't stop there. We're removing plastic rings from all of our major -- across the U.K. In the U.S., this month, we announced our investments in TRU Colors, a North Carolina-based brewery that was founded on the premise that aligning rival gang members under the same roof with a common goal can both mitigate street violence and create economic opportunity. 
We're excited to share our knowledge on brewing, brand positioning and supplier relationships, and we are excited to be part of a business that is driving positive change in creating economic opportunity. 
I can assure you the events of this quarter are not lost on any of us. But as the quarter came to a close, there is land on the horizon. The on-trend gradually began to open back up in the U.K. Our industry standard can inventory normalized, and our weekly shipments in the U.S. topped 1 million barrels for the first month in nearly a year. We are making progress on the things that are within our control, and we are delivering against our revitalization plan. And that is what gives me the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for the full year. That is what gives me confidence in the current expectation that the Board will be in a position to reinstate the dividend in the second half of this year. That is what gives me confidence that we'll achieve long-term top line growth, and that is what tells me the future of Molson Coors is bright. Tracey?"
263765,709400834,2262829,"Molson Coors Beverage Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. Despite the challenges Gavin mentioned, we are proud of our operational agility and resilience as we have deeply managed through these challenges while still continuing to execute our revitalization plan. Now let me",1635,"Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. Despite the challenges Gavin mentioned, we are proud of our operational agility and resilience as we have deeply managed through these challenges while still continuing to execute our revitalization plan. Now let me take you through our quarterly results and provide an update on our outlook. 
Consolidated net sales revenue decreased 11.1% in constant currency principally due to lower financial volumes, which declined 12%, while brand volumes declined 9.1%. We delivered net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand mix in the U.S. as we continue to premiumize our portfolio. However, this was more than offset by the on-premise restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic and the corresponding negative channel mix as well as the unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S. related to the cybersecurity incident and the Texas winter storms. 
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 1.8% in constant currency as the net pricing growth more than offset the negative mix effect in Canada and Europe. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation and volume deleverage partially offset by cost savings. Driving cost inflation was higher transportation costs due to the continued tightening of the freight market in North America as well as higher can sourcing costs as we continue to source additional aluminum cans from all over the world to address the significant off-premise demand for our core brands. 
MG&A in the quarter decreased 15.9% on a constant currency basis driven by lower marketing spend and discretionary expenses as well as cost savings. While the timing of our marketing investments was adjusted in areas impacted by the pandemic, we continue to invest as planned behind our core brands and key innovations. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 20.2% on a constant currency basis. 
Underlying free cash flow was a use of $271 million for the quarter, an increase in cash use of $54 million from the prior year period, driven by lower underlying EBITDA and unfavorable working capital driven by the timing of payments related to lower volumes, prior year non-income tax deferrals due to governmental programs related to the coronavirus pandemic and incentive payments partially offset by lower CapEx spend. 
Capital expenditures paid were $103 million for the quarter, which were largely focused on our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project. Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to project timing. 
Now let's look at our results by business units. In North America, our markets experienced varying degrees of on-premise restrictions. In the U.S., our largest market, we saw progressive reopenings. And while there has been sequential improvement in the on-premise channel, we are still not back to pre-pandemic levels. In Canada, we saw significant restrictions and closures, while in Latin America, we saw restrictions easing. North America net sales revenue was down 6.3% in constant currency due to financial volume declines of 9.4%, reflecting lower brand volume due to the on-premise restrictions and [ factoring ] the March pantry loading in the prior year as well as unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S. In the U.S., brand volumes decreased 7.3% compared to domestic shipment declines of 9.5%, driven by the economy and premium segments. However, our U.S. above-premium brand volumes grew versus the prior year, and the segment reached a record high portion of our portfolio relative to any prior year first quarter since the creation of the MillerCoors joint venture. Canada brand volumes declined 10.8%, primarily due to the on-premise closure, while Latin America brand volumes grew 10.8%. 
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.4% in constant currency. In the U.S., net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.1% on driven by positive brand mix led by innovation brands, Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA. In Canada, negative channel mix more than offset the net pricing increases while Latin America net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased due to positive sales mix. 
North America underlying EBITDA decreased 13.3% in constant currency due to the lower net sales revenue and higher COGS per hectoliter partially offset by a 14.4% decrease in MG&A in constant currency. The increase in cost per hectoliter was driven primarily by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging material costs, volume deleverage and mix impact from premiumization partially offset by cost savings. The MG&A decline was mainly due to lower marketing spend and discretionary expenses as well as cost savings. We increased marketing investment behind core innovation brands such as Coors Seltzer, Vizzy and Blue Moon LightSky, and we increased media spending behind our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite. These increases were more than offset by lower spend in areas impacted by the pandemic, such as sports and live entertainment events. 
Europe net sales revenue was down 39.5% in constant currency driven by volume declines and negative geographic and channel mix due to on-premise restrictions, most meaningfully in the U.K. given the on-premise lockdowns for the fourth quarter. Europe financial volumes decreased 22% and brand volumes decreased 17%, driven by a significant decline in brand volumes in the U.K. However, our Central and Eastern European business has performed fairly well and was able to deliver comparable volumes versus the prior year period. 
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis declined 10.4% driven by unfavorable geographic channel and brand mix, particularly from our higher-margin on-premise-focused U.K. business partially offset by positive pricing. Underlying EBITDA was a loss of $38 million compared to a loss of $4.1 million in the prior year, driven by gross margin impact of lower volumes and unfavorable geographic and channel mix as a result of the pandemic partially offset by lower MG&A expenses driven by cost mitigation actions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Net debt was $7.7 billion, down $1.1 billion from March 31, 2020. And we ended the first quarter with a strong borrowing capacity with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion U.S. credit facility as of March 31, 2021. As for our U.K. COVID corporate financing facility, it was closed on March 23, 2021, and we had no outstanding borrowings at that time. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We are reaffirming our 2021 annual guidance provided on February 11, 2021. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We are working aggressively to build inventories and expect domestic shipment trends in the U.S. to begin to exceed brand volume in the second half of the year. For the year, we maintain our current year goal of shipping to consumption in the U.S. 
In the U.S., we expect improving on-premise trends in the second quarter as we lap essentially full closures in the prior year, while in Canada, we have seen increasing on-premise restrictions continuing to pressure the on-premise channel. In Europe, we've seen a gradual opening of the U.K. on-premise beginning in mid-April to outdoor consumption only, and we expect further phased on-premise reopenings later in the second quarter, resulting in year-on-year improvement versus the prior period. 
We anticipate underlying EBITDA will be flat compared to 2020 as growth is expected to be offset by COGS inflationary headwinds but more significantly from increased investment to deliver against our revitalization plan. We intend to increase marketing spend to build on the strength of our core brands and support our successful 2020 launches, including Blue Moon LightSky, Vizzy and Coors Seltzer and new innovations like Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA. 
With this in mind, we expect significant year-on-year increases in marketing spend over the balance of the year and, most notably, in the second quarter. We expect second quarter marketing spend to be higher than the second quarter 2020 level and to approach second quarter 2019 levels. 
We also continue to anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, net interest expense of $270 million plus or minus 5% and an effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. It also bears reminding that in  2020, our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $150 million in tax payment from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic, of which we currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due. 
Our efforts in 2020 positioned us with greatly improved financial flexibility. better enabling us to execute our capital allocation priorities to invest in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders in 2021. We plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives, improve efficiencies and advance towards our sustainability goals. 
Driven by a commitment to maintaining [ anytime ], upgrading our investment-grade rating, we expect to continue to pay down debt and reaffirm our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.25x by the end of 2021 and below 3x by the end of 2022. And in line with our fourth quarter 2020 earnings comments, we currently anticipate that our Board of Directors will be in a position to reinstate a dividend in the second half of this year. 
Now we are pleased with our ability to adapt and overcome despite the incredible challenges we faced in the first quarter. Our continued progress against our revitalization plan, the agility of our organization in the face of challenges and the commitment and resilience of our people give us the confidence we can continue to successfully execute our revitalization plan, driving long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress. So with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Debbie?"

Our revitalization plan, one of its core tenets was that we were going to spend more money behind our core brands, behind our above premium brands and also to extend beyond the beer with above premium. In the first quarter, we actually did increase our spend behind our innovations. And we also increased the spend behind media on our core brands. In fact, we didn't make any adjustments to our marketing plan in Q1 as a result of the cybersecurity incident or the Texas storm. We spent what we were planning to spend, particularly behind, as I said, our core brands and our innovations. We didn't plan to spend a lot of money in Europe because of the on-premise closures. And we certainly didn't spend any money, as Tracey said in her opening remarks, on live sports or live concepts in the U.S.A. or Canada because there weren't any. 
We do expect a substantial increase in marketing, particularly in Q2, returning pretty close to the 2019 levels as we feel the tremendous momentum that we've got behind brands like Vizzy, Topo Chico, our core brands at Miller Lite and Coors Light. And obviously, as Europe starts to reopen, we'll be increasing our marketing spend in Europe in Q2 and beyond as well. Tracey, do you want to take G&A and then the dividend?"

I also want to remind you that we do have the cost savings program that we announced last year, $600 million over 3 years. In 2020, we achieved $270 million of that $600 million, and we expect to achieve in sort of roughly an equal portion the balance in 2021 and 2022. So there is the cost savings, which we are continuing to track very well against that will provide some relief and enable us to carry on it with our revitalization plan and invest behind our brands to grow that top line. 
As it relates to the Board, as I said, we are having conversations with the Board. We are assessing exactly when and how we will be or we will be recommending to the Board to reinstate the dividend. So I can't say much more than that, but more to come."

So maybe not getting back all the volume that you lost during the incidents in Q1 in the quarter -- in Q2, that is. And then you have expectations for marketing spending, I'll just use MG&A as a proxy in Q2 being up year-over-year and sort of in line with 2019 levels or a little bit below. I think that's what I heard. And I guess if I'm putting all that together, I mean, you could see something like MG&A up 500 basis points in North America, for example, and EBITDA implied up kind of double digits in the back half of the year to get to the flat EBITDA. And I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out there, but the general concept here is that Q2, a slow recovery if you have the significantly accelerated spend? What happens if the recovery is a little bit slower? Do you pull back on that? And then just confirming this dynamic that it seems like to get to the flat EBITDA. It's really about just delivery in the back half of the year. Apologies for more of a financial question, but if that kind of makes sense. I appreciate any perspective on that."

So I mean, obviously, we're not going to give quarterly guidance, the numbers, the guidance that Tracey has given you for the full year, and we'll let that  stand on by themselves. 
From a recovery point of view, we've pretty quickly put a plan in place. We're prioritizing our core brands of Coors Light, Miller Lite, Coors Banquet, Blue Moon, Miller High Life, Keystone Light and Leinenkugel Summer Shandy. So that's our primary focus at the moment. We've discontinued to deprioritize slower-moving brands and packs. Most of that is in the economy space but also some side. 
Now the plan is designed to make sure that we recover our core brands to be in a much better place by Memorial Day and, ultimately, for Europe. The self-service and innovation supplier, frankly, wasn't affected by the cybersecurity incident at all. Can suppliers returned back to normal, producing bottles in the -- kegs at full capacity. So I guess to try and get a little bit closer to your question, obviously, with us really only focusing on the core brands, that will imply that the slower-moving and some of the deprioritized brands will only really be picked up in the second half of the year from a volume perspective. 
From a marketing spend perspective, we've got a lot of momentum behind some really exciting innovations, which have landed well, and we'll be fueling those.

And maybe as part of that, if you could just characterize how thin U.S. channel inventories were exiting March relative to consumer demand run rates? And just -- what we're trying to -- I'm really trying to figure out just what the catch-up is now that I presume you're shifting to full capacity as we sit here end of April."

Now I would tell you that the recovery plan our supply chain teams just did a tremendous job in those sort of back end of March. So I would say, by the end of March, we were a couple of hundred thousand barrels ahead of where we were expecting to be. So I think you can assume that the impact was  a little bit less than what we've said in our 8-K. And as we sit here today, I think it's the 29th of April, we've continued to meet the recovery plan and, in fact, exceeded a little bit. So I think our breweries are well on track with that recovery plan. 
We have seen sequential improvement in our core brands inventory, but we're not where we want to be just yet. We expect to be much closer to where we want to be with those brands by Memorial Day and then fully recovered on the core brands towards -- in the sort of back end of the second quarter. And then we can focus in on those brands that we have paused beyond that. I think that's about as far as I'm going to go on the impact, Steve."

So I'll start with your final point, right, which is actually more than half of the seltzer growth is actually coming from outside of the beer category. We've tested that number multiple times over the last year, and it's pretty consistent. So Obviously, premium -- are losing segment to sales, but it certainly is coming from other places, including craft and ironically economy, less so actually premium lights, which may surprise you, but it's what the data says. We have seen continued positive trends for Coors Light and Miller Lite over the past quarter, and that's trading off the strong performance which we had in 2020. And the focus that we're placing on the health of our core brands is  paying off, specifically our ambitions to connect with new drinkers and giving them a real reason to reach for Miller Lite and Coors Light and just kind of break through that big beer advertising plateau with fresh creative approaches, and we're seeing the benefits of it. 
For example, in Coors Light, we're up significantly in key brand health metrics like consideration and like household penetration, positive impressions amongst 21- to 34-year olds, which is a key target market for us. And so far in 2021, Miller Lite see an increase in both consideration and positive impression. I can go on in quite some more detail on how the Coors Light campaign is has turned a corner since the 2019 launch of -- brands growing segment share in premium life every quarter since we had that launch We've cut our share loss in the total category by more than 20 -- more than 70%, I think it was. Coors Light is continuing to establish itself as the brand consumers buy when they're ready to chill. So the campaign for Coors Light is resonating strongly with our core market, but also our growth targets, for example, the Latino drinker. 
So our revitalization strategy required us to invest behind our core brands, and we're doing exactly that. And we are seeing the benefits of it. From a share point of view, I think I gave you some of the stats in our opening remarks. I don't know if I mentioned that above premium is also gaining industry share. Blue Moon LightSky is doing particularly well. And I haven't talked much about Vizzy, but we think we've got a real winner with Vizzy. It's achieved almost a 3% share in 2020 with only one SKU And that SKU moved faster in Q1 than all Bud Light variety packs put together. We're expanding our footprint with new packs. We've got a second variety pack. the lemonade pack, and we've got a third new launching in summer. Our variety pack #2 is already turning faster than our variety pack #1. And Vizzy Lemonade is the second fastest turning lemonade sell through in the market. Vizzy actually had a record sales week last week. So you gave me a lot of questions. I've tried to give you a lot of answers and give you a little bit of color. I hope that helps, Kevin."

I think the answer to both of your questions, Brian, is yes. During the pandemic, we certainly saw an increased demand for large trusted brands, and that's particularly true in the on-premise as your question is direct to that. We also saw it in the off-premise, but it's particularly true in the on-premise, where on-premise owners are sticking to fewer, faster-moving brands. And that obviously benefits brands like Miller Lite and Coors Light. It also helps us from a Blue Moon point of view as well. I mean Blue Moon is the largest craft brand, as you know, and it's disproportionately focused on the on-premise. So the reopening of the on-premise and the move to large trusted brands is helping us, particularly with Miller Lite, Coors Light and Blue Moon. And we've seen it tick up a couple of points in our share in the on-premise as the on-premises has reopened. 
You referenced seltzers on-premise. And certainly, in packaged form, I think that, that is absolutely right. I mean we're in -- we've actually had triple-digit growth in our placements this year and retailers are reaching out to us asking for Topo Chico as quickly as possible given its spectacular launch and the demand that's been created by that. Distribution of seltzer and velocity for us in the on-premise is actually increasing, and it's going to give us a real opportunity to do large-scale sampling opportunities, particularly through our alliances because. We know we've got great tasting products when we get consumers to try them, they're sold. And that also applies to innovation like Blue Moon LightSky. 
We're launching 2 draft seltzer on a regional basis through our craft companies, and we'll see how that plays out. But certainly, we're seeing big uptick in demand for our seltzer packaged brands in the on-premise. I hope I got all of that, Brian."

Do you have maybe increased confidence that you'll get to that double-digit share of the category by the end of the year? And then you also referenced some work that you're doing on the international side with hard seltzers. How -- I mean, how do you see those European markets developing for hard seltzers?

Look, as you know, we don't normally give these updates anymore. But I think given the cybersecurity incident, I'll make an exception and give you some flavor for how April is going. You referenced scanner data. I mean, obviously, that needs context, right? I mean before data, scanner data is including that massive loading that we had in the off-premise from March of last year. And so it doesn't take into account any shift into the on-premise. 
Over the last 4 weeks, our sales to retailers in the United States are up mid-single digits, Rob, so quite different to what you're seeing in the scanner data. We're shipping over 1 million barrels a week in the U.S.A., as I said in my prepared remarks, and the U.K. volume's up double digits despite only, as I said, 30% to 40% of on-premise being open and only for outdoor dining. 
Your second question around seltzers. Heading towards our goal of double digits or 10% by the end of the year, I mean You're right. I mean we had a spectacular launch of Topo Chico in the very limited markets in which it's in. It's only in 16 markets. So I think we've got a clear winner here, and we'll continue to feel the potential of this brand. And based on the reaction in those 16 markets, I think it's got strong national potential, and we'll look to roll that out to future markets when we're confident that we can meet the unexpectedly very high demand that we had in its rollout markets. 
You're right on Vizzy. I think we believe we have a real winner with Vizzy. I won't repeat the stats I just gave, I think it was to Brian or Kevin, but I think particularly exciting for us is the fact that Vizzy Lemonade is the second fastest earning lemonade seltzer. And as I said, we had a record sales week for Vizzy last year. We're pleased with the performance. We had a singular SKU last year. We only launched in April, and we had inventory challenges while we're meeting all the demand for Vizzy, now that we've got the capacity up and running in our fourth Fort Worth Brewery. So If that means that we're more confident to get to our 10% target. We certainly think we've got the brands in the seltzer space to do that and now we need to execute. 
I think the early data in the European market suggests that seltzer is going to be good. I'm not sure yet that I'm ready to tell you that it's going to be as good as it is in the United States. We don't need any data to support that. But certainly, Three Fold has landed well in the United Kingdom. And Wai is already in a couple of markets in Central and Eastern Europe, and we'll be rolling it out more fully towards in this month. So I hope that helps, Rob."

So we expect to continue to see that tightening in the freight market. And then as it relates to us, sourcing cans from 4 continents, that also actually added to that inflation. 
In terms of levers to mitigate that, I did mention our cost savings program. So we delivered $270 million of the $600 million in 2020. We expect to deliver the balance of that in 2021 and 2022 roughly in equal portions. And we're doing -- so far, we're tracking well to achieve those savings.

He's actually an owner of the business together with us. And frankly, every time he put something out on Instagram, he reaches 231 million followers in  a nanosecond. 
The true test of how innovation lands is what are the distributors order. I mean we just had our order window for the very first order closed. I think it was either last night or the night before it. And the orders are strong, and that tells you how the distributors feel about it. The retailers are particularly excited about it as well. So we're just getting into the market with it now.

La Colombe, we've already hit our distribution targets. We had distribution targets with our partner, La Colombe, that was set for the full year. And we're in April, and we've hit them.

In Q1, we -- as we said in our earnings release, we did incur a net expense of $2 million as it related to various consultants and experts that helped us and are helping us with investigation. Actually I don't want to talk too much about it because it still is an open investigation around the incident. But just in terms of investments, we have seen a significant amount of upgrading our systems in North America. We've spoken about U.S. for a number of years, our BPM systems. And at this stage, we are also upgrading our systems for Canada, where we're actually taking the Canadian systems and putting it on to our U.S. systems. So more than that, Lauren, I really don't want to give because it is an open investigation. 
Just in terms of Q2, though, as it relates specifically to the incidents, we do anticipate some further minimal, really immaterial costs as we sort of put this to bed."

Let me start by stating the obvious. The first quarter was not the quarter we expected to have. That reality was driven by 3 events: cybersecurity incident that caused the global system outage; a freak winter storm in Texas that forced utility companies to shut off power to major businesses, including our Fort Worth brewery; and government pandemic restrictions that shut down the entire on-premise channel in the U.K. and severely restricted much of the on-premise in Canada. 
To say that all of these events happening in a single quarter is unprecedented would be an understatement. But while we can't control the weather, across the business, we executed well on what was in our control. That's true of how we responded to each event. Our team quickly implemented contingency plans to boost production and get our core brands back to a stable inventory per for Memorial Day. And right now, we are shipping over 1 million barrels a week in the United States for the first time in nearly a year. But most importantly, it's true of how we are executing on our revitalization plan. 
During the first quarter, Coors Light and Miller Lite outperformed the combination of Bud Light and Michelob Ultra in U.S. industry share performance versus the prior year according to IRR. Our U.S. above premium portfolio grew brand volumes versus the prior year and continued to gain industry share according to IRR, and we took substantial steps towards our hard seltzer ambition. 
Our Truss joint ventures nonalcoholic cannabis beverages are holding strong as the #1 dollar share spot in the entire Canadian cannabis beverage market. As expected, the availability of our 12-ounce standard cans returned to normal levels. And we continued working to protect the environment through 2 significant initiatives in the United Kingdom. 
So let's look deeper at each area. That starts with our core. where we continue to see improving brand volume trends for Coors Light and Miller Lite in North America over the past quarter, thus trailing off strong performance in 2020. But the performance is even more impressive when you look at our biggest brands and our biggest family of brands. Coors Light finished the quarter with its strongest category share performance since Q1 of 2017, and Coors Banquet posted its best quarterly volume performance in over 4 years in the United States. We're building on that strong performance in the Coors family of brands with the launch of Coors Pure in March, our first USDA certified organic beer brand. And we had a strong Q1 in Panama with over a 50% increase in brand volumes with Coors Light's explosive triple-digit growth leading the way. 
However, it comes to our plans to aggressively grow our above-premium portfolio. As you know, we have big ambitions for hard seltzers this year, and the first quarter was a big one. And as we sit here today, our share of the U.S. hard seltzer segment is over 50% higher than it was at the beginning of the year. In a single week, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer sold at jumped to a 3.2 share of the U.S. hard seltzer category. despite only launching in 16 markets and have achieved a 20 share in Texas. Now I know it's early days, but that is a stunning fact that speaks to the opportunity with this brand. 
And it's not alone in our portfolio. Vizzy was a IRR top 10 U.S. industry growth brand in Q1. We are building on that with the brand's second variety pack, which launched in March, and the new Vizzy Lemonade, which launched several weeks later. They are both performing well. And in fact, Vizzy Lemonade is the second fastest turning hard lemonade seltzer in the market. 
We made significant headway with our hard seltzer in Canada and in Europe as well. After just over a monthly market, Vizzy and Coors Seltzer are top 5 hard seltzer and brands with some of the leading Canadian retailers. In the U.K., our new Three Fold hard seltzer brand is launched, while our new brand Wai in Central and Eastern Europe is launching in the coming weeks. 
In above premium beers, Blue Moon LightSky, the #1 new item in U.S. beer last year is currently the #1 share gainer in U.S. craft beer in 2021. And Hop Valley has made its official national debut in the U.S. and Canada. It's our first national IPA in the U.S., and we believe it will be another driver of growth for our above premium portfolio. 
When it comes to our plans to expand beyond beer, last year, we made a lot of news as we took on a number of partnerships to build a competitive portfolio. This year, it's all about executing on those plans. ZOA gives us a strong entry into the $16 billion U.S. energy and performance space and is positioned to take a meaningful share of the category within a matter of months. It's just now beginning to hit shelves. But by Memorial Day, we expect ZOA will have over 80,000 points of distribution. And by the end of summer, that number is expected to climb to nearly 150,000. 
La Colombe alone gives us the #1 above premium player in the RTD coffee space, and I'm excited to report that we are ahead of plan on all of our distribution targets. Truss Canada, our Canadian cannabis joint venture with HEXO is holding strong as the #1 dollar share position with 6 of the top 10 cannabis beverage SKUs in Canada. And our Truss USA joint venture is building on that through their first lineup of hemp-derived CBD beverages in Colorado. And we have now entered the fast-growing RTD cocktail space through an exclusive equity and distribution agreement with Superbird in above-premium tequila-based Paloma. This entire lineup represents tremendous growth for our business and is helping us drive our emerging growth division towards a $1 billion revenue business by 2023. 
Last, but certainly not least, is how we are investing in our capabilities, our people and our communities. We have long been recognized as a leader for our environmental efforts. And several weeks ago, we became the first major U.K. brewer to operate entirely by renewable energy. Soon, every one of the 1 billion pounds of beer we produce annually in the U.K. will be made with 100% renewable energy. 
And we didn't stop there. We're removing plastic rings from all of our major -- across the U.K. In the U.S., this month, we announced our investments in TRU Colors, a North Carolina-based brewery that was founded on the premise that aligning rival gang members under the same roof with a common goal can both mitigate street violence and create economic opportunity. 
We're excited to share our knowledge on brewing, brand positioning and supplier relationships, and we are excited to be part of a business that is driving positive change in creating economic opportunity. 
I can assure you the events of this quarter are not lost on any of us. But as the quarter came to a close, there is land on the horizon. The on-trend gradually began to open back up in the U.K. Our industry standard can inventory normalized, and our weekly shipments in the U.S. topped 1 million barrels for the first month in nearly a year. We are making progress on the things that are within our control, and we are delivering against our revitalization plan. And that is what gives me the confidence to reaffirm our guidance for the full year. That is what gives me confidence in the current expectation that the Board will be in a position to reinstate a dividend in the second half of this year. That is what gives me confidence that we'll achieve long-term top line growth, and that is what tells me the future of Molson Coors is bright. Trace?"
263765,709400834,2263138,"Molson Coors Beverage Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Molson Coors Beverage Company","Executives","Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. Despite the challenges Gavin mentioned, we are proud of our operational agility and resilience as we have deeply managed through these challenges while still continuing to execute our revitalization plan. Now let me",1630,"Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. Despite the challenges Gavin mentioned, we are proud of our operational agility and resilience as we have deeply managed through these challenges while still continuing to execute our revitalization plan. Now let me take you through our quarterly results and provide an update on our outlook. 
Consolidated net sales revenue decreased 11.1% in constant currency principally due to lower financial volumes, which declined 12%, while brand volumes declined 9.1%. We delivered net pricing growth in North America and Europe as well as positive brand mix in the U.S. as we continued to premiumize our portfolio. However, this was more than offset by the on-premise restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic and the corresponding negative channel mix as well as the unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S. related to the cybersecurity incident and the Texas winter storms. 
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 1.8% in constant currency as the net pricing growth more than offset the negative mix effect in Canada and Europe. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation and volume deleverage partially offset by cost savings. Driving cost inflation was higher transportation costs due to the continued tightening of the freight market in North America as well as higher can sourcing costs as we continue to source additional aluminum cans from all over the world to address the significant off-premise demand for our core brands. 
MG&A in the quarter decreased 15.9% on a constant currency basis driven by lower marketing spend and discretionary expenses as well as cost savings. While the timing of our marketing investments was adjusted in areas impacted by the pandemic, we continued to invest as planned behind our core brands and key innovations. As a result, underlying EBITDA decreased 20.2% on a constant currency basis. 
Underlying free cash flow was a use of $271 million for the quarter, an increase in cash use of $54 million from the prior year period, driven by lower underlying EBITDA and unfavorable working capital driven by the timing of payments related to lower volumes, prior year non-income tax deferrals due to governmental programs related to the coronavirus pandemic and incentive payments partially offset by lower CapEx spend. 
Capital expenditures paid were $103 million for the quarter, which were largely focused on our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project. Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to project timing. 
Now let's look at our results by business units. In North America, our markets experienced varying degrees of on-premise restrictions. In the U.S., our largest market, we saw progressive reopenings. And while there has been sequential improvement in the on-premise channel, we are still not back to pre-pandemic levels. In Canada, we saw significant restrictions and closures, while in Latin America, we saw restrictions easing. North America net sales revenue was down 6.3% in constant currency due to financial volume declines of 9.4%, reflecting lower brand volume due to the on-premise restrictions and the March pantry loading in the prior year as well as unfavorable shipment timing in the U.S. In the U.S., brand volumes decreased 7.3% compared to domestic shipment declines of 9.5%, driven by the economy and premium segments. However, our U.S. above-premium brand volumes grew versus the prior year, and the segment reached a record high portion of our portfolio relative to any prior year first quarter since the creation of the Miller Coors joint venture. Canada brand volumes declined 10.8%, primarily due to the on-premise closure, while Latin America brand volumes grew 10.8%. 
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.4% in constant currency. In the U.S., net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.1% driven by positive brand mix led by innovation brands, Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA. In Canada, negative channel mix more than offset the net pricing increases while Latin America net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased due to positive sales mix. 
North America underlying EBITDA decreased 13.3% in constant currency due to the lower net sales revenue and higher COGS per hectoliter partially offset by a 14.4% decrease in MG&A and constant currency. The increase in cost per hectoliter was driven primarily by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging material costs, volume deleverage and mix impact from premiumization partially offset by cost savings. The MG&A decline was mainly due to lower marketing spend and discretionary expenses as well as cost savings. We increased marketing investment behind core innovation brands such as Coors Seltzer, Vizzy and Blue Moon LightSky, and we increased media spending behind our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite. These increases were more than offset by lower spend in areas impacted by the pandemic, such as sports and live entertainment events. 
Europe net sales revenue was down 39.5% in constant currency driven by volume declines and negative geographic and channel mix due to on-premise restrictions, most meaningfully in the U.K. given the on-premise lockdowns for the fourth quarter. Europe financial volumes decreased 22% and brand volumes decreased 17%, driven by a significant decline in brand volumes in the U.K. However, our Central and Eastern European business has performed fairly well and was able to deliver comparable volumes versus the prior year period. 
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis declined 10.4% driven by unfavorable geographic channel and brand mix, particularly from our higher-margin on-premise-focused U.K. business partially offset by positive pricing. Underlying EBITDA was a loss of $38 million compared to a loss of $4.1 million in the prior year, driven by gross margin impact of lower volumes and unfavorable geographic and channel mix as a result of the pandemic partially offset by lower MG&A expenses driven by cost mitigation actions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Net debt was $7.7 billion, down $1.1 billion from March 31, 2020. And we ended the first quarter with a strong borrowing capacity with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion U.S. credit facility as of March 31, 2021. As for our U.K. COVID corporate financing facility, it was closed on March 23, 2021, and we had no outstanding borrowings at that time. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We are reaffirming our 2021 annual guidance provided on February 11, 2021. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We are working aggressively to build inventories and expect domestic shipment trends in the U.S. to begin to exceed brand volume in the second half of the year. For the year, we maintain our current year goal of shipping to consumption in the U.S. 
In the U.S., we expect improving on-premise trends in the second quarter as we lap essentially full closures in the prior year. While in Canada, we have seen increasing on-premise restrictions continuing to pressure the on-premise channel. In Europe, we've seen a gradual opening of the U.K. on-premise beginning in mid-April to outdoor consumption only, and we expect further phased on-premise reopenings later in the second quarter, resulting in year-on-year improvement versus the prior period. 
We anticipate underlying EBITDA will be flat compared to 2020 as growth is expected to be offset by COGS inflationary headwinds but more significantly from increased investment to deliver against our revitalization plan. We intend to increase marketing spend to build on the strength of our core brands and support our successful 2020 launches, including Blue Moon LightSky, Vizzy and Coors Seltzer and new innovations like Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA. 
With this in mind, we expect significant year-on-year increases in marketing spend over the balance of the year and, most notably, in the second quarter. We expect second quarter marketing spend to be higher than the second quarter 2020 level and to approach second quarter 2019 levels. 
We also continue to anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, net interest expense of $270 million plus or minus 5% and an effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. It also bears reminding that in 2020, our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $150 million in tax payment from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic, of which we currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due. 
Our efforts in 2020 positioned us with greatly improved financial flexibility. better enabling us to execute our capital allocation priorities to invest in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders in 2021. We plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives, improve efficiencies and advance towards our sustainability goals. 
Driven by a commitment to maintaining anytime, upgrading our investment-grade rating, we expect to continue to pay down debt and reaffirm our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.25x by the end of 2021 and below 3x by the end of 2022. And in line with our fourth quarter 2020 earnings comments, we currently anticipate that our Board of Directors will be in a position to reinstate a dividend in the second half of this year. Now we are pleased with our ability to adapt and overcome despite the incredible challenges we faced in the first quarter. Our continued progress against our revitalization plan, the agility of our organization in the face of challenges and the commitment and resilience of our people give us the confidence we can continue to successfully execute our revitalization plan, driving long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth. And we look forward to updating you on our continued progress. So with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Debbie?"

And then also on a follow-up for the dividend is that the way we should be thinking?

Our revitalization plan, one of its core tenets was that we were going to spend more money behind our core brands, behind our above premium brands and also to extend beyond the beer with above premium. In the first quarter, we actually did increase our spend behind our innovations. And we also increased the spend behind media on our core brands. In fact, we didn't make any adjustments to our marketing plan in Q1 as a result of the cybersecurity incident or the Texas storm. We spent what we were planning to spend, particularly behind, as I said, our core brands and our innovations. We didn't plan to spend a lot of money in Europe because of the on-premise closures. And we certainly didn't spend any money, as Tracey said in her opening remarks, on live sports or live concepts in the U.S.A. or Canada because there weren't any. 
We do expect a substantial increase in marketing, particularly in Q2, returning pretty close to the 2019 levels as we feel the tremendous momentum that we've got behind brands like Vizzy, Topo Chico, our core brands at Miller Lite and Coors Light. And obviously, as Europe starts to reopen, we'll be increasing our marketing spend in Europe in Q2 and beyond as well. Tracey, do you want to take G&A and then the dividend?"

I also want to remind you that we do have the cost savings program that we announced last year, $600 million over 3 years. In 2020, we achieved $270 million of that $600 million, and we expect to achieve in sort of roughly an equal portion the balance in 2021 and 2022. So there is the cost savings, which we are continuing to track very well against that will provide some relief and enable us to carry on it with our revitalization plan and invest behind our brands to grow that top line. 
As it relates to the Board, as I said, we are having conversations with the Board. We are assessing exactly when and how we will be or we will be recommending to the Board to reinstate the dividend. So I can't say much more than that, but more to come."

And I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out there, but the general concept here is that Q2, a slow recovery if you have the significantly accelerated spend? What happens if the recovery is a little bit slower? Do you pull back on that? And then just confirming this dynamic that it seems like to get to the flat EBITDA.

So I mean, obviously, we're not going to give quarterly guidance, the numbers, the guidance that Tracey has given you for the full year, and we'll let that stand on by themselves. 
From a recovery point of view, we've pretty quickly put a plan in place. We're prioritizing our core brands of Coors Light, Miller Lite, Coors Banquet, Blue Moon, Miller High Life, Keystone Light and Leinenkugel Summer Shandy. So that's our primary focus at the moment. We've discontinued to deprioritize slower-moving brands and packs. Most of that is in the economy space but also some cider. 
Now the plan is designed to make sure that we recover our core brands to be in a much better place by Memorial Day and, ultimately, for Europe. The self-service and innovation supplier, frankly, wasn't affected by the cybersecurity incident at all. Can suppliers returned back to normal, producing bottles in the -- kegs at full capacity. So I guess to try and get a little bit closer to your question, obviously, with us really only focusing on the core brands, that will imply that the slower-moving and some of the deprioritized brands will only really be picked up in the second half of the year from a volume perspective. 
From a marketing spend perspective, we've got a lot of momentum behind some really exciting innovations, which have landed well, and we'll be fueling those. And Coors Light and Miller Lite performance, as I said in my opening remarks, is strong. The campaigns are working, and we'll be putting the necessary firepower behind those 2 brands.

Now I would tell you that the recovery plan our supply chain teams just did a tremendous job in those sort of back end of March. So I would say, by the end of March, we were a couple of hundred thousand barrels ahead of where we were expecting to be. So I think you can assume that the impact was a little bit less than what we've said in our 8-K. And as we sit here today, I think it's the 29th of April, we've continued to meet the recovery plan and, in fact, exceeded a little bit. So I think our breweries are well on track with that recovery plan. 
We have seen sequential improvement in our core brands inventory, but we're not where we want to be just yet. We expect to be much closer to where we want to be with those brands by Memorial Day and then fully recovered on the core brands towards -- in the sort of back end of the second quarter.

So I'll start with your final point, right, which is actually more than half of the seltzer growth is actually coming from outside of the beer category. We've tested that number multiple times over the last year, and it's pretty consistent. So Obviously, premium lights are losing segment to sales, but it certainly is coming from other places, including craft and ironically economy, less so actually premium lights, which may surprise you, but it's what the data says. We have seen continued positive trends for Coors Light and Miller Lite over the past quarter, and that's trading off the strong performance which we had in 2020. And the focus that we're placing on the health of our core brands is paying off, specifically our ambitions to connect with new drinkers and giving them a real reason to reach for Miller Lite and Coors Light and just kind of break through that big beer advertising plateau with fresh creative approaches, and we're seeing the benefits of it. 
For example, in Coors Light, we're up significantly in key brand health metrics like consideration and like household penetration, positive impressions amongst 21- to 34-year olds, which is a key target market for us. And so far in 2021, Miller Lite see an increase in both consideration and positive impression. I can go on in quite some more detail on how the Coors Light campaign has turned a corner since the 2019 launch of -- brands growing segment share in premium lights every quarter since we had that launch We've cut our share loss in the total category by more than 20 -- more than 70%, I think it was. Coors Light is continuing to establish itself as the brand consumers buy when they're ready to chill. So the campaign for Coors Light is resonating strongly with our core market, but also our growth targets, for example, the Latino drinker. 
So our revitalization strategy required us to invest behind our core brands, and we're doing exactly that. And we are seeing the benefits of it. From a share point of view, I think I gave you some of the stats in our opening remarks. I don't know if I mentioned that above premium is also gaining industry share. Blue Moon LightSky is doing particularly well. And I haven't talked much about Vizzy, but we think we've got a real winner with Vizzy. It's achieved almost a 3% share in 2020 with only one SKU And that SKU moved faster in Q1 than all Bud Light variety packs put together. We're expanding our footprint with new packs. We've got a second variety pack. the lemonade pack, and we've got a third new launching in summer. Our variety pack #2 is already turning faster than our variety pack #1. And Vizzy Lemonade is the second fastest turning lemonade sell through in the market. Vizzy actually had a record sales week last week. So you gave me a lot of questions. I've tried to give you a lot of answers and give you a little bit of color. I hope that helps, Kevin."

I think the answer to both of your questions, Bryan, is yes. During the pandemic, we certainly saw an increased demand for large trusted brands, and that's particularly true in the on-premise as your question is direct to that. We also saw it in the off-premise, but it's particularly true in the on-premise, where on-premise owners are sticking to fewer, faster-moving brands. And that obviously benefits brands like Miller Lite and Coors Light. It also helps us from a Blue Moon point of view as well. I mean Blue Moon is the largest craft brand, as you know, and it's disproportionately focused on the on-premise. So the reopening of the on-premise and the move to large trusted brands is helping us, particularly with Miller Lite, Coors Light and Blue Moon. And we've seen it tick up a couple of points in our share in the on-premise as the on-premises has reopened. 
You referenced seltzers on-premise. And certainly, in packaged form, I think that, that is absolutely right. I mean we're in -- we've actually had triple-digit growth in our placements this year and retailers are reaching out to us asking for Topo Chico as quickly as possible given its spectacular launch and the demand that's been created by that. Distribution of seltzer and velocity for us in the on-premise is actually increasing, and it's going to give us a real opportunity to do large-scale sampling opportunities, particularly through our alliances because. We know we've got great tasting products when we get consumers to try them, they're sold. And that also applies to innovation like Blue Moon LightSky. 
We're launching 2 draft seltzer on a regional basis through our craft companies, and we'll see how that plays out. But certainly, we're seeing big uptick in demand for our seltzer packaged brands in the on-premise. I hope I got all of that, Bryan."

Look, as you know, we don't normally give these updates anymore. But I think given the cybersecurity incident, I'll make an exception and give you some flavor for how April is going. You referenced scanner data. I mean, obviously, that needs context, right? I mean the 4 week data, scanner data is including that massive loading that we had in the off-premise from March of last year. And so it doesn't take into account any shift into the on-premise. 
Over the last 4 weeks, our sales to retailers in the United States are up mid-single digits, Rob, so quite different to what you're seeing in the scanner data. We're shipping over 1 million barrels a week in the U.S.A., as I said in my prepared remarks, and the U.K. volume is up double digits despite only, as I said, 30% to 40% of on-premise being open and only for outdoor dining. 
Your second question around seltzers. Heading towards our goal of double digits or 10% by the end of the year, I mean you're right. I mean we had a spectacular launch of Topo Chico in the very limited markets in which it's in. It's only in 16 markets. So I think we've got a clear winner here, and we'll continue to feel the potential of this brand. And based on the reaction in those 16 markets, I think it's got strong national potential, and we'll look to roll that out to future markets when we're confident that we can meet the unexpectedly very high demand that we had in its rollout markets. 
You're right on Vizzy. I think we believe we have a real winner with Vizzy. I won't repeat the stats I just gave, I think it was to Bryan or Kevin, but I think particularly exciting for us is the fact that Vizzy Lemonade is the second fastest earning lemonade seltzer. And as I said, we had a record sales week for Vizzy last year. We're pleased with the performance. We had a singular SKU last year. We only launched in April, and we had inventory challenges while we're meeting all the demand for Vizzy, now that we've got the capacity up and running in our Fort Worth Brewery. So If that means that we're more confident to get to our 10% target. We certainly think we've got the brands in the seltzer space to do that and now we need to execute. 
I think the early data in the European market suggests that seltzer is going to be good. I'm not sure yet that I'm ready to tell you that it's going to be as good as it is in the United States. We don't need any data to support that. But certainly, Three Fold has landed well in the United Kingdom. And Wai is already in a couple of markets in Central and Eastern Europe, and we'll be rolling it out more fully towards in this month. So I hope that helps, Rob."

So our underlying COGS in the quarter increased 5.6%, and 470 basis points of that was inflation, was just under half of that related to the transportation. So as I think everyone knows, the freight market is really tight. We spoke about this in Q4, and we said we expect it to continue to be tight in Q1. It did start showing improvements in January and the beginning of February, but then that changed with all the winter storms and that caused major disruptions to the entire transportation network. So we expect to continue to see that tightening in the freight market. And then as it relates to us, sourcing cans from 4 continents, that also actually added to that inflation. 
In terms of levers to mitigate that, I did mention our cost savings program. So we delivered $270 million of the $600 million in 2020. We expect to deliver the balance of that in 2021 and 2022 roughly in equal portions. And we're doing -- so far, we're tracking well to achieve those savings. And the majority of those cost savings are focused on comps. So in addition to the cost savings program, as you mentioned, we have really robust hedging programs. We hedge all our commodities. We can -- I don't want to get into the detail of how we hedge, but our hedging programs are robust, and that will help to mitigate some of the inflationary pressure that we are seeing."

He's actually an owner of the business together with us. And frankly, every time he put something out on Instagram, he reaches 231 million followers in a nanosecond. 
The true test of how innovation lands is what are the distributors order. I mean we just had our order window for the very first order closed. I think it was either last night or the night before it. And the orders are strong, and that tells you how the distributors feel about it. The retailers are particularly excited about it as well. So we're just getting into the market with it now. So I don't want to get ahead of myself. But where it has been in the market with some of the stores and GNC and online, it's been -- the results are tremendous. So short story, very excited about ZOA from a retailer and a supplier and consumer point of view. 
 
La Colombe, we've already hit our distribution targets. We had distribution targets with our partner, La Colombe, that was set for the full year. And we're in April, and we've hit them. So that is an illustration of how our distributors have executed in C-stores and the drug chain. So short answer is very good, Sean. 
From -- point of view, tremendous amount of work has gone into getting that ready to launch in the fall of this year in Texas. They've made tremendous progress, the joint venture hiring, folk setting up the distributor relationships, awarding the brand to the various distributors in Texas and gaining commitments, talking to the chain. So I would say we're exactly where we thought with the England joint venture."

So as far as contribution to NSR is concerned,I mean, essentially, we had one brand in the market for 8 months of the year, last year with Vizzy. And I think we exited the last -- exited the year close to a full share of seltzers. We're closer to 7 share now than we were at a 4 share. We've got the plans. We've got the marketing muscle to put behind our seltzers for the balance of the year. I'm not going to be repetitive and bore you on all the excitement around busy and both Topo Chico.

Good morning, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Nearly 2 years ago, we laid out the Molson Coors revitalization plan, a multiyear strategy to deliver the sustainable top line growth that has eluded our business for many years,",1963,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Nearly 2 years ago, we laid out the Molson Coors revitalization plan, a multiyear strategy to deliver the sustainable top line growth that has eluded our business for many years, while at the same time, delivering sustainable bottom line growth. 
Under the plan, we have streamlined the company on reinvesting those savings to build on the strength of our iconic core, aggressively grow our above premium portfolio, expand beyond the beer, enhance our capabilities and support our people and communities. We had a few doubters then, and we had some unexpected challenges since from a global pandemic to severe Texas winter storms to a cyberattack in our company. 
But nearly 2 years later, we can say to those doubters with confidence that Molson Coors is on the path to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth. Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. I say that because for nearly 2 years, we've talked a lot about the outputs of our revitalization plan, new investments, new partnerships, new product launches and new campaigns. But today, we're able to start talking meaningfully outcomes from the revitalization plan, and that's an important shift. 
In the second quarter, despite ongoing pandemic restrictions, we delivered the most top line growth of any quarter in over a decade, and we nearly achieved 2019 net sales revenue levels on a constant currency basis despite those pandemic restrictions during this quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with this progress, but it's a strong indicator of what is yet to come through our revitalization plan. 
Our progress was primarily driven by 3 things: first, it was driven by the fact that we delivered the best brand mix in the United States since the inception of the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008. This significant premiumization of our portfolio was led by the strong growth of our U.S. hard seltzers, where we doubled our share of the U.S. hard seltzer segment in the second quarter. We took over as the global brewer with the fastest-growing U.S. seltzer portfolio. And we recently passed another major brewer and our fourth in total U.S. seltzer shares, we continue to move towards our goal of achieving a 10 share in the U.S. by year-end. Those are outcomes. 
We're also continuing to see strong traction with our Vizzy innovation. With this fast-turning new lemonade variety pack helped the Vizzy brand gain almost a full point of U.S. share in the second quarter. And we just added another new package to that family with Vizzy watermelon, which has been a hit with retailers thus far. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations in the 16 markets in which it's sold in the U.S. The demand has far outpaced our original plans for the brand, and with supply improving, we are now positioned to be more aggressive in marketing this brand. That is an outcome. 
Outside of the U.S., our Canadian hard seltzer portfolio continues to perform very well. The combination of Vizzy and Coors Hard Seltzer has earned more than a 50 share of the hard seltzer category with the largest beer retailer in the country. Vizzy specifically has earned the #1 spot in the on-premise in key regions like Ontario, and we're looking forward to fuel this momentum with Vizzy Lemonade, which launched in Canada just a few weeks ago. That's an outcome. 
In Europe, Three Fold in the U.K. and Wine Moment in Central and Eastern Europe continue to build distribution and consumer awareness with a strong mix of brand advertising. The category is still at an early stage, but we are well positioned to win share and develop our portfolio as popularity around hard seltzers continues to grow. And while our fast-growing hard seltzer to portfolio is driving our premiumization is not alone. [indiscernible] continues to exceed expectations in the U.K. on-premise with unprecedented consumer demand. And PAH from the startup of Plamen stable of brands is performing ahead of expectations in the Central and Eastern European markets beating initial estimates by more than 50%. 
Our Latin America business, where our global brands primarily operate in the above premium price segment has exceeded expectations given the coronavirus pandemic throughout the region. Collectively, for the first half of 2021, the region is exceeding brand volume levels for the comparable 2019 period despite continued issued pandemic restrictions. 
For example, our Puerto Rican operations [Audio Gap] on premise. In the U.S., Blue Moon Lifeco was the #1 new beer item in 2020 and has grown double digits this year, building off its strong base. While Leinenkugel Summer Shandy brand volume is up 10% year-to-date. Those are outcomes. 
And in just a few weeks, the Yuengling joint venture will launch in the state of Texas, where distributor, retailer and customer interest has been incredibly high. Product shipments begin next week and are scheduled to hit retail by August 23. 
The other factor that drove the best brand in more than a decade is a rationalization of the long, long tail of our economy portfolio in the U.S. As we have discussed, in recent months in the U.S., we paused production of a number of smaller, low-margin slow-moving economy brands and SKUs. This allowed us to improve our brewing efficiency and stabilize inventories of our core brands, and it also premiumized our portfolio and improved our margins, and we intend to maintain that higher level of premiumization and service. 
So after an extensive analysis of our business, we are meaningfully streamlining and premiumizing our U.S. portfolio, discontinuing around 100 SKUs, including the elimination of 11 economy brands altogether. This will improve supply chain flexibility for our more profitable priority brands, enhance our innovation efforts, enable us to better focus resources and ensure dependable and on-time shipments to our distributors. 
Let's be clear, while economy brands have typically not been a focus of the investment community, distributors who sell brands like Magnum and [indiscernible] are going to feel it when they're discontinued. So our local sales teams are partnering with distributors and retailers on a market-by-market basis on exit plans and to identify swaps that make sense. 
So the headline is simple, premiumization is here to stay at Molson Coors. We're going to invest bigger behind our fast-growing global hard seltzer portfolio, and we're going to permanently streamline our smaller portfolio of legacy brands. We're excited about the progress we're making, and we're not about to stop now. 
Our top line growth was also driven by the strength of our core brands and the pace of the return to the on-premise. Coors Light and Miller Lite again grew share of the U.S. Premium Light segment. With on-premise accounts reopening in a big way across the U.S., the brands were at 97% of their total 2019 STR volume in the second quarter. Coors Light specifically achieved its best half year share trend in 4 years and its U.S. STRs rose by 1.7% in the second quarter. At the same time, Miller Lite grew 3.2% in the U.S. in the quarter. 
In Canada, Coors Light has grown share with our largest retail customer for 4 straight quarters. Our top line growth was also aided by the investments we have made in our Beyond Beer initiatives. Standing here at the end of July, ZOA has already far surpassed our expectations for the entire year and its co-owner, Dwayne Johnson, continues to amplify the product across his massive social media presence as well as through a new TV campaign that debuted during the Olympics this month. 
The RTD coffee market is estimated at $4.3 billion in 2021, and La Colombe ranked #1 in the above premium category. We're excited about the progress we are making and continue to have success with distribution to large national and regional retailers in both the drug and convenience store channels. 
Trust Canada, our joint venture with HEXO has grown to more than a 50% share of the Canadian cannabis beverage industry and now hold 7 of the top 10 SKUs in the country. And in the U.S. after starting in the Denver Metro area, Trust U.S. has expanded distribution to other distributors and independent retailers across the state, a strong vote of confidence in the joint venture's plan and in its brands. 
As I said earlier, the results from the second quarter demonstrate that the revitalization plan is starting to pay off. So we're going to continue investing in our business, in our people and in our communities to continue driving the results we're starting to see. You saw that in the last quarter as we announced 2 new projects to increase our global hard seltzer production capacity. In Canada, we announced plans to quadruple our in-house hard seltzer production capacity. And in the U.K., we announced plans to add a new hard seltzer canning line in our Burton upon Trent brewery, while also upgrading our beer and cider packaging facilities to drive efficiencies. Those 2 investments follow a similar effort last year to increase our hard seltzer production capacity fivefold in the U.S. These investments will have long-lasting benefits as we bring more production in-house, and ultimately improve our profit margin. But the investments in our business are not stopping there. 
Finally, after more than a year of pandemic-related challenges, we're going to be able to more fully invest behind our brands. Now what does that mean? While sticking in the U.K. for a moment, Safal Hard seltzer is backed by the biggest brand investment Molson Coors has ever made into a new U.K. category. And you can expect to see a boost in our marketing spending over the second half of the year as well. That's why those markets are opening back up. Our local alliances are reactivating for the first time in over a year, and our inventory will have recovered to a point that it makes sense to more fully invest behind brand marketing. 
As important as that is, our success or failure as a company isn't entirely defined by our top line growth. It's also determined in part by how well we support our approximately 17,000 employees and support our hometown communities all around the world. That's why we directly engaged our North American employees in what we call Project Justice, an effort we started last summer and have continued in 2021. Through this initiative, we are supporting 33 organizations across the U.S. and Canada that are working to create a more just and inclusive world. That's also why we're expanding our scholarship program for U.S. college students at Pollo, who are pursuing careers in fermentation and brewing sciences as we work to bring more diverse voices to our industry. And that's why we're looking within our organization to improve the representation of women and people of color across the biggest part of our business. 
We also just released our annual ESG report called our imprint with a refreshed strategy that focuses on 2 key pillars: people and planet, and stay tuned as we continue our ESG journey. 
We've had our share of challenges over the last several years, but that is changing. And today, the sons all say the same thing, Molson Coors' future is bright and the revitalization plan is succeeding. We're deleveraging our business. We've reinstated a dividend. We're thinking more consciously about how we best support our people and the communities in which we operate. We're investing behind our brands. We're reshaping our portfolio, and we're expanding into new spaces. Nearly 2 years into our revitalization plan, our results are improving. We're going to put our foot even more firmly on the gas pedal as we drive towards our sustainable top and bottom line growth initiative for this business.

We posted a strong second quarter, which exceeded expectations. We continue to make real progress executing our revitalization plan, and we are starting to see the results in our operating performance. As Gavin noted",1615,"Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. We posted a strong second quarter, which exceeded expectations. We continue to make real progress executing our revitalization plan, and we are starting to see the results in our operating performance. As Gavin noted, we continue to premiumize our brands and strengthen our core business and our improved financial flexibility has enabled us to invest in our business while continuing to delever our balance sheet and to reinstate the dividend. 
Now let me take you through our quarterly results in more detail and provide an update on our outlook. Consolidated net sales revenue increased 13.7% in constant currency, delivering 98% of second quarter 2019 levels despite continuing to operate with varying degrees of on-premise restrictions. Consolidated financial volumes improved 5.5%, outpacing brand volume growth of 3.1%, driven by higher Europe volumes and favorable U.S. domestic shipments. 
Top line performance benefited from on-premise reopenings in the quarter for most of our major markets as well as strong global net pricing, positive channel mix and historic favorable brand mix levels in the U.S. as we continue to premiumize our portfolio. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 5% in constant currency, driven by pricing growth, coupled with positive brand and channel mix, partially offset by geographic mix, given the strong growth in Europe and Latin America. This top line growth was somewhat offset by inflationary pressures, which impacted most consumer product companies, as well as increased marketing investments as we continue to execute our revitalization plan. 
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation including higher freight and packaging costs. However, with robust hedging and cost savings programs, we have been able to significantly mitigate much of the inflationary pressure. 
MG&A in the quarter increased 25.3% on a constant currency basis as we cycle timing shifts and targeted reductions to marketing spend in the prior year period due to the coronavirus pandemic. As planned, we significantly increased marketing investments in the quarter, putting strong commercial pressure behind our key innovations and core brands. 
Underlying EBITDA decreased 1.3% on a constant currency basis but increased compared to 2019 second quarter level. Underlying free cash flow was $558.2 million dollars for the first half of the year, a decrease of $238.2 million from the prior year period. This decrease was wholly driven by lapping roughly $500 million in benefit in the prior year related to tax deferrals due to governmental programs and was partially offset by favorable working capital and lower capital spend. 
Capital expenditures paid were $212 million for the first half of the year as we continue to invest behind capability programs such as our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project in our new Montreal brewery. Capital expenditures were lower in the first half of the year compared to the prior year, primarily due to project timing. 
Now let's look at our results by business units. In North America, the on-premise channel accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales revenue in the quarter compared to approximately 16% in the same period in 2019. In North America, on-premise reopenings vary by market. In the U.S., our largest market, we continue to see progressive reopenings during the quarter and attained over 80% of 2019 levels as of quarter end. 
In Latin America, restrictions continue to ease, while in Canada, significant restrictions continue throughout the quarter with on-premise volume about 1/4 of prepandemic levels. 
North America net sales revenue was up 8.3% in constant currency, driven by strong net pricing growth, positive brand mix in the U.S., favorable U.S. shipment timing and higher Latin America volumes. Of note, U.S. net sales revenue exceeded the second quarter 2019 levels. 
In the U.S., the domestic shipment volumes increased 1.2%, outpacing brand volume declines of 4% as we focus on rebuilding inventory following the first quarter supply disruption. The brand volume declines were entirely due to economy, which was down double digits as we deprioritized certain noncore SKUs. 
Our above premium portfolio was up double digits and our premium brands were up low single digits. In fact, our U.S. above premium brand volumes reached a record high portion of our portfolio compared to any prior quarter since the creation of the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008. 
Canada brand volumes declined 5.1%, while net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.7% in constant currency with pricing growth delivered across all geographies. The U.S. increased 6.9%, driven by net pricing and historic levels of positive brand mix. While the intention decline in economy was a contributor, about half of this record mix performance was due to growth in above premium, led by innovation brands, including Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA. These positive factors were partially offset by negative geographic mix resulting from the restricted trading environment in the higher-revenue Canadian business and strong growth in Latin America. 
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 8.5%, driven by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging materials costs and mix impacts from premiumization. Underlying MG&A increased 24.2% due to higher marketing investments. We increased marketing investment behind core innovation brands and we increased media spending behind our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite. 
Our U.S. media spend approached 2019 levels while local tactical spend was somewhat constrained due to on-premise restrictions, which eased throughout the quarter. North America underlying EBITDA decreased 10.7% in constant currency as higher gross profit was more than offset by higher planned MG&A. 
Europe net sales revenue was up 52.3% in constant currency driven by volume increases and positive channel, geographic and brand mix due to on-premise progressive reopening, most meaningfully in the U.K. given the reduced on-premise restrictions compared to nearly full lockdowns in the prior year quarter. 
Above premium brand volumes reached a record high portion of our Europe portfolio. Europe financial volumes increased 17.8% and brand volumes increased 15.4%, driven by a significant increase in U.K. on-premise volumes. 
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 16.6%, driven by favorable channels, geographic and brand mix, particularly from our higher-margin, on-premise-focused U.K. business as well as positive pricing. Underlying EBITDA increased 189% in constant currency, driven by gross margin impact of higher volumes and favorable channel, geographic and brand mix as a result of gradual on-premise reopening, partially offset by higher MG&A expense. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2021, we had lowered our net debt-to-underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.35x and reduced our net debt to $6.9 billion down from 3.5x and $7.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. We ended the second quarter with strong borrowing capacity with no outstanding balance on our USD 1.5 billion credit facility. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We are again reaffirming our 2021 annual guidance originally provided on February 11, 2021. While we are certainly in a better place than we were a year ago, it bears reminding that uncertainty as it pertains to the coronavirus and its variants remains to varying degrees by market. 
Now I'll provide some underlying expectations to provide some additional context for the balance of the year. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth for the full year on a constant currency basis. Building off the strong shipment growth in the U.S. in the second quarter, we continue to work aggressively to build inventories to more optimal levels. 
In the U.S., we expect on-premise trends to continue to improve as we lap restrictions in the prior year period. 
In Canada, we are seeing gradual on-premise reopenings varying by province, which should provide positive channel mix. 
In Europe, the U.K. should benefit from this full on-premise reopening July 19. However, the comparison is more difficult than it was for the second quarter given the on-premise was largely opened for the full third quarter of 2020. 
Our guidance also anticipates continued strength in our above premium portfolio, particularly hard seltzers. Also, we expect continued solid progress against our previously discussed emerging growth 3-year revenue goal of $1 billion against which we are tracking ahead of plan. We continue to anticipate underlying EBITDA to be roughly flat compared to 2020 as top line growth is expected to be offset by continued cost inflationary headwinds but more significantly from increased investments to deliver against our revitalization plan. 
We intend to increase marketing investments to build on the strength of our core brands and support successful innovation. As a result, we expect significant year-on-year increases in marketing investments over the balance of the year and most notably in the third quarter. 
We expect third quarter marketing investments to be higher than the second quarter of 2021 and also higher than the third quarter of 2019 as we continue to ramp up supply following the disruptions in the first quarter. Obviously, this will have an impact on our bottom line, particularly in the third quarter, but this will strengthen the future of our brands. 
Also, as a reminder, in 2020, our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $130 million in tax payments from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic. We currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due. 
Moving to capital allocation. We continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. First, we plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and execution against our revitalization plan. 
We are excited about the future of Molson Coors as we drive towards our goal of long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth. 
And with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

And then also, I love to understand why you're not using the Vizzy trademark more in Europe and the U.K., and that you feel that you need to have different sorts of trademarks there.

So Robert, there's really no surprise to us that this rate of growth slowed because the category was cycling last year's huge comps. And we've said in the past that seltzers were a beneficiary of the on-premise shutdown because it had such distribution exposure in the off-premise. And so as the on-premise is reopened, there's less distribution there. And so this is not a surprise to us. I think we've been saying this for almost a year. We've also been saying for a while, even if it's growing at 10%, 20%, 40%, there really isn't anything else in the beer space that's growing back quickly. So it's good for the beer category, and it's good for us. 
In North America, in the U.S., we've got 2 very clear and differentiated winners from our point of view, and we plan to continue our focus on Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Now you referred to Coors Seltzer, Rob. And I would say to you that Coors Seltzer up in Canada is actually doing really, really well. It's already achieved double-digit share in some retailers. And it's between Vizzy and Coors Seltzer is probably the most successful product launches that we've had for our company in 5 years up in Canada. 
We do believe that there will be a shakeout in the near future as many brands struggle to succeed in the crowded space. And while Vizzy and Topo Chica Hard Seltzer have continued to accelerate, because hard seltzer wasn't. And so that's why we made the decision in the U.S. to discontinue Coors Seltzer and commit our NGI resources, the material supply we've got in our shelf space to Vizzy and Topo Chico. 
Of course, it's going to stay in Canada because it's doing, as I said, really well. The market dynamics are different, and the brand has performed well. In Europe, it's exhibiting, in the U.K. and Central Eastern Europe, some of the same trends in the early days as the U.S. did. And we've obviously tested all of our options from a brand point of view. And the early read was that Three Fold was the right brand to go with, and it's landed very well. We're building capacity there. And I think we're well positioned in the U.K. to be a strong player if it takes off like it did in the U.S. 
And the same applies to Central and Eastern Europe. Why Moment was the best brand resonated really well with the consumers there. the Central Eastern European team do a fantastic job from an execution point of view. So the execution is really good. And we actually have first-mover advantage in Central and Eastern Europe. So we feel very good about our leading position in Central and Eastern Europe with that brand as well. I think I hit all your questions, Rob, but if I didn't, I'm happy to take a follow-up from you."

Look, yes, during the pandemic, we did see increased demand for large trusted brands. And this is particularly true in the on-premise. Many on-premise owners are sticking to faster moving brands and this obviously benefits brands like Miller Lite and Coors Light, in particular, for us. And we are seeing that trend stick as we settle into the sort of new normal. 
And as I said earlier, with Miller Lite and Coors Light, we did grow segment share for the 27th quarter. We're also seeing growth in our above premium portfolio. For example, Blue Moon in the U.S. is up nearly 15% in the quarter. Peroni's up nearly 35%. And it has provided us an outstanding opportunity to sample our newer offerings, like Premium Life Sky and Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which we actually missed that opportunity last year. 
So certainly, I wouldn't say it's just Vizzy that's going on-premise, I would say it's both Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Topo Chico is as good as well as it's doing. It's still in fairly limited number of markets, less than half of the states in the U.S. And in those states, it's the desire for it to be on-premise has been very, very good. 
Canada, obviously, a little too early to say because the restrictions there have dragged on a little longer than they did in the United States. So too soon to tell how the Canadian on-premise is going to open up. 
In Europe, it's been very pleasing. We, as you know, significantly over-indexed to the on-premise. So the on-premise recovery that's taking place in Europe has been has been very positive for us. And in fact, in July, we've seen the on-premise business in U.K. start to approach 2019 levels and hold there. So that has been very encouraging for us."

And we've actually seen the on-premise approach to 2019 levels for the last -- well, most of July, actually, -- it actually spiked a bit higher than that, but that was distorted by the euro finals. We were actually in the U.K. were actually for a few weeks, quite substantially above 2019 levels, that settled back down now. And as I said, we're approaching 2019 levels. 
Central and Eastern Europe is a little being a little bit more impacted by tourism. And so we're probably not quite at the U.K. levels in Central and Eastern Europe. And in the U.S., we've seen, as I think I said on the last call, more outlets opened from an on-premise point of view than we were initially expecting. And certainly, volume has increased and settled down into a fairly stable level. We will have in the back half of the year, a lot more fairs, festivals, alliance opportunities, which we didn't have in the second half of last year. And I'm referring to football primarily, which is a big drinking occasion for us. So without wishing to put particular goals out there, we are encouraged by what we're seeing from an on-premise and venue volume point of view. 
I wasn't totally sure I got your price tiers question, Steve. So let me give it a shot. I mean we did, as I said, have the strongest share of our portfolio being above premium in the second quarter. Based on an NSR point of view, it was up into the -- up into the high teens level, which we haven't seen levels like that since the joint venture started. So working particularly  well.

And in the U.K., we were expecting so-called Freedom Day to be back in June. And as you know, that was delayed into July. I would say those are the 2 things that we didn't know at that time. 
From a revitalization plan point of view, yes, I mean, we or the whole rationale for the revitalization plan is to drive both top line and bottom line growth. And the first year was always going to be a reinvestment year, which was supposed to be last year, but we've been through all the reasons why that  didn't make sense. And we're certainly reinvesting behind our brands this year. We increased our marketing spend meaningfully in the second quarter. There were couple of things that didn't make sense for us to do like investing in meaningful marketing in Canada while it was closed and delaying the U.K. out a month. So that was probably marketing spend that we would have spent in Q2, which we'll now move into the back half of the year. And as Tracey said, primarily in Q3. Our supply situation has improved meaningfully since the cybersecurity attack and our fast-moving brands and SKUs with the exception of 1 or 2 SKUs or subsegments are at inventory levels that are higher than they were at the same time last year, which allows us now to really put emphasis behind our brands. 
As I said, Topo Chico is supply. We've worked really well with our partners to increase our supply in the third quarter and beyond. And so that will be coming through, which will allow our marketing teams really put emphasis behind that. So I think I've answered your question, Kevin, but help me if I haven't."

As far as our 10% share goal is concerned, we -- as I said, I think we've got to clear and differentiated winners with Vizzy and Topo Chico. With Vizzy, we're seeing strong traction with the innovation that we've brought, particularly the variety pack 2 and Vizzy Lemonade. We're seeing with retailers where we've got all 3 busy SKUs on shelf that we see obvious 2/3 increase in each of those SKUs velocities, and so we're going to continue to fuel Vizzy's momentum. We've got more innovation coming. We have had innovation LTOs like our June Pride Pack. And we've just recently launched Watermelon variety pack. So it's caveating a unique point of difference in the category. And so, so much so that we're well on our way to becoming the #4 spot in the segment despite all the new entrants in 2021. 
I'm not going to show our hand in terms of which brands are going to take Coors Hard self space, but you can assume that we do have innovation coming on Vizzy and we'll utilize Coors Hard Seltzer space to put that innovation from Vizzy into that space. And so we feel good about Vizzy. Vizzy will certainly be a big part of getting to our 10 share goal as well Topo Chico, as I said, 2018, I'm not going to repeat all of that. But it does remain incredibly strong. Supply is improving. We have worked with our third-party suppliers to ramp up supply. And we'll go national when we believe we can supply the markets that we're in at this point in time. I mean how high is high is not quite clear yet on Topo Chico because we haven't been able to supply all of the demand, it takes us forever a 10 share, I see other states we're doing equally as well. 
So in terms of when are we going to bring it in-house, we've always said we're going to bring it in-house in 2022. That plan is on track. When we do, it will improve our margins. And it's a slightly different process than perhaps Vizzy, so all Coors seltzer, so it's not a direct substitution from a liquid point of view, but certainly from a canned availability point of view, we've got that capacity and it's ready.

Good morning, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Nearly 2 years ago, we laid out the Molson Coors revitalization plan, a multiyear strategy to deliver the sustainable top line growth that has eluded our business for many years,",2027,"Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Nearly 2 years ago, we laid out the Molson Coors revitalization plan, a multiyear strategy to deliver the sustainable top line growth that has eluded our business for many years, while at the same time, delivering sustainable bottom line growth.  
Under the plan, we have streamlined the company on reinvesting those savings to build on the strength of our iconic core, aggressively grow our above premium portfolio, expand beyond the beer aisle, enhance our capabilities and support our people and communities. We had a few doubters then and we had some unexpected challenges since, from a global pandemic to severe Texas winter storms to a cyberattack in our company.  
But nearly 2 years later, we can say to those doubters with confidence that Molson Coors is on the path to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth. Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. I say that because for nearly 2 years, we've talked a lot about the outputs of our revitalization plan, new investments, new partnerships, new product launches and new campaigns. But today, we're able to start talking meaningfully the outcomes from the revitalization plan, and that's an important shift.  
In the second quarter, despite ongoing pandemic restrictions, we delivered the most top line growth of any quarter in over a decade, and we nearly achieved 2019 net sales revenue levels on a constant currency basis despite those pandemic restrictions during this quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with this progress, but it's a strong indicator of what is yet to come through our revitalization plan.  
Our progress was primarily driven by 3 things. First, it was driven by the fact that we delivered the best brand mix in the United States since the inception of the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008. This significant premiumization of our portfolio was led by the strong growth of our U.S. hard seltzers, where we doubled our share of the U.S. hard seltzer segment in the second quarter. We took over as the global brewer with the fastest-growing U.S. seltzer portfolio. And we recently passed another major brewer and are fourth in total U.S. seltzer shares, we continue to move towards our goal of achieving a 10 share in the U.S. by year-end. Those are outcomes.  
We're also continuing to see strong traction with our Vizzy innovation. Vizzy's fast-turning new lemonade variety pack helped the Vizzy brand gain almost a full point of U.S. share in the second quarter. And we just added another new package to that family with Vizzy Watermelon, which has been a hit with retailers thus far. Topo Chico Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations in the 16 markets in which it's sold in the U.S. The demand has far outpaced our original plans for the brand, and with supply improving, we are now positioned to be more aggressive in marketing this brand. That is an outcome.  
Outside of the U.S., our Canadian hard seltzer portfolio continues to perform very well. The combination of Vizzy and Coors Hard Seltzer has earned more than a 50 share of the hard seltzer category with the largest beer retailer in the country. Vizzy specifically has earned the #1 spot in the on-premise in key regions like Ontario, and we're looking forward to fuel this momentum with Vizzy Lemonade, which launched in Canada just a few weeks ago. That's an outcome.  
In Europe, Three Fold in the U.K. and WAI Moment in Central and Eastern Europe continue to build distribution and consumer awareness with a strong mix of brand advertising. The category is still at an early stage, but we are well positioned to win share and develop our portfolio as popularity around hard seltzers continues to grow. And while our fast-growing hard seltzer portfolio is driving our premiumization, it's not alone.  Madri continues to exceed expectations in the U.K. on-premise with unprecedented consumer demand. And Pravha from the Staropramen stable of brands is performing ahead of expectations in the Central and Eastern European markets beating initial estimates by more than 50%.  
Our Latin America business, where our global brands primarily operate in the above premium price segment, has exceeded expectations given the coronavirus pandemic throughout the region. Collectively, for the first half of 2021, the region is exceeding brand volume levels for the comparable 2019 period despite continued government-issued pandemic restrictions.  
For example, our Puerto Rican operations, which had been in long-term decline, are currently growing. Those are outcomes. In Canada, our Six Pints craft division is growing absolute volume despite its reliance on the on-premise. In the U.S., Blue Moon LightSky was the #1 new beer item in 2020 and has grown double digits this year, building off its strong base, while Leinenkugel Summer Shandy brand volume is up 10% year-to-date. Those are outcomes.  
And in just a few weeks, the Yuengling joint venture will launch in the state of Texas, where distributor, retailer and customer interest has been incredibly high. Product shipments begin next week and are scheduled to hit retail by August 23.  
The other factor that drove the best brand in more than a decade is a rationalization of the long, long tail of our economy portfolio in the U.S. As we have discussed, in recent months in the U.S., we paused production of a number of smaller low-margin, slow-moving economy brands and SKUs. This allowed us to improve our brewing efficiency and stabilize inventories of our core brands, and it also premiumized our portfolio and improved our margins, and we intend to maintain that higher level of premiumization and service.  
So after an extensive analysis of our business, we are meaningfully streamlining and premiumizing our U.S. portfolio, discontinuing around 100 SKUs, including the elimination of 11 economy brands altogether. This will improve supply chain flexibility for our more profitable priority brands, enhance our innovation efforts, enable us to better focus resources and ensure dependable and on-time shipments to our distributors.  
Let's be clear, while economy brands have typically not been a focus of the investment community, distributors who sell brands like Magnum and Mickey's Ice are going to feel it when they're discontinued. So our local sales teams are partnering with distributors and retailers on a market-by-market basis on exit plans and to identify swaps that make sense. So the headline is simple, premiumization is here to stay at Molson Coors. We're going to invest bigger behind our fast-growing global hard seltzer portfolio, and we're going to permanently streamline our smaller portfolio of legacy brands. We're excited about the progress we're making, and we're not about to stop now.  
Our top line growth was also driven by the strength of our core brands and the pace of the return to the on-premise. Coors Light and Miller Lite again grew share of the U.S. premium light segment. With on-premise accounts reopening in a big way across the U.S., the brands were at 97% of their total 2019 STR volume in the second quarter. Coors Light specifically achieved its best half year share trend in 4 years, and its U.S. STRs rose by 1.7% in the second quarter. At the same time, Miller Lite grew 3.2% in the U.S. in the quarter.  
In Canada, Coors Light has grown share with our largest retail customer for 4 straight quarters. Our top line growth was also aided by the investments we have made in our beyond beer initiatives. Standing here at the end of July, ZOA has already far surpassed our expectations for the entire year and its co-owner, Dwayne Johnson, continues to amplify the product across his massive social media presence as well as through a new TV campaign that debuted during the Olympics this month.  
The RTD coffee market is estimated at $4.3 billion in 2021, and La Colombe has ranked #1 in the above premium category. We're excited about the progress we are making and continue to have success with distribution to large national and regional retailers in both the drug and convenience store channels.  
Truss Canada, our joint venture with HEXO, has grown to more than a 50 share of the Canadian cannabis beverage industry and now hold 7 of the top 10 SKUs in the country. And in the U.S., after starting in the Denver Metro area, Truss U.S. has expanded distribution to other distributors and independent retailers across the state, a strong vote of confidence in the joint venture's plan and in its brands.  
As I said earlier, the results from the second quarter demonstrate that the revitalization plan is starting to pay off. So we're going to continue investing in our business, in our people and in our communities to continue driving the results we're starting to see. You saw that in the last quarter as we announced 2 new projects to increase our global hard seltzer production capacity. In Canada, we announced plans to quadruple our in-house hard seltzer production capacity. And in the U.K., we announced plans to add a new hard seltzer canning line in our Burton-upon-Trent brewery, while also upgrading our beer and cider packaging facilities to drive efficiencies. Those 2 investments follow a similar effort last year to increase our hard seltzer production capacity fivefold in the U.S. These investments will have long-lasting benefits as we bring more production in-house and ultimately improve our profit margin. But the investments in our business are not stopping there.  
Finally, after more than a year of pandemic-related challenges, we're going to be able to more fully invest behind our brands. Now what does that mean? While sticking in the U.K. for a moment, Three Fold hard seltzer is backed by the biggest brand investment Molson Coors has ever made into a new U.K. category. And you can expect to see a boost in our marketing spending over the second half of the year as well. That's because markets are opening back up. Our local alliances are reactivating for the first time in over a year, and our inventory will have recovered to a point that it makes sense to more fully invest behind the brand marketing.  
As important as that is, our success or failure as a company isn't entirely defined by our top line growth. It's also determined in part by how well we support our approximately 17,000 employees and support our hometown communities all around the world. That's why we directly engaged our North American employees in what we call Project Justice, an effort we started last summer and have continued in 2021. Through this initiative, we are supporting 33 organizations across the U.S. and Canada that are working to create a more just and inclusive world. That's also why we're expanding our scholarship program for U.S. college students of color, who are pursuing careers in fermentation and brewing sciences as we work to bring more diverse voices to our industry. And that's why we're looking within our organization to improve the representation of women and people of color across the biggest part of our business.  
We also just released our annual ESG report called Our Imprint, with a refreshed strategy that focuses on 2 key pillars: people and planet. From eliminating plastic rings in the U.K., to saving over 100 million gallons of water annually through our Golden Brewery modernization project to the significant work we are doing to support our people, we've made great progress against our goals. And stay tuned as we continue our ESG journey.  
We've had our share of challenges over the last several years, but that is changing. And today, the sign is also the same thing, Molson Coors' future is bright and the revitalization plan is succeeding. We're deleveraging our business. We've reinstated a dividend. We're thinking more consciously about how we best support our people and the communities in which we operate. We're investing behind our brands. We're reshaping our portfolio, and we're expanding into new spaces. Nearly 2 years into our revitalization plan, our results are improving. We're going to put our foot even more firmly on the gas pedal as we drive towards our sustainable top and bottom line growth initiative for this business.  Tracey?"

We posted a strong second quarter, which exceeded expectations. We continue to make real progress executing our revitalization plan, and we are starting to see the results in our operating performance.  As Gavin no",1814,"Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. We posted a strong second quarter, which exceeded expectations. We continue to make real progress executing our revitalization plan, and we are starting to see the results in our operating performance.  
As Gavin noted, we continue to premiumize our brands and strengthen our core business, and our improved financial flexibility has enabled us to invest in our business while continuing to delever our balance sheet and to reinstate a dividend.  
Now let me take you through our quarterly results in more detail and provide an update on our outlook. Consolidated net sales revenue increased 13.7% in constant currency, delivering 98% of second quarter 2019 levels despite continuing to operate with varying degrees of on-premise restrictions. Consolidated financial volumes improved 5.5%, outpacing brand volume growth of 3.1%, driven by higher Europe volumes and favorable U.S. domestic shipments.  
Top line performance benefited from on-premise reopenings in the quarter for most of our major markets as well as strong global net pricing, positive channel mix and historic favorable brand mix levels in the U.S. as we continue to premiumize our portfolio. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 5% in constant currency, driven by pricing growth, coupled with positive brand and channel mix, partially offset by geographic mix given the strong growth in Europe and Latin America. This top line growth was somewhat offset by inflationary pressures, which impacted most consumer product companies as well as increased marketing investments as we continue to execute our revitalization plan.  
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation including higher freight and packaging costs. However, with robust hedging and cost savings programs, we have been able to significantly mitigate much of the inflationary pressure.  
MG&A in the quarter increased 25.3% on a constant currency basis as we cycle timing shifts and targeted reductions to marketing spend in the prior year period due to the coronavirus pandemic. As planned, we significantly increased marketing investments in the quarter, putting strong commercial pressure behind our key innovations and core brands.  
Underlying EBITDA decreased 1.3% on a constant currency basis but increased compared to 2019 second quarter level. Underlying free cash flow was $558.2 million for the first half of the year, a decrease of $238.2 million from the prior year period. This decrease was wholly driven by lapping roughly $500 million in benefit in the prior year related to tax deferrals due to governmental programs and was partially offset by favorable working capital and lower capital spend.  
Capital expenditures paid were $212 million for the first half of the year as we continue to invest behind capability programs such as our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project in our new Montreal brewery. Capital expenditures were lower in the first half of the year compared to the prior year, primarily due to project timing.  
Now let's look at our results by business unit. In North America, the on-premise channel accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales revenue in the quarter compared to approximately 16% in the same period in 2019. In North America, on-premise reopenings vary by market. In the U.S., our largest market, we continue to see progressive reopenings during the quarter and attained over 80% of 2019 levels as of quarter end.  
In Latin America, restrictions continue to ease, while in Canada, significant restrictions continue throughout the quarter with on-premise volume about 1/4 of pre-pandemic levels.  
North America net sales revenue was up 8.3% in constant currency, driven by strong net pricing growth, positive brand mix in the U.S., favorable U.S. shipment timing and higher Latin America volumes. Of note, U.S. net sales revenue exceeded the second quarter 2019 levels.  
In the U.S., domestic shipment volumes increased 1.2%, outpacing brand volume declines of 4% as we focus on rebuilding inventory following the first quarter supply disruption. The brand volume declines were entirely due to economy, which was down double digits as we deprioritized certain noncore SKUs.  
Our best premium portfolio was up double digits and our premium brands were up low single digits. In fact, our U.S. above premium brand volumes reached a record-high portion of our portfolio compared to any prior quarter since the creation of the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008.  
Canada brand volumes declined 5.1%, while Latin America brand volumes experienced triple digit growth, driven by strong core brand performance.  Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.7% in constant currency, with pricing growth delivered across all geographies. The U.S. increased 6.9%, driven by net pricing and historic levels of positive brand mix. While the intention decline in economy was a contributor, about half of this record mix performance was due to growth in above premium, led by innovation brands, including Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and ZOA. These positive factors were partially offset by negative geographic mix resulting from the restricted trading environment in the higher-revenue Canadian business and strong growth in Latin America.  
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 8.5%, driven by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging materials costs and mix impacts from premiumization. Underlying MG&A increased 24.2% due to higher marketing investments. We increased marketing investment behind core innovation brands and we increased media spending behind our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite.  
Our U.S. media spend approached 2019 levels while local tactical spend was somewhat constrained due to on-premise restrictions, which eased throughout the quarter. North America underlying EBITDA decreased 10.7% in constant currency as higher gross profit was more than offset by higher planned MG&A.  
Europe net sales revenue was up 52.3% in constant currency driven by volume increases and positive channel, geographic and brand mix due to on-premise progressive reopening, most meaningfully in the U.K., given the reduced on-premise restrictions compared to nearly full lockdowns in the prior year quarter.  
Above premium brand volumes reached a record-high portion of our Europe portfolio. Europe financial volumes increased 17.8% and brand volumes increased 15.4%, driven by a significant increase in U.K. on-premise volumes.  
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 16.6%, driven by favorable channel, geographic and brand mix, particularly from our higher-margin, on-premise-focused U.K. business as well as positive pricing. Underlying EBITDA increased 189% in constant currency, driven by gross margin impact of higher volumes and favorable channel, geographic and brand mix as a result of gradual on-premise reopening, partially offset by higher MG&A expense.  
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2021, we had lowered our net debt-to-underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.35x and reduced our net debt to $6.9 billion, down from 3.5x and $7.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. We ended the second quarter with strong borrowing capacity with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion U.S. credit facility.  
Turning to our financial outlook. We are again reaffirming our 2021 annual guidance originally provided on February 11, 2021. While we are certainly in a better place than we were a year ago, it pays reminding that uncertainty as it pertains to the coronavirus and its variants remains to varying degrees by market.  
Now I'll provide some underlying expectations to provide some additional context for the balance of the year. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth for the full year on a constant currency basis. Building off the strong shipment growth in the U.S. in the second quarter, we continue to work aggressively to build inventories to more optimal levels.  
In the U.S., we expect on-premise trends to continue to improve as we lap restrictions in the prior year period.  In Canada, we are seeing gradual on-premise reopenings varying by province, which should provide positive channel mix.  In Europe, the U.K. should benefit from this full on-premise reopening July 19. However, the comparison is more difficult than it was for the second quarter given the on-premise was largely opened for the full third quarter of 2020.  
Our guidance also anticipates continued strength in our above premium portfolio, particularly hard seltzers. Also, we expect continued solid progress against our previously discussed emerging growth 3-year revenue goal of $1 billion against which we are tracking ahead of plan. We continue to anticipate underlying EBITDA to be roughly flat compared to 2020 as top line growth is expected to be offset by continued cost inflationary headwinds, but more significantly from increased investments to deliver against our revitalization plan.  
We intend to increase marketing investments to build on the strength of our core brands and support successful innovation. As a result, we expect significant year-on-year increases in marketing investments over the balance of the year and most notably in the third quarter.  
We expect third quarter marketing investments to be higher than the second quarter of 2021 and also higher than the third quarter of 2019 as we continue to ramp up supply following the disruptions in the first quarter. Obviously, this will have an impact on our bottom line, particularly in the third quarter, but this will strengthen the future of our brands.  
Also, as a reminder, in 2020, our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $130 million in tax payments from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic. We currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due.  
Moving to capital allocation. We continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. First, we plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives, improve efficiencies and advance towards our sustainability goal. Second, we have a strong desire to maintain and, in time, upgrade our investment-grade rating. As such, we expect to continue to pay down debt and reaffirm our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.25x by the end of 2021 and below 3x by the end of 2022. 
Demonstrating our commitment to this goal, on July 15, we announced that we had repaid in full the $1 billion 2.1% senior notes that were maturing that day using a combination of commercial paper and cash on hand. And third and also as announced on July 15, our Board of Directors determined to reinstate a quarterly dividend on our Class A and Class B common shares and declared a dividend -- a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. The Board made the decision to reinstate a dividend at a level that they believe is sustainable and gives room for future increases as business performance improves. We are proud of our operational performance in the quarter, which underscores successful execution against our revitalization plan.  
We are excited about the future of Molson Coors as we drive towards our goal of long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth.  
And with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

And then also, I'd love to understand why you're not using the Vizzy trademark more in Europe and the U.K., and that you feel that you need to have different sorts of trademarks there.

Look, I mean, we've always said that the growth rates weren't going to continue at the elevated levels that they were and that others might have seen. So Robert, there's really no surprise to us that this rate of growth slowed because the category was cycling last year's huge comps. And we've said in the past that seltzers were a beneficiary of the on-premise shutdown because it had such distribution exposure in the off-premise. And so as the on-premise is reopened, there's less distribution there. And so this is not a surprise to us. I think we've been saying this for almost a year. We've also been saying for a while, even if it's growing at 10%, 20%, 40%, there really isn't anything else in the beer space that's growing that quickly. So it's good for the beer category and it's good for us. 
In North America, in the U.S., we've got 2 very clear and differentiated winners from our point of view, and we plan to continue our focus on Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Now you referred to Coors Seltzer, Rob. And I would say to you that Coors Seltzer up in Canada is actually doing really, really well. It's already achieved double-digit share in some retailers. And it's -- between Vizzy and Coors Seltzer, it's probably the most successful product launches that we've had for our company in 5 years up in Canada. 
We do believe that there will be a shakeout in the near future as many brands struggle to succeed in the crowded space. And while Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer continued to accelerate, Coors Hard Seltzer wasn't. And so that's why we made the decision in the U.S. to discontinue Coors Seltzer and commit our energy, our resources, the material supply we've got in our shelf space to Vizzy and Topo Chico. 
Of course, it's going to stay in Canada because it's doing, as I said, really well. The market dynamics are different, and the brand has performed well. In Europe, it's exhibiting, in the U.K. and Central and Eastern Europe, some of the same trends in the early days as the U.S. did. And we've obviously tested all of our options from a brand point of view. And the early read was that Three Fold was the right brand to go with, and it's landed very well. We're building capacity there. And I think we're well positioned in the U.K. to be a strong player if it takes off like it did in the U.S. 
And the same applies to Central and Eastern Europe. WAI Moment was the best brand, resonated really well with the consumers there. The Central and Eastern European team do a fantastic job from an execution point of view, so the execution is really good. And we actually have first-mover advantage in Central and Eastern Europe. So we feel very good about our leading position in Central and Eastern Europe with that brand as well. I think I hit all your questions, Rob, but if I didn't, I'm happy to take a follow-up from you."

So first, I was curious about hard seltzer, the degree to which you're trying to expand presence of your brands in on-premise. 
And I think that you had mentioned Vizzy as an on-premise play in Canada. If I got that wrong, I apologize, but I was curious if that was in the thought process for the U.S. 
And then also just the, I think, industry-wide discussion of big brands gaining more presence, share of tap handles and so on as on-premise reopens. And I was curious the degree to which you're starting to see that or been positioning for that to be the case as reopening continued."

Look, I mean, yes, during the pandemic, we did see increased demand for large trusted brands. And this is particularly true in the on-premise. Many on-premise owners are sticking to faster-moving brands, and this obviously benefits brands like Miller Lite and Coors Light, in particular, for us. And we are seeing that trend stick as we settle into the sort of new normal. 
And as I said earlier, with Miller Lite and Coors Light, we did grow segment share for the 27th quarter. We're also seeing growth in our above premium portfolio. For example, Blue Moon in the U.S. is up nearly 15% in the quarter. Peroni is up nearly 35%. And it has provided us an outstanding opportunity to sample our newer offerings, like premium LightSky and Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, which we actually missed that opportunity last year. 
So certainly, I wouldn't say it's just Vizzy that's going on-premise, I would say it's both Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer. Topo Chico is as good as well as it's doing. It's still in fairly limited number of markets, less than half of the states in the U.S. And in those states, it's the desire for it to be on-premise has been very, very good. 
Canada, obviously, a little too early to say because the restrictions there have dragged on a little longer than they did in the United States. So too soon to tell how the Canadian on-premise is going to open up. 
In Europe, it's been very pleasing. We, as you know, significantly over-indexed to the on-premise. So the on-premise recovery that's taking place in Europe has been -- that's been very positive for us. And in fact, in July, we've seen the on-premise business in U.K. start to approach 2019 levels and hold there. So that has been very encouraging for us."

And as we put it to North America, you're also at 91% indexed to '19 in the quarter, but that was down from 94% in the first quarter, presumably as the economy brands were deprioritized. But as we think about the back half, similar question, do you think you recover that index to '19 in the back half, number one?

And we've actually seen the on-premise approach to 2019 levels for the last -- well, most of July, actually. It actually spiked a bit higher than that, but that was distorted by the EURO finals. We were actually -- in the U.K., we're actually, for a few weeks, quite substantially above 2019 levels. That settled back down now. And as I said, we're approaching 2019 levels. 
Central and Eastern Europe is a little -- being a little bit more impacted by tourism. And so we're probably not quite at the U.K. levels in Central and Eastern Europe. And in the U.S., we've seen, as I think I said on the last call, more outlets opened from an on-premise point of view than we were initially expecting. And certainly, volume has increased and settled down into a fairly stable level. We will have, in the back half of the year, a lot more fairs, festivals, alliance opportunities, which we didn't have in the second half of last year. And I'm referring to football primarily, which is a big drinking occasion for us. So without wishing to put particular goals out there, we are encouraged by what we're seeing from an on-premise and venue volume point of view. 
I wasn't totally sure I got your price tiers question, Steve. So let me give it a shot. I mean we did, as I said, have the strongest share of our portfolio being above premium in the second quarter. Based on an NSR point of view, it was up into the high teens level, which we haven't seen levels like that since the joint venture started. So working particularly  well. And in Q2, our NSR was actually above 2019. So encouraging signs for sure."

Kind of, Gavin, as you're assessing in the first 6 months of the year, looking to the balance of the year and specifically around the major puts and takes. When you spoke with the investment community in June, you said the company was running ahead of plan. On-premise recovery certainly seems to be running ahead of plan. And certainly, where folks thought perhaps 6 months ago, the performance of your seltzer portfolio, similarly also running ahead of plan, commodity environment worse and then it seems like the SKU rationalization probably has greater pace than you anticipated at the start of the year. So when you kind of pull all these together, I was hoping you could comment on anything perhaps we're missing. Just put a finer point on the puts and takes. As you look back over the past 6 months, how this has progressed the level of confidence for the company as you look to the balance of the year?

So I guess the 2 things which I would say when we talk to the investment community after Q1, which didn't transpire as we were expected, was Canada, the reopening of the on-premise and the continuation of the lockdown went on for longer than we were expecting in Canada. 
And in the U.K., we were expecting so-called Freedom Day to be back in June. And as you know, that was delayed into July. I would say those are the 2 things that we didn't know at that time. 
From a revitalization plan point of view, yes, I mean, we -- the whole rationale for the revitalization plan is to drive both top line and bottom line growth. And the first year was always going to be a reinvestment year, which was supposed to be last year, but we've been through all the reasons why that  didn't make sense. And we're certainly reinvesting behind our brands this year. We increased our marketing spend meaningfully in the second quarter. There were a couple of things that didn't make sense for us to do like investing in meaningful marketing in Canada while it was closed and delaying the U.K. out a month. So that was probably marketing spend that we would have spent in Q2, which will now move into the back half of the year, and as Tracey said, primarily in Q3. Our supply situation has improved meaningfully since the cybersecurity attack and our fast-moving brands and SKUs with the exception of 1 or 2 SKUs or subsegments are at inventory levels that are higher than they were at the same time last year, which allows us now to really put emphasis behind our brands. 
As I said, Topo Chico is supply. We've worked really well with our partners to increase our supply in the third quarter and beyond. And so that will be coming through, which will allow our marketing teams to really put emphasis behind that. So I think I've answered your question, Kevin, but help me if I haven't."

As far as our 10% share goal is concerned, we, as I said, I think we've got 2 clear and differentiated winners with Vizzy and Topo Chico. With Vizzy, we're seeing strong traction with the innovation that we've brought, particularly the Variety Pack 2 and Vizzy Lemonade. We're seeing with retailers where we've got all 3 busy SKUs on shelf that we see almost a 2/3 increase in each of those SKUs velocities, and so we're going to continue to fuel Vizzy's momentum. We've got more innovation coming. We have had innovation LTOs like our June Pride Pack. And we've just recently launched the watermelon variety pack. So it's carved out a unique point of difference in the category. And so, so much so that we're well on our way to becoming the #4 spot in the segment despite all the new entrants in 2021. 
I'm not going to show our hand in terms of which brands are going to take Coors Hard Seltzer's space, but you can assume that we do have innovation coming on Vizzy and we'll utilize Coors Hard Seltzer space to put that innovation from Vizzy into that space. And so we feel good about Vizzy. Vizzy will certainly be a big part of getting to our 10 share goal as well Topo Chico, as I said to Nadine, I'm not going to repeat all of that, but it does remain incredibly strong. Supply is improving. We have worked with our third-party suppliers to ramp up supply. And we'll go national when we believe we can supply the markets that we're in at this point in time. I mean we've -- how high is high is not quite clear yet on Topo Chico because we haven't been able to supply all of the demand  in Texas for over a 10 share, I'll say. Other states, we're doing equally as well. 
So in terms of when are we going to bring it in-house, we've always said we're going to bring it in-house in 2022. That plan is on track. When we do, it will improve our margins. And it's a slightly different process than perhaps Vizzy, so all Coors Seltzer. So it's not a direct substitution from a liquid point of view, but certainly from a canned availability point of view, we've got that capacity and it's ready."

I'm going to change things up a bit here from our normal structure, and I'm going to share 7 key headlines from our third quarter: Firstly, Coors Light is growing share of the total beer category in the United States. This is our biggest brand in our biggest market, a brand that many doubters could get back onto this trajectory, and it's growing share in the industry for the first time in more than 5 years; two, globally, Molson Coors' net sales revenue from its above premium portfolio has surpassed 25% of our brand volume net sales revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time since the revitalization plan was announced; third, Molson Coors has grown share of the U.S. about premium segment for 2 straight quarters for the first time in over 5 years; four, as we expand beyond beer and with 3 months still left in the year, Molson Coors has sold nearly 2 million cases of non-alcohol beverages in the United States; five, Molson Coors total market share trend in Canada has improved for 8 straight months, leading to national share growth in the third quarter, and the European business has bounced back, essentially reaching 2019 revenue levels; sixth, challenges in the global supply chain impacted our third quarter volumes. We are already seeing improvements in brewery output in October. We are back to shipping approximately 1 million barrels per week in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. And in aggregate, distributor inventories are starting to improve; and seventh, like for so many others, transportation availability and transportation costs are worse than they have been in years.
So I want to start there and then we'll work backwards. Like we've discussed for the second quarter and like other CPG companies, inflation was again a challenge in Q3, specifically with respect to transportation. Fuel prices are up, Trackers are in short supply around the world and freight costs are up 2%.
As Tracey highlighted in our second quarter earnings, we have long-term contracts with carriers and a robust hedging program as well as meaningful cost savings programs to mitigate price fluctuations. The driver shortages at our existing carriers are forcing us to use the spot market and to pay spot market rates, which are significantly higher than they have been in many years. Right now, up to 1 in every 4 shipments are at these high spot rates. That level of inflation cannot be completely absorbed or avoided, and you're seeing the results in our COGS for the quarter.
Beyond the hedging and cost savings, we are taking steps to reduce the impact, including shipping more beverages on rail. Also, we expect gross margin benefits as we continue to premiumize our portfolio under our revitalization plan and achieve improved efficiencies through our economy SKU deprioritization and rationalization plans. But even with those steps, inflation will continue to be a pressure point for us and for just about every other company.
Our shipment trends in the third quarter were not what we wanted them to be. Some of that is related to the challenges of moving finished goods to distributors and also moving suppliers within our brewery network. Some of that is related to our own suppliers having difficulty in getting us the materials we needed since they're facing the same supply chain challenges as everyone else in the world. But the good news is that this trend, as I've said, has already started turning.
While August and September were difficult production months, the steps we have taken in the third quarter to expand our base of material suppliers and improve our availability for most packaging materials have allowed us to increase shipments so far in the fourth quarter. We are once again shipping approximately 1 million barrels per week in the U.S., and that has helped us increase distributor inventories by approximately 20% over the past few weeks. So that is, of course, the measurement of our total network and that is a trend we expect to build on.
I also want to quickly address volume. Some of you may look at our North American volume trends with concern. But I want to remind you that this is predominantly the result of an intentional and strategic decision we made to deprioritize and eliminate a number of large -- a large number of lower-margin, slower moving SKUs in the U.S. that were mainly in the economy segment. The intention was to simplify and premiumize our portfolio, and that is exactly what is happening. So our volume is down, but our net sales revenue per hectoliter is up. And I can again tell you that we are on track to deliver on our full year key financial guidance for 2021.
This is what is happening in Canada. We have improved our national share trend for 8 straight months, leading to total share growth in the third quarter. This is the best share trend performance we have seen in at least 6 years. As the on-premise reopens in Canada, our share is growing above 2019 levels, a big driver of our progress. Coors is growing share of the segment in Canada as well with Miller Lite also growing approximately 30% in the quarter.
Molson Ultra has seen strong year-to-date performance with volume growing mid-single digits along with strong share gains. These are all very good signs for our business in Canada. Not to be outdone, our European business has bounced back strongly. In the U.K., our on-trade net sales revenue has now reached 2019 levels, and margin has surpassed 2019 levels as the business continues to premiumize, which I'll touch on in more detail in a moment.
As we look to the fourth quarter, we plan to keep this momentum up by stepping up our European marketing investments. 2 years after shifting from a beer company to a beverage company, we have reached a significant milestone. For the first 9 months of the year, we have sold nearly 2 million cases of non-alcohol beverages as we continue to drive towards our $1 billion revenue ambition for our emerging growth business by 2023. We have launched into categories where we think we can create scale offerings like water, energy and coffee.
First, of course, that our partnership with ZOA, which has been making some serious noise since its launch just over 6 months ago. It's the #1 new energy franchise in 2021, and it's already a top 20 energy drink brand. ZOA already has 31,000 buying outlets and over 15,000 points of distribution with more coming online every day. There's a lot of upside for this brand.
We have the distribution partnership for Lakalone's incredible lineup of ready-to-drink coffee, one of the fastest-growing spaces in the beverage industry. And thanks to our early success with distribution in large national retailers, we also unlocked national distribution of Lakalone in grocery and mass channel stores for early 2022.
Growing beyond the beer aisle is no longer an aspiration. We're doing it, and we're driving scale. Molson Coors has grown share of the U.S. above premium segment for 2 straight quarters for the first time in over 5 years. That mark is largely driven by the continued success of our U.S. hard seltzer portfolio, and this is another space I want to take a little more time to discuss.
There's been a lot of noise over the past few months about hard seltzers in the U.S., a lot. Not all of it has been accurate, and much of it has been unproductive.
Now our hard seltzer is going to keep growing at 200% per year. But of course, not. And we've been clear since last fall that we didn't expect them to do so. But in spite of the rosy forecast some had a year ago and the bleak forecast being thrown about today, there are some clear truths. Hard seltzer are here to stay. There are over 10% of beer category sales and growing. But the segment has matured and the easy growth is over.
Moving forward, it is going to take distinctive, differentiated brands in order to succeed, and that's why we feel so confident about our portfolio. While so many of the mainstays are declining, Molson Coors has the fastest-growing hard seltzer portfolio in the United States.
Vizzy brand volumes grew 50% in the third quarter versus the prior year and passed yet another competitor to become the #4 hard seltzer in the United States. Despite only being launched in 16 different markets in the U.S., Topo Chico Hard Seltzer occupies the #3 slot as a new item in the general milk beverages category. The brand also gained a 2.4% share of the U.S. market according to IRI, and this success has led to the national expansion of the brand.
But that is not the extent of our premiumization. Our joint venture with Yuengling launched in Texas this quarter, and we are very pleased with the very early results. By the end of August, it was already available for purchase in 40,000 locations across the state.
As the on-premise continues to strengthen, so have 2 of our biggest above premium brands. Peroni is up double digits, gaining share in the category and outpacing all other European imports. Blue Moon Belgian White is up high single digits. And this quarter, we announced plans to build upon the success of Blue Moon Light Sky, which our data shows is 96% incremental to the flagship Belgian White.  Blue Moon Light Sky continues to see double-digit growth year-to-date after finishing 2020 as the #1 new beer in the United States. In 2022, we'll add more muscle to the Blue Moon family as we launched Light Sky Tropical Wheat.
As I said in our second quarter earnings call, premiumization is here to stay at Molson Coors. All that growth in the U.S. is contributing to a significant premiumization of our entire global portfolio. So much so that as of the third quarter, the percentage of Molson Coors portfolio that is above premium has surpassed 25% of our brand volume net sales revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time since the revitalization plan was announced, and that progress is being seen throughout the company.
The early returns on our Canadian hard seltzer portfolio have exceeded expectations with both Vizzy and Coors Seltzer, generating strong market share. We will extend that streak when we introduced Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in Canada in 2022, which we announced this month.
Six Pints, our Canadian craft business, is growing double digits despite on-premise restrictions. Combined with the growth of Miller Lite at and Molson Ultra, this has continued to drive the premiumization of our business in Canada.
In Western Europe, our new Mediterranean lager, Madri, has already doubled its distribution goal for the year, now at approximately 5,500 on-premise outlets with more coming in the fourth quarter.
In Central and Eastern Europe, New Smooth [indiscernible], Praha, has been performing above expectations across the market with presence in more than 15,000 outlets supported with strong media campaigns, reaching over 13 million consumers. And in Latin America, Coors Light is growing in Puerto Rico for the first time in 15 years, where it sells at an above premium price point.
And speaking of Coors Light, that brings me to the final point I want to make this morning. In the face of many doubters, Coors Light is growing share of industry in the United States for the first time in more than 5 years. The brand's strong performance in the third quarter was aided by the continued success of our Made to Chill campaign and through increased marketing investment.
We're actually making progress on the things that are within our control and driving measurable results that continue us on the path to delivering on our goal of sustainable, long-term top and bottom line growth. We are 2 years into our revitalization plan, and I remain confident that we are on track to deliver our full year key financial guidance for 2021, while continuing to invest behind our brands. And I'm very optimistic about the future for Molson Coors.

We continue to make real progress executing our revitalization plan. We invested behind our business, driving premiumization of our portfolio of brands and strengthening our core business while continuing to delever our balance sheet and to reinstate the dividend. But like most consumer product companies, we face supply chain challenges and inflationary cost headwinds in the quarter, which had an impact on our quarterly results.
Now let me take you through our quarterly results in more detail and provide an update on our outlook. Consolidated net sales revenue increased 1% in constant currency, delivering over 99% of third quarter 2019 level despite the on-premise continuing to operate below pre-pandemic levels. Consolidated financial volumes declined 3.9%, primarily due to lower brand volumes, which were down 3.6%, largely due to the economy segment, including the economy SKU deprioritization program.
Top line performance benefited from strong global net pricing, favorable brand mix levels in North America as we continue to premiumize our portfolio, double-digit revenue growth in Europe and positive channel mix. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.6% in constant currency, driven by the strong pricing growth, coupled with positive brand and channel mix. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 8.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation, including higher transportation and input costs, mix impact from premiumization and volume deleverage.
However, with our robust hedging and cost savings programs, we have been able to mitigate some of the inflationary pressure. Underlying NG&A in the quarter increased 3.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher marketing investments behind our core brands and innovation as well as parking targeted reductions to marketing spend in the prior year period due to the pandemic, which was largely offset by lower G&A expenses.
As planned, we increased marketing investments in the quarter to levels above second quarter 2021 and third quarter 2019 levels, ensuring strong commercial pressure behind our key innovations and core brands. As a result of these factors, underlying EBITDA decreased 10.9% on a constant currency basis.
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was significantly impacted by a discrete tax item. You may recall in the second quarter of last year following the issuance of certain U.S. tax regulations -- We recognized a material discrete tax expense of $135 million. It was related to previously taken tax positions over several years.
In the third quarter of this year, we reached a settlement with the tax authorities with regard to our tax positions impacted by those tax regulations. As a result of the settlement, we had a release of unrecognized tax benefit positions in the quarter that resulted in a P&L tax benefit of $68 million, including a $49 million discrete tax benefit in the third quarter.
Underlying free cash flow was $933 million for the first 9 months of the year, a decrease in cash received of $227 million, from the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by the repayment of taxes related to various government-sponsored deferral programs related to the pandemic. As a reminder, in 2020, working capital was positively impacted by over $200 million for benefits related to these government tax deferral program.
Capital expenditures paid was $363 million for the first 9 months of the year as we continue to invest behind capability programs such as our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project and our new Montreal brewery expected to open by year-end. Capital expenditure levels were relatively consistent with the comparable period in the prior year.
Now let's look at our results of our business units. In North America, the on-premise has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, but continued to improve on a sequential quarter basis. In the third quarter, the on-premise channel accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales revenue in the quarter, compared to approximately 12% in the second quarter of 2021 and 16% in the same period in 2019.
In the U.S., the on-premise accounted for about 88% of 2019 net sales revenue in the quarter. In Canada, restrictions continue to ease throughout the quarter with the on-premise net sales rising to 80% of 2019 levels in the third quarter, up from about 25% in the second quarter. North America net sales revenue was down 2.1% in constant currency as net pricing growth and positive brand mix were more than offset by lower volume. North America financial volumes decreased 4.8%, largely due to lower brand volumes of 3.8%, driven by the U.S.
In the U.S. domestic shipment volumes decreased 6.6%, trailing brand volume declines of 5.2%, driven by unfavorable shipment timing and declines in the deprioritized economy segment. Economy was down double digits as we deprioritize and announced the rationalization of approximately 100 non-core SKUs, which were primarily in the economy segment. Conversely, our U.S. at best premium portfolio was up high single digits.
Canada brand volumes improved 0.5% in the quarter, and Latin America brand volumes continued their strong performance and experienced 9% growth, reflecting the easing of on-premise restrictions.
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.4% in constant currency with net pricing growth and favorable brand mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix given the growing license volume in Latin America.
U.S. net sales per head gamier increased 3.2%, driven by net pricing growth and positive brand mix, led by best premium innovation brands, including Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Yuengling. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew in Canada due to positive brand and channel mix as well as net pricing increases while Latin America also increased due to favorable sales mix.
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 7.3%, driven by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging materials and brewery costs, volume deleverage and mix impact from premiumization. Underlying MG&A decreased 1% as higher marketing investments were offset by lower G&A due to lower incentive compensation expense and the recognition of the Yuengling Company joint venture equity income.
We increased marketing investments behind our innovation brands and our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, including an increase in local tactical spend as on-premise restrictions eased throughout the quarter. As planned, we increased U.S. marketing investment compared to not only the same period in 2020, but also versus 2019. North America underlying EBITDA decreased 14.3% in constant currency.
Europe net sales revenue was up 14.7% in constant currency, with an 11% increase in net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis driven by positive brand, channel, geographic and packaging mix and positive net pricing. Top line performance also benefited from the on-premise reopening in the U.K. on July 19. And of note, in the third quarter of 2020, the on-premise have fewer restrictions than in the second and fourth quarters of that year. The U.K. on-premise channel net sales revenue reached similar levels of pre-pandemic levels in the quarter.
Europe financial volumes decreased 2% and brand volumes decreased 3%. The decline was primarily due to lower Central and Eastern European volumes driven by increased on-premise restrictions related to the coronavirus and the disposal of our India business in the first quarter of 2021. This was partially offset by growth in the above premium brand volumes, which reached another record high portion of our Europe portfolio. Underlying EBITDA increased 2.7% in constant currency as revenue growth was partially offset by higher marketing investments.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, we had lowered our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.3x and reduced our net debt to $6.6 billion, down from 3.5x and $7.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.
On July 15, we announced that we had repaid in full the $1 billion, 2.1 senior notes that are maturing that day using a combination of commercial paper and cash on hand. We ended the third quarter with strong borrowing capacity with approximately $1.5 billion available capacity under our U.S. credit facility.
Now turning to our financial outlook. We are again reaffirming our 2021 key financial annual guidance originally provided on February 11, 2021. While we are seeking in a better place than we were a year ago, it bears reminding that uncertainty has pertains to the coronavirus and its variants remains severely decrease by market. If restrictions are reinstated in some of our larger markets, this could have a significant impact on our financial performance over the next few months.
Now I'll provide some underlying expectations to provide some additional context for the balance of the year. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth for the full year on a constant currency basis. We continue to work to build inventories with wholesalers, which have been at low levels. And as Gavin mentioned, we are making progress.
In the U.S. we expect on-premise trends to continue to improve as we lap restrictions in the prior year period. In Canada, we continue to see greater on-premise reopenings bearing by coupon, which should continue to provide positive channel mix. In Europe, the U.K. top line should strongly benefit from the prior year fourth quarter, given the on-premise was fully locked down for November and December of 2020, which are typically strong months given the holidays.
Our guidance also anticipates continued strength in our both premium portfolio, particularly hard seltzers, innovations and imports. Also, we expect continued solid progress against our previously discussed emerging gross revenue goal of $1 billion in annual revenue by 2023, against which we continue to track ahead of plan driven by ZOA, [indiscernible] and Latin America.
We continue to anticipate underlying EBITDA to be roughly flat compared to 2020 as top line growth is expected to be offset by continued cost inflationary headwinds largely transportation and packaging materials, including aluminum and the Midwest premium and increased marketing investments to deliver against our revitalization plan.
Under the revitalization plan, 2021 has been a year of investment for the company, and we intend to continue to increase marketing investments to build on the strength of our core brands and support successful innovation. As Gavin mentioned, we expect fourth quarter marketing investment to be higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, as we continue to ramp up supply and put commercial pressure to support our big bet brands in both North America and Europe.
We continue to anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, and net interest expense of $270 million, plus or minus 5%. However, due solely to the street tax benefit in the third quarter, we have adjusted our effective tax rate range for 2021 only to 13% to 15% from 20% to 23% previously. Also, as a reminder, in 2020, our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $150 million in tax payments from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic. We currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due.
Moving to capital allocation. We continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. First, we plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives, improve efficiencies and advance towards our sustainability goals.
Second, we have a strong desire to maintain and, in time, upgraded our investment grade rating. As such, we expect to continue to improve our net debt position and reassure our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.25x by the end of 2021, and below 3x by the end of 2022.
And third, on July 15, our Board of Directors determined to reinstate a quarterly dividend on our Class A and Class B common shares and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share payable on September 17. The Board made the decision to reinstate the dividend at a level that they believe is sustainable and provides room for future increases as business performance improved.
In closing, to be sure we have faced challenges in the quarter, but are proud of our agility and the actions we have taken to manage through them. Through it all, we have continued to successfully execute against our revitalization plan with clear premiumization of our portfolio. And despite all the ups and downs throughout this year, we have reaffirmed our key financial annual guidance yet again.
Like most consumer product companies, we face near-term challenges, but the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we are confident we are on the right path toward long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth.
So with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

Maybe just a couple of contextual points to help you here, right? I mean, the fourth quarter last year in Europe and Canada were very difficult as a result of the almost total lockdown of the on-premise. And that's not our expectation this year, and we haven't seen that in October, which is obviously the first month of the fourth quarter. I did cover off in my opening remarks, the challenges that we had with the sales to wholesalers shipments in the third quarter. And that has improved meaningfully in October due to the actions which we took to improve that. And as I said, our distributor inventory levels are approximately 20% higher then they were coming out of the third quarter, which is obviously very helpful from that perspective as well.
Our above premium performance continues to accelerate, whether that's brands like Blue Moon, [indiscernible] and [indiscernible], and our seltzer portfolio as well as our emerging growth portfolio. So yes, I think those are the contextual points I would give you.
On the flip side, I'll tell you, at the same time, we do intend to increase marketing spend. I know there's been some conversation about the fact that it's either or. And for us, it's not. It's both and. And we did that in the third quarter. We increased our marketing spend above 2019 levels and above, obviously, 2020, which was -- is an easier comp. And we plan to spend more than 2019 levels in the fourth quarter as well behind the success that we're seeing in many of our brands. So hopefully, that's helpful for you. 's"

As far as the overall ITD space is concerned, I mean, obviously, it's an emerging and fast-growing segment. ITD sales already outpaced spirits, and that gap is only going to widen in the future.

As far as pricing is concerned, Nadine, they won just a tougher one for me, right? Because obviously, we don't provide guidance on price going forward for obvious reasons. But we closely watch and evaluate our pricing.
We do it on a market-by-market basis. We do brand by brand to see how it best with our brand strength and so on. And obviously, input costs play a role in those decisions. We do have other levers which can help offset inflationary pressure. As Tracey mentioned, one of them moving from truck to rail. We've got our cost savings programs. We have a robust hedging program. Our overall premiumization strategy is driving strong positive mix in our NSR per hectoliter. I think this quarter was the fifth quarter that we've grown that, notwithstanding the significant comp that we had in this space from Q3. And then we've got a variety of revenue management tools. We've spent a long time in the last 6 years since 2015 building revenue management tool capability. And I think we've as well placed in that space as we've been in a long time."

It's not 1 million barrels every single week because obviously, the Thanksgiving, we would shut the Thanksgiving day and there's Christmas Day and so on. So it's not a 1 size fits all for every single week, but that's an important component. From an on-premise point of view, in both -- in all of U.S. and Canada and Europe.

From an NSR point of view, we in the U.S., we're at approximately 85% of 2019 levels in Q3.

Can you talk about how much of a drag that was if you were to add that all up, and that could help us get an understanding of how the underlying business is doing."

It's following a recent line of questioning just around the economy SKUs and how you see the mix of the portfolio evolving over time and the focus on value over volume and how that can play out in the near term.
I guess if you look at your portfolio today and you think about your aspirations for the go forward on getting to a volume growth basis, do you still see aspects of your portfolio, which you potentially need to improve? And I suppose there always are these opportunities, but maybe more strategically. And then if that is the case, do you see the premiumization strategy over time as enough to offset some of these decisions and then it's all sort of connected to the volume dynamic, but the share gains are well taken in some of your most important brands.
But I guess the other side of that is just the categories have been under pressure, tough comps, and there are other aspects that are that are in play there. But do you have any view on where you kind of see category growth going forward?
I know it's not something that you can necessarily control, but that is an important dynamic here. So if I put all that together, there's this dynamic around the portfolio, how you see it today. But at premiums issued could be enough to offset future decisions and just maybe your latest thoughts on the category, the categories which you play would be helpful."

We believe that innovation and great innovation around beer and around seltzers will add value to both the category and ourselves over the over the next 3 years, and that's are putting so much emphasis on a really tight and focused in innovation portfolio.
Remember, Chris, that our focus is not so much volume, right? It's really about driving revenue and value, and that's what we're doing. So I wouldn't expect our volumes to be positive necessarily because of the actions that we've taken in the economy portfolio. But we think they're right.

I'm going to change things up a bit here from our normal structure, and I'm going to share 7 key headlines from our third quarter. Firstly, Coors Light is growing share of the total beer category in the United States. This is our biggest brand in our biggest market, a brand that many doubters could get back onto this trajectory, and it's growing share in the industry for the first time in more than 5 years.
Two, globally, Molson Coors' net sales revenue from its above premium portfolio has surpassed 25% of our brand volume net sales revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time since the revitalization plan was announced. Third, Molson Coors' grown share of the U.S. above premium segment for 2 straight quarters for the first time in over 5 years. Four, as we expand beyond beer and with 3 months still left in the year, Molson Coors has sold nearly 2 million cases of non-alcohol beverages in the United States; five, Molson Coors' total market share trend in Canada has improved for 8 straight months, leading to national share growth in the third quarter, and the European business has bounced back, essentially reaching 2019 revenue levels; sixth, challenges in the global supply chain impacted our third quarter volumes.
We are already seeing improvements in brewery output in October. We are back to shipping approximately 1 million barrels per week in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. And in aggregate, distributor inventories are starting to improve; and seventh, like for so many others, transportation availability and transportation costs are worse than they have been in years. So I want to start there and then we'll work backwards. Like we've discussed for the second quarter and like other CPG companies, inflation was again a challenge in Q3, specifically with respect to transportation. Fuel prices are up, truckers are in short supply around the world and freight costs are up 2%.
As Tracey highlighted in our second quarter earnings, we have long-term contracts with carriers and a robust hedging program as well as meaningful cost savings programs to mitigate price fluctuations. The driver shortages at our existing carriers are forcing us to use the spot market and to pay spot market rates, which are significantly higher than they have been in many years. Right now, up to 1 in every 4 shipments are at these high spot rates. That level of inflation cannot be completely absorbed or avoided, and you're seeing the results in our COGS for the quarter.
Beyond the hedging and cost savings, we are taking steps to reduce the impact, including shipping more beverages on rail. Also, we expect gross margin benefits as we continue to premiumize our portfolio under our revitalization plan and achieve improved efficiencies through our economy SKU deprioritization and rationalization plans. But even with those steps, inflation will continue to be a pressure point for us and for just about every other company. Our shipment trends in the third quarter were not what we wanted them to be. Some of that is related to the challenges of moving finished goods to distributors and also moving suppliers within our brewery network. Some of that is related to our own suppliers having difficulty in getting us the materials we needed since they're facing the same supply chain challenges as everyone else in the world. But the good news is that this trend, as I've said, has already started turning.
While August and September were difficult production months, the steps we have taken in the third quarter to expand our base of material suppliers and improve our availability for most packaging materials have allowed us to increase shipments so far in the fourth quarter. We are once again shipping approximately 1 million barrels per week in the U.S., and that has helped us increase distributor inventories by approximately 20% over the past few weeks. So that is, of course, the measurement of our total network and that is a trend we expect to build on.
I also want to quickly address volume. Some of you may look at our North American volume trends with concern. But I want to remind you that this is predominantly the result of an intentional and strategic decision we made to deprioritize and eliminate a number of large -- a large number of lower-margin, slower moving SKUs in the U.S. that were mainly in the economy segment. The intention was to simplify and premiumize our portfolio, and that is exactly what is happening. So our volume is down, but our net sales revenue per hectoliter is up. And I can again tell you that we are on track to deliver on our full year key financial guidance for 2021.
This is what is happening in Canada. We have improved our national share trend for 8 straight months, leading to total share growth in the third quarter. This is the best share trend performance we have seen in at least 6 years. As the on-premise reopens in Canada, our share is growing above 2019 levels, a big driver of our progress. Coors' growing share of the segment in Canada as well with Miller Lite also growing approximately 30% in the quarter.
Molson Ultra has seen strong year-to-date performance with volume growing mid-single digits along with strong share gains. These are all very good signs for our business in Canada. Not to be outdone, our European business has bounced back strongly. In the U.K., our on-trade net sales revenue has now reached 2019 levels, and margin has surpassed 2019 levels as the business continues to premiumize, which I'll touch on in more detail in a moment.
As we look to the fourth quarter, we plan to keep this momentum up by stepping up our European marketing investments. 2 years after shifting from a beer company to a beverage company, we have reached a significant milestone. For the first 9 months of the year, we have sold nearly 2 million cases of non-alcohol beverages as we continue to drive towards our $1 billion revenue ambition for our emerging growth business by 2023. We have launched into categories where we think we can create scale offerings like water, energy and coffee. First, of course, is our partnership with Zoa, which has been making some serious noise since its launch just over 6 months ago. It's the #1 new energy franchise in 2021, and it's already a top 20 energy drink brand. Zoa already has 31,000 buying outlets and over 115,000 points of distribution with more coming online every day.
There's a lot of upside for this brand. We have the distribution partnership for La Colombe's incredible lineup of ready-to-drink coffee, 1 of the fastest-growing spaces in the beverage industry. And thanks to our early success with distribution in large national retailers, we've also unlocked national distribution of La Colombe in grocery and mass channel stores for early 2022. Growing beyond the beer aisle is no longer an aspiration. We're doing it, and we're driving scale. Molson Coors' grown share of the U.S. above premium segment for 2 straight quarters for the first time in over 5 years. That mark is largely driven by the continued success of our U.S. hard seltzer portfolio, and this is another space I want to take a little more time to discuss.
There's been a lot of noise over the past few months about hard seltzers in the U.S., a lot. Not all of it has been accurate, and much of it has been unproductive.
Now hard seltzer is going to keep growing at 200% per year. But of course, not. And we've been clear since last fall that we didn't expect them to do so. But in spite of the rosy forecast some had a year ago and the bleak forecast being thrown about today, there are some clear truths. Hard seltzers are here to stay. There are over 10% of beer category sales and growing. But the segment has matured and the easy growth is over.
Moving forward, it is going to take distinctive, differentiated brands in order to succeed, and that's why we feel so confident about our portfolio. While so many of the mainstays are declining, Molson Coors has the fastest-growing hard seltzer portfolio in the United States.
Vizzy brand volumes grew 50% in the third quarter versus the prior year and passed yet another competitor to become the #4 hard seltzer in the United States. Despite only being launched in 16 different markets in the U.S., Topo Chico Hard Seltzer occupies the #3 slot as a new item in the general malt beverages category. The brand also garnered a 2.4% share of the U.S. market according to IRI, and this success has led to the national expansion of the brand.
But that is not the extent of our premiumization. Our joint venture with Yuengling launched in Texas this quarter, and we are very pleased with the very early results. By the end of August, it was already available for purchase in 40,000 locations across the state. As the on-premise continues to strengthen, so have 2 of our biggest above premium brands. Peroni is up double digits, gaining share in the category and outpacing all other European imports. Blue Moon Belgian White is up high single digits. And this quarter, we announced plans to build upon the success of Blue Moon LightSky, which our data shows is 96% incremental to the flagship Belgian White.  Blue Moon LightSky continues to see double-digit growth year-to-date after finishing 2020 as the #1 new beer in the United States. In 2022, we'll add more muscle to the Blue Moon family as we launched LightSky Tropical Wheat.
As I said in our second quarter earnings call, premiumization is here to stay at Molson Coors. All that growth in the U.S. is contributing to a significant premiumization of our entire global portfolio. So much so that as of the third quarter, the percentage of Molson Coors portfolio that is above premium has surpassed 25% of our brand volume net sales revenue on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time since the revitalization plan was announced. And that progress is being seen throughout the company. 
The early returns on our Canadian Hard Seltzer portfolio have exceeded expectations with both Vizzy and Coors sales are generating strong market share. We will extend that streak when we introduced Topo Chico Hard Seltzer in Canada in 2022, which we announced this month.
Six Pints, our Canadian craft business, is growing double digits despite on-premise restrictions. Combined with the growth of Miller Lite and Molson Ultra, this has continued to drive the premiumization of our business in Canada.
In Western Europe, our new Mediterranean lager, Madre, has already doubled its distribution goal for the year, now at approximately 5,500 on-premise outlets with more coming in the fourth quarter.
In Central and Eastern Europe, New Smooth pilsner lager Pravha, has been performing above expectations across the market with presence in more than 15,000 outlets supported with strong media campaigns, reaching over 13 million consumers.
And in Latin America, Coors Light is growing in Puerto Rico for the first time in 15 years, where it sells at an above premium price point.
And speaking of Coors Light, that brings me to the final point I want to make this morning. In the face of many doubters, Coors Light is growing share of industry in the United States for the first time in more than 5 years. The brand's strong performance in the third quarter was aided by the continued success of our Made to Chill campaign and through increased marketing investment.
We're actually making progress on the things that are within our control and driving measurable results that continue us on the path to delivering on our goal of sustainable, long-term top and bottom line growth. We are 2 years into our revitalization plan, and I remain confident that we are on track to deliver our full year key financial guidance for 2021, while continuing to invest behind our brands. And I'm very optimistic about the future for Molson Coors. Tracey?"

We continue to make real progress executing our revitalization plan. We invested behind our business, driving premiumization of our portfolio of our brands and strengthening our core business while continuing to delever our balance sheet and to reinstate the dividend. But like most consumer product companies, we face supply chain challenges and inflationary cost headwinds in the quarter, which had an impact on our quarterly results.
Now let me take you through our quarterly results in more detail and provide an update on our outlook. Consolidated net sales revenue increased 1% in constant currency, delivering over 99% of third quarter 2019 level despite the on-premise continuing to operate below pre-pandemic levels. Consolidated financial volumes declined 3.9%, primarily due to lower brand volumes, which were down 3.6%, largely due to the economy segment, including the economy SKU deprioritization program.
Top line performance benefited from strong global net pricing, favorable brand mix levels in North America as we continue to premiumize our portfolio, double-digit revenue growth in Europe and positive channel mix. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.6% in constant currency, driven by the strong pricing growth, coupled with positive brand and channel mix. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 8.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation, including higher transportation and input costs, mix impact from premiumization and volume deleverage.
However, with our robust hedging and cost savings programs, we have been able to mitigate some of the inflationary pressure. Underlying MG&A in the quarter increased 3.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher marketing investment behind our core brands and innovation as well as parking targeted reductions to marketing spend in the prior year period due to the pandemic, which was largely offset by lower G&A expenses.
As planned, we increased marketing investments in the quarter to levels above second quarter 2021 and third quarter 2019 levels, ensuring strong commercial pressure behind our key innovations and core brands. As a result of these factors, underlying EBITDA decreased 10.9% on a constant currency basis. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was significantly impacted by a discrete tax item. You may recall in the second quarter of last year following the issuance of certain U.S. tax regulations, we recognized a material discrete tax expense of $135 million. It was related to previously taken tax positions over several years. 
In the third quarter of this year, we reached a settlement with the tax authorities with regard to our tax positions impacted by those tax regulations. As a result of the settlement, we had a release of unrecognized tax benefit positions in the quarter that resulted in a P&L tax benefit of $68 million, including a $49 million discrete tax benefit in the third quarter.
Underlying free cash flow was $933 million for the first 9 months of the year, a decrease in cash received of $227 million, from the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by the repayment of taxes related to various government-sponsored deferral programs related to the pandemic.
As a reminder, in 2020, working capital was positively impacted by over $200 million for benefits related to these government tax deferral program.
Capital expenditures paid was $363 million for the first 9 months of the year as we continue to invest behind capability programs such as our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project and our new Montreal brewery expected to open by year-end. Capital expenditure levels were relatively consistent with the comparable period in the prior year.
Now let's look at our results of our business units. In North America, the on-premise has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, but continued to improve on a sequential quarter basis. In the third quarter, the on-premise channel accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales revenue in the quarter, compared to approximately 12% in the second quarter of 2021 and 16% in the same period in 2019.
In the U.S., the on-premise accounted for about 88% of 2019 net sales revenue in the quarter. In Canada, restrictions continue to ease throughout the quarter with the on-premise net sales rising to 80% of 2019 levels in the third quarter, up from about 25% in the second quarter. North America net sales revenue was down 2.1% in constant currency as net pricing growth and positive brand mix were more than offset by lower volume. North America financial volumes decreased 4.8%, largely due to lower brand volumes of 3.8%, driven by the U.S.
In the U.S. domestic shipment volumes decreased 6.6%, trailing brand volume declines of 5.2%, driven by unfavorable shipment timing and declines in the deprioritized economy segment. Economy was down double digits as we deprioritize and announced the rationalization of approximately 100 non-core SKUs, which were primarily in the economy segment. Conversely, our U.S. above premium portfolio was up high single digits.
Canada brand volumes improved 0.5% in the quarter, and Latin America brand volumes continued their strong performance and experienced 9% growth, reflecting the easing of on-premise restrictions.
Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 2.4% in constant currency with net pricing growth and favorable brand mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix given the growing license volume in Latin America.
U.S. net sales per hectoliter increased 3.2%, driven by net pricing growth and positive brand mix, led by best premium innovation brands, including Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Zoa. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew in Canada due to positive brand and channel mix as well as net pricing increases while Latin America also increased due to favorable sales mix.
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 7.3%, driven by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging materials and brewery costs, volume deleverage and mix impact from premiumization. Underlying MG&A decreased 1% as higher marketing investments were offset by lower G&A due to lower incentive compensation expense and the recognition of the Yuengling Company joint venture equity income.
We increased marketing investments behind our innovation brands and our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, including an increase in local tactical spend as on-premise restrictions eased throughout the quarter. As planned, we increased U.S. marketing investment compared to not only the same period in 2020, but also versus 2019. North America underlying EBITDA decreased 14.3% in constant currency.
Europe net sales revenue was up 14.7% in constant currency, with an 11% increase in net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis driven by positive brand, channel, geographic and packaging mix and positive net pricing. Top line performance also benefited from the on-premise reopening in the U.K. on July 19. And of note, in the third quarter of 2020, the on-premise have fewer restrictions than in the second and fourth quarters of that year. The U.K. on-premise channel net sales revenue reached similar levels of pre-pandemic levels in the quarter.
Europe financial volumes decreased 2% and brand volumes decreased 3%. The decline was primarily due to lower Central and Eastern European volumes driven by increased on-premise restrictions related to the coronavirus and the disposal of our India business in the first quarter of 2021. This was partially offset by growth in the above premium brand volumes, which reached another record high portion of our Europe portfolio. Underlying EBITDA increased 2.7% in constant currency as revenue growth was partially offset by higher marketing investments.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, we had lowered our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.3x and reduced our net debt to $6.6 billion, down from 3.5x and $7.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.
On July 15, we announced that we had repaid in full the $1 billion, 2.1 senior notes that are maturing that day using a combination of commercial paper and cash on hand. We ended the third quarter with strong borrowing capacity with approximately $1.5 billion available capacity under our U.S. credit facility.
Now turning to our financial outlook. We are again reaffirming our 2021 key financial annual guidance originally provided on February 11, 2021. While we are sitting in a better place than we were a year ago, it bears reminding that uncertainty pertains to the coronavirus and its variants remains severely decreased by market. If restrictions are reinstated in some of our larger markets, this could have a significant impact on our financial performance over the next few months.
Now I'll provide some underlying expectations to provide some additional context for the balance of the year. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit net sales revenue growth for the full year on a constant currency basis. We continue to work to build inventories with wholesalers, which have been at low levels. And as Gavin mentioned, we are making progress.
In the U.S., we expect on-premise trends to continue to improve as we lack restrictions in the prior year period. In Canada, we continue to see greater on-premise reopenings bearing by COVID, which should continue to provide positive channel mix. In Europe, the U.K. top line should strongly benefit from the prior year fourth quarter, given the on-premise was fully locked down for November and December of 2020, which are typically strong months given the holidays.
Our guidance also anticipates continued strength in our both premium portfolio, particularly hard seltzers, innovations and imports. Also, we expect continued solid progress against our previously discussed emerging gross revenue goal of $1 billion in annual revenue by 2023, against which we continue to track ahead of plan driven by Zoa, La Colombe and Latin America.
We continue to anticipate underlying EBITDA to be roughly flat compared to 2020 as top line growth is expected to be offset by continued cost inflationary headwinds largely transportation and packaging materials, including aluminum and the Midwest premium and increased marketing investments to deliver against our revitalization plan.
Under the revitalization plan, 2021 has been a year of investment for the company, and we intend to continue to increase marketing investments to build on the strength of our core brands and support successful innovation. As Gavin mentioned, we expect fourth quarter marketing investment to be higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, as we continue to ramp up supply and put commercial pressure to support our big bet brands in both North America and Europe.
We continue to anticipate underlying depreciation and amortization of $800 million, and net interest expense of $270 million, plus or minus 5%. However, due solely to the discrete tax benefit in the third quarter, we have adjusted our effective tax rate range for 2021 only to 13% to 15% from 20% to 23% previously. Also, as a reminder, in 2020, our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $130 million in tax payments from various government-sponsored payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic. We currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due.
Moving to capital allocation. We continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. First, we plan to continue to prudently invest in brewery modernization and production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives, improve efficiencies and advance towards our sustainability goals.
Second, we have a strong desire to maintain and, in time, upgrade our investment grade rating. As such, we expect to continue to improve our net debt position and reaffirm our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.25x by the end of 2021, and below 3x by the end of 2022.
And third, on July 15, our Board of Directors determined to reinstate a quarterly dividend on our Class A and Class B common shares and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share payable on September 17. The Board made the decision to reinstate the dividend at a level that they believe is sustainable and provides room for future increases as business performance improved.
In closing, to be sure we have faced challenges in the quarter, but are proud of our agility and the actions we have taken to manage through them. Through it all, we have continued to successfully execute against our revitalization plan with clear premiumization of our portfolio. And despite all the ups and downs throughout this year, we have reaffirmed our key financial annual guidance yet again.
Like most consumer product companies, we face near-term challenges, but the fundamentals of our business remains strong, and we are confident we are on the right path toward long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth.
So with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

And that's not our expectation this year, and we haven't seen that in October, which is obviously the first month of the fourth quarter. I did cover off in my opening remarks, the challenges that we had with the sales to wholesalers shipments in the third quarter. And that has improved meaningfully in October due to the actions which we took to improve that. And as I said, our distributor inventory levels are approximately 20% higher than they were coming out of the third quarter, which is obviously very helpful from that perspective as well.
Our above premium performance continues to accelerate, whether that's brands like Blue Moon Belgian Whites and Peroni and our seltzer portfolio as well as our emerging growth portfolio. So yes, I think those are the contextual points I would give you.
On the flip side, I'll tell you, at the same time, we do intend to increase marketing spend. I know there's been some conversation about the fact that it's either or. And for us, it's not. It's both and. And we did that in the third quarter. We increased our marketing spend above 2019 levels and above, obviously, 2020, which was -- is an easier comp. And we plan to spend more than 2019 levels in the fourth quarter as well behind the success that we're seeing in many of our brands. So hopefully, that's helpful for you."

And that's why our 2 seltzer brands grew more share than any other major brewer in the third quarter and why we feel so good about those 2 brands.
As far as the overall ITD space is concerned, I mean, obviously, it's an emerging and fast-growing segment. ITD sales already outpaced spirits, and that gap is only going to widen in the future. And competing in this space is a natural fit for us, given that we've got hundreds of years of experience in alcoholic beverages and lots of experience in 12-ounce cans and bottles.

Yes, about 10 years ago. And the objective was they're really there to share the increase in freight and fuel and to eliminate volatility. And we've had years where the freight and fuel surcharge has gone down, for example, the last 2 years. And unfortunately, given the significant challenges that exist in the whole freight and fuel market, it is going to go up meaningfully next year. And yes, it is a cost sharing between ourselves and the distributors. So about -- was 50-50. So I mean it's a cost sharing.
When do we finalize the number? We finalized it at the end of the year and it will apply to the whole for the whole of next year. As far as pricing is concerned, Nadine, that one is a tougher one for me, right? Because obviously, we don't provide guidance on price going forward for obvious reasons. But we closely watch and evaluate our pricing.
We do it on a market-by-market basis. We do it brand by brand to see how it best fits with our brand strength and so on. And obviously, input costs play a role in those decisions. We do have other levers which can help offset inflationary pressures. As Tracey mentioned, one of them moving from truck to rail. We've got our cost savings programs. We have a robust hedging program. Our overall premiumization strategy is driving strong positive mix in our NSR per hectoliter. I think this quarter was the fifth quarter that we've grown that, notwithstanding the significant comp that we had in this space from Q3. And then we've got a variety of revenue management tools. We've spent a long time in the last 6 years since 2015 building revenue management tool capability. And I think we've as well placed in that space as we've been in a long time."

The guidance implies essentially a return to, as I do the math, about 95% of 2019 EBITDA in the quarter, which itself was, I think, a multiyear high.

And getting back to 1 million barrels a week. It was an important milestone for us that -- but just to give you some dimension, that's kind of the level of shipments that we would have as we head into summer. So we're doing a really nice job so far in October of rebuilding our distributor inventory levels and inventory days. And already, many of our SKUs are close to where we would like them to be.
It's not 1 million barrels every single week because obviously, the Thanksgiving, we would shut for Thanksgiving day and there's Christmas Day and so on. So it's not a 1 size fits all for every single week, but that's an important component. From an on-premise point of view, in both -- in all of U.S. and Canada and Europe. I mean, this is performing better than it has in previous quarters.
From an NSR point of view, in the U.S., we're at approximately 85% of 2019 levels in Q3. And in Canada or on-premise restrictions have eased back a lot and volumes are back up to close to 80% of 2019 levels. And as I said, the U.K. and Central Eastern Europe from an NSR point of view, is close to 100% of what it was in 2019. And the fourth quarter last year was a very, very tough comparison for both Canada and for Europe. Our NSR per hectoliter when you compare it to 2019 is going to be meaningfully up because of the premiumization efforts that we've had."

So through the revitalization program, you're clearly doing a lot of the right things and seeing tangible results, which is encouraging, emphasizing beyond beer. I think you said the above premium is now 25% of the portfolio, and that grew nicely in the quarter, which is great. The cross current, of course, is the leverage to economy, which continues to have demand headwinds, Light continues to face demand headwinds. Although to Bryan's question a moment ago, the market share trends with Coors Light have been encouraging.
So years ago, I think the company put a stake in the ground and indicated it could get back to flat volumes in the U.S. I think it's -- the decision was made to kind of subsequently walk back that target. But as we sit here today, what objective measures would you like investors to anchor to in terms of how you're defining success in the U.S. over the next 3 to 5 years?"

And obviously, our revitalization plan, our focus is on revenue, not necessarily volume. And the quality of our revenue and changing the shape of our portfolio is what is important to us now.
So for me, what success looks like over the short, medium and long term is that we're driving sustainable top line revenue growth and at the same time, driving our profits. So it's not an either or for us, it's a both end. And we're going to do that, as I've said, by focusing in on our core so that would be Miller Lite and Coors Light. And we've talked a bit about the success of how we're doing with the Coors Light. And in particular, in Canada and in the U.S. but also our core brands in our European markets.
I mean a real success story for me is what the team have done with Ožujsko in Croatia. It was a brand that was in long-term decline, and they've turned that around and have been growing it nicely behind our increased focus behind core, changing the shape of our portfolio at the above premium levels was our second priority. And the third priority of beyond beer is coupled with above premium, right, because we're only going into above premium beyond beer areas. So whether it's the success of our efforts in seltzers or new brands like Madre and Pravha in Europe or Blue Moon Belgian White and Light Sky in the United States with Zoa and La Colombe.
I'd like to see the shape of our above premium portfolio to obviously be bigger than 25%. We've got an internal goal yet, which we haven't shared externally. But obviously, we would like to see that grow to a higher level. So at its highest level, top line, bottom line, sustainable growth and a changed portfolio shape defined success for us, Kevin.
Given everything that we've experienced over the last 2 years, I'm very pleased with the progress that the team has made overall against our revitalization plan. If you you'd ask me if I would be happy, we are where we are in the sort of first months of the gloom of the pandemic, I would have taken it in the heat beat, and we're in a good place."

From an individual performance point of view, we're not going to break out every single volume element of our above premium portfolio. But we've got real pockets of strength and growth in our Latin American business, which is above premium. Sometimes that can be -- it depends whether it's export or license. Certainly, export is performing particularly well for us.
Zoa is -- and our non-alc space is also relatively low base. So a large chunk of that 2 million cases is all incremental, which still relatively small, but growing particularly strongly Kaumil. From a Yuengling point of view, from a third quarter point of view, it was really just in the market for months, right?

It's following a recent line of questioning just around the economy SKUs and how you see the mix of the portfolio evolving over time and the focus on value over volume and how that can play out in the near term.
I guess if you look at your portfolio today and you think about your aspirations for the go forward on getting to a volume growth basis, do you still see aspects of your portfolio, which you potentially need to improve? And I suppose there always are these opportunities, but maybe more strategically. And then if that is the case, do you see the premiumization strategy over time as enough to offset some of these decisions and then it's all sort of connected to the volume dynamic, but the share gains are well taken in some of your most important brands.
But I guess the other side of that is just the categories have been under pressure, tough comps, and there are other aspects that are in play there. But do you have any view on where you kind of see category growth going forward?
I know it's not something that you can necessarily control, but that is an important dynamic here. So if I put all that together, there's this dynamic around the portfolio, how you see it today. But as premiums issued could be enough to offset future decisions and just maybe your latest thoughts on the category, the categories which you play would be helpful."

We've long said that we believe all segments all matter to our consumers and the decisions we've made around our economy portfolio are not meant to change that view. So we still have 4 key brands in that -- 4 key economy brands in that space that we're focusing on like Keystone Light, Miller High Life Steel Reserve Alloy and the Tiki series and [indiscernible] and we will continue to focus on those brands and having reduced so much complexity out of the economy portfolio.
It's allowing both ourselves and our distributors to really hone in and focus on performing very well with those 4 key brands in the economy space. From an overall segment point of view, we believe that seltzers are here to stay. We believe that there is growth to be had in seltzers. We believe that there is strong growth for us in the beyond beer space.
We recognize the need to offer products beyond traditional beer, and that's why we're putting so much so much focus on that. We believe that innovation and great innovation around beer and around seltzers will add value to both the category and ourselves over the next 3 years, and that's why we're putting so much emphasis on a really tight and focused innovation portfolio.
Remember, Chris, that our focus is not so much volumes, right? It's really about driving revenue and value, and that's what we're doing. So I wouldn't expect our volumes to be positive necessarily because of the actions that we've taken in the economy portfolio. But we think they're right. And then I think to address your other questions. We don't have any plans to do any more big moves in our economy space. We went as deep as we believe is necessary.

Because we do continue to see strong performance from Vizzy. There's lots of distribution runway available for it. It's holding firm as the #4 brand in the space. Topo Chico continues to deliver. It's currently in just 16 markets. And remains the fastest turning brand in Texas, the third fastest turning brand nationally. And we believe there's a very strong opportunity for seltzers to bring Latino drinkers into the space because they're relatively under shared. And we think that Topo Chico plays really, really well into that space given the data that we have. So I think the key for us is differentiation. We've been preaching it for a while now, Brett, we wouldn't have been as successful as we have been in the seltzer space. If our brands weren't differentiated, if there was just a me-too with what was there.
And so the brands that we brought are differentiated, that are fast moving, and we have real differentiated innovation coming behind both of those brands in the new year. So we think there is lots of upside for our portfolio in this space. And as I said, we also believe that this is a big segment that is going to be here to stay.
