I hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. I'll begin this morning with a review of Baxter's fourth quarter performance and some perspective on 2020 as a whole. Jay",1158,"Thank you, Clare, and thank you for everyone joining today's call. I hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. I'll begin this morning with a review of Baxter's fourth quarter performance and some perspective on 2020 as a whole. Jay will provide additional details on the financials, including our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2021. Then we will close with Q&A. Obviously, it is impossible to frame this year's performance without reference to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This has been a year like no other, and I once again want to acknowledge the health care providers, first responders, caregivers, researchers and, of course, patients who are on the front lines of this daily struggle. And I'm deeply grateful to my Baxter colleagues who continue to make a difference, not only battling COVID-19, but across all of the acute and chronic conditions addressed by our broad portfolio.
In the spirit of our mission, we've partnered with 3 companies to manufacture selected COVID-19 vaccines through our Baxter biopharma Solutions business. We're privileged to work alongside these companies and proud to bring our leading-edge contract manufacturing capabilities to the fight against this pandemic.
Our results in 2020 demonstrate our commitment to driving performance and reflect the diversity and durability of our portfolio amid these challenging market conditions. Baxter delivered fourth quarter reported sales growth of 5%, 3% at constant currency rates and 2% operation. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, down 18% year-over-year, reflecting a challenging comparison to the prior year quarter, our strongest quarter since the back of is in line, as well as the ongoing impact of the pandemic on our business. 
Geographically, growth was led by our Asia Pacific segment, which was up 8% at constant currency rates. This reflects the region's overall momentum and leadership in pandemic containment and recovery. Fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth was 5% for EMEA and flat in the Americas, also at constant rates. 4 of our 6 GBUs grew for the quarter at constant rates. Unless otherwise noted, all sales growth figures discussed are compared to the prior year period at constant currency rates. 
Growth was led by acute therapies at 50%. This reflects sustained higher demand for continuous Renal Replacement Therapy, or CRRT, products used in the treatment of COVID-19. Our Renal care business delivered mid single-digit growth for the quarter, driven by ongoing strength parton dialysis therapies particularly in the U.S. 
During the quarter, we announced FDA authorization of our Homechoice Claria APD cycler which features Sharesource, the only to a remote patient management platform for PD patients in the U.S. This new cycle option alongside Amia supports our ability to expand excess the home-based therapy as the new CMS and stage renal disease treatment choices or ETC payment model takes effect this year. While the impact of COVID has been more muted on Baxter's Renal care business, overall ESRD patient volumes in 2020 have been depressed by COVID as this patient population is experiencing a higher mortality rate and the incidence of new patient diagnosis is slow.
As the leading home therapies, we have launched a global campaign safer home, designed to educate clinicians and patients around the world about the benefits of peritoneal dialysis therapy and increased awareness of alternatives to e-center hemodialysis treatment.
As a result, we expect home therapies growth to continue to outpace that of overall ESRD growth. Clinical Nutrition also grew mid-single digits, reflecting the benefit of the new product launches, enhanced commercial execution, competitive dynamics in the U.S. and advance for nutrition products as part of COVID-19 patient treatment. Advanced Surgery group at 10%, benefiting from the impact of our early 2020 Seprafilm acquisition, adjusting for the acquisition and foreign exchange, advanced surgery declined low single digits operationally year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing lower rate of surgical procedures globally amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Sales in our Medication Delivery and Pharmaceuticals businesses both declined mid-single digits, reflecting lower rates of hospital admissions versus pre-COVID levels. Declines in admissions were partially offset by increased utilization and stocking of a range of products used in treating COVID-19 patients including certain presentations of our large volume of rentals, mini banks and select generic injectable pharmaceuticals. 
Shifting perspective to full year 2020. Baxter achieved sales growth of 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis and 2% operation. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $3.09, declining 7% versus 2019. The essential nature of our portfolio has long been fundamental to our business model and mission to save and sustain lives. This certainly proved essential to our overall 2020 results. While utilization of certain products and therapies declined in light of endemic conditions, it's surged in others, none more so than our acute therapies portfolio as well as a range of other products across our GBUs. 
These products merged at the core of pandemic care and end demand grows to record levels, we invested as necessary to help increase the flow of these products to the patients and clinicians who were rely on this globally. 
Amid the unpredictability of 2020, we remained focused on our strategic objectives, which include advancing health care innovation, delivering value to all its stakeholders. You can see many highlights in today's press release.
And this is not changing as we seize the opportunities in 2021 and beyond. The global launch of our leading-edge NOVUM IQ infusion platform achieved key milestones at the end of 2020 with CE market in Europe and Health Canada, too. And we are on track to submit our 510(k) application to FDA by the close of the first quarter. Plus our new product pipeline includes additional generic injectables and the next-generation of our market-leading Prismax technology, among other highlights. In addition, we will continue pursuing attractive business development and licensing opportunities in line with our core portfolio in key adjacencies. 
To the extent we don't find opportunities that meet our disciplined strategic and financial criteria, we will return value to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Baxter's momentum is also evident in other ways, like our growing Net Promoter Scores globally demonstrating the strength of our customer relationships and laying the groundwork for expanding opportunities.
And it can be seen in our wide-ranging ESG recognition, which reflects our standing as a good corporate citizen and an employer of choice for top talent. That's why I remain optimistic about our future, Baxter transformation, now entering its sixth year has been far more than strengthen our financial performance.
It has strengthened our agility, adaptability, genius and tenacity. These attributes alongside our enduring mission and essential portfolio have been key to navigating today's uncertainty. They will remain at the heart of driving value for patients, clinicians and shareholders as the global health care landscape continues evolving rapidly. 
Now I will pass it on to Jay, who will take a closer look at our financial performance and outlook for 2021."
254571,699514627,2191677,"Baxter International Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the durability of our portfolio and adaptability of our employees and operations to deliver on our mission.

As Joe mentioned, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the durability of our portfolio and adaptability of our employees and operations to deliver on our mission. Although 2020 presented some unique challenges, we remain focused on accelerating top line growth through continued execution on new product launches, market development initiatives and partnerships and strategic business development.
And we are committed to driving improvement in operating margins with particular emphasis on gross margin expansion. To that extent, we've established a similar program to what was put in place to transform and optimize our operating expenses. We expect to begin recognizing benefits from this program in 2021 and beyond.
Our current plan is to provide our new long-term financial outlook in the fall of this year. We're targeting September 20 to host an person investor conference but will pivot to virtual if necessary.
Turning to our fourth quarter 2020 results. Global sales of $3.2 billion advanced 5% on a reported basis, 3% on a constant currency basis and 2% on an operational basis, despite the surge in cases of COVID around the globe and in the face of our most challenging comparison to the prior year period.
We estimate COVID negatively impacted net revenues by over $100 million in the quarter. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings declined 18% to $0.80 per share as the negative impact from COVID on our businesses as well as higher interest expense and tax rate more than offset operational growth in the quarter. 
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and global business units. Starting with our 3 regional segments. Sales in Americas were flat on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on an operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa advanced 5% on both a constant currency and operational basis and sales in our Asia Pacific region advanced 8% on a constant currency basis and 6% operationally.
Moving on to performance by Global business units. Note that for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses with the exception of our Advanced Surgery business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusting for the acquisition of Seprafilm.
Global sales for Renal care were $1 billion, advancing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in both our PD and HD businesses. PD benefited from mid-single-digit patient growth in the U.S. and APAC regions. As Joe referenced, the pandemic has clearly reinforced the advantages of home-based PD treatment and the implementation of the new CMSCTC payment model this year will further accelerate the shift of care to the home for ESRD patients in the U.S. 
Sales in medication delivery of $753 million declined 3% on a constant currency basis. As Joe mentioned, hospitalization rates remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels impacting our medication delivery business. This pressure was partially offset by increased demand for IV solutions in the U.S. related to COVID Care protocols and a government stockpile order. 
Internationally, we continue to see growth within our Infusion Systems business led by increased placements of our EVOIQ pump platform, and we look forward to building further momentum in 2021. As a reminder, this quarter represented a challenging comparison as growth in medication delivery advanced 19% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Pharmaceutical sales of $571 million declined 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting ongoing pressure from lower hospitalization rates. Additionally, we continue to experience lower demand for our inhaled anesthesia products globally. These declines were partially offset by increased demand for our international pharmacy compounding business.
Moving to Nutrition. Total sales were $246 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Strong performance in the quarter was driven by the benefit of recent new product launches, competitor shortages in amino acids and demand for certain products used in the treatment of COVID patients as well as enhanced commercial execution, notably in our EMEA region.
Sales in advanced surgery were $260 million, advancing 10% on a constant currency basis and declining 2% on an operational basis. The acquisition of Seprafilm in February contributed approximately $30 million of sales in the quarter, while globally, surgical procedures remain below pre COVID levels. We did see improvement in the U.S. and estimate that for the fourth quarter, surgical procedures were flat to pre-COVID levels above our prior expectation of mid- single digit declines. Also, as a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from select competitive shortages that did not repeat in 2020.
Sales in our acute Therapies business were $221 million, representing growth of 50% on a constant currency basis, driven by ongoing COVID-related demand as the acuity of cases remained high during the fourth quarter.
Finally, sales in our other category, which primarily includes our contract manufacturing services, were $117 million in the quarter, declining 4% on a constant currency basis. Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 41.4% declined by 430 basis points over the prior year, driven by lower sales of higher-margin products, increased operations expenses related to COVID and unfavorable manufacturing variances due to lower production volumes.
Adjusted SG&A of $622 million declined 1% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a reduction of discretionary spending related to COVID restrictions, lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $132 million declined 14% on a reported basis, reflecting our continued efforts to enhance our processes and optimize our R&D organization, along with reductions in discretionary spend due to COVID. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17.7%, a  decrease of 230 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the factors I just discussed. Net interest expense was $38 million in the quarter, an increase of $18 million compared to the prior year, driven by increased interest expense from higher outstanding debt balances as well as decreased interest income due to lower interest rates.
Other adjusted nonoperating expense totaled $5 million in the quarter compared to $16 million of income in the prior year period. This includes increased expenses related to foreign exchange and reduced pension benefits as compared to the prior year period.
The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 20.2%, above our expectations, driven primarily by the mix of earnings in the quarter. Turning to the full year 2020. Sales of $11.7 billion increased by 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis and 2% on an operational basis.
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings decreased 7% to $3.09 per diluted share. On a full year basis, we generated free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. This represents a decrease of $250 million versus the prior year period, in part related to carrying higher inventory levels for pandemic preparedness as well as the impact from settlement of all outstanding interest rate derivative contracts. 
As of the end of the year, we had approximately $3.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, along with $6.2 billion of long-term indebtedness. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $500 million or 6.3 million shares of common stock. And over the course of the year, deployed approximately $500 million to inorganic business development opportunities. We'll continue to balance our investments across organic and inorganic initiatives to fuel our growth and drive margin expansion.
Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021. For the full year 2021, we expect global growth of 7% to 8% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis. I would like to point out the key assumptions reflected in our full year sales outlook, which include approximately 300 basis points of foreign exchange impact.
Our current expectation is that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates and surgical procedures are going to remain below pre COVID levels, roughly down mid-single digits for the year. Our expectation is that rates will improve sequentially throughout the year to exit Q4 with admissions down slightly and procedures roughly flat.
Moving down the P&L. We anticipate adjusted operating margin to expand between 20 to 50 basis points, reflecting the continued impact from COVID on our business. This impact will be most notable during the first half of the year and then ease as the year progresses.
For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 18.5% and a full year diluted average share count between the range of 510 million to 515 million shares. This share count reflects the fourth quarter repurchases and assume that any additional repurchases are only undertaken to offset dilution.
Based on these factors, we expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.35 to $3.43 per diluted share. Specific to the first quarter of 2021, we expect growth of approximately 3% on a reported basis and sales to decline low single digits on a constant currency basis. 
We expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.63 to $0.65 per diluted share. With that, we can now open the call for Q&A."

So Vijay, in terms of growth in Q1, obviously, the key factor that's in play is we had an incredibly strong Q1 of last year. And so we exceeded our expectations. And frankly, it was really some -- there was certainly some pre-buying related to COVID, but also strength across the portfolio. So as we think about the sequencing, our most challenging comp is in the first quarter, and we expect the lowest level of performance. And it really is in those areas that are primarily impacted by COVID.
Obviously, Q2 and Q3 have much easier comps, so we will start to see some nice growth there. And then we do expect to close the year with some growth against what is a fairly challenging comp given the strong performance in Q1. The guidance of 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis includes $50 million to $100 million of improvement related to COVID.
So we are still expecting relative to normalized levels very substantial COVID impact. So that will abate over time. And certainly, in the second half, it will be better than the first. But we'll see -- we're expecting to see about $50 million to $100 million of improvement. So really, that's the story on the overall guidance from a sales perspective."

Overall, margin improvement is a crucial part of our long-term focus and the long-term story of the company. So we are very focused on this. You heard in my prepared remarks, some comments in terms of implementing now gross margin improvements in similar ways using a similar methodology to what we applied to operating expenses over the last several years. With the new leader for our manufacturing area coming in, Jim Borse, we're incredibly excited about our opportunity to drive gross margin. But there are some peculiarities that you have to think about with respect to 2021. While from a manufacturing standpoint, we're expecting maybe 150 basis points of improvement as some of these COVID costs abate. We also have an OpEx normalization that we have to contend with. 
And what I mean by that is things like travel, the bonus pool, discretionary spending, we -- all of those were sources of savings in 2020. and those pools are rebuilt in 2021 as we start to look at accelerating growth for the long term. So that's roughly 100 basis points of headwind as we look at 2021. 
And then I would add to that, while the FX environment from a sales standpoint is favorable, that's roughly 30 basis points of headwind as we approach next year on the operating margin line. So you put those items together, along with our continued normal focus on operating improvement and you land where we are with respect to the guidance that we shared. What I will tell you is it really is a very different story, first half to second half. In the first half, we have some continued COVID costs. We have some continued rollout of manufacturing impact, and we have a lower revenue base.
What happens in the second half is we have a larger revenue base in place. We're able to -- most of the COVID costs are gone by the second half. And then finally, we will start to see and expect to see some of the improvements that Jim and his team are addressing, they accrue more to the second half.  So I think as we get to Q3, Q4, you'll see margins that you're more normally used to seeing. In the first half of the year, it will be a bit lower than what we've typically seen in the past. 
So -- but again, the core part of the story, we are very focused on this particular area, and it's a long-term valuation driver for us."

Obviously, that is, as I said to Vijay, our most challenging quarter of the year. And it's really challenging across the board, although I will say that we do expect to see continued performance in acute in the first quarter before that becomes a very challenging comp in the future. As we move on to Q2 and Q3, the growth rate is much higher. Q2 was, I believe, one of the only quarters, if the only we declined this year. And so from a comp standpoint, while we still expect to have an impact on both admissions and procedures in the second quarter, we do see -- we'll see a strong growth quarter in the second quarter and third quarter on the back of easy comps related to COVID impacts. 
And then in the fourth quarter, our current thinking is sort of lower single digit, but growth nonetheless, in large part, driven by the strength in portfolio, some of the launch is starting to impact sales in the fourth quarter. So those are some of the drivers there. From a business unit standpoint, renal, generally speaking, is steady.
Our acute business will face severe challenges beginning in Q2, as you would expect. Medication delivery has easier comps from Q2 to Q4. So we'll see some nice growth in that category. Our pharmaceuticals business also, which has been impacted by COVID fairly substantially, will have a challenging Q1, but then again, growth beyond that. Nutrition overall, we've seen a solid performance in nutrition, proud of the progress there, that will continue although there is an easy comp in the second quarter.
And then advanced surgery will behave like a lot of the discretionary procedure businesses that you're familiar with. Now what I will say is all of this is underlined by our market assumptions on COVID. And so there's a lot of optimism lately in terms of patient trends and so on, and we're certainly excited about that and the impact of vaccines as we move forward.
But the way we see it, Q1, we expect to be down relative to pre COVID levels from a hospital census standpoint, double digits from a surgical procedure standpoint, mid-single. Q2 starts to improve so you'll see sort of mid-single in census or high single-digit in hospital census. And then surgical procedures improved from the mid-single digits.
And then Q3, Q4, much more normal. So really, that's a crucial underlying assumption for us. If that plays out as is, guidance should be solid. But again, a lot of variables in play here that we have to contend with."

Listen, the pipeline that we have get disrupted in 2020, but we feel that we have momentum coming into 2021 and 2022. If you think about DTC, we believe that PD as a category will be a high single-digit growth, which is probably 300 to 400 basis points above the market growth of the SRD. Baxter is well positioned to capitalize on that. We do have investments. We made investments in capacity. And we are prepared to support the growth.
As a matter of fact, we have to anticipate some capacity investments because the growth of the category has surpassed our expectations. So even in a COVID year like 2020, we saw growth in that category. So that is one of the drivers. The other one audience that you mentioned is the pump. We're all excited about it. But I don't speak on behalf of agencies across the globe.
We are filing with the FDA, hopefully, by the end of the first quarter as we prepare the documentation. We have worked collaboratively. I don't speak on behalf of the agency. I can't predict what the agency is going to do. On our side, that we control, we will do the best we can to have this all filed. 
And if we need to make adjustments across the globe and other finance, we will we -- we're confident that we can launch the NOVUM in 2021. It's a new platform. It's an open architecture platform and we have great hopes for this product. 
We also have new pharmaceutical molecules. They are launching this year, but just going back and looking at the launch of mix revenue was impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. We think that with the exit momentum of December, November and December, we see this molecule gaining momentum. We have a lot of new accounts signed up. So I think we're getting there, and we are in place right now that we don't speak about cyclophosphamide anymore.
So we were able to do what we wanted to do, which is to change the mix of the pharmaceutical business. That is one that we continue to invest organic and inorganically as well. I think a couple of other things, if I think about the P&L, the gross margin improvement, driven by supply chain is one that we focus. Jay has spoken about our digital transformation, which will affect our G&A and how we do business.
And also, I think the cash in the balance sheet is a great advantage to us, either on the M&A point of view with these multi kids or perhaps large ones. If nothing comes about the large ones, we will return the money to the shareholders, creating value as well. So I think altogether shows a good bet of optimism and success for Baxter."

So Joanne, thanks for the question. The -- as we think about the 2 categories, hospital census and surgical volumes, we really make our comparisons to pre-COVID levels. And so if we think about the fourth quarter of 2020 our hospital census, as we see it, was roughly down 10%. And our surgical volumes was roughly flat as there was some pent-up demand that was capitalized on in the fourth quarter of this year.
Now as we move to 2021, our assumptions are roughly hospital census continues to be down in the first quarter, double digits relative to those pre-COVID levels and it ends the year at down roughly 3%. And that's our current working assumption. But it's an important driver for us, Joanne, and we'll watch that very carefully during the course of the year. And it's a fairly linear improvement over the course of the year. So on a full year basis, relative to pre COVID levels, were down mid-single digits on the census standpoint. From a surgical volume standpoint, our sense is Q4 did benefit from some pent-up demand. So in Q1, we are expecting a decline relative to pre-COVID levels in the mid-single digits range. And then it improves from there.
And by Q4, we're assuming down a couple of percent, relative to pre-COVID levels. So this is -- we expect surgical volumes to perform a little bit better than general hospital census on a full year basis.
So that's our current assumptions. We'll update that every quarter. It's something that we're very focused on as it is an important driver of our overall sales volumes."

So -- but we have an idea of what is the replacement rates on the marketplace. We also understand the frustration of some of the customers who have competitive product on the aging of the platform.
So we think we put our plans based on that. I think there were some stockpiling in terms of pumps in some parts of the world. But the cycle to replace old platforms, either 7, 8 or 9 years, depends upon how a hospital sees that is still there. So I believe that our new pump will create the momentum and the impetus, perhaps for a hospital to look at that.
We do have the plans. We're not going to speak about the plans, but we do have the plans. But more importantly, we do not promote the product prior to its approval."

Maybe I misremembering there, but just wanted to make sure that everything is on track there and what else you need to do before you refile? 
And then the other question I wanted to ask was a little bit longer term, it's a COVID related question. And the question is, when you think about your core markets are there any that you think are now because of COVID, a little structurally weaker due to either pricing or changes in how care will be delivered going forward?

We have plans and everything is in place to execute this by the end in Q1. We were more hopeful in part the second -- third quarter last year to submit faster. But I think it's slowing down to speed up was wise decision by Baxter.
We had contact with the FDA, and that contact has been very collaborative to the point that we understood some of the things that we had to prepare in more detail. So instead of rushing to get something in, we work with the agency and continue to very collaboratively. So we have what is needed for them to evaluate the pump. 
So every time that I think about of any plans in the future, like this submission is I'm very, very optimistic, and I have the confirmation from our executives that this is going to happen. But I always say, hopefully, because I think things happen that we don't anticipate. But at this moment, I don't see anything that would prevent us from  a filing this at the end of the first quarter. I want to make sure that, that's clear. 
On your other question on COVID, there are structural changes in the market, primarily how people see care. But more importantly is how long is this COVID pandemic and preventive matters will stick with us and how long the herding unit would take us to get a herding unit and people feel more comfortable doing things differently. 
I think there's a huge adaptability that we're seeing hospitals have these separate awards. And we believe that there are some changes in how people consult with the primary care physicians. People who have cancer, unfortunately need infusion. They need infusion, they either needed to do an infusion center and they need to go home and have it then in a place that is safe.
People who need surgery, they will need to have the surgery, no matter what, otherwise, they go in and they're sicker later. People who need to be admitted because they have issues, they need to -- so I believe that the return of the pre COVID will happen with changes in technology that will allow for better triage. I want to point to the home because this is a part that people sometimes are forgetting.
We look a lot of that acute side, but their home treatments are the ones that I think will gain prevalence and we'll gain preference. And Baxter, being a home care company in the ESRD space plays well for our PD business. And we've seen that even with the issues that we saw in 2020 with reduction in patient census, we still see momentum of that therapy mode, and we are very focused on that. 
So that is the momentum that has shifted. When it got to Baxter, the growth of PD was the ESRD or lower in most places in the world. And today, I see the reversing. And I think COVID is enough formation, those changes are ahead."

As we look at the mix, and hang on one second here. As we look at the mix between gross and operating margin, you're right, roughly the gross margin we're looking at in the 44% range and then on the way to the operating margin that we've identified. And really what's going to happen is it is a story of 2 different halves. Specifically, in the first half of the year, we still have some COVID costs we still have the rollout of some manufacturing variations from Q4, hitting the first quarter and some into the second quarter.
And so -- and then finally, we also have a lower sales level, generally speaking, which isn't good for sort of positive manufacturing variations. So all those things negatively impact the first half of the year. And so we will see a fairly substantial step-up to that from below kind of that average level to something above it in the second half of the year. And then the same story holds true on operating margin. 
We'll start to see some real leverage on SG&A in the second half of the year, in part as we get the incremental sales, but also at some of the savings initiatives from the digital transformation start to play out into our numbers. So it really is a story of 2 halves in terms of margin improvement. As we look longer-term about comparisons to prior years and so on, I think that -- as I said, you'll get close from a gross margin standpoint by the end of this year to the pre COVID levels. And then we'll share some more guidance on long-term expectations when we get it together in September. But core to our story and core to our focus is this idea that we want to be more efficient and we intend to be more efficient, in particular, on the gross margin line for the coming years. It's an important part of our valuation."

So all in all, 2021 is a rebound year, fully realizing growth in 2022. Second, on your question on mortality, it is -- we saw increase in mortality due to the situation of COVID. As that ameliorates into 2021, we probably should see the reversal of that.

And how do you get PDs and insertion of a catheter, that surgery, and people have to go to the hospital. 
Despite the fact the association said that to be a an emergency surgery, some people just did not have the capacity to do it or did not have the time to go into a hospital cue to get it done. So I think Q4 was depressed by the pandemic to                 . How do we see the mix shift going into 2021 as you become -- as the cases go down, vaccination becomes more credible, primarily on people who are highly at risk like patients in the SRT, and you see all the product costs from the CDC to vaccinate folks like that first. 
So you will see probably these folks going back, the people going back into PD modality into 2021, like I answered today that we see a rebound in 2021 with full realization of that in 2022. And this is what our forecast, our viewing there is that this is 300 to 400 basis points above the ESRD average PD. So it is -- we're starting to see growth.

Second is to develop a cycle, which is globally nature and more affordable. So that is something that we'll provide to our customers on a global basis. If you think about automatically -- automatic PD is only done in countries which have higher income per capita. And so -- but the incidence is actually not only in those countries across the globe.

But we can make it, we've proven, and we will activate when we think this best."

I hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. I'll begin this morning with a review of Baxter's fourth quarter performance and some perspective on 2020 as a whole. Jay",1155,"Thank you, Clare, and thank you for everyone joining today's call. I hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. I'll begin this morning with a review of Baxter's fourth quarter performance and some perspective on 2020 as a whole. Jay will provide additional details on the financials, including our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021. Then we will close with Q&A. 
Obviously, it is impossible to frame this year's performance without reference to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been a year like no other, and I once again want to acknowledge the health care providers, first responders, caregivers, researchers and, of course, patients who are on the front lines of this daily struggle. And I'm deeply grateful to my Baxter colleagues who continue to make a difference, not only battling COVID-19, but across all of the acute and chronic conditions addressed by our broad portfolio. 
In the spirit of our mission, we've partnered with 3 companies to manufacture selected COVID-19 vaccines through our Baxter BioPharma Solutions business. We're privileged to work alongside these companies and proud to bring our leading-edge contract manufacturing capabilities to the fight against this pandemic. 
Our results in 2020 demonstrate our commitment to driving performance and reflect the diversity and durability of our portfolio amid these challenging market conditions. Baxter delivered fourth quarter reported sales growth of 5%, 3% at constant currency rates and 2% operation. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, down 18% year-over-year, reflecting a challenging comparison to the prior year quarter, our strongest quarter since the Baxalta spin-off as well as the ongoing impact of the pandemic on our business.  
Geographically, growth was led by our Asia Pacific segment, which was up 8% at constant currency rates. This reflects the region's overall momentum and leadership in pandemic containment and recovery. Fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth was 5% for EMEA and flat in the Americas, also at constant rates. 4 of our 6 GBUs grew for the quarter at constant rates, unless otherwise noted, all sales growth figures discussed are compared to the prior year period at constant currency rates. Growth was led by Acute Therapies at 50%. This reflects sustained higher demand for continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT, products used in the treatment of COVID-19. 
Our Renal Care business delivered mid single-digit growth for the quarter, driven by ongoing strength for peritoneal dialysis therapies, particularly in the U.S. During the quarter, we announced FDA authorization of our Homechoice Claria APD cycler which features Sharesource, the only two-way remote patient management platform for PD patients in the U.S. This new cycler option alongside AMIA supports our ability to expand accessibility to home-based therapy as the new CMS end-stage renal disease treatment choices or ETC payment model takes effect this year. 
While the impact of COVID has been more muted on Baxter's Renal Care business, overall ESRD patient volumes in 2020 have been depressed by COVID as this patient population is experiencing a higher mortality rate and the incidence of new patient diagnosis is slow. 
As the leader in home therapies, we have launched a global campaign Safer at Home, designed to educate clinicians and patients around the world about the benefits of peritoneal dialysis therapy and increased awareness of alternatives to in-center hemodialysis treatment. As a result, we expect home therapies growth to continue to outpace that of overall ESRD growth. 
Clinical Nutrition also grew mid-single digits, reflecting the benefit of the new product launches, enhanced commercial execution, competitive dynamics in U.S. and the demand for nutrition products as part of COVID-19 patient treatment. 
Advanced Surgery grew at 10%, benefiting from the impact of our early 2020 Seprafilm acquisition. Adjusting for the acquisition and foreign exchange, Advanced Surgery declined low single digits operationally year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing lower rate of surgical procedures globally amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Sales in our Medication Delivery and Pharmaceuticals businesses both declined mid-single digits, reflecting lower rates of hospital admissions versus pre-COVID levels. Declines in admissions were partially offset by increased utilization and stocking of a range of products used in treating COVID-19 patients, including certain presentations of our large volume parenterals, Mini-bags and select generic injectable pharmaceuticals.  
Shifting perspective to full year 2020. Baxter achieved sales growth of 3% on both the reported and constant currency basis and 2% operation. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share were $3.09, declining 7% versus 2019. 
The essential nature of our portfolio has long been fundamental to our business model and mission to save and sustain lives. This certainly proved essential to our overall 2020 results, while utilization of certain products and therapies declined in light of pandemic conditions. It surged in others, none more so than our Acute Therapies portfolio as well as a range of other products across our GBUs. These products emerged at the core of pandemic care. And as demand grows to record levels, we invested as necessary to help increase the flow of these products to the patients and clinicians who will rely on this globally.  
Amid the unpredictability of 2020, we remained focused on our strategic objectives, which include advancing health care innovation, delivering value to all its stakeholders. You can see many highlights in today's press release. And this is not changing as we seize the opportunities in 2021 and beyond. The global launch of our leading-edge NOVUM IQ infusion platform achieved key milestones at the end of 2020 with CE marking in Europe and Health Canada approval. And we are on track to resubmit our 510(k) application to FDA by the close of the first quarter. Plus our new product pipeline includes additional generic injectables and the next-generation of our market-leading PrisMax technology among other highlights. 
In addition, we will continue pursuing attractive business development and licensing opportunities in line with our core portfolio in key adjacencies. To the extent we don't find opportunities that meet our disciplined strategic and financial criteria, we will return value to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
Baxter's momentum is also evident in other ways, like our growing Net Promoter Scores globally demonstrating the strength of our customer relationships and laying the groundwork for expanding opportunities. And it can be seen in our wide-ranging ESG recognition, which reflects our standing as a good corporate citizen and an employer of choice for top talent. That's why I remain optimistic about our future. 
Baxter transformation, now entering its sixth year, has done far more than strengthen our financial performance. It has strengthened our agility, adaptability, resilience and tenacity. These attributes alongside our enduring mission and essential portfolio have been key to navigating today's uncertainty. They will remain at the heart of driving value for patients, clinicians and shareholders as the global health care landscape continues evolving rapidly.  
Now I will pass it on to Jay, who will take a closer look at our financial performance and outlook for 2021."
254571,699514627,2192051,"Baxter International Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the durability of our portfolio and adaptability of our employees and operations to deliver on our mission. Although 2020 presented some unique challenges,",1526,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, our fourth quarter results demonstrate the durability of our portfolio and adaptability of our employees and operations to deliver on our mission. 
Although 2020 presented some unique challenges, we remain focused on accelerating top line growth through continued execution on new product launches, market development initiatives and partnerships and strategic business development. And we are committed to driving improvement in operating margins with particular emphasis on gross margin expansion. 
To that extent, we've established a similar program to what was put in place to transform and optimize our operating expenses. We expect to begin recognizing benefits from this program in 2021 and beyond. 
Our current plan is to provide our new long-term financial outlook in the fall of this year. We're targeting September 20 to host an in-person investor conference but will pivot to virtual if necessary. 
Turning to our fourth quarter 2020 results. Global sales of $3.2 billion advanced 5% on a reported basis, 3% on a constant currency basis and 2% on an operational basis, despite the surge in cases of COVID around the globe and in the face of our most challenging comparison to the prior year period. 
We estimate COVID negatively impacted net revenues by over $100 million in the quarter. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings declined 18% to $0.80 per share as the negative impact from COVID on our businesses as well as higher interest expense and tax rate more than offset operational growth in the quarter. 
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and global business units. Starting with our 3 regional segments. Sales in Americas were flat on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on an operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa advanced 5% on both a constant currency and operational basis. And sales in our Asia Pacific region advanced 8% on a constant currency basis and 6% operationally. 
Moving on to performance by global business units. Note that for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses with the exception of our Advanced Surgery business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusting for the acquisition of Seprafilm. 
Global sales for Renal Care were $1 billion, advancing 4% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in both our PD and HD businesses. PD benefited from mid-single-digit patient growth in the U.S. and APAC regions. As Joe referenced, the pandemic has clearly reinforced the advantages of home-based PD treatment and the implementation of the new CMS ETC payment model this year will further accelerate the shift of care to the home for ESRD patients in the U.S. 
Sales in Medication Delivery of $753 million declined 3% on a constant currency basis. As Joe mentioned, hospitalization rates remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels, impacting our Medication Delivery business. This pressure was partially offset by increased demand for IV solutions in the U.S. related to COVID care protocols and a government stockpile order. Internationally, we continue to see growth within our Infusion Systems business led by increased placements of our Evo IQ pump platform, and we look forward to building further momentum in 2021. As a reminder, this quarter represented a challenging comparison as growth in Medication Delivery advanced 19% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Pharmaceutical sales of $571 million declined 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting ongoing pressure from lower hospitalization rates. Additionally, we continue to experience lower demand for our inhaled anesthesia products globally. These declines were partially offset by increased demand for our international pharmacy compounding business. 
Moving to Nutrition. Total sales were $246 million, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis. Strong performance in the quarter was driven by the benefit of recent new product launches, competitor shortages in amino acids and demand for certain products used in the treatment of COVID patients as well as enhanced commercial execution, notably in our EMEA region. 
Sales in Advanced Surgery were $260 million, advancing 10% on a constant currency basis and declining 2% on an operational basis. The acquisition of Seprafilm in February contributed approximately $30 million of sales in the quarter, while globally, surgical procedures remain below pre-COVID levels. We did see improvement in the U.S. and estimate that for the fourth quarter, surgical procedures were flat to pre-COVID levels above our prior expectation of mid-single declines. Also, as a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from select competitive shortages that did not repeat in 2020. 
Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $221 million, representing growth of 50% on a constant currency basis, driven by ongoing COVID-related demand as the acuity of cases remained high during the fourth quarter. 
Finally, sales in our other category, which primarily includes our contract manufacturing services, were $117 million in the quarter, declining 4% on a constant currency basis. 
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 41.4% declined by 430 basis points over the prior year, driven by lower sales of higher-margin products, increased operations expenses related to COVID and unfavorable manufacturing variances due to lower production volumes. 
Adjusted SG&A of $622 million declined 1% on a year-over-year basis, driven by a reduction of discretionary spending related to COVID restrictions, lower bonus accruals under our annual employee incentive compensation plans.  
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $132 million declined 14% on a reported basis, reflecting our continued efforts to enhance our processes and optimize our R&D organization, along with reductions in discretionary spend due to COVID. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17.7%, a  decrease of 230 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the factors I just discussed. 
Net interest expense was $38 million in the quarter, an increase of $18 million compared to the prior year, driven by increased interest expense from higher outstanding debt balances as well as decreased interest income due to lower interest rates. 
Other adjusted nonoperating expense totaled $5 million in the quarter compared to $16 million of income in the prior year period. This includes increased expenses related to foreign exchange and reduced pension benefits as compared to the prior year period. 
The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 20.2%, above our expectations, driven primarily by the mix of earnings in the quarter. 
Turning to the full year 2020. Sales of $11.7 billion increased by 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis and 2% on an operational basis. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings decreased 7% to $3.09 per diluted share. 
On a full year basis, we generated free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. This represents a decrease of $250 million versus the prior year period, in part related to carrying higher inventory levels for pandemic preparedness as well as the impact from settlement of all outstanding interest rate derivative contracts.  
As of the end of the year, we had approximately $3.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, along with $6.2 billion of long-term indebtedness. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $500 million or 6.3 million shares of common stock. And over the course of the year, deployed approximately $500 million to inorganic business development opportunities. We'll continue to balance our investments across organic and inorganic initiatives to fuel our growth and drive margin expansion. 
Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2021. For the full year 2021, we expect global growth of 7% to 8% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis. I would like to point out the key assumptions reflected in our full year sales outlook, which include approximately 300 basis points of foreign exchange impact. 
Our current expectation is that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates and surgical procedures are going to remain below pre-COVID levels, roughly down mid-single digits for the year. Our expectation is that rates will improve sequentially throughout the year to exit Q4 with admissions down slightly and procedures roughly flat. 
Moving down to P&L. We anticipate adjusted operating margin to expand between 20 to 50 basis points, reflecting the continued impact from COVID on our business. This impact will be most notable during the first half of the year and then ease as the year progresses. 
For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% to 18.5% and a full year diluted average share count between the range of 510 million to 515 million shares. This share count reflects the fourth quarter repurchases and assume that any additional repurchases are only undertaken to offset dilution. 
Based on these factors, we expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.35 to $3.43 per diluted share. Specific to the first quarter of 2021, we expect growth of approximately 3% on a reported basis and sales to decline low single digits on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.63 to $0.65 per diluted share.  
With that, we can now open the call for Q&A."

So Vijay, in terms of growth in Q1, obviously, the key factor that's in play is we had an incredibly strong Q1 of last year. And so we exceeded our expectations. And frankly, it was really some -- there was certainly some pre-buying related to COVID, but also strength across the portfolio. So as we think about the sequencing, our most challenging comp is in the first quarter, and we expect the lowest level of performance. And it really is in those areas that are primarily impacted by COVID.
Obviously, Q2 and Q3 have much easier comps, so we will start to see some nice growth there. And then we do expect to close the year with some growth against what is a fairly challenging comp given the strong performance in Q1. The guidance of 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis includes $50 million to $100 million of improvement related to COVID.
So we are still expecting relative to normalized levels very substantial COVID impact. So that will abate over time. And certainly, in the second half, it will be better than the first. But we'll see -- we're expecting to see about $50 million to $100 million of improvement. So really, that's the story on the overall guidance from a sales perspective."

Overall, margin improvement is a crucial part of our long-term focus and the long-term story of the company. So we are very focused on this. You heard in my prepared remarks, some comments in terms of implementing now gross margin improvements in si",419,"Sure. Overall, margin improvement is a crucial part of our long-term focus and the long-term story of the company. So we are very focused on this. You heard in my prepared remarks, some comments in terms of implementing now gross margin improvements in similar ways using a similar methodology to what we applied to operating expenses over the last several years. With the new leader for our manufacturing area coming in, Jim Borzi, we're incredibly excited about our opportunity to drive gross margin. 
But there are some peculiarities that you have to think about with respect to 2021. While from a manufacturing standpoint, we're expecting maybe 150 basis points of improvement as some of these COVID costs abate, we also have an OpEx normalization that we have to contend with. And what I mean by that is things like travel, the bonus pool, discretionary spending, we -- all of those were sources of savings in 2020, and those pools are rebuilt in 2021 as we start to look at accelerating growth for the long-term. So that's roughly 100 basis points of headwind as we look at 2021. 
And then I would add to that, while the FX environment from a sales standpoint is favorable, that's roughly 30 basis points of headwind as we approach next year on the operating margin line. So you put those items together, along with our continued normal focus on operating improvement and you land where we are with respect to the guidance that we shared. 
What I will tell you is it really is a very different story, first half to second half. In the first half, we have some continued COVID costs, we have some continued rollout of manufacturing impacts, and we have a lower revenue base. What happens in the second half is we have a larger revenue base in place. We're able to -- most of the COVID costs are gone by the second half. And then finally, we will start to see and expect to see some of the improvements that Jim and his team are addressing, they accrue more to the second half.  
So I think as we get to Q3, Q4, you'll see margins that you're more normally used to seeing. In the first half of the year, it will be a bit lower than what we've typically seen in the past. So -- but again, the core part of the story, we are very focused on this particular area, and it's a long-term valuation driver for us."

Obviously, that is, as I said to Vijay, our most challenging quarter of the year. And it's really challenging across the board, although I will say that we do expect to see continued performance in Acute in the first quarter before that becomes a very challenging comp in the future. 
As we move on to Q2 and Q3, the growth rate is much higher. Q2 was, I believe, one of the only quarters, if the only, we declined this year. And so from a comp standpoint, while we still expect to have an impact on both admissions and procedures in the second quarter, we do see -- we'll see a strong growth quarter in the second quarter and third quarter on the back of easy comps related to COVID impacts. 
And then in the fourth quarter, our current thinking is sort of lower single digit, but growth nonetheless, in large part, driven by the strength of portfolio, some of the launches starting to impact sales in the fourth quarter. So those are some of the drivers there. 
From a business unit standpoint, Renal, generally speaking, is steady. Our Acute business will face severe challenges beginning in Q2, as you would expect. Medication Delivery has easier comps from Q2 to Q4, so we'll see some nice growth in that category. Our Pharmaceuticals business also, which has been impacted by COVID fairly substantially, will have a challenging Q1, but then again, growth beyond that. Nutrition overall, we've seen a solid performance in Nutrition, proud of the progress there, that will continue, although there is an easy comp in the second quarter. And then Advanced Surgery will behave like a lot of the discretionary procedure businesses that you're familiar with. 
Now what I will say is all of this is underlined by our market assumptions on COVID. And so there's a lot of optimism lately in terms of patient trends and so on, and we're certainly excited about that and the impact of vaccines as we move forward. But the way we see it, Q1, we expect to be down relative to pre-COVID levels from a hospital census standpoint, double digits; from a surgical procedure standpoint, mid-single. Q2 starts to improve, so you'll see sort of mid-single in census -- or high single-digit in hospital census. And then surgical procedures improve from the mid-single digits. And then Q3, Q4, much more normal. 
So really, that's a crucial underlying assumption for us. If that plays out as is, guidance should be solid. But again, a lot of variables in play here that we have to contend with."

Listen, the pipeline that we have got disrupted in 2020, but we feel that we have momentum coming into 2021 and 2022. If you think about the ETC, we believe that PD as a category will be a high single-digit growth, which is probably 300 to 400 basis points above the market growth of ESRD. Baxter is well positioned to capitalize on that. We do have investments. We made investments in capacity. And we are prepared to support the growth. As a matter of fact, we have to anticipate some capacity investments because the growth of the category has surpassed our expectations. So even in a COVID year like 2020, we saw growth of that category. So that is one of the drivers. 
The other one, Marcus, that you mentioned is the pump. We're all excited about it. But I don't speak on behalf of agencies across the globe. We are filing with the FDA, hopefully, by the end of the first quarter as we prepare the documentation. We have worked collaboratively. I don't speak on behalf of the agency. I can't predict what the agency is going to do. On our side that we control, we will do the best we can to have this all filed. And if we need to make adjustments across the globe with other friends, we will. We are very -- we're confident that we can launch the NOVUM in 2021. It's a new platform. It's an open architecture platform and we have great hopes for this product. 
We also have new pharmaceutical molecules. They are launching this year, but just going back and looking, the launch of Myxredlin was impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. We think that with the exit, momentum of December -- November and December, we see this molecule gaining momentum. We have a lot of new accounts signed up. So I think we're getting there, and we are in place right now that we don't speak about cyclophosphamide anymore. So we were able to do what we wanted to do, which is to change the mix of the Pharmaceutical business. That is one that we continue to invest organic and inorganically as well. 
I think a couple of other things, if I think about the P&L, the gross margin improvement driven by supply chain is one that we are laser focused. Jay has spoken about our digital transformation, which will affect our G&A and how we do business. And also, I think the cash in the balance sheet is a great advantage to us, either on the M&A point of view with small gains or perhaps large ones. But if nothing comes above the large ones, we will return the money to the shareholders, creating value as well. So I think, altogether, it shows a good breath of optimism and success for Baxter."

So Joanne, thanks for the question. The -- as we think about the 2 categories, hospital census and surgical volumes, we really make our comparisons to pre-COVID levels. And so if we think about the fourth quarter of 2020, our hospital census, as we see it, was roughly down 10%. And our surgical volumes was roughly flat as there was some pent-up demand that was capitalized on in the fourth quarter of this year.
Now as we move to 2021, our assumptions are, roughly, hospital census continues to be down in the first quarter, double digits relative to those pre-COVID levels and it ends the year at down roughly 3%. And that's our current working assumption. But it's an important driver for us, Joanne, and we'll watch that very carefully during the course of the year. And it's a fairly linear improvement over the course of the year. So on a full year basis, relative to pre-COVID levels, were down mid-single digits on the census standpoint. 
From a surgical volume standpoint, our sense is Q4 did benefit from some pent-up demand. So in Q1, we are expecting a decline relative to pre-COVID levels in the mid-single digits range. And then it improves from there. And by Q4, we're assuming down a couple of percent relative to pre-COVID levels. So this is -- we expect surgical volumes to perform a little bit better than general hospital census on a full year basis.
So that's our current assumptions. We'll update that every quarter. It's something that we're very focused on as it is an important driver of our overall sales volumes."

So we think -- we put our plans based on that. I think there were some stockpiling in terms of pumps in some parts of the world. But the cycle to replace old platforms, either 7, 8 or 9 years, depends upon how a hospital sees that is still there. So I believe that our new pump will create the momentum and the impetus perhaps for a hospital to look at that.

We have plans and everything is in place to execute this by the end of Q1. We were more hopeful in first -- second -- third quarter last year to submit it faster. But I think slowing down to speed up was wise decision by Baxter.
We had contact with the FDA, and that contact has been very collaborative to the point that we understood some of the things that we had to prepare in more detail. So instead of rushing to get something in, we worked with the agency, continue to very collaboratively. So we have what is needed for them to evaluate the pump. 
So every time that I think about of any plans in the future, like this submission is I'm very, very optimistic, and I have the confirmation from our executives that this is going to happen. But I always say hopefully, because I think things happen that we don't anticipate. But at this moment, I don't see anything that would prevent us create -- from filing this at the end of the first quarter. I want to make sure that, that's clear. 
On your other question on COVID, there are structural changes in the market, primarily how people see care. But more importantly is how long is this COVID pandemic and preventive measures will stick with us and how long the herd immunity -- it will takes us to get herd immunity and people feel more comfortable doing things differently. 
I think there's a huge adaptability that we're seeing. Hospitals have these separate wards. And we believe that there are some changes in how people consult with their primary care physicians. People who have cancer, unfortunately need infusion. They need infusion, they either needed to go to an infusion center or they need to go home and have it then in a place that is safe.
People who need surgery, they will need to have the surgery, no matter what, otherwise, they go in and they're sicker later. People who need to be admitted because they have issues, they need to -- so I believe that the return of the pre COVID will happen with changes in technology that will allow for better triage. 
I want to point to the home because this is a part that people sometimes are forgetting. We look a lot of that acute side, but their home treatments are the ones that I think will gain prevalence and will gain preference. In Baxter, being a home care company in the ESRD space plays well for our PD business. And we've seen that. Even with issues that we saw in 2020 with reduction in patient census, we still see momentum of that therapy mode, and we are very focused on that. 
So that is the momentum that has shifted. When it got to Baxter, the growth of PD was at ESRD or lower in most places in the world. And today, I see that reversing. And I think COVID is an affirmation that those changes are ahead."

As we look at the mix between gross and operating margin, you're right, roughly the gross margin we're looking at in the 44% range and then on the way to the operating margin that we've identified. And really what's going to happen is it is a story of 2 different halves. Specifically, in the first half of the year, we still have some COVID costs. We still have the rollout of some manufacturing variations from Q4 hitting the first quarter and some into the second quarter. And so -- and then finally, we also have a lower sales level, generally speaking, which isn't good for sort of positive manufacturing variations. 
So all those things negatively impact the first half of the year. And so we will see a fairly substantial step-up to that from below kind of that average level to something above it in the second half of the year. And then the same story holds true on operating margin. We'll start to see some real leverage on SG&A in the second half of the year, in part as we get the incremental sales, but also at some of the savings initiatives from the digital transformation start to play out into our numbers. 
So it really is a story of 2 halves in terms of margin improvement. As we look longer-term about comparisons to prior years and so on, I think that -- as I said, you'll get close from a gross margin standpoint by the end of this year to the pre-COVID levels. And then we'll share some more guidance on long-term expectations when we get together in September. But core to our story and core to our focus is this idea that we want to be more efficient and we intend to be more efficient, in particular on the gross margin line for the coming years. It's an important part of our valuation."

Now the growth like fully expected. I will see 2022, it is where we take off on this and becomes fully realized. 2021, because the first quarter is still a COVID environment, you'll see a little reduction, but then it's going to pick up. And we've seen the pickup also not only in the U.S., but in Latin America and China and other places that we're strong in peritoneal dialysis. So all in all, 2021 is a rebound year, fully realizing growth in 2022. 
Second, on your question on mortality, it is -- we saw increase in mortality due to the situation of COVID. As that ameliorates into 2021, we probably should see the reversal of that.

So that is a fact. The other thing is we saw fourth quarter slowdown because the rampant aspect of the pandemic in Q4, that was tremendously -- that was filling up hospitals. And how do you get PDs and insertion of a catheter, that surgery, and people have to go to the hospital. 
Despite the fact the association said that to be an emergency surgery, some people just did not have the capacity to do it or did not have the time to go into a hospital queue to get it done. 
So I think Q4 was depressed by the pandemic without a doubt. How do we see the mix shift going into 2021, as you become -- as the cases go down, vaccination becomes more prevalent, primarily on people who are highly at risk like patients in the ESRD, and you see all the protocols from the CDC to vaccinate folks like that first. So you will see probably these folks going back, the people going back into PD modality into 2021, like I answered today that we see a rebound in 2021 with full realization of that in 2022. 
And this is what our forecast, our viewing this is that this is 300 to 400 basis points above the ESRD average PD. So it is -- we're starting to see growth. We saw growth before, and we will continue because PD starting to see the growth. You just need to understand that 2021 will be a little bit of a transition in the beginning of the year and picking up towards the end of the year when you have more herd immunity."

But as we got into the fall, things became more difficult as people became more isolated due to all the protocols for  lockdowns. So I believe the delay visits were the major driver of that. 
But you see that they will pick up as we are starting to see less cases. This will normalize, as I said before. Look at the first quarter and first half of this year as a transition, then moves into an acceleration into the third and fourth quarter because of the herd immunity and vaccination."

So if we think about that, and take 2020 as the year where things have slowed down, you eventually catch up in 2021, realize full growth in 2022.

We proved the technology work -- the technology works. We're happy with that. We are putting that as in a second development plan, meaning we're decelerating that development and accelerating a new cycle because we believe despite the fact we would benefit from a point-of-care, we've got to get a cycler that it has more affordability and more global in nature.
So we're putting our resources in what we call our new project, [ Project UNO ], which we are very excited about it. It's 3 to 3.5 years in the making in the future, but that is something that we need more urgently than point-of-care. And so that technology point-of-care is proven, we can deliver that. 
More importantly for Baxter right now was to immediately make some capacity investments, which we did, and to be able to attend our customers. Second is to develop a cycler, which is global in nature and more affordable. So that is something that we'll provide to our customers on a global basis. If you think about automatically -- automatic PD is only done in countries which have higher income per capita. And so -- but the incidence is actually not only in those countries. It's across the globe. And I think, to have a more affordable product, it is the mission of the company. And so we took -- that took precedence over rolling out on-demand fluid making.

This strategic acquisition, which closed on February 17 this year, supplements Baxter's previously existing U.S. rights to Doxil, which the company acquired in 2019.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe.I'll begin with an overview of Baxter's first quarter performance. Jay will take a closer look at the financials,",1072,"Thank you, Clare. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe.
I'll begin with an overview of Baxter's first quarter performance. Jay will take a closer look at the financials, including our outlook for Q2 and the year as a whole. Then we'll close with Q&A.
Baxter delivered first quarter sales growth of 5% on a reported basis and 1% on both a constant currency and operational basis.
This represents solid performance in the face of an unprecedented pandemic as well as a challenging year-over-year comparison, given the heightened sales we experienced a year ago as our customers prepared for the impact of COVID-19. On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 declined 7%.
This decrease reflects the negative year-over-year impact of COVID on our results in the quarter. On a segment basis, Asia Pacific delivered growth of 8% at constant rates. This growth reflects strength across the region, while much of the region is progressing in its recovery.
We continue to monitor the situation in India, which is experiencing the highest COVID infection rates around the world. Sales results in EMEA were flat year-over-year and declined 1% in the Americas, also at constant currency rates. Sales in both of these segments continue to be impacted by lower rates of hospital admissions and surgical volumes due to the pandemic. 
Looking at performance by business. Acute therapies led growth across all of our product categories, with sales increasing 28% on a constant currency basis. Results were driven by ongoing heightened demand globally for Baxter's continuous renal replacement therapy or CRT technology amid COVID-19.
 As we discussed last year, we expect acute therapies demand to receive from its pandemic peak and return to more typical levels over the course of the year. Our biopharma solutions business advanced 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by our partnerships to assist in manufacturing the COVID-19 vaccines.
Renal care clinical nutrition pharmaceuticals all grew at low single digits at constant currency. Growth in Renal care continues to be driven by demand for our peritoneal dialysis or PD products globally. I would point out that demand for both our in center HD and PD businesses has been dampened by the [indiscernible] volumes driven by higher mortality rates for ESRD patients in the wake of the pandemic.
We expect the ESRD patient volumes to stabilize and return to normal over the next 18 to 24 months, but the pace of their recovery may vary by market.
PD growth is expected to continue outpacing HD growth market-wide for the foreseeable future beyond the general lifestyle benefits of home-based PD. This therapy continues to be recognized as a bio treatment option amid pandemic conditions. In addition, the new CMS end-stage renal disease treatment choices or ETC payment model went into effect in the U.S. at the start of the year, which supports expanded access to home therapies. HD will remain a critical treatment option in numerous markets as a pioneering dialysis broadly, Baxter is committed to innovation across both modalities, enabling clinicians and patients to make the right treatment choices based on their distinct needs.
Last quarter, I highlighted the FDA's 510(k) clearance of our Homechoice CLARIA APD cycler as 1 more way we are supporting PD growth in the U.S.
More recently, we received 510(k) clearance of our leading-edge AK 98 hemodialysis system, a proven platform that is currently used in more than 90 countries worldwide and now launching in the U.S.
Growth in our clinical nutrition business reflected demand from Baxter's multi chamber nutritional product offerings in the U.S. and APAC markets as well as nutrition compound growth in EMEA.
Pharmaceuticals growth was driven by continued strength in our international pharmacy compounded business as well as the benefit from the recent acquisition of Calyx, Doxil rights in select territories outside the U.S.
This acquisition further strengthens our pharmaceuticals portfolio globally and, in particular, represents a platform to accelerate growth in Europe. Adjusting for the Caelyx and Doxil acquisitions and foreign exchange.
Pharmaceuticals declined low single digits year-over-year. Performance in the quarter reflects a challenging comparison to the prior year quarter, which occurred before in mark the decline in hospitalization to surgical volumes due to the pandemic, intended with heightened sales as hospitals stocked up on few supplies as the pandemic emerged. Medication delivery and advanced surgery both declined mid-single digits at constant currency rates as these businesses were also impacted by lower rates of hospitalizations and surgical procedures as well as the challenging comparison to the prior year quarter. That said, we're seeing gradual steady recovery in this trend.
Expect this to continue over the course of the year, particularly as the rate of COVID vaccinations improves globally. In medication delivery, we are also excited by the potential of our NOVUM IQ infusion platform, including our dose IQ safety software and IQ enterprise digital connectivity suite. NOVUM IQ was resubmitted for FDA 510(K) clearance earlier this month.
We look forward to advancing this application and anticipate introducing this exciting technology the U.S. in the second half of this year.
We also remain committed to broadening our presence globally for NOVUM IQ and currently expect to introduce this platform in Europe in 2022 as we work to enhance our product offering to address the specific needs of this region. As I wrap up, I would like to reinforce the Baxter is both well prepared and well positioned for the future.
The essential nature and durability of our portfolio, the breadth and diversity of our product lines, our expansive geographic footprint and the impact of our transformation, all taken together, fewer resilience, adaptability and agility.
We remain focused on advancing innovation key to sustained growth in any industry. We have a lot to look forward to across our businesses, including new therapeutics and increasingly new value-added digital solutions. You may hear about many of these at our upcoming investor conference and some even sooner.
And to supplement our organic pipeline, we will continue to pursue attractive BD opportunity in our core portfolio and key adjacencies as well as complements our business.
And our 50,000 employees remain absolutely dedicated to advance in our mission for patients, and we are committed as ever to returning value to our shareholders. Now I'll pass it to Jay for a deeper dive into our financials and outlook."

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter performance, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic conditions and a tough comparison to first quarter 2020, where we experienced tightened demand for select products as COVID-19 began to spread to the U.S. and other geographies.
The strength and resilience of our portfolio continues to be on display, and we are executing on the priorities we've set out. As Joe mentioned, this quarter, we resubmitted the FDA 510(k) filing for Novum IQ, our suite of next-generation infusion pumps, is a promising multiyear growth driver for Baxter. Additionally, in line with our strategic objective, we bolstered our pharmaceuticals portfolio with the acquisition of rights to select territories outside the U.S. that will allow future growth, particularly in our EMEA region. And we continue to execute on recent new product launches across our businesses and geographies. 
Turning to our first quarter 2021 results, global sales of $2.9 billion advanced 5% on a reported basis, 1% on a constant currency basis and 1% on an operational basis.
For the quarter, we estimate that COVID negatively impacted year-over-year sales growth by approximately 400 basis points. Sales growth in the first quarter did exceed our expectations, driven by operational strength and the benefit from COVID vaccine manufacturing-related revenues. 
Also, the recent acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil contributed approximately 45 basis points to growth in the quarter.
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings declined 7% to $0.76 per share as the negative impact from COVID on our business and operations as well as increased interest expense and a higher tax rate more than offset operational growth in the quarter. 
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories, starting with our 3 regional segments.
Sales in the Americas declined 1% on both a constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa were flat on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on an operational basis. And sales in our APAC region advanced 8% on both a concurrency and operational basis.
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note, for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses with the exception of our pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth, adjusting for the acquisition of rights and select territories outside the U.S. for Caelyx/Doxil.
Global sales for renal care were $922 million, advancing 2% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in our PD business. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnosis resulting from the pandemic. This is particularly notable in Select Latin America markets, which saw patient volumes decline mid-teens during the quarter. Our current expectation is for PD patient volumes to ramp over the course of the year, although as Joe mentioned, the pace of recovery will vary by market and be further impacted by the rate of COVID vaccinations.
Longer term, we remain excited about the trajectory for our Renal care business, in particular, with our leading portfolio of home therapies.
Sales and medication delivery of $652 million declined 6% on a constant currency basis. The sales decline reflects a difficult comparison to the first quarter 2020, where we experienced tightened demand for certain medication delivery products and hadn't yet felt the full impact from the lower rate of hospital admissions and surgical procedures.
During the quarter, we estimate that U.S. hospital emissions were down high single digits as compared to pre-COVID levels.
Pharmaceutical sales of $552 million advanced 1% on a constant currency basis and declined 2% on an operational basis. OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil contributed approximately $13 million for the quarter.
Pharmaceutical performance in the quarter was also negatively impacted by the Q1 2020 pre pandemic buy-in for select products as well as lower rates of hospital admissions and surgical volumes.
With sales of both inhaled anesthetics and specialty injectables declining high single digits, excluding the benefit of the Caelyx/Doxil acquisition.
Strength in our international pharmacy compounding services partially offset this impact. Moving to Nutrition. Total sales were $234 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by increased demand for multi chamber bags and nutrition compounding products in EMEA. Sales in advanced surgery were $217 million, declining 6% on a constant currency basis.
Sales within the quarter were impacted by lower surgical procedure volumes as well as a difficult year-over-year comparison as the first quarter of 2020 included a benefit of approximately 600 basis points, resulting from competitor product shortages. Although surgical procedures experienced a slow start to the year.
We expect quarterly sequential improvement and anticipate ending the year with procedure volumes approximately flat to pre-COVID levels. Sales in our acute therapies business were $207 million, representing growth of 28% on a constant currency basis, driven by ongoing COVID-related demand.
As Joe mentioned, we anticipate this demand will slow as vaccination rates increase and COVID-related admissions decline. As mentioned, beginning this quarter, we are disclosing sales associated with our biopharma Solutions contract manufacturing unit, which was previously presented in our other category.
First quarter sales in biopharma solutions were $135 million, representing growth of 11% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by revenues generated from manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines on a contract basis.
We are honored to play a role in helping meet global demand for COVID-19 vaccines. 
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42% declined by 230 basis points over the prior year, driven by lower sales of high-margin products and increased operations and supply chain expenses resulting from COVID. Adjusted SG&A of $609 million increased 3% on a year-over-year basis and was flat on a constant currency basis. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $128 million increased 4% on a reported basis and was also flat on a constant currency basis.
Both adjusted SG&A and R&D reflected continued benefit from lower discretionary spending amid the pandemic. The adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17%, a decrease of 180 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $34 million in the quarter, an increase of $13 million compared to the prior year, driven by increased interest expense from higher outstanding debt balances as well as decreased interest income due to lower interest rates. Other nonoperating expense totaled $5 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16% and was favorable to our expectations, driven primarily by a discrete tax benefit recognized in the quarter. We had expected this benefit to occur later in the year.
Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of 8% to 9% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx/ Doxil as well as approximately 300 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth. Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates and surgical procedures will stay below pre-COVID levels with rates improving throughout the year and exiting the fourth quarter with admissions down low single digits and procedures roughly flat.
Moving down the P&L, we now anticipate adjusted operating margin to expand between 40 to 60 basis points, reflecting the strong first quarter performance and the inclusion of the Caelyx/Doxil OUS rights.
We expect this benefit to be partially offset by increased supply chain and manufacturing-related costs, given the increase in commodity pricing and freight transport as well as a negative impact from foreign exchange.
For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% and a full year diluted average share count between the range of 510 million to 515 million shares.
Based on these factors, we expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.47 to $3.55 per diluted share.
Specific to the second quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of 14% to 15% on a reported basis, 8% to 9% on a constant currency basis and 7% to 8% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.72 to $0.75 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

But you did raise EPS guidance a little more than the first quarter beat. So I was hoping to get a sense of some of the items impacting second quarters.

254571,709056523,2262457,"Baxter International Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Sure.

Robbie, consistent with how we outlined performance at the beginning of the -- when we gave guidance originally, we really do see this as a tale of 2 different halves, with the shape of the second half being very different than the shape of the first half. In part, that relates to admissions and surgical procedures.
 And in part, it relates to certain manufacturing costs, which we expect to subside to the back part of the year.
 And so first, as it relates to admissions, our second quarter assumption and admissions, first quarter, we saw about 8% down relative to pre-COVID levels. In the second quarter, we're expecting to see roughly 7% down. That's kind of the working assumption that we have in place.
But in the back half of the year, we'll expect to see roughly 3% down. And so we do see a market improvement from first half to second half that benefits the top line. And then from the margin standpoint, we will see incremental improvements  in the second half of the year, in particular, with respect to gross margin that start to drive our performance up.
And so in fact, the second half average margin will be in the 20% range or a little bit north of that as implied by the guidance that we've shared. Now specific to the second quarter, there are a few moving pieces. What I would say is we do have sequential improvement in sales that contributes approximately $0.10 of earnings impact roughly all in. And included in that is maybe a couple of cents related to the Doxil acquisition.
Now -- but as we think about the second quarter, 1 of the things that's really important for us is setting the stage for a successful acceleration in the second half and setting the stage for a successful 2022. We are making meaningful OpEx investments in the second quarter to support that acceleration. And so we're seeing roughly about $0.10 or so of OpEx investments that take place in the second quarter. And then from a financial statement standpoint, there is a tax rate. We see the tax rate from the first quarter to the second quarter tick up roughly $0.03. We saw a discrete item in the first quarter of the year. We don't expect that to repeat in the second quarter. Therefore, there's a bit of a tick up.  .
So I think broadly speaking, as you say, we're really pleased with the first quarter performance. It's a nice start to the year. It sets the stage for a successful performance throughout the rest of the year. But I view Q2 as a little bit more of a stage setter on the way to a really solid second half of the year."

If you'll recall in our last earnings call, we talked a little bit about the digital transformation that's underway led by [ Andy Fry and Tavis ], our CIO. We've got an enormous amount of work ongoing in terms of cost improvements and efficiency enhancements related to that transformation. And also, [ Jim Borzi ], our Head of Manufacturing and Operations, has a lot in terms of accelerating operating performance in the second half of the year. So all of those things will feature prominently as we look at Q3, Q4 and beyond. But we do need -- as is always the case, if you're falling short of revenue expectations, it creates a real absorption challenge in the manufacturing facilities. It creates a real absorption challenge as you look at things like fixed SG&A and R&D costs.
So there is some -- it's important that we do see the acceleration on the revenue line in order for us to deliver what our expectations are. Now having said that, I do believe that we have the right revenue projection in place.
And I think our ability to forecast revenues in light of this highly volatile environment has really improved quite substantially over the last 18 months. So I think the assumptions that I outlined that support the second half hopefully prove reasonable, but we'll have to wait and see."

And it starts with aggregation of data sources. There are a number of proprietary data sources that we now have in place that really give us good line of sight to like in terms of actual patients admitted to hospitals, along with surgical procedures. So we have a number of sources. And then, of course, there's a lot of publicly available sources. But early on in the pandemic, if we rewind over a year, we didn't have the availability of data sources for the -- for information because, frankly, this was -- hospital admissions was never a variable that was very concerning to us. It was always something that would grow low single digits each year. And so in light of the Q2 last year, where we saw a 20% decline.
[indiscernible] and team started spending a lot of their energy and effort assessing and understanding data sources. But then the second thing that we did was we started to do some work in terms of anticipating and forecasting with some artificial intelligence, looking at a variety of data sources that could predict behavior. And ultimately, what we found is, in the fourth quarter of last year, in the first quarter of this year, the model that we built, and I'm talking most specifically to the U.S. because I think that's a big driver for us, and it's also a discrete data set that lends itself to a level of analytics that perhaps other markets, it's a little more challenging. 
What we found was Q4, Q1, we were largely in line with our expectations within the tolerance range that was acceptable. And so we've applied that same analytic lens looking forward. Now we could be wrong, of course. And we've quantified in the past what that -- what a mistake would cost us from an admission standpoint. I believe 1 percentage point in the U.S. per month is a $2 million.
And so that's the sort of the penalty for being wrong. But I think throughout -- once we got through Q2 of last year, our ability to anticipate what the outcome was going to be, has been significantly better. And past performance is no guarantee of future performance. We have caveats related to forward-looking statements that Clare shared at the outset of this call.
But I feel like we have done a nice job really, really assessing this and understanding drivers going forward. I don't know, Joe, if you'd like to add anything."

From the moment we buy raw material, either whatever raw material it is, all the way to the delivery to the customer. We have specifics. As a matter of fact, coincidentally, I just reviewed that yesterday with the team. We have programs in all areas, from cost of raw materials to the cost reductions in our manufacturing facilities. The ability to predict cost of logistics, which has been a headwind for the company and for many other companies around the globe, with containers and shipping lanes being clocked up. So those things are the focus of Baxter. 
And I saw the numbers yesterday, there's a progressive increase in net cost reduction of integrated supply chain that pleased me.
The second thing is digital transformation because Baxter did indeed remove cost from a G&A, but not enough. We got to a point that now we need to redesign our processes. So I just give an example to supplement Bob's question to Jay is finance organizations a large group within the company. Does a great job. But also, we can do things in a much more concise and better way. So we're looking at that from digital transformation of our quality organizations, regulatory affairs, as well as the research and development. We shift research and development within the company. People ask me why don't we spend more in research and development? Always, we can spend more money. There's always opportunity to put more money. But we are now, this year, piping out 22 new products, a brand-new platform of pumps that this company never had the capability to develop, and we're doing this with the R&D resources that we have by shifting location of labor, but also becoming more effective in doing that. And lastly is the mix of this new product that will come into play for the margin accretion. So there is opportunity in G&A and gross margin via reduction in costs from integrated supply chain as well as the mix due to new products."

And so -- and our April trends, what we've seen thus far is, broadly speaking, supportive of the comments that I've made.

And then for renal care, can you give us some more color on what you're seeing within the U.S., Europe and other markets? I believe you mentioned that Latam was down in mid teens.
How should we think about the increased mortality on the ESRD patients as it relates to both our in center products in your PD products within those geographies in 2021? And also, have you seen increased PD demand as patients would rather be at home versus the center? And how the patients get vaccinated? Are they keeping on PD?"

And by us before, there was a significant [indiscernible] because of patients off therapy. But when we look at the dynamics of the market, we still see the U.S., the PD patient growth, even with that in the U.S. was 3.3%, and the outlook for the year is 6%. The issue that was dampened the number overall is significant reduction in Latin American patient sensors, primarily Mexico, some in Brazil as well, due to fatalities, due to COVID-19. And also a reduction in sensors until the -- once COVID hit in Europe. Europe was starting to recover and start to gain really good momentum until COVID hit. So we are optimistic even for PD this year, different than HD, 6.1% outlook for the year.
And the dynamics are correct, to your point, a PD is shown to be a home therapy that in crisis like a pandemics shows an increased value of convenience and safety for the patient by staying home that have to travel to the clinic. And I think I believe that the ESRD disease state in the U.S., the change in guidance for home therapies, you're going to continue to see this therapy gaining momentum.
So even though we had closed in the beginning of the year, affecting heavily a lot of areas in the U.S., we still see good growth going forward."

Maybe I'll start with these, Joe, and then you can chime in. And I'll answer your second question first, in relation to puts and takes with respect to the full year guidance.
Overall, if we take the full year and disregard the quarters for a moment, the strong operational performance that we've seen from a sales standpoint, plus some incremental vaccines adds roughly $0.10 to our overall guidance. In addition to that, we have some OpEx savings, that's about $0.04. But 1 of the things that we highlighted in the script was the supply chain cost that we've seen in the short term. And really, with the highly volatile environment from a global logistics market standpoint from a raw materials pricing standpoint, resin prices. Some of this is impacted by the freeze in Texas, some of this impacted by the global supply chain challenges along with Suez Canal, we are expecting a fairly substantial increase in supply chain costs related to those discrete items.
And that really eats up the vast majority of those upsides that I characterized a little bit ago.
And then in addition, we've added the Doxil acquisition that's a little north of $0.10 in terms of full year impact. FX and other items, all of that stuff kind of washes on a full year basis, although we do see some movement amongst quarters. So that really is the overall drivers of the full year performance. And what I would say is very excited about the strong operational performance. Very mindful of the current environment that we're faced with, with respect to shipping and container costs, resin costs, et cetera. We do expect that will alleviate over time.
We've tried to put the right projections in given the acute situation that we've seen over the last several months, and we anticipate for at least the next several months."

You're going to continue to see the tuck-ins because those are good for the company, leverage our sales and marketing organizations as well as our manufacturing groups.

I'll begin with an overview of Baxter's first quarter performance. Jay will take a closer look at the financials, including our outlook for Q2 and the year as a whole. Then we'll close with Q&A. 
Baxter delivered first quarter sales growth of 5% on a reported basis and 1% on both a constant currency and operational basis. This represents solid performance in the face of an unprecedented pandemic as well as a challenging year-over-year comparison, given the heightened sales we experienced a year ago as our customers prepared for the impact of COVID-19. On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 declined 7%. This decrease reflects the negative year-over-year impact of COVID on our results in the quarter. On a segment basis, Asia Pacific delivered growth of 8% at constant rates. This growth reflects the strength across the region, while much of the region is progressing in its recovery. 
We continued to monitor the situation in India, which is experiencing the highest COVID infection rates around the world. Sales results in the EMEA were flat year-over-year and declined 1% in the Americas, also at constant currency rates. Sales in both of these segments continue to be impacted by lower rates of hospital admissions and surgical volumes due to the pandemic.
Looking at performance by business. Acute therapies led growth across all of our product categories, with sales increasing 28% on a constant currency basis. Results were driven by ongoing heightened demand globally for Baxter's continuous renal replacement therapy or CRT technology amid COVID-19. As we discussed last year, we expect acute therapies demand to receive from its pandemic peak and return to more typical levels over the course of the year. Our BioPharma Solutions business advanced 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by our partnerships to assist in manufacturing the COVID-19 vaccines. 
Renal Care, Clinical Nutrition, Pharmaceuticals all grew at low single digits at constant currency. Growth in Renal Care continues to be driven by demand for our peritoneal dialysis or PD products globally. I would point out that demand for both our in-center HD and PD businesses has been dampened by the past patient volumes driven by higher mortality rates for ESRD patients in the wake of the pandemic. We expect the ESRD patient volumes to stabilize and return to normal over the next 18 to 24 months, but the pace of their recovery may vary by market. 
PD growth is expected to continue outpacing HD growth market-wide for the foreseeable future beyond the general lifestyle benefits of home-based PD. This therapy continues to be recognized as a bio treatment option amid pandemic conditions. In addition, the new CMS end-stage renal disease treatment choices or ETC payment model went into effect in the U.S. at the start of the year, which supports expanded access to home therapies. HD will remain a critical treatment option in numerous markets. As a pioneering dialysis broadly, Baxter is committed to innovation across both modalities, enabling clinicians and patients to make the right treatment choices based on their distinct needs. 
Last quarter, I highlighted the FDA's 510(k) clearance of our HOMECHOICE CLARIA APD cycler as one more way we are supporting PD growth in the U.S. More recently, we received 510(k) clearance of our leading-edge AK 98 hemodialysis system, a proven platform that is currently used in more than 90 countries worldwide and now launching in the U.S. 
Growth in our Clinical Nutrition business reflected demand from Baxter's multi chamber nutritional product offerings in the U.S. and APAC markets as well as nutrition compound growth in EMEA.  
Pharmaceuticals growth was driven by continued strength in our international pharmacy compounded business as well as the benefit from the recent acquisition of Caelyx, Doxil rights in select territories outside the U.S. This acquisition further strengthens our Pharmaceuticals portfolio globally and, in particular, represents a platform to accelerate growth in Europe. Adjusting for the Caelyx and Doxil acquisitions and foreign exchange Pharmaceuticals declined low single digits year-over-year. Performance in the quarter reflects a challenging comparison to the prior year quarter, which occurred before in mark the decline in hospitalization to surgical volumes due to the pandemic, intended with heightened sales as hospitals stocked up on few supplies as the pandemic emerged. 
Medication delivery and advanced surgery both declined mid-single digits at constant currency rates as these businesses were also impacted by lower rates of hospitalizations and surgical procedures as well as the challenging comparison to the prior year quarter. That said, we're seeing gradual steady recovery in this trend. I expect this to continue over the course of the year, particularly as the rate of COVID vaccinations improves globally. In medication delivery, we are also excited by the potential of our NOVUM IQ infusion platform, including our Dose IQ Safety Software and IQ Enterprise Digital Connectivity Suite. NOVUM IQ was resubmitted for FDA 510(K) clearance earlier this month. We look forward to advancing this application and anticipate introducing this exciting technology to the U.S. in the second half of this year. We also remain committed to broadening our presence globally for NOVUM IQ and currently expect to introduce this platform in Europe in 2022 as we work to enhance our product offering to address the specific needs of this region. 
As I wrap up, I would like to reinforce the Baxter is both well prepared and well positioned for the future. The essential nature and durability of our portfolio, the breadth and diversity of our product lines, our expansive geographic footprint and the impact of our transformation, all taken together, fuel our resilience, adaptability and agility. We remain focused on advancing innovation, the key to sustained growth in any industry. We have a lot to look forward to across our businesses, including new therapeutics and increasingly new value-added digital solutions. You may hear about many of these at our upcoming investor conference and some even sooner. 
And to supplement our organic pipeline, we will continue to pursue attractive BD opportunity in our core portfolio in key adjacencies as well as complements our business. And our 50,000 employees remain absolutely dedicated to advance in our mission for patients, and we are committed as ever to returning value to our shareholders. 
Now I'll pass it to Jay for a deeper dive into our financials and outlook."

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter performance, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic conditions and a tough comparison to first quarter 2020, where we experienced tightened demand for s",1433,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter performance, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic conditions and a tough comparison to first quarter 2020, where we experienced tightened demand for select products as COVID-19 began to spread to the U.S. and other geographies. 
The strength and resilience of our portfolio continues to be on display, and we are executing on the priorities we've set out. As Joe mentioned, this quarter, we resubmitted the FDA 510(k) filing for NOVUM IQ, our suite of next-generation infusion pumps is a promising multiyear growth driver for Baxter. Additionally, in line with our strategic objective, we bolstered our pharmaceuticals portfolio with the acquisition of rights to select territories outside the U.S. that will allow FOR future growth, particularly in our EMEA regions, and we continue to execute on recent new product launches across our businesses and geographies.  
Turning to our first quarter 2021 results. Global sales of $2.9 billion advanced 5% on a reported basis, 1% on a constant currency basis and 1% on an operational basis. For the quarter, we estimate that COVID negatively impacted year-over-year sales growth by approximately 400 basis points. Sales growth in the first quarter did exceed our expectations driven by operational strength and the benefit from COVID vaccine manufacturing-related revenues. Also, the recent acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil contributed approximately 45 basis points to growth in the quarter. 
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings declined 7% to $0.76 per share as the negative impact from COVID on our business and operations as well as increased interest expense and a higher tax rate more than offset operational growth in the quarter.  
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories, starting with our 3 regional segments. Sales in the Americas declined 1% on both a constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa were flat on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on an operational basis. And sales in our APAC region advanced 8% on both a concurrency and operational basis. 
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note, for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses with the exception of our Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth, adjusting for the acquisition of rights and select territories outside the U.S. for Caelyx/Doxil. 
Global sales for Renal Care were $922 million, advancing 2% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in our PD business. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnosis resulting from the pandemic. This is particularly notable in select Latin America markets, which saw patient volumes decline mid-teens during the quarter. Our current expectation is for PD patient volumes to ramp over the course of the year, although as Joe mentioned, the pace of recovery will vary by market and be further impacted by the rate of COVID vaccinations. Longer term, we remain excited about the trajectory for our Renal care business, in particular, with our leading portfolio of home therapies. 
Sales and medication delivery of $652 million declined 6% on a constant currency basis. The sales decline reflects a difficult comparison to the first quarter 2020, where we experienced tightened demand for certain medication delivery products and hadn't yet felt the full impact from the lower rate of hospital admissions and surgical procedures. During the quarter, we estimate that U.S. hospital emissions were down high single digits as compared to pre-COVID levels. 
Pharmaceutical sales of $552 million advanced 1% on a constant currency basis and declined 2% on an operational basis. OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil contributed approximately $13 million for the quarter. Pharmaceutical performance in the quarter was also negatively impacted by the Q1 2020 pre pandemic buy-in for select products as well as lower rates of hospital admissions and surgical volumes. With sales of both inhaled anesthetics and specialty injectables declining high single digits, excluding the benefit of the Caelyx/Doxil acquisition. 
Strength in our international pharmacy compounding services partially offset this impact. Moving to Nutrition. Total sales were $234 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by increased demand for multi chamber bags and nutrition compounding products in EMEA. Sales in advanced surgery were $217 million, declining 6% on a constant currency basis. 
Sales within the quarter were impacted by lower surgical procedure volumes as well as a difficult year-over-year comparison as the first quarter of 2020 included a benefit of approximately 600 basis points, resulting from competitor product shortages. Although surgical procedures experienced a slow start to the year. 
We expect quarterly sequential improvement and anticipate ending the year with procedure volumes approximately flat to pre-COVID levels. Sales in our acute therapies business were $207 million, representing growth of 28% on a constant currency basis, driven by ongoing COVID-related demand. 
As Joe mentioned, we anticipate this demand will slow as vaccination rates increase and COVID-related admissions decline. As mentioned, beginning this quarter, we are disclosing sales associated with our BioPharma Solutions contract manufacturing unit, which was previously presented in our other category. 
First quarter sales in BioPharma Solutions were $135 million, representing growth of 11% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by revenues generated from manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines on a contract basis. We are honored to play a role in helping meet global demand for COVID-19 vaccines.  
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42% declined by 230 basis points over the prior year, driven by lower sales of high-margin products and increased operations and supply chain expenses resulting from COVID. Adjusted SG&A of $609 million increased 3% on a year-over-year basis and was flat on a constant currency basis. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $128 million increased 4% on a reported basis and was also flat on a constant currency basis. 
Both adjusted SG&A and R&D reflect the continued benefit from lower discretionary spending amid the pandemic. The adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17%, a decrease of 180 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $34 million in the quarter, an increase of $13 million compared to the prior year, driven by increased interest expense from higher outstanding debt balances as well as decreased interest income due to lower interest rates. Other nonoperating expense totaled $5 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16% and was favorable to our expectations, driven primarily by a discrete tax benefit recognized in the quarter. We had expected this benefit to occur later in the year. 
Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of 8% to 9% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil as well as approximately 300 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth. Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates and surgical procedures will stay below pre-COVID levels with rates improving throughout the year and exiting the fourth quarter with admissions down low single digits and procedures roughly flat. 
Moving down the P&L, we now anticipate adjusted operating margin to expand between 40 to 60 basis points, reflecting the strong first quarter performance and the inclusion of the Caelyx/Doxil OUS rights. We expect this benefit to be partially offset by increased supply chain and manufacturing-related costs, given the increase in commodity pricing and freight transport as well as a negative impact from foreign exchange. 
For the year, we expect an average adjusted tax rate of approximately 18% and a full year diluted average share count between the range of 510 million to 515 million shares. Based on these factors, we expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.47 to $3.55 per diluted share. Specific to the second quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of 14% to 15% on a reported basis, 8% to 9% on a constant currency basis and 7% to 8% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.72 to $0.75 per diluted share.  
With that, we can now open up the call for Q&A."

But you did raise EPS guidance a little more than the first quarter beat. So I was hoping to get a sense of some of the items impacting second quarters. There's still a lag from high-cost inventory flowing through COGS, et cetera, and how to think about the margin expansion in the back half of the year?"
254571,709056523,2262482,"Baxter International Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Sure.

Robbie, consistent with how we outlined performance at the beginning of the -- when we gave guidance originally, we really do see this as a tale of 2 different halves, with the shape of the second half being very different than the shape of the first half. In part, that relates to admissions and surgical procedures. And in part, it relates to certain manufacturing costs, which we expect to subside to the back part of the year. 
And so first, as it relates to admissions, our second quarter assumption and admissions, first quarter, we saw about 8% down relative to pre-COVID levels. In the second quarter, we're expecting to see roughly 7% down. That's kind of the working assumption that we have in place. But in the back half of the year, we'll expect to see roughly 3% down. And so we do see a market improvement from first half to second half that benefits the top line. And then from the margin standpoint, we will see incremental improvements  in the second half of the year, in particular, with respect to gross margin that start to drive our performance up. 
And so in fact, the second half average margin will be in the 20% range or a little bit north of that as implied by the guidance that we've shared. Now specific to the second quarter, there are a few moving pieces. What I would say is we do have sequential improvement in sales that contributes approximately $0.10 of earnings impact roughly all in. And included in that is maybe a couple of cents related to the Doxil acquisition. Now -- but as we think about the second quarter, 1 of the things that's really important for us is setting the stage for a successful acceleration in the second half and setting the stage for a successful 2022. 
We are making meaningful OpEx investments in the second quarter to support that acceleration. And so we're seeing roughly about $0.10 or so of OpEx investments that take place in the second quarter. And then from a financial statement standpoint, there is a tax rate. We see the tax rate from the first quarter to the second quarter tick up roughly $0.03. We saw a discrete item in the first quarter of the year. We don't expect that to repeat in the second quarter. Therefore, there's a bit of a tick up. 
So I think broadly speaking, as you say, we're really pleased with the first quarter performance. It's a nice start to the year. It sets the stage for a successful performance throughout the rest of the year. But I view Q2 as a little bit more of a stage setter on the way to a really solid second half of the year."

On margin enhancements as we've been for the last 5 years. So there will definitely be some discussion of that. The one thing I would caution you is, remember, we always have a seasonality factor in play. And Q1, Q2 are typically lower than Q3, Q4 for a whole host of reasons.

Now we have specific programs that we've earmarked on both the gross margin and the cost side. 
If you'll recall in our last earnings call, we talked a little bit about the digital transformation that's underway led by Andy Frye and Talvis, our CIO. We've got an enormous amount of work ongoing in terms of cost improvements and efficiency enhancements related to that transformation. And also, Jim Borzi, our Head of Manufacturing and Operations, has a lot in terms of accelerating operating performance in the second half of the year. So all of those things will feature prominently as we look at Q3, Q4 and beyond. But we do need -- as is always the case, if you're falling short of revenue expectations, it creates a real absorption challenge in the manufacturing facilities. It creates a real absorption challenge as you look at things like fixed SG&A and R&D costs. 
So there is some -- it's important that we do see the acceleration on the revenue line in order for us to deliver what our expectations are. Now having said that, I do believe that we have the right revenue projection in place. And I think our ability to forecast revenues in light of this highly volatile environment has really improved quite substantially over the last 18 months. So I think the assumptions that I outlined that support the second half hopefully prove reasonable, but we'll have to wait and see."

So we have a number of sources. And then, of course, there's a lot of publicly available sources. But early on in the pandemic, if we rewind over a year, we didn't have the availability of data sources for the -- for information because, frankly, this was -- hospital admissions was never a variable that was very concerning to us. It was always something that would grow low single digits each year. And so in light of the Q2 last year, where we saw a 20% decline. 
[indiscernible] and team started spending a lot of their energy and effort assessing and understanding data sources. But then the second thing that we did was we started to do some work in terms of anticipating and forecasting with some artificial intelligence, looking at a variety of data sources that could predict behavior. And ultimately, what we found is, in the fourth quarter of last year, in the first quarter of this year, the model that we built, and I'm talking most specifically to the U.S. because I think that's a big driver for us, and it's also a discrete data set that lends itself to a level of analytics that perhaps other markets, it's a little more challenging.  
What we found was Q4, Q1, we were largely in line with our expectations within the tolerance range that was acceptable. And so we've applied that same analytic lens looking forward. Now we could be wrong, of course. And we've quantified in the past what that -- what a mistake would cost us from an admission standpoint. I believe 1 percentage point in the U.S. per month is a $2 million. 
And so that's the sort of the penalty for being wrong. But I think throughout -- once we got through Q2 of last year, our ability to anticipate what the outcome was going to be, has been significantly better. And past performance is no guarantee of future performance. We have caveats related to forward-looking statements that Clare shared at the outset of this call. But I feel like we have done a nice job really, really assessing this and understanding drivers going forward. 
I don't know, Joe, if you'd like to add anything."

From the moment we buy raw material, either whatever raw material it is, all the way to the delivery to the customer. We have specifics. As a matter of fact, coincidentally, I just reviewed that yesterday with the team. We have programs in all areas, from cost of raw materials to the cost reductions in our manufacturing facilities. The ability to predict cost of logistics, which has been a headwind for the company and for many other companies around the globe, with containers and shipping lanes being clocked up. So those things are the focus of Baxter.  
And I saw the numbers yesterday, there's a progressive increase in net cost reduction of integrated supply chain that pleased me. The second thing is digital transformation because Baxter did indeed remove cost from a G&A, but not enough. We got to a point that now we need to redesign our processes. So I just give an example to supplement Bob's question to Jay is finance organizations a large group within the company. Does a great job. But also, we can do things in a much more concise and better way. 
So we're looking at that from digital transformation of our quality organizations, regulatory affairs, as well as the research and development. We shift research and development within the company. People ask me why don't we spend more in research and development? Always, we can spend more money. There's always opportunity to put more money. But we are now, this year, piping out 22 new products, a brand-new platform of pumps that this company never had the capability to develop, and we're doing this with the R&D resources that we have by shifting location of labor, but also becoming more effective in doing that. And lastly is the mix of this new product that will come into play. For the margin accretion. So there is opportunity in G&A and gross margin via reduction in costs from integrated supply chain as well as the mix due to new products."

And so -- and our April trends, what we've seen thus far is, broadly speaking, supportive of the comments that I've made. Now having said that, for all of the reasons that you know well, Pito, the second quarter of the year represents a very, very easy comp for areas like medication delivery. So whereas in the U.S. and globally, we saw a decline in the first quarter of the year.

But when we look at the dynamics of the market, we still see the U.S., the PD patient growth, even with that in the U.S. was 3.3%, and the outlook for the year is 6%. The issue that was dampened the number overall is significant reduction in Latin American patient senses, primarily Mexico, some in Brazil as well, due to fatalities, due to COVID-19. And also a reduction in sensors until the -- once COVID hit in Europe. Europe was starting to recover and start to gain really good momentum until COVID hit. So we are optimistic even for PD this year, different than HD, 6.1% outlook for the year. 
And the dynamics are correct, to your point, a PD is shown to be a home therapy that in crisis like a pandemic shows an increased value of convenience and safety for the patient by staying home that have to travel to the clinic. And I think I believe that the ESRD disease state in the U.S., the change in guidance for home therapies, you're going to continue to see this therapy gaining momentum.

And I'll answer your second question first, in relation to puts and takes with respect to the full year guidance. Overall, if we take the full year and disregard the quarters for a moment, the strong operational performance that we've seen from a sales standpoint, plus some incremental vaccines adds roughly $0.10 to our overall guidance. In addition to that, we have some OpEx savings, that's about $0.04. But one of the things that we highlighted in the script was the supply chain cost that we've seen in the short term. And really, with the highly volatile environment. 
From a global logistics market standpoint from a raw materials pricing standpoint, resin prices. Some of this is impacted by the freeze in Texas, some of this impacted by the global supply chain challenges along with Suez Canal, we are expecting a fairly substantial increase in supply chain costs related to those discrete items. And that really eats up the vast majority of those upsides that I characterized a little bit ago. 
And then in addition, we've added the Doxil acquisition that's a little north of $0.10 in terms of full year impact. FX and other items, all of that stuff kind of washes on a full year basis, although we do see some movement amongst quarters. So that really is the overall drivers of the full year performance. And what I would say is very excited about the strong operational performance. Very mindful of the current environment that we're faced with, with respect to shipping and container costs, resin costs, et cetera. We do expect that will alleviate over time. We've tried to put the right projections in given the acute situation that we've seen over the last several months, and we anticipate for at least the next several months."

And if I understand the annual guide correctly, the constant currency guide raise was mostly a function of Caelyx. So I guess my question is, is the underlying business coming in better than expectations in Q1, why wouldn't that flow through in the back half?"

But given where we are in the year, given some of the challenges that the renal patient census is faced with at this point, it's a little difficult to call full year strength at this stage. We'll have to continue to watch. If the renal patient senses stabilizes, if admissions and surgical procedures come in line or better than what we've modeled, we'll certainly update. But at this point in time, I think we've got a reasonable guidance for the balance of the year."

We just did a couple of small ones in the pharmaceuticals business. We'll continue to look for those opportunities. 
We're going into adjacencies. We're looking at things to shore up where we can have advantage. But more importantly, also, we're starting to look at the health care theater in general and trying to anticipate with what we saw last year and how health care is moving in the direction is moving than said, where should Baxter go. And we're always talk about intelligent devices. We are talking about the integration with the hospital systems, with the deployment of our own gateway for the new pumps. 
So if you think about how do you participate where actually the puck is going, not the puck is today, so the company can revitalize itself as well. So these are all areas that we look. We are very eager to continue to explore opportunities. But as I always say, if we do not find the right opportunity, we're not going to sit on cash and have cash burn a hole in our pockets. We will bring either share buyback as well as increase in dividends."

I will begin with a review of Baxter's second quarter results, and also share a few words about our upcoming investor conference. Jay will then provide a deeper dive on our financial performance and outlook. And we will wrap up with Q&A. 
Baxter delivered second quarter sales growth of 14% as reported, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by the ongoing global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in favorable performance comparisons for a number of our businesses versus the prior year as the pandemic affect the patient treatment dynamics and demand mix in the prior year. On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, up 25% year-over-year in our original guidance. All 3 of our geographic segments contributed to the positive quarterly performance. The Americas and EMEA achieved high single-digit growth and APAC achieved a low double-digit growth, all at constant currency rates. While we are clearly experiencing recovery from the pandemic across all 3 of our geographies, the situation on the ground varies considerably by market. 
As always, we salute the health care workers who continue to face enormous challenges every day on the front lines of care. I also want to express my personal gratitude to all the Baxter employees who tirelessly support these clinicians and caregivers while helping to ensure we address the needs of patients across our vast life-sustaining portfolio. 
Turning to our performance by business. 5 of our 7 product categories achieved growth on a constant currency basis. Performance was led by BioPharma Solutions and Advanced Surgery, which delivered 49% and 48% constant currency growth, respectively. Growth in BPS was filled by contracts to assist in the manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. Advanced Surgery growth reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year spurred by improving surgical volumes as pandemic recovery advances globally. 
As you saw in this morning's press release, we are building on our momentum in Advanced Surgery with the acquisition of [indiscernible] polysecaride hemostatic system.  [indiscernible] marks our entry into the global hemostatic powder segment, which will allow us to serve surgeons in their patients with an even broader range of options to control into operative bleeding across active and passive solutions. 
Our Medication Delivery business grew 12% at constant currency rates, also benefiting from a favorable comparison driven by improving rates of admissions at hospitals as compared to the prior year. Looking ahead, Medication Delivery is continuing to position for the U.S. launch of our NOVUM IQ infusion platform including those IQ safety software and our IQ enterprise digital connectivity suite. 
Following up on our recent FDA resubmission, we are now in the process of responding an additional information request from the agency. We continue to expect to launch NOVUM IQ in the U.S. before the end of the year. Our Clinical Nutrition category advanced single digits at constant currency rates, reflecting ongoing strength in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals also grew at single digits constant currency. Adjusting for the recent Calyx and Doxil acquisition, Pharmaceuticals was flat year-over-year, although we expect competitive pressures to continue in this marketplace, we remain focused on launching molecules with differentiated presentations and/or complex formulations. 
We have several projected launches of new generic injectables in the coming years that will help to fuel growth in this business and mitigate some of the competitive pressures we are experiencing. Performance in Renal Care was comparable to the prior year at constant rates with growth in the U.S., offset by a decline across international markets. On a global basis, the market continues to be dampened by the impact of the pandemic, which has contributed to a higher mortality rate for patients with kidney disease combined with a slowing of new patient diagnosis. 
As we said last quarter, we expect the recovery of this market to continue, returning to its pre-COVID dynamics over the next 1 to 2 years. In this quarter, we saw returned positive year-over-year PD patient growth globally including mid-single-digit PD patient growth in the U.S. The pandemic has highlighted the vital importance of the home dialysis therapy option. And as a leader in recognized innovator in this space, it has never been more urgent to support education, awareness and access. 
Our global safer at home campaign, which has been underway for more than a year is dedicated to helping clinicians, patients and other stakeholders, learn more about the benefits of home care, particularly amid pandemic conditions. Lastly, performance in acute therapies declined mid-single digits at constant currency rates year-over-year. This decline was expected given the extremely challenging comparison following last year's historic surge in demand for continuous renal replacement that have in light of the pandemic. We remain excited by the prospects for the advanced treatment options in the CRT market. 
In fact, Q2 marked the launch of PrisMax to the latest version of our nex-gen platform for CRRT and organ support with embedded TrueView digital health technology. From an ESG perspective, earlier this month, we announced our 2030 corporate responsibility commitment, which will help to drive Baxter's environmental social governance efforts over the next decade and beyond. This work is integral to how we advance our mission to save and sustain lives and serve all of our stakeholders from patients and clinicians to our communities and investors. Our 2030 commitment is built around the 3 overarching objectives, empower our patients, protect our planet and champion our people and communities. All details can be found in our 2020 corporate responsibility report now posted on baxter.com. 
Briefly looking ahead, we continue operating in an environment of some uncertainty. We fully anticipate the broader trend of pandemic recovery to sustain but geographic disparities and emerging variants could slow and undermine the pace. All stores like our health care peers and countless other companies, Baxter is subject to the impact of inflation in the rising cost of freight, fuel and other raw materials and commodities. We will continue to look for opportunities to offset the impact from these incremental expenses. 
As I wrap up, I want to highlight that our 2020 investor conference will be held on Monday, September 20 in Deerfield, Illinois. At the conference, we plan to focus on our key strategic objectives to enhance growth and drive innovation. In addition, as a critical part of our ongoing business transformation. 
Jim [indiscernible] is Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, will outline the next phase of our manufacturing supply chain journey, which is expected to enhance our operational effectiveness and drive margin improvement. 
Now I'll pass it to Jay, who will share a closer look at our results and our outlook for the balance of the year."

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Second quarter 2021 global sales of $3.1 billion [ advanced ] 14% on a reported basis, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an operational basis. Sales growth this quarter reflects the ongoing recovery in hospital and surgical volumes, along with the benefit from COVID vaccines. We estimate these factors contributed just over 450 basis points of sales growth in the quarter. OUS sales of Calix, Doxil totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter. 
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 25% to $0.80 per share, exceeding our guidance range driven by disciplined operational execution, and a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories. Starting with our 3 regional segments. Sales in the Americas increased 8% on both a constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 8% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an operational basis, and sales in our Asia Pac region advanced 10% on a constant currency basis and 9% operationally. 
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for our Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusted for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the U.S. to Calix and Doxil. 
Global sales for Renal care were $964 million, were flat on currency basis a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by our PD business, where we observed both the sequential and year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes. This was partially offset by declining international sales of in-center HD dialyzers, reflecting the impact from the pandemic as well as competitive dynamics. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnoses resulting from the pandemic. Our expectation remains that PD patient volumes will continue to ramp over the course of the year, although the pace may vary by market. 
In particular, we are monitoring COVID resurgences in Asia Pac and parts of Europe. Sales in Medication Delivery of $697 million, increased 12% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in this business reflects the recovery in the pace of hospital admissions in many markets following the height of the pandemic last year. 
We estimate that in the second quarter, the rate of U.S. hospital admissions was down approximately 7% as compared to pre-COVID levels, a market improvement from the second quarter of 2020, which saw U.S. admissions down approximately 20%. 
Pharmaceutical sales of $546 million advanced 5% on a constant currency basis and were flat to prior year on an operational basis. Performance in the quarter benefited from the recovery in surgical procedures and hospital admissions. Demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and the contribution from OUS sales of Calix Doxil. This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. generic injectables portfolio, which faced a headwind from prior year sales of select injectable drugs used to treat critical COVID-19 patients as well as increased competitive activity for certain molecules. 
Moving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $237 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven primarily by growth in the U.S. partially offset by lower international sales of vitamins resulting from supply constraints. 
Sales in Advanced Surgery were $256 million, increasing 48% on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we estimate surgical procedures were at or slightly above pre-COVID levels, contributing to strength in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $188 million, declining 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the challenging year-over-year comparison due to surge in product demand this time last year related to the COVID pandemic. As Joe mentioned, we anticipate that COVID-related demand for CRRT will moderate this year, but will improve over time through the launch of new products and increased awareness of this therapy. 
BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $183 million, representing growth of 49% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines. 
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42.6% increased by 100 basis points over the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in manufacturing and a favorable product mix as the impact from COVID receives. Adjusted SG&A of $649 million increased 12% on a reported basis, reflecting the impact from foreign exchange, the improvement in sales and resulting increase in commissions and increased promotional spend in support of new product launches. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $139 million increased 18% on a reported basis driven by the impact of foreign exchange and investments in our new product pipeline. Both adjusted SG&A and R&D spending reflect a somewhat more normalized level of spend as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a result of the pandemic, particularly those related to employee bonus accruals. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17.2%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. 
Net interest expense totaled $34 million in the quarter, and other nonoperating income contributed $2 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, an increase over the prior year driven by lower stock-based compensation award deductions as compared to the prior year period. The tax rate was favorable to our expectations driven by a favorable change in earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.80 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.72 to $0.75 per share. 
Within the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $300 million or 3.7 million shares of common stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $600 million or 7.3 million shares of common stock, which has been partially offset by option-related dilution. On a net basis, our outstanding share count has declined by approximately 5 million shares through the second quarter. In addition, during the second quarter, we announced a 14% increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate. The strength of our financial position has fueled our ability to increase our quarterly dividend rate on an annual basis for the sixth consecutive year. We continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is balanced between inorganic and organic initiatives with the objective of accelerating growth and expanding margins, driving innovation and returning value to our shareholders. 
With respect to cash flow in the first half of 2021, we've generated $854 million of operating cash flow and $525 million in free cash flow. 
Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 8% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Calix Doxil as well as approximately 250 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth. Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates will stay below pre-COVID levels with rates improving throughout the year, and exiting down low single digits. Based on surgical procedure data in the U.S. to date, we now expect surgical procedures will continue to be a 100% of pre-COVID levels for the remainder of the year. 
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand between 40 to 60 basis points. For the year, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17.5% and a full year diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.49 to $3.55 per diluted share. 
Specific to the third quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 9% on a reported basis, approximately 7% on a constant currency basis and approximately 6% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open the call up for Q&A."

And Joe, I realize you won't talk about market speculation, but I do think it would be helpful for investors to hear maybe a little bit of an update on your thoughts on M&A generally and maybe talk about what the circumstances would have to be for you to pursue a larger deal.

I'll address the renal question first from a Q2 performance standpoint and then turn it over to Joe for the second question. Overall, as you mentioned, the U.S. had a solid performance in Renal growing 4%. We ended up -- TD was a little bit in excess of that 5% with the HD business slightly below that. And then internationally, you're right, we had a decline in the quarter, which we do not expect to continue. There were a couple of drivers of that. One is we've talked historically about patient census challenges, and that being a headwind that we're facing and contending with this year, which has kind of disrupted the normal orderly cadence of patient growth that we see internationally. And that was pronounced in the second quarter. Our PD business actually slightly declined. So 1% decline in the quarter. We do expect that to return starting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And frankly, we've seen, in certain markets, delays in procedures of establishing new PD patients, like, for example, in Japan, along with this patient census issue. All of these things came together to impact the growth rate in the quarter. Like I say, in the second half of the year, we do expect to see an acceleration and feel solid about that. 
And then in the HD business, we did have some pricing competition on dialyzers. We see that from time-to-time. So the HD business declined mid-single digits, and we will expect that to normalize in the second half of the year. So while -- the Renal business has been a fairly consistent performer for us internationally. And if you look at that over a series of multiple quarters, I think you can expect -- or you can gain some confidence in the second half of the year, we'll grow that business internationally, roughly 3%. And I'll turn it over to Joe to address the other question."

First is size being a secondary conversation. First is you strategically fit for the company. We look at the areas of growth for the future. You look what is going to make a difference in the health care in 5 to 10 years, where does Baxter is going. It's now where the puck is where the puck is going. Sometimes we get it attached to growth rates and things of of where things are. We've got to look where things are going. And Baxter is doing a lot in connected health, and we need to make sure that we have the ability to deploy capital in that area as well as adjacencies. Going into areas of no correlation to Baxter to create a new lack of to presenting much more challenging environment for the company in terms of M&A. Not impossible to do it, but it's something that is more difficult. Second is how do we see returns. The returns are always the same. We look at internal rate of returns to be above our cost of capital, about a few hundred basis points as well as we look at ROIC very similarly on a 5-year base posted deal. 
We look also the ability for the company to generate cash flow and our ability to bring the company integrated into Baxter, which I feel confident that we, through our digital transformation, have a much better ability of bringing companies in than a few years ago. 
And the third and last one is that not every deal is created the same, and we examine multiple opportunities at all times. So the company has a significant amount of cash. And it doesn't go against deals. It goes back to the shareholders in form of -- in terms of buybacks as we have done. As you saw, we just did some buyback this quarter. And for the year, we are around $600 million. So this is how I think about M&A."

We watch that, of course, very carefully, and I've talked about the risk and the sensitivity around that in the past, and we're particularly watching given the delta variant, but feel solid that we've got our hands around this at this point. 
And so then as we translate that to the rest of the P&L, let me talk first about a full year basis and then maybe make some comments on the second half. On a full year basis, we are seeing some challenges in the Pharmaceuticals business related to competition and pricing. And so on a full year basis, probably $0.06 of a headwind from pharma offset by $0.06 of a benefit from our BioPharma Solutions business, which is performing better than our expectations. So those items sort of counteract each other. And then we have roughly $0.08 or so on a full year basis of global supply chain costs that we're contending with. And so essentially, we're seeing things like freight and premium freight cost, that's roughly $0.03. We actually have a fairly substantial manufacturing facility in Colombia. We've had a couple of cents of impact from Colombia unrest and ensuring we're getting product to our patients and product out of the country in an expeditious manner. And then, of course, through some purchase price variations, which there is some inflation in that rounding out the $0.08. 
But offsetting that, we have -- we're committed to really using resources efficiently as a company. And so we're able to counteract the vast majority of that. So roughly $0.07 of benefit from measures that we have in place that are enhanced versus our expectations, really looking at all of the spending categories and challenging ourselves to make sure that we're using resources as efficiently as possible. Of course, when we do those exercises, we don't touch things like quality or critical R&D programs, but we really do look hard at the cost base to ensure we're being efficient and offsetting where possible. 
So that's really the story on a full year basis. But if you think about it -- and then there's financial assumptions that kind of wash out. We had some benefit in the first half from a number of assumptions, and then we have some headwinds in the second half. But if you look at it exclusively from a second half standpoint, I'll say that FX is actually $0.03 of impact. So that is really one of the big drivers of the second half performance. We've seen dollar strengthening. And so that has an impact on our translation back of our overseas business. That's roughly $0.03. BPS and Pharma, again, kind of wash out in the second half. And then we have a couple of cents of supply chain expenses. But I think really the most notable impact to the second half is this foreign exchange impact that we're contending with right now."

So we are in process of delivering our portfolio. The conditions of the market have deteriorated in terms of pricing headwinds as well as COVID, with the patients that have not gone to a hospital, and the budget of the pharmacies, right? So when we look at this whole thing, where do we stand today? We still see the headwinds that, that business has. Don't confuse the whole category that we have, which is -- has 2 very separate businesses. One is our anesthesia business, which are gases. Instead of gases -- and that has declined consistently over the last 24 months because the type of delivery systems, the anesthesiologists are using across the globe for gas from our Pharmaceutical business. So I tell you that we just had 3 products, are conditionally approved. We're going to be launching 3 in the next 6 to 9 months. We are excited about the portfolio and follows the same recipe of difficult to formulate, and novel ways of delivering. 
So if you think about that, it is still a good business, has very, very, very strong and healthy profitability. So what we need to do is to make sure that our innovation will [ not ] stop, and we continue to bring products organically and sometimes inorganically to the portfolio to be able to augment the growth of this business and keep ahead of the competition. Baxter has put together a very good group of R&D scientists in the United States as well as India. And together, they are working 24 hours a day in tandem to be able to deliver on that. I'm still fan up that portfolio, understanding the headwinds that, that portfolio can have every so often is some drugs will go out in contribution based on competition, but then we're able to launch to launch new products. Remember, there are 22 new product launches this year, probably around half of them are Pharmaceutical products. So we do not see a long-term issue for this business, but more so a -- every so often issue that you have when you have competition coming into your market that has just happened in the last 12 months."

I -- when you think about 2019, you saw -- and you see how we are looking at for the rest of the year, we see this year as a recove",559,"Vijay, I think that there is changes in how patients are being treated and how hospitals are seeing the influx of patients. I -- when you think about 2019, you saw -- and you see how we are looking at for the rest of the year, we see this year as a recovery year where your admissions towards the end of the year, the exit into 2022, we'll be probably 100%, 98% to 100% of going back to the admission flow rates that we've had before. So if you think about the major dynamics of the market, I would say there is a move from the acute care to the less acute care. And what is the impact for Baxter? If you think about Baxter as a health care supply company with products that are a must-have independent of setting, we follow the patient with our products in many places. If you go to a less acute site, you will need a pump no matter what. You still need fluid, you need medicines, injectables. You need things that are needed to treat that patient. To the home side, we have that advantage and have spoken about the PD advantage that is a positive for the company, not only by the rule in the U.S. with a kidney dialysis and transplant changes that were done during President Trump's tenure, but also the place to be if you have sick patients that don't want to go to acute sites or dialysis clinics. So that is a positive. 
When we look at what I see is temporary. The inflation that we are seeing in the disruption -- in supply chain, I think not only Baxter is working hard to offset that, but also I don't believe those are fundamental changes that will alter the -- completely the going-forward dynamic of our logistic costs as well as raw material costs. We will face headwinds in this area. We have spoken about the cost of containers are very expensive, fuel and everything else. We're offsetting that, as you could see this quarter, and we have done for the year, and we plan to continue to do it. 
The thing is how do you see that? Is that a fundamental change in the cost structure? We don't think so. We think that, that will eventually subside. But at the moment, we don't have that in our numbers. In our numbers what we have is us offsetting headwinds coming in from the cost point of view. Market-wise, as I said, they are changed a significant amount of telehealth, connecting the dots of information coming from ICUs. So the better off -- we will be better off, but continue to develop our digital health products as we're doing. If you think about our share source with the companion -- with the mobile companion that we just launched earlier this year, a true view in our CRT as well as half of the portfolio with the FDA today. Regarding our new pump is a mechanical electrical pump is actually software that is going with it. that will be installed in the hospitals networks as gateway to be able to manage traffic and bring information back and forth. So that boat has shipped that both has sales. There's no way to not be in the connected market going forward."

As you know, Joe and I are both really focused on driving free cash flow and driving free cash flow performance sustainably. And frankly, we've made a series of decisions over the last couple of years to suboptimize the base case, to protect against severe situations that could emerge. All of these things were absolutely the right thing to do, carrying extra inventory into the pandemic. As we sit here today, carrying select inventory of incremental product. As we look at a hurricane season, which could be a challenge. And so these things have -- we've had a little bit excess inventory relative to our normal expectations. As we move towards the end of the year, and as we've been able to improve the predictability of sales by product line in a post-pandemic world, we'll start to be able to optimize cash flow a little bit more carefully and closely. 
And so I think as we move to 2022 and '23, we'll start to see more normal years for cash flow. Obviously, 2020 was a huge anomaly. 2021 continues to be anomalous because of, again, just really being sensitive to having enough product available to support patients in a very challenging situation. But as I said, I think as we emerge in 2022 and '23, we'll be able to optimize the inventory a little bit better, continue our focus on accounts receivable. And then furthermore, on the days payable really work to optimize that, working closely with our suppliers. 
And then finally, from a CapEx standpoint, there are certain investments that we always make, and we'll continue to make those, especially those that support growth in businesses like our PD business. So we'll continue to look for those value-creating opportunities, and those exist. So we'll have more CapEx, and that will be a continued area for us of great investment. But I think 2022 starts to become a more normal year and then even more so in future beyond that."

And is that something that we need to consider as we look over the long term for Baxter?"

The configuration of products in some of those sites are differently using hospitals. So price points may differ for products used in nonacute or step down -- significant step down of facilities that are not part of a hospital campus. But that is not -- there's no 2 different conversations going on. We believe that our products are -- have price consistency across customers. and we negotiate every single contract with the intent to have as much penetration as we can within that integrated supply chain for the hospital. So if you think about negotiations are all about class of products, and quality availability of products. And evidently, price is a big deal, no best price usually wins. So I don't see tremendous distinction."

We have some line of sight in the short term, but our crystal ball gets murky as we look towards year-end. That's very clear. And so I would say that 1 point of procedure volume in the U.S. is roughly $0.5 million of impact per month. And so that's something that we watch carefully. I think when we put together the sales guidance for the year, we have the ability to withstand a little bit of softness in surgical procedures and admissions as it relates to Delta variant. But this is an uncertainty that we're contending with, not only on the surgical procedure side, but also on the admission side. And I've talked historically about a lot of the work that we've done in terms of forecasting and modeling. And I think we've done a really good job kind of relating our business to some of these fundamental drivers. But you're right, there are -- this is a valve of world that we're living in today, and we'll have to watch carefully as we move through the rest of the year if the virus changes course substantially. At this point, we don't have any reason to believe that will be the case and feel good about the numbers. I've sized the downside risk, it's not enormous. So I think we're in okay shape."

I will begin with a review of Baxter's second quarter results, and also share a few words about our upcoming investor conference. Jay will then provide a deeper dive on our financial performance and outlook. And we will wrap up with Q&A. 
Baxter delivered second quarter sales growth of 14% as reported, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by the ongoing global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in favorable performance comparisons for a number of our businesses versus the prior year, as the pandemic affect the patient treatment dynamics and demand mix in the prior year. 
On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, up 25% year-over-year and exceeding our original guidance. All three of our geographic segments contributed to the positive quarterly performance. The Americas and EMEA achieved high single-digit growth and APAC achieved a low double-digit growth, all at constant currency rates. While we are clearly experiencing recovery from the pandemic across all three of our geographies, the situation on the ground varies considerably by market. 
As always, we salute the health care workers, who continue to face enormous challenges every day on the front lines of care. I also want to express my personal gratitude to all the Baxter employees, who tirelessly support these clinicians and caregivers while helping to ensure we address the needs of patients across our vast life-sustaining portfolio. 
Turning to our performance by business, 5 of our 7 product categories achieved growth on a constant currency basis. Performance was led by BioPharma Solutions and Advanced Surgery, which delivered 49% and 48% constant currency growth, respectively. Growth in BPS was filled by contracts to assist in the manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. Advanced Surgery growth reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year spurred by improving surgical volumes as pandemic recovery advances globally. 
As you saw in this morning's press release, we are building on our momentum in Advanced Surgery with the acquisition of PerClot Polysaccharide Hemostatic System. PerClot marks our entry into the global hemostatic powder segment, which will allow us to serve surgeons and their patients with an even broader range of options to control into operative bleeding across active and passive solutions. 
Our Medication Delivery business grew 12% at constant currency rates, also benefiting from a favorable comparison driven by improving rates of admissions at hospitals as compared to the prior year. Looking ahead, Medication Delivery is continuing to position for the U.S. launch of our NOVUM IQ infusion platform including those IQ safety software in our IQ enterprise digital connectivity suite. 
Following up on our recent FDA resubmission, we are now in the process of responding to an additional information request from the agency. We continue to expect to launch NOVUM IQ in the U.S. before the end of the year. 
Our Clinical Nutrition category advanced single digits at constant currency rates, reflecting ongoing strength in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals also grew at single digits constant currency. Adjusting for the recent Caelyx and Doxil acquisition, Pharmaceuticals was flat year-over-year. Although we expect competitive pressures to continue in this marketplace, we remain focused on launching molecules with differentiated presentations and/or complex formulations. 
We have several projected launches of new generic injectables in the coming years that will help to fuel growth in this business and mitigate some of the competitive pressures we are experiencing. Performance in Renal Care was comparable to the prior year at constant rates with growth in the U.S., offset by a decline across international markets. On a global basis, the market continues to be dampened by the impact of the pandemic, which has contributed to a higher mortality rate for patients with kidney disease combined with a slowing of new patient diagnosis. 
As we said last quarter, we expect the recovery of this market to continue, returning to its pre-COVID dynamics over the next 1 to 2 years. In this quarter, we saw returned positive year-over-year PD patient growth globally including mid-single-digit PD patient growth in the U.S. 
The pandemic has highlighted the vital importance of the home dialysis therapy option. And as a leader in recognized innovator in this space, it has never been more urgent to support education, awareness and access. 
Our global safer at home campaign, which has been underway for more than a year, is dedicated to helping clinicians, patients and other stakeholders learn more about the benefits of home care, particularly amid pandemic conditions. Lastly, performance in Acute Therapies declined mid-single digits at constant currency rates year-over-year. This decline was expected given the extremely challenging comparison following last year's historic surge in demand for continuous renal replacement therapy in light of the pandemic. We remain excited by the prospects for the advanced treatment options in the CRRT market. 
In fact, Q2 marked the launch of PrisMax to the latest version of our nex-gen platform for CRRT and organ support with embedded TrueView digital health technology. From an ESG perspective, earlier this month, we announced our 2030 corporate responsibility commitment, which will help to drive Baxter's environmental, social, governance efforts over the next decade and beyond. 
This work is integral to how we advance our mission to save and sustain lives and serve all of our stakeholders from patients and clinicians to our communities and investors. Our 2030 commitment is built around the three overarching objectives, empower our patients, protect our planet and champion our people and communities. Full details can be found in our 2020 corporate responsibility report now posted on baxter.com. 
Briefly looking ahead, we continue operating in an environment of some uncertainty. We fully anticipate broader trend of pandemic recovery to sustain, but geographic disparities and emerging variants could slow and undermine the pace. All storages like our health care peers and countless other companies, Baxter is subject to the impact of inflation in the rising cost of freight, fuel and other raw materials and commodities. We will continue to look for opportunities to offset the impact from these incremental expenses. 
As I wrap up, I want to highlight that our 2021 investor conference will be held on Monday, September 20 in Deerfield, Illinois. At the conference, we plan to focus on our key strategic objectives to enhance growth and drive innovation. In addition, as a critical part of our ongoing business transformation, Jim Borzi, Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, will outline the next phase of our manufacturing supply chain journey, which is expected to enhance our operational effectiveness and drive margin improvement. 
Now I'll pass it to Jay, who will share a closer look at our results and our outlook for the balance of the year."
254571,718658980,2354577,"Baxter International Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Second quarter 2021 global sales of $3.1 billion advanced 14% on a reported basis, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an operationa",1376,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Second quarter 2021 global sales of $3.1 billion advanced 14% on a reported basis, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an operational basis. Sales growth this quarter reflects the ongoing recovery in hospital and surgical volumes, along with the benefit from COVID vaccines. We estimate these factors contributed just over 450 basis points of sales growth in the quarter. OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter. 
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 25% to $0.80 per share, exceeding our guidance range driven by disciplined operational execution, and a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories. Starting with our three regional segments. Sales in the Americas increased 8% on both a constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 8% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an operational basis, and sales in our Asia Pac region advanced 10% on a constant currency basis and 9% operationally. 
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for our Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusted for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the U.S. of the Caelyx and Doxil. 
Global sales for Renal care were $964 million, were flat on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by our PD business, where we observed both the sequential and year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes. This was partially offset by declining international sales of in-center HD dialyzers, reflecting the impact from the pandemic as well as competitive dynamics. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnoses resulting from the pandemic. Our expectation remains that PD patient volumes will continue to ramp over the course of the year, although the pace may vary by market. 
In particular, we are monitoring COVID resurgences in Asia Pac and parts of the Europe. Sales in Medication Delivery of $697 million, increased 12% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in this business reflects the recovery in the pace of hospital admissions in many markets following the height of the pandemic last year. 
We estimate that in the second quarter, the rate of U.S. hospital admissions was down approximately 7% as compared to pre-COVID levels, a market improvement from the second quarter of 2020, which saw U.S. admissions down approximately 20%. 
Pharmaceutical sales of $546 million, advanced 5% on a constant currency basis and were flat to prior year on an operational basis. Performance in the quarter benefited from the recovery in surgical procedures and hospital admissions, demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and the contribution from OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil. This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. generic injectables portfolio, which faced a headwind from prior year sales of select injectable drugs used to treat critical COVID-19 patients as well as increased competitive activity for certain molecules. 
Moving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $237 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven primarily by growth in the U.S., partially offset by lower international sales of vitamins resulting from supply constraints. 
Sales in Advanced Surgery were $256 million, increasing 48% on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we estimate surgical procedures were at or slightly above pre-COVID levels, contributing to strength in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $188 million, declining 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the challenging year-over-year comparison due to surge in product demand this time last year related to the COVID pandemic. As Joe mentioned, we anticipate that COVID-related demand for CRRT will moderate this year, but will improve over time through the launch of new products and increased awareness of this therapy. 
BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $183 million, representing growth of 49% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines. 
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42.6% increased by 100 basis points over the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in manufacturing and a favorable product mix as the impact from COVID receives. Adjusted SG&A of $649 million increased 12% on a reported basis, reflecting the impact from foreign exchange, the improvement in sales and resulting increase in commissions and increased promotional spend in support of new product launches. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $139 million increased 18% on a reported basis driven by the impact of foreign exchange and investments in our new product pipeline. Both adjusted SG&A and R&D spending reflect a somewhat more normalized level of spend, as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a result of the pandemic, particularly those related to employee bonus accruals. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17.2%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year.  Net interest expense totaled $34 million in the quarter, and other nonoperating income contributed $2 million in the quarter. 
The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, an increase over the prior year driven by lower stock-based compensation award deductions as compared to the prior year period. The tax rate was favorable to our expectations driven by a favorable change in earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.80 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.72 to $0.75 per share. 
Within the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $300 million or 3.7 million shares of common stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $600 million or 7.3 million shares of common stock, which has been partially offset by option-related dilution. On a net basis, our outstanding share count has declined by approximately 5 million shares through the second quarter. In addition, during the second quarter, we announced a 14% increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate. The strength of our financial position has fueled our ability to increase our quarterly dividend rate on an annual basis for the sixth consecutive year. 
We continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is balance between inorganic and organic initiatives with the objective of accelerating growth and expanding margins, driving innovation and returning value to our shareholders. 
With respect to cash flow in the first half of 2021, we've generated $854 million of operating cash flow and $525 million in free cash flow. 
Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 8% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil as well as approximately 250 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth. 
Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates will stay below pre-COVID levels with rates improving throughout the year, and exiting down low single digits. Based on surgical procedure data in the U.S. to date, we now expect surgical procedures will continue to be a 100% of pre-COVID levels for the remainder of the year. 
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand between 40 to 60 basis points. For the year, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17.5% and a full year diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $3.49 to $3.55 per diluted share. 
Specific to the third quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 9% on a reported basis, approximately 7% on a constant currency basis and approximately 6% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open the call up for Q&A."

So that's question number one. And then a follow-up on  question number 2 is more strategic for Joe. And Joe, I realize you won't talk about market speculation, but I do think it would be helpful for investors to hear maybe a little bit of an update on your thoughts on M&A generally and maybe talk about what the circumstances would have to be for you to pursue a larger deal? How important it is that M&A improves the company's growth rate, things of that nature? I just think an update there would be much appreciated. So those are my 2 questions."

I'll address the Renal question first from a Q2 performance standpoint and then turn it over to Joe for the second question. Overall, as you mentioned, the U.S. had a solid performance in Renal growing 4%. We ended up -- TD was a little bit in excess of that 5% with the HD business slightly below that. And then internationally, you're right, we had a decline in the quarter, which we do not expect to continue. There were a couple of drivers of that. One is we've talked historically about patient census challenges, and that being a headwind that we're facing and contending with this year, which is kind of disrupted the normal orderly cadence of patient growth that we see internationally. And that was pronounced in the second quarter. Our PD business actually slightly declined, so 1% decline in the quarter. We do expect that to return starting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And frankly, we've seen, in certain markets, delays in procedures of establishing new PD patients, like, for example, in Japan, along with this patient census issue. All of these things came together to impact the growth rate in the quarter. Like I say, in the second half of the year, we do expect to see an acceleration and feel solid about that. 
And then in the HD business, we did have some pricing competition on dialyzers. We see that from time-to-time. So the HD business declined in mid-single digits, and we will expect that to normalize in the second half of the year. So while -- the Renal business has been a fairly consistent performer for us internationally. And if you look at that over a series of multiple quarters, I think you can expect -- or you can gain some confidence in the second half of the year, we'll grow that business internationally, roughly 3%. And I'll turn it over to Joe to address the other question."

First is size being a secondary conversation. First is you strategically fit for the company. We look at the areas of growth for the future. You look what is going to make a difference in the healthcare in 5 to 10 years, where this Baxter is going. It's now where the puck is where the puck is going. Sometimes we get it attached to growth rates and things of where things are. We've got to look where things are going. And Baxter is doing a lot in connected health, and we need to make sure that we have the ability to deploy capital in that area as well as adjacencies. 
Going into areas of no correlation to Baxter to create [indiscernible] presenting much more challenging environment for the company in terms of M&A. Not impossible to do it, but it's something that is more difficult. Second is how do we see returns. The returns are always the same. We look at internal rate of returns to be above our cost of capital, about a few hundred basis points as well as we look at ROIC very similarly on a 5-year base posted deal. 
We look also the ability for the company to generate cash flow and our ability to bring the company integrated into Baxter, which I feel confident that we, through our digital transformation, have a much better ability of bringing companies in than a few years ago. 
And the third and last one is that not every deal is created the same, and we examine multiple opportunities at all times. So the company has a significant amount of cash. And it doesn't go against deals. It goes back to the shareholders in form of -- in terms of buybacks, as we have done. As you saw, we just did some buyback this quarter. And for the year, we are around $600 million. So this is how I think about M&A."

Thus far, we're seeing a fairly stable admissions environment relative to our expectations. Underlying our guidance, we're expecting roughly 98% of admissions in the United States in the fourth quarter of the year. We watch that, of course, very carefully, and I've talked about the risk and the sensitivity around that in the past, and we're particularly watching given the delta variant, but feel solid that we've got our hands around this at this point. 
And so then as we translate that to the rest of the P&L, let me talk first about a full year basis and then maybe make some comments on the second half. On a full year basis, we are seeing some challenges in the Pharmaceuticals business related to competition and pricing. And so on a full year basis, probably $0.06 of a headwind from pharma offset by $0.06 of a benefit from our BioPharma Solutions business, which is performing better than our expectations. So those items kind of -- sort of counteract each other. And then we have roughly $0.08 or so on a full year basis of global supply chain costs that we're contending with. And so essentially, we're seeing things like freight and premium freight cost, that's roughly $0.03. We actually have a fairly substantial manufacturing facility in Colombia. We've had a couple of cents of impact from Colombia unrest and ensuring we're getting product to our patients and product out of the country in an expeditious manner. And then, of course, through some purchase price variations, which there is some inflation in that rounding out the $0.08. 
But offsetting that, we have -- we're committed to really using resources efficiently as a company. And so we're able to counteract the vast majority of that. So roughly $0.07 of benefit from measures that we have in place that are enhanced versus our expectations, really looking at all of the spending categories and challenging ourselves to make sure that we're using resources as efficiently as possible. Of course, when we do those exercises, we don't touch things like quality or critical R&D programs, but we really do look hard at the cost base to ensure we're being efficient and offsetting where possible. 
So that's really the story on a full year basis. But if you think about it -- and then there's financial assumptions that kind of wash out, we had some benefit in the first half from a number of assumptions, and then we have some headwinds in the second half. But if you look at it exclusively from a second half standpoint, I'll say that FX is actually $0.03 of impact. So that is really one of the big drivers of the second half performance. We've seen dollar strengthening. And so that has an impact on our translation back of our overseas business. That's roughly $0.03. BPS and Pharma, again, kind of wash out in the second half. And then we have a couple of cents of supply chain expenses. But I think really the most notable impact to the second half is this foreign exchange impact that we're contending with right now."

So we are in process of delivering our portfolio. The conditions of the market have deteriorated in terms of pricing headwinds as well as COVID, with the patients that have not gone to a hospital, and the budget of the pharmacies, right? So when we look at this whole thing, where do we stand today? We still see the headwinds that, that business has. Don't confuse the whole category that we have, which is -- has two very separate businesses. One is our anesthesia business, which are gases. Instead of gases -- and that has declined consistently over the last 24 months because the type of delivery systems the anesthesiologists are using across the globe for gas from our Pharmaceutical business. So I tell you that we just had three products conditionally approved. We're going to be launching three in the next 6 to 9 months. We are excited about the portfolio and follows the same recipe of difficult to formulate, and novel ways of delivering. 
So if you think about that, it is still a good business, has very, very, very strong and healthy profitability. So what we need to do is to make sure that our innovation will -- does not stop, and we continue to bring products organically and sometimes inorganically to the portfolio to be able to augment the growth of this business and keep ahead of the competition. Baxter has put together a very good group of R&D scientists in the United States as well as India. And together, they are working 24 hours a day in tandem to be able to deliver on that. I'm still fan up that portfolio, understanding the headwinds that, that portfolio can have every so often, as some drugs will go out in contribution based on competition, but then we're able to launch new products. Remember, there are 22 new product launches this year, probably around half of them are Pharmaceutical products. So we do not see a long-term issue for this business, but more so a -- every so often issue that you have -- when you have competition coming into your market that has just happened in the last 12 months."

I would say that the PD market is still very much a good market to be in. It has grown above the overall renal dialysis business across the globe.

I -- when you think about 2019, you saw -- and you see how we are looking at for the rest of the year, we see this year as a recovery year where the admissions towards the end of the year, they exit into 2022, will be probably 100% -- 98% to 100% of going back to the admission flow rates that we've had before. So if you think about the major dynamics of the market, I would say there is a move from the acute care to the less acute care. And what is the impact for Baxter? If you think about Baxter as a healthcare supply company, with products that are must have, independents that are setting. We follow the patient with our products in many places. If you go to a less acute site, you will need a pump no matter what, you still need fluids, you need medicines, injectables, you still need things that are needed to treat that patient. To the home side, we have that advantage and have spoken about the PD advantage that is a positive for the company, not only by the rule in the U.S. with a kidney dialysis and transplant changes that were done during President Trump's tenure, but also the place to be, if you have sick patients that don't want to go to acute sites or dialysis clinics. So that is a positive. 
When we look at what I see is temporary, the inflation that we are seeing in the disruption in supply chain, I think not only Baxter is working hard to offset that, but also I don't believe those are fundamental changes that will alter the -- completely the going-forward dynamic of our logistic costs as well as raw material costs. We will face headwinds in this area. We have spoken about the cost of containers, are very expensive, fuel and everything else. We're offsetting that, as you could see this quarter, and we have done for the year, and we plan to continue to do it. 
The thing is how do you see that? Is that a fundamental change in the cost structure? We don't think so. We think that, that will eventually subside. But at the moment, we don't have that in our numbers. In our numbers what we have is us offsetting headwinds coming in from the cost point of view. Market-wise, as I said, they are changed a significant amount of telehealth, connecting the dots of information coming from ICUs. So the better off -- we will be better off, but continue to develop our digital health products as we're doing. If you think about our share source with the companion -- with the mobile companion that we just launched earlier this year, a true view in our CRT as well as half of the portfolio with the FDA today. Regarding our new pump, is not a mechanical/electrical pump, is actually software that is going with it that will be installed in the hospitals networks as gateway to be able to manage traffic and bring information back and forth. So that boat has shipped -- that boat has sailed. There's no way to not be in the connected market going forward."

As you know, Joe and I are both really focused on driving free cash flow and driving free cash flow performance sustainably. And frankly, we've made a series of decisions over the last couple of years to suboptimize the base case, to protect against severe situations that could emerge. All of these things were absolutely the right thing to do, carrying extra inventory into the pandemic. As we sit here today, carrying select inventory of incremental product, as we look at a hurricane season, which could be a challenge. And so these things have -- we've had a little bit excess inventory relative to our normal expectations. As we move towards the end of the year, and as we've been able to improve the predictability of sales by product line in a post-pandemic world, we'll start to be able to optimize cash flow a little bit more carefully and closely. 
And so I think as we move to 2022 and '23, we'll start to see more normal years for cash flow. Obviously, 2020 was a huge anomaly. 2021 continues to be anomalous because of, again, just really being sensitive to having enough product available to support patients in a very challenging situation. But as I said, I think as we emerge in 2022 and '23, we'll be able to optimize the inventory a little bit better, continue our focus on accounts receivable. And then furthermore, on the days payable really work to optimize that, working closely with our suppliers. 
And then finally, from a CapEx standpoint, there are certain investments that we always make, and we'll continue to make those, especially those that support growth in businesses like our PD business. So we'll continue to look for those value-creating opportunities, and those exist. So we'll have more CapEx, and that will be a continued area for us of great investment. But I think 2022 starts to become a more normal year and then even more so in future beyond that."

We -- on one side, we hope that we don't ever need to produce another [file of] vaccine. So this disease goes away, and the world is back to normal. On the other hand, we're doing what we can to help the world get through this. So I would say that you're probably going to have some residual production in 2022. Because as you can see, it was overseas about a few weeks ago. And the scarcity of vaccine is remarkable. So there's still a lot of places in the world that don't have vaccines. And I think eventually, those vaccines will reach there. So we're not making a prediction in 2022, but we think there will be residual production in 2022 for vaccines."

I don't comment, all of you know on the call. And outside the call that I don't comment on behalf of the agency. The agency will do what the agency will do. What we can do is make sure that our engineers and scientists and the regulatory folks are focused on this. We have a lot of people focused on getting those answers to the FDA. We hope that they will be happy with the answers. And we can have the product launched this year as we're planning at the moment. 
I also want to just make sure that you all know, we're having pretty good demand for our spectrum pump -- our current pump, so it's not all or nothing. We do have really good demand for our pump, very large contracts coming about. So I just want to make sure that we feel very comfortable with where we are in terms of our technical responses to the FDA, we think we have it. We are very happy with the design of the bump and the future that holds because it's a very different platform that will hit the markets when approved and hopefully bring this industry at a different level of technology.

And what we were pleased that we were able to drive an impact in the face of a challenging worldwide supply chain environment, in the second quarter. But there is part of the savings that we experienced this year that are related to a slower resumption of activity. And so as we look at the second quarter, we had sort of anticipated a very substantial increase in SG&A. You'll note that we did have a nice-sized increase in SG&A, but it was just not quite at the pace that we anticipated. So we'll expect that to resume. 
Here's what I would say about SG&A and other spending categories and cost of goods going forward. At the Investor Day, we'll talk about things like the work that Jim Borzi is doing to really optimize manufacturing and supply chain and really taking a cutting-edge approach in that arena. And then the other thing that I will tell you about is the digital transformation that we're undertaking, and that will have a nice impact in terms of really spending across the company. And I think that's something that will feature prominently. In the meantime, we were pleased to drive a short-term result, but I don't think all the changes that we're making are the ones that we'll be talking about with you when we get together in September."

But that is not -- there's no 2 different conversations going on. We believe that our products are -- have price consistency across customers. And we negotiate every single contract with the intent to have as much penetration as we can within that integrated supply chain for the hospital. So if you think about negotiations are all about class of products, and quality availability of products and evidently, price is a big deal, no best price usually wins.

And so I would say that one point of procedure volume in the U.S. is roughly $0.5 million of impact per month. And so that's something that we watch carefully. I think when we put together the sales guidance for the year, we have the ability to withstand a little bit of softness in surgical procedures and admissions, as it relates to Delta variant. But this is an uncertainty that we're contending with, not only on the surgical procedure side, but also on the admission side. 
And I've talked historically about a lot of the work that we've done in terms of forecasting and modeling. And I think we've done a really good job kind of relating our business to some of these fundamental drivers. But you're right, there are -- this is a valve of world that we're living in today.

I will begin with a review of Baxter's second quarter results, and also share a few words about our upcoming investor conference. Jay will then provide a deeper dive on our financial performance and outlook. And we will wrap up with Q&A. 
Baxter delivered second quarter sales growth of 14% as reported, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by the ongoing global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in favorable performance comparisons for a number of our businesses versus the prior year, as the pandemic affect the patient treatment dynamics and demand mix in the prior year. 
On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, up 25% year-over-year and exceeding our original guidance. All three of our geographic segments contributed to the positive quarterly performance. The Americas and EMEA achieved high single-digit growth and APAC achieved a low double-digit growth, all at constant currency rates. While we are clearly experiencing recovery from the pandemic across all three of our geographies, the situation on the ground varies considerably by market. 
As always, we salute the health care workers, who continue to face enormous challenges every day on the front lines of care. I also want to express my personal gratitude to all the Baxter employees, who tirelessly support these clinicians and caregivers while helping to ensure we address the needs of patients across our vast life-sustaining portfolio. 
Turning to our performance by business, 5 of our 7 product categories achieved growth on a constant currency basis. Performance was led by BioPharma Solutions and Advanced Surgery, which delivered 49% and 48% constant currency growth, respectively. Growth in BPS was filled by contracts to assist in the manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. Advanced Surgery growth reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year spurred by improving surgical volumes as pandemic recovery advances globally. 
As you saw in this morning's press release, we are building on our momentum in Advanced Surgery with the acquisition of PerClot Polysaccharide Hemostatic System. PerClot marks our entry into the global hemostatic powder segment, which will allow us to serve surgeons and their patients with an even broader range of options to control into operative bleeding across active and passive solutions. 
Our Medication Delivery business grew 12% at constant currency rates, also benefiting from a favorable comparison driven by improving rates of admissions at hospitals as compared to the prior year. Looking ahead, Medication Delivery is continuing to position for the U.S. launch of our NOVUM IQ infusion platform including those IQ safety software in our IQ enterprise digital connectivity suite. 
Following up on our recent FDA resubmission, we are now in the process of responding to an additional information request from the agency. We continue to expect to launch NOVUM IQ in the U.S. before the end of the year. 
Our Clinical Nutrition category advanced single digits at constant currency rates, reflecting ongoing strength in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals also grew at single digits constant currency. Adjusting for the recent Caelyx and Doxil acquisition, Pharmaceuticals was flat year-over-year. Although we expect competitive pressures to continue in this marketplace, we remain focused on launching molecules with differentiated presentations and/or complex formulations. 
We have several projected launches of new generic injectables in the coming years that will help to fuel growth in this business and mitigate some of the competitive pressures we are experiencing. Performance in Renal Care was comparable to the prior year at constant rates with growth in the U.S., offset by a decline across international markets. On a global basis, the market continues to be dampened by the impact of the pandemic, which has contributed to a higher mortality rate for patients with kidney disease combined with a slowing of new patient diagnosis. 
As we said last quarter, we expect the recovery of this market to continue, returning to its pre-COVID dynamics over the next 1 to 2 years. In this quarter, we saw returned positive year-over-year PD patient growth globally including mid-single-digit PD patient growth in the U.S. 
The pandemic has highlighted the vital importance of the home dialysis therapy option. And as a leader in recognized innovator in this space, it has never been more urgent to support education, awareness and access. 
Our global safer at home campaign, which has been underway for more than a year, is dedicated to helping clinicians, patients and other stakeholders learn more about the benefits of home care, particularly amid pandemic conditions. Lastly, performance in Acute Therapies declined mid-single digits at constant currency rates year-over-year. This decline was expected given the extremely challenging comparison following last year's historic surge in demand for continuous renal replacement therapy in light of the pandemic. We remain excited by the prospects for the advanced treatment options in the CRRT market. 
In fact, Q2 marked the launch of PrisMax to the latest version of our nex-gen platform for CRRT and organ support with embedded TrueView digital health technology. From an ESG perspective, earlier this month, we announced our 2030 corporate responsibility commitment, which will help to drive Baxter's environmental, social, governance efforts over the next decade and beyond. 
This work is integral to how we advance our mission to save and sustain lives and serve all of our stakeholders from patients and clinicians to our communities and investors. Our 2030 commitment is built around the three overarching objectives, empower our patients, protect our planet and champion our people and communities. Full details can be found in our 2020 corporate responsibility report now posted on baxter.com. 
Briefly looking ahead, we continue operating in an environment of some uncertainty. We fully anticipate broader trend of pandemic recovery to sustain, but geographic disparities and emerging variants could slow and undermine the pace. All storages like our health care peers and countless other companies, Baxter is subject to the impact of inflation in the rising cost of freight, fuel and other raw materials and commodities. We will continue to look for opportunities to offset the impact from these incremental expenses. 
As I wrap up, I want to highlight that our 2021 investor conference will be held on Monday, September 20 in Deerfield, Illinois. At the conference, we plan to focus on our key strategic objectives to enhance growth and drive innovation.

254571,718658980,2359721,"Baxter International Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Second quarter 2021 global sales of $3.1 billion advanced 14% on a reported basis, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an operationa",1376,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Second quarter 2021 global sales of $3.1 billion advanced 14% on a reported basis, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an operational basis. Sales growth this quarter reflects the ongoing recovery in hospital and surgical volumes, along with the benefit from COVID vaccines. We estimate these factors contributed just over 450 basis points of sales growth in the quarter. OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter. 
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 25% to $0.80 per share, exceeding our guidance range driven by disciplined operational execution, and a lower-than-expected tax rate. 
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories. Starting with our three regional segments. Sales in the Americas increased 8% on both a constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 8% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an operational basis, and sales in our Asia Pac region advanced 10% on a constant currency basis and 9% operationally. 
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for our Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusted for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the U.S. of the Caelyx and Doxil. 
Global sales for Renal care were $964 million, were flat on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by our PD business, where we observed both the sequential and year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes. This was partially offset by declining international sales of in-center HD dialyzers, reflecting the impact from the pandemic as well as competitive dynamics. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnoses resulting from the pandemic. Our expectation remains that PD patient volumes will continue to ramp over the course of the year, although the pace may vary by market. 
In particular, we are monitoring COVID resurgences in Asia Pac and parts of the Europe. Sales in Medication Delivery of $697 million, increased 12% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in this business reflects the recovery in the pace of hospital admissions in many markets following the height of the pandemic last year. 
We estimate that in the second quarter, the rate of U.S. hospital admissions was down approximately 7% as compared to pre-COVID levels, a market improvement from the second quarter of 2020, which saw U.S. admissions down approximately 20%. 
Pharmaceutical sales of $546 million, advanced 5% on a constant currency basis and were flat to prior year on an operational basis. Performance in the quarter benefited from the recovery in surgical procedures and hospital admissions, demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and the contribution from OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil. This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. generic injectables portfolio, which faced a headwind from prior year sales of select injectable drugs used to treat critical COVID-19 patients as well as increased competitive activity for certain molecules. 
Moving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $237 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven primarily by growth in the U.S., partially offset by lower international sales of vitamins resulting from supply constraints. 
Sales in Advanced Surgery were $256 million, increasing 48% on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we estimate surgical procedures were at or slightly above pre-COVID levels, contributing to strength in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $188 million, declining 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the challenging year-over-year comparison due to surge in product demand this time last year related to the COVID pandemic. As Joe mentioned, we anticipate that COVID-related demand for CRRT will moderate this year, but will improve over time through the launch of new products and increased awareness of this therapy. 
BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $183 million, representing growth of 49% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines. 
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42.6% increased by 100 basis points over the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in manufacturing and a favorable product mix as the impact from COVID receives. Adjusted SG&A of $649 million increased 12% on a reported basis, reflecting the impact from foreign exchange, the improvement in sales and resulting increase in commissions and increased promotional spend in support of new product launches. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $139 million increased 18% on a reported basis driven by the impact of foreign exchange and investments in our new product pipeline. Both adjusted SG&A and R&D spending reflect a somewhat more normalized level of spend, as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a result of the pandemic, particularly those related to employee bonus accruals. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17.2%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year.  Net interest expense totaled $34 million in the quarter, and other nonoperating income contributed $2 million in the quarter. 
The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, an increase over the prior year driven by lower stock-based compensation award deductions as compared to the prior year period. The tax rate was favorable to our expectations driven by a favorable change in earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.80 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.72 to $0.75 per share. 
Within the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $300 million or 3.7 million shares of common stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $600 million or 7.3 million shares of common stock, which has been partially offset by option-related dilution. On a net basis, our outstanding share count has declined by approximately 5 million shares through the second quarter. In addition, during the second quarter, we announced a 14% increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate. The strength of our financial position has fueled our ability to increase our quarterly dividend rate on an annual basis for the sixth consecutive year. 
We continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is balance between inorganic and organic initiatives with the objective of accelerating growth and expanding margins, driving innovation and returning value to our shareholders. 
With respect to cash flow in the first half of 2021, we've generated $854 million of operating cash flow and $525 million in free cash flow. 
Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 8% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil as well as approximately 250 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth. 
Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates will stay below pre-COVID levels with rates improving throughout the year, and exiting down low single digits. Based on surgical procedure data in the U.S. to date, we now expect surgical procedures will continue to be a 100% of pre-COVID levels for the remainder of the year. 
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand between 40 to 60 basis points. For the year, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17.5% and a full year diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $3.49 to $3.55 per diluted share. 
Specific to the third quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 9% on a reported basis, approximately 7% on a constant currency basis and approximately 6% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open the call up for Q&A."

So that's question number one. And then a follow-up on  question number 2 is more strategic for Joe. And Joe, I realize you won't talk about market speculation, but I do think it would be helpful for investors to hear maybe a little bit of an update on your thoughts on M&A generally and maybe talk about what the circumstances would have to be for you to pursue a larger deal? How important it is that M&A improves the company's growth rate, things of that nature? I just think an update there would be much appreciated. So those are my 2 questions."

I'll address the Renal question first from a Q2 performance standpoint and then turn it over to Joe for the second question. Overall, as you mentioned, the U.S. had a solid performance in Renal growing 4%. We ended up -- TD was a little bit in excess of that 5% with the HD business slightly below that. And then internationally, you're right, we had a decline in the quarter, which we do not expect to continue. There were a couple of drivers of that. One is we've talked historically about patient census challenges, and that being a headwind that we're facing and contending with this year, which is kind of disrupted the normal orderly cadence of patient growth that we see internationally. And that was pronounced in the second quarter. Our PD business actually slightly declined, so 1% decline in the quarter. We do expect that to return starting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And frankly, we've seen, in certain markets, delays in procedures of establishing new PD patients, like, for example, in Japan, along with this patient census issue. All of these things came together to impact the growth rate in the quarter. Like I say, in the second half of the year, we do expect to see an acceleration and feel solid about that. 
And then in the HD business, we did have some pricing competition on dialyzers. We see that from time-to-time. So the HD business declined in mid-single digits, and we will expect that to normalize in the second half of the year. So while -- the Renal business has been a fairly consistent performer for us internationally. And if you look at that over a series of multiple quarters, I think you can expect -- or you can gain some confidence in the second half of the year, we'll grow that business internationally, roughly 3%. And I'll turn it over to Joe to address the other question."

First is size being a secondary conversation. First is you strategically fit for the company. We look at the areas of growth for the future. You look what is going to make a difference in the healthcare in 5 to 10 years, where this Baxter is going. It's now where the puck is where the puck is going. Sometimes we get it attached to growth rates and things of where things are. We've got to look where things are going. And Baxter is doing a lot in connected health, and we need to make sure that we have the ability to deploy capital in that area as well as adjacencies. 
Going into areas of no correlation to Baxter to create [indiscernible] presenting much more challenging environment for the company in terms of M&A. Not impossible to do it, but it's something that is more difficult. Second is how do we see returns. The returns are always the same. We look at internal rate of returns to be above our cost of capital, about a few hundred basis points as well as we look at ROIC very similarly on a 5-year base posted deal. 
We look also the ability for the company to generate cash flow and our ability to bring the company integrated into Baxter, which I feel confident that we, through our digital transformation, have a much better ability of bringing companies in than a few years ago. 
And the third and last one is that not every deal is created the same, and we examine multiple opportunities at all times. So the company has a significant amount of cash. And it doesn't go against deals. It goes back to the shareholders in form of -- in terms of buybacks, as we have done. As you saw, we just did some buyback this quarter. And for the year, we are around $600 million. So this is how I think about M&A."

Thus far, we're seeing a fairly stable admissions environment relative to our expectations. Underlying our guidance, we're expecting roughly 98% of admissions in the United States in the fourth quarter of the year. We watch that, of course, very carefully, and I've talked about the risk and the sensitivity around that in the past, and we're particularly watching given the delta variant, but feel solid that we've got our hands around this at this point. 
And so then as we translate that to the rest of the P&L, let me talk first about a full year basis and then maybe make some comments on the second half. On a full year basis, we are seeing some challenges in the Pharmaceuticals business related to competition and pricing. And so on a full year basis, probably $0.06 of a headwind from pharma offset by $0.06 of a benefit from our BioPharma Solutions business, which is performing better than our expectations. So those items kind of -- sort of counteract each other. And then we have roughly $0.08 or so on a full year basis of global supply chain costs that we're contending with. And so essentially, we're seeing things like freight and premium freight cost, that's roughly $0.03. We actually have a fairly substantial manufacturing facility in Colombia. We've had a couple of cents of impact from Colombia unrest and ensuring we're getting product to our patients and product out of the country in an expeditious manner. And then, of course, through some purchase price variations, which there is some inflation in that rounding out the $0.08. 
But offsetting that, we have -- we're committed to really using resources efficiently as a company. And so we're able to counteract the vast majority of that. So roughly $0.07 of benefit from measures that we have in place that are enhanced versus our expectations, really looking at all of the spending categories and challenging ourselves to make sure that we're using resources as efficiently as possible. Of course, when we do those exercises, we don't touch things like quality or critical R&D programs, but we really do look hard at the cost base to ensure we're being efficient and offsetting where possible. 
So that's really the story on a full year basis. But if you think about it -- and then there's financial assumptions that kind of wash out, we had some benefit in the first half from a number of assumptions, and then we have some headwinds in the second half. But if you look at it exclusively from a second half standpoint, I'll say that FX is actually $0.03 of impact. So that is really one of the big drivers of the second half performance. We've seen dollar strengthening. And so that has an impact on our translation back of our overseas business. That's roughly $0.03. BPS and Pharma, again, kind of wash out in the second half. And then we have a couple of cents of supply chain expenses. But I think really the most notable impact to the second half is this foreign exchange impact that we're contending with right now."

So we are in process of delivering our portfolio. The conditions of the market have deteriorated in terms of pricing headwinds as well as COVID, with the patients that have not gone to a hospital, and the budget of the pharmacies, right? So when we look at this whole thing, where do we stand today? We still see the headwinds that, that business has. Don't confuse the whole category that we have, which is -- has two very separate businesses. One is our anesthesia business, which are gases. Instead of gases -- and that has declined consistently over the last 24 months because the type of delivery systems the anesthesiologists are using across the globe for gas from our Pharmaceutical business. So I tell you that we just had three products conditionally approved. We're going to be launching three in the next 6 to 9 months. We are excited about the portfolio and follows the same recipe of difficult to formulate, and novel ways of delivering. 
So if you think about that, it is still a good business, has very, very, very strong and healthy profitability. So what we need to do is to make sure that our innovation will -- does not stop, and we continue to bring products organically and sometimes inorganically to the portfolio to be able to augment the growth of this business and keep ahead of the competition. Baxter has put together a very good group of R&D scientists in the United States as well as India. And together, they are working 24 hours a day in tandem to be able to deliver on that. I'm still fan up that portfolio, understanding the headwinds that, that portfolio can have every so often, as some drugs will go out in contribution based on competition, but then we're able to launch new products. Remember, there are 22 new product launches this year, probably around half of them are Pharmaceutical products. So we do not see a long-term issue for this business, but more so a -- every so often issue that you have -- when you have competition coming into your market that has just happened in the last 12 months."

I -- when you think about 2019, you saw -- and you see how we are looking at for the rest of the year, we see this year as a recovery year where the admissions towards the end of the year, they exit into 2022, will be probably 100% -- 98% to 100% of going back to the admission flow rates that we've had before. So if you think about the major dynamics of the market, I would say there is a move from the acute care to the less acute care. And what is the impact for Baxter? If you think about Baxter as a healthcare supply company, with products that are must have, independents that are setting. We follow the patient with our products in many places. If you go to a less acute site, you will need a pump no matter what, you still need fluids, you need medicines, injectables, you still need things that are needed to treat that patient. To the home side, we have that advantage and have spoken about the PD advantage that is a positive for the company, not only by the rule in the U.S. with a kidney dialysis and transplant changes that were done during President Trump's tenure, but also the place to be, if you have sick patients that don't want to go to acute sites or dialysis clinics. So that is a positive. 
When we look at what I see is temporary, the inflation that we are seeing in the disruption in supply chain, I think not only Baxter is working hard to offset that, but also I don't believe those are fundamental changes that will alter the -- completely the going-forward dynamic of our logistic costs as well as raw material costs. We will face headwinds in this area. We have spoken about the cost of containers, are very expensive, fuel and everything else. We're offsetting that, as you could see this quarter, and we have done for the year, and we plan to continue to do it. 
The thing is how do you see that? Is that a fundamental change in the cost structure? We don't think so. We think that, that will eventually subside. But at the moment, we don't have that in our numbers. In our numbers what we have is us offsetting headwinds coming in from the cost point of view. Market-wise, as I said, they are changed a significant amount of telehealth, connecting the dots of information coming from ICUs. So the better off -- we will be better off, but continue to develop our digital health products as we're doing. If you think about our share source with the companion -- with the mobile companion that we just launched earlier this year, a true view in our CRT as well as half of the portfolio with the FDA today. Regarding our new pump, is not a mechanical/electrical pump, is actually software that is going with it that will be installed in the hospitals networks as gateway to be able to manage traffic and bring information back and forth. So that boat has shipped -- that boat has sailed. There's no way to not be in the connected market going forward."

As you know, Joe and I are both really focused on driving free cash flow and driving free cash flow performance sustainably. And frankly, we've made a series of decisions over the last couple of years to suboptimize the base case, to protect against severe situations that could emerge. All of these things were absolutely the right thing to do, carrying extra inventory into the pandemic. As we sit here today, carrying select inventory of incremental product, as we look at a hurricane season, which could be a challenge. And so these things have -- we've had a little bit excess inventory relative to our normal expectations. As we move towards the end of the year, and as we've been able to improve the predictability of sales by product line in a post-pandemic world, we'll start to be able to optimize cash flow a little bit more carefully and closely. 
And so I think as we move to 2022 and '23, we'll start to see more normal years for cash flow. Obviously, 2020 was a huge anomaly. 2021 continues to be anomalous because of, again, just really being sensitive to having enough product available to support patients in a very challenging situation. But as I said, I think as we emerge in 2022 and '23, we'll be able to optimize the inventory a little bit better, continue our focus on accounts receivable. And then furthermore, on the days payable really work to optimize that, working closely with our suppliers. 
And then finally, from a CapEx standpoint, there are certain investments that we always make, and we'll continue to make those, especially those that support growth in businesses like our PD business. So we'll continue to look for those value-creating opportunities, and those exist. So we'll have more CapEx, and that will be a continued area for us of great investment. But I think 2022 starts to become a more normal year and then even more so in future beyond that."

I don't comment, all of you know on the call. And outside the call that I don't comment on behalf of the agency. The agency will do what the agency will do. What we can do is make sure that our engineers and scientists and the regulatory folks are focused on this. We have a lot of people focused on getting those answers to the FDA. We hope that they will be happy with the answers. And we can have the product launched this year as we're planning at the moment. 
I also want to just make sure that you all know, we're having pretty good demand for our spectrum pump -- our current pump, so it's not all or nothing. We do have really good demand for our pump, very large contracts coming about. So I just want to make sure that we feel very comfortable with where we are in terms of our technical responses to the FDA, we think we have it.

And what we were pleased that we were able to drive an impact in the face of a challenging worldwide supply chain environment, in the second quarter. But there is part of the savings that we experienced this year that are related to a slower resumption of activity. And so as we look at the second quarter, we had sort of anticipated a very substantial increase in SG&A. You'll note that we did have a nice-sized increase in SG&A, but it was just not quite at the pace that we anticipated. So we'll expect that to resume. 
Here's what I would say about SG&A and other spending categories and cost of goods going forward. At the Investor Day, we'll talk about things like the work that Jim Borzi is doing to really optimize manufacturing and supply chain and really taking a cutting-edge approach in that arena. And then the other thing that I will tell you about is the digital transformation that we're undertaking, and that will have a nice impact in terms of really spending across the company.

But that is not -- there's no 2 different conversations going on. We believe that our products are -- have price consistency across customers. And we negotiate every single contract with the intent to have as much penetration as we can within that integrated supply chain for the hospital.

We have some line of sight in the short term, but our crystal ball gets murky as we look towards year-end. That's very clear. And so I would say that one point of procedure volume in the U.S. is roughly $0.5 million of impact per month. And so that's something that we watch carefully. I think when we put together the sales guidance for the year, we have the ability to withstand a little bit of softness in surgical procedures and admissions, as it relates to Delta variant. But this is an uncertainty that we're contending with, not only on the surgical procedure side, but also on the admission side. 
And I've talked historically about a lot of the work that we've done in terms of forecasting and modeling. And I think we've done a really good job kind of relating our business to some of these fundamental drivers. But you're right, there are -- this is a valve of world that we're living in today. And we'll have to watch carefully as we move through the rest of the year if the virus changes course substantially.

I will begin with a review of Baxter's second quarter results, and also share a few words about our upcoming investor conference. Jay will then provide a deeper dive on our financial performance and outlook. And we will wrap up with Q&A.
Baxter delivered second quarter sales growth of 14% as reported, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by the ongoing global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in favorable performance comparisons for a number of our businesses versus the prior year, as the pandemic affect the patient treatment dynamics and demand mix in the prior year.
On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.80, up 25% year-over-year and exceeding our original guidance. All 3 of our geographic segments contributed to the positive quarterly performance. The Americas and EMEA achieved high single-digit growth and APAC achieved low double-digit growth, all at constant currency rates. While we are clearly experiencing recovery from the pandemic across all 3 of our geographies, the situation on the ground varies considerably by market.
As always, we salute the health care workers, who continue to face enormous challenges every day on the front lines of care. I also want to express my personal gratitude to all the Baxter employees, who tirelessly support these clinicians and caregivers while helping to ensure we address the needs of patients across our vast life-sustaining portfolio.
Turning to our performance by business, 5 of our 7 product categories achieved growth on a constant currency basis. Performance was led by BioPharma Solutions and Advanced Surgery, which delivered 49% and 48% constant currency growth, respectively. Growth in BPS was filled by contracts to assist in the manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. Advanced Surgery growth reflects a favorable comparison to the prior year spurred by improving surgical volumes as pandemic recovery advances globally.
As you saw in this morning's press release, we are building on our momentum in Advanced Surgery with the acquisition of PerClot Polysaccharide Hemostatic System. PerClot marks our entry into the global hemostatic powder segment, which will allow us to serve surgeons and their patients with an even broader range of options to control intraoperative bleeding across active and passive solutions.
Our Medication Delivery business grew 12% at constant currency rates, also benefiting from a favorable comparison, driven by improving rates of admissions at hospitals as compared to the prior year. Looking ahead, Medication Delivery is continuing to position for the U.S. launch of our NOVUM IQ infusion platform including those IQ safety software in our IQ enterprise digital connectivity suite.
Following up on our recent FDA resubmission, we are now in the process of responding to an additional information request from the agency. We continue to expect to launch NOVUM IQ in the U.S. before the end of the year.
Our Clinical Nutrition category advanced single digits at constant currency rates, reflecting ongoing strength in the U.S. Pharmaceuticals also grew at single digits constant currency. Adjusting for the recent Caelyx and Doxil acquisition, Pharmaceuticals was flat year-over-year. Although we expect competitive pressures to continue in this marketplace, we remain focused on launching molecules with differentiated presentations and/or complex formulations.
We have several projected launches of new generic injectables in the coming years that will help to fuel growth in this business and mitigate some of the competitive pressures we are experiencing. Performance in Renal Care was comparable to the prior year at constant rates with growth in the U.S. offset by a decline across international markets. On a global basis, the market continues to be dampened by the impact of the pandemic, which has contributed to a higher mortality rate for patients with kidney disease combined with a slowing of new patient diagnosis.
As we said last quarter, we expect the recovery of this market to continue, returning to its pre-COVID dynamics over the next 1 to 2 years. In this quarter, we saw a return to positive year-over-year PD patient growth globally including mid-single-digit PD patient growth in the U.S.
The pandemic has highlighted the vital importance of the home dialysis therapy option. And as a leader in recognized innovator in this space, it has never been more urgent to support education, awareness and access. Our global safer at home campaign, which has been underway for more than a year, is dedicated to helping clinicians, patients and other stakeholders learn more about the benefits of home care, particularly amid pandemic conditions.
Lastly, performance in Acute Therapies declined mid-single digits at constant currency rates year-over-year. This decline was expected given the extremely challenging comparison following last year's historic surge in demand for continuous renal replacement therapy in light of the pandemic. We remain excited by the prospects for the advanced treatment options in the CRRT market. In fact, Q2 marked the launch of PrisMax to the latest version of our next-gen platform for CRRT and organ support with embedded TrueVue digital health technology. 
From an ESG perspective, earlier this month, we announced our 2030 corporate responsibility commitment, which will help to drive Baxter's environmental, social and governance efforts over the next decade and beyond. This work is integral to how we advance our mission to save and sustain lives and serve all of our stakeholders from patients and clinicians to our communities and investors. Our 2030 commitment is built around 3 overarching objectives, empower our patients, protect our planet and champion our people and communities. Full details can be found in our 2020 corporate responsibility report now posted on baxter.com.
Briefly looking ahead, we continue operating in an environment of some uncertainty. We fully anticipate broader trend of pandemic recovery to sustain, but geographic disparities and emerging variants could slow and undermine the pace. Also just like our health care peers and countless other companies, Baxter is subject to the impact of inflation in the rising cost of freight, fuel and other raw materials and commodities. We will continue to look for opportunities to offset the impact from these incremental expenses.
As I wrap up, I want to highlight that our 2021 investor conference will be held on Monday, September 20 in Deerfield, Illinois. At the conference, we plan to focus on our key strategic objectives to enhance growth and drive innovation. In addition, as a critical part of our ongoing business transformation, Jim Borzi, Senior Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, will outline the next phase of our manufacturing supply chain journey, which is expected to enhance our operational effectiveness and drive margin improvement.
Now I'll pass it to Jay, who will share a closer look at our results and our outlook for the balance of the year."

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Second quarter 2021 global sales of $3.1 billion advanced 14% on a reported basis, 9% on a constant currency basis and 8% on an operational basis. Sales growth this quarter reflects the ongoing recovery in hospital and surgical volumes, along with the benefit from COVID vaccines. We estimate these factors contributed just over 450 basis points of sales growth in the quarter. OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter. 
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 25% to $0.80 per share, exceeding our guidance range driven by disciplined operational execution, and a lower-than-expected tax rate.
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments and key product categories. Starting with our 3 regional segments. Sales in the Americas increased 8% on both a constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 8% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an operational basis, and sales in our Asia Pac region advanced 10% on a constant currency basis and 9% operationally.
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this quarter, constant currency growth is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for our Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth adjusted for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the U.S. for Caelyx and Doxil.
Global sales for Renal care were $964 million, were flat on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by our PD business, where we observed both the sequential and year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes. This was partially offset by declining international sales of in-center HD dialyzers, reflecting the impact from the pandemic as well as competitive dynamics. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnoses resulting from the pandemic. Our expectation remains that PD patient volumes will continue to ramp over the course of the year, although the pace may vary by market.
In particular, we are monitoring COVID resurgences in Asia Pac and parts of the Europe. Sales in Medication Delivery of $697 million, increased 12% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in this business reflects the recovery in the pace of hospital admissions in many markets following the height of the pandemic last year.
We estimate that in the second quarter, the rate of U.S. hospital admissions was down approximately 7% as compared to pre-COVID levels, a marked improvement from the second quarter of 2020, which saw U.S. admissions down approximately 20%.
Pharmaceutical sales of $546 million, advanced 5% on a constant currency basis and were flat to prior year on an operational basis. Performance in the quarter benefited from the recovery in surgical procedures and hospital admissions, demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and the contribution from OUS sales of Caelyx/Doxil. This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. generic injectables portfolio, which faced a headwind from prior year sales of select injectable drugs used to treat critical COVID-19 patients as well as increased competitive activity for certain molecules.
Moving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $237 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven primarily by growth in the U.S., partially offset by lower international sales of vitamins resulting from supply constraints. 
Sales in Advanced Surgery were $256 million, increasing 48% on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we estimate surgical procedures were at or slightly above pre-COVID levels, contributing to strength in the quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $188 million, declining 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting challenging year-over-year comparison due to surge in product demand this time last year related to the COVID pandemic. As Joe mentioned, we anticipate that COVID-related demand for CRRT will moderate this year, but will improve over time through the launch of new products and increased awareness of this therapy.
BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $183 million, representing growth of 49% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines.
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 42.6% increased by 100 basis points over the prior year, reflecting operational improvements in manufacturing and a favorable product mix as the impact from COVID recedes. Adjusted SG&A of $649 million increased 12% on a reported basis, reflecting the impact from foreign exchange, the improvement in sales and resulting increase in commissions and increased promotional spend in support of new product launches. Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $139 million increased 18% on a reported basis driven by the impact of foreign exchange and investments in our new product pipeline. Both adjusted SG&A and R&D spending reflect a somewhat more normalized level of spend, as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a result of the pandemic, particularly those related to employee bonus accruals.
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 17.2%, an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense totaled $34 million in the quarter, and other nonoperating income contributed $2 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, an increase over the prior year driven by lower stock-based compensation award deductions as compared to the prior year period. The tax rate was favorable to our expectations driven by a favorable change in earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $0.80 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.72 to $0.75 per share.
Within the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $300 million or 3.7 million shares of common stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $600 million or 7.3 million shares of common stock, which has been partially offset by option-related dilution. On a net basis, our outstanding share count has declined by approximately 5 million shares through the second quarter. In addition, during the second quarter, we announced a 14% increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate. The strength of our financial position has fueled our ability to increase our quarterly dividend rate on an annual basis for the sixth consecutive year.
We continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is balance between inorganic and organic initiatives with the objective of accelerating growth and expanding margins, driving innovation and returning value to our shareholders. With respect to cash flow in the first half of 2021, we've generated $854 million of operating cash flow and $525 million in free cash flow.
Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 8% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil as well as approximately 250 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth.
Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates will stay below pre-COVID levels with rates improving throughout the year, and exiting down low single digits. Based on surgical procedure data in the U.S. to date, we now expect surgical procedures will continue to be a 100% of pre-COVID levels for the remainder of the year.
Moving down the P&L. We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand between 40 to 60 basis points. For the year, we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 17.5% and a full year diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares. Based on these factors, we now expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $3.49 to $3.55 per diluted share.
Specific to the third quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of approximately 9% on a reported basis, approximately 7% on a constant currency basis and approximately 6% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share.
With that, we can now open the call up for Q&A."

And Joe, I realize you won't talk about market speculation, but I do think it would be helpful for investors to hear maybe a little bit of an update on your thoughts on M&A generally and maybe talk about what the circumstances would have to be for you to pursue a larger deal?

I'll address the Renal question first from a Q2 performance standpoint and then turn it over to Joe for the second question. Overall, as you mentioned, the U.S. had a solid performance in Renal, growing 4%. We ended up -- PD was a little bit in excess of that 5% with the HD business slightly below that. And then internationally, you're right, we had a decline in the quarter, which we do not expect to continue. There were a couple of drivers of that. One is we've talked historically about patient census challenges, and that being a headwind that we're facing and contending with this year, which has kind of disrupted the normal orderly cadence of patient growth that we see internationally. And that was pronounced in the second quarter.
Our PD business actually slightly declined, so 1% decline in the quarter. We do expect that to return starting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And frankly, we've seen, in certain markets, delays in procedures of establishing new PD patients, like, for example, in Japan, along with this patient census issue. All of these things came together to impact the growth rate in the quarter. Like I say, in the second half of the year, we do expect to see an acceleration and feel solid about that.
And then in the HD business, we did have some pricing competition on dialyzers. We see that from time-to-time. So the HD business declined in mid-single digits, and we will expect that to normalize in the second half of the year. So while -- the Renal business has been a fairly consistent performer for us internationally. And if you look at that over a series of multiple quarters, I think you can expect -- or you can gain some confidence in the second half of the year, we'll grow that business internationally, roughly 3%. I'll turn it over to Joe to address the other question."

First is size being a secondary conversation. First is strategically fit for the company. We look at the areas of growth for the future. We look what is going to make a difference in the healthcare in 5 to 10 years, where this Baxter is going. It's now where the puck is where the puck is going. Sometimes we get it attached to growth rates and things of where things are. We've got to look where things are going. And Baxter is doing a lot in connected health, and we need to make sure that we have the ability to deploy capital in that area as well as adjacencies.
Going into areas of no correlation to Baxter, to create a new leg of the stool, presenting much more challenging environment for the company in terms of M&A. Not impossible to do it, but it's something that is more difficult. Second is how do we see returns. The returns are always the same. We look at internal rate of returns to be above our cost of capital, about a few hundred basis points as well as we look at ROIC very similarly on a 5-year base post the deal.
We look also the ability for the company to generate cash flow and our ability to bring the company integrated into Baxter, which I feel confident that we, through our digital transformation, have a much better ability of bringing companies in than a few years ago.
And the third and last one is that not every deal is created the same, and we examine multiple opportunities at all times. So the company has a significant amount of cash. And it doesn't go against deals. It goes back to the shareholders in form of -- in terms of buybacks, as we have done. As you saw, we just did some buyback this quarter. And for the year, we are around $600 million. So this is how I think about M&A."

Thus far, we're seeing a fairly stable admissions environment relative to our expectations. Underlying our guidance, we're expecting roughly 98% of admissions in the United States in the fourth quarter of the year. We watch that, of course, very carefully, and I've talked about the risk and the sensitivity around that in the past, and we're particularly watching given the delta variant, but feel solid that we've got our hands around this at this point.
And so then as we translate that to the rest of the P&L, let me talk first about full year basis and then maybe make some comments on the second half. On a full year basis, we are seeing some challenges in the Pharmaceuticals business related to competition and pricing. And so on a full year basis, probably $0.06 of the headwind from Pharma offset by $0.06 of the benefit from our BioPharma Solutions business, which is performing better than our expectations. So those items kind of -- sort of counteract each other. And then we have roughly $0.08 or so on a full year basis of global supply chain costs that we're contending with.
And so essentially, we're seeing things like freight and premium freight cost, that's roughly $0.03. We actually have a fairly substantial manufacturing facility in Colombia. We've had a couple of cents of impact from Colombia unrest and ensuring we're getting product to our patients and product out of the country in an expeditious manner. And then, of course, through some purchase price variations, which there is some inflation in that rounding out the $0.08.
But offsetting that, we have -- we're committed to really using resources efficiently as a company. And so we're able to counteract the vast majority of that. So roughly $0.07 of benefit from measures that we have in place that are enhanced versus our expectations, really looking at all of the spending categories and challenging ourselves to make sure that we're using resources as efficiently as possible. Of course, when we do those exercises, we don't touch things like quality or critical R&D programs, but we really do look hard at the cost base to ensure we're being efficient and offsetting where possible.
So that's really the story on a full year basis. But if you think about it -- and then there's financial assumptions that kind of wash out. We had some benefit in the first half from a number of assumptions, and then we have some headwinds in the second half. But if you look at it exclusively from a second half standpoint, I'll say that FX is actually $0.03 of impact. So that is really one of the big drivers of the second half performance. We've seen dollar strengthening. And so that has an impact on our translation back of our overseas business. That's roughly $0.03. BPS and Pharma, again, kind of wash out in the second half. And then we have a couple of cents of supply chain expenses. But I think really the most notable impact to the second half is this foreign exchange impact that we're contending with right now."

One is our anesthesia business, which are gases, anesthetic gases, and that has declined consistently over the last 24 months because the type of delivery systems the anesthesiologists are using across the globe for gas from our Pharmaceutical business. So I tell you that we just had 3 products conditionally approved. We're going to be launching 3 in the next 6 to 9 months. We are excited about the portfolio and follow the same recipe of difficult to formulate, and novel ways of delivering.
So if you think about that, it is still a good business, has very, very, very strong and healthy profitability. So what we need to do is to make sure that our innovation will -- does not stop, and we continue to bring products organically and sometimes inorganically to the portfolio to be able to augment the growth of this business and keep ahead of the competition. Baxter has put together a very good group of R&D scientists in the United States as well as India. And together, they are working 24 hours a day in tandem to be able to deliver on that. I'm still a fan of that portfolio, understanding the headwinds that, that portfolio can have every so often, as some drugs will go down in contribution based on competition, but then we're able to launch new products.
Remember, there are 22 new product launches this year, probably around half of them are Pharmaceutical products. So we do not see a long-term issue for this business, but more a -- every so often issue that you have when you have competition coming into your market that has just happened in the last 12 months."

I would say that the PD market is still very much a good market to be in. It has grown above the overall renal dialysis business across the globe. Particularly in the U.S., we're still very optimistic on the vector of the growth that despite all that happened in 2020, we're able to have growth this year and expect to return to a high single-digit patient growth to double-digit patient growth, probably towards the end of '22 going into 2023."

I -- when you think about 2019, you saw -- and you see how we are looking at for the rest of the year, we see this year as a recovery year where new admissions towards the end of the year, they exit into 2022, will be probably 100% -- 98% to 100% of going back to the admission flow rates that we've had before.  So if you think about the major dynamics of the market, I would say there is a move from the acute care to the less acute care.
And what is the impact for Baxter? If you think about Baxter as a health care supply company with products that are a must have independent of doctor's setting, we follow the patient with our products in many places. If you go to a less acute site, you will need a pump no matter what, you still need fluids, you need medicines, injectables, you still need things that are needed to treat that patient. To the home side, we have that advantage and have spoken about the PD advantage that is a positive for the company, not only by the rule in the U.S. with a kidney dialysis and transplant changes that were done during President Trump's tenure, but also the place to be, if you have sick patients that don't want to go to acute sites or dialysis clinics. So that is a positive.
When we look at what I see is temporary, the inflation that we are seeing and the disruption in supply chain, I think not only Baxter is working hard to offset that, but also I don't believe those are fundamental changes that will alter the -- completely the going-forward dynamic of our logistic costs as well as raw material costs. We will face headwinds in this area. We have spoken about the cost of containers are very expensive, fuel and everything else. We're offsetting that, as you could see this quarter, and we have done for the year, and we plan to continue to do it.
The thing is how do you see that? Is that a fundamental change in the cost structure? We don't think so. We think that, that will eventually subside. But at the moment, we don't have that in our numbers. In our numbers what we have is us offsetting headwinds coming in from the cost point of view. Market-wise, as I said, they are changed a significant amount of telehealth, connecting the dots of information coming from ICUs. So the better off -- we will be better off, but continue to develop our digital health products as we're doing.
If you think about our Sharesource with the companion -- with the mobile companion that we just launched earlier this year, a true view in our CRT as well as half of the portfolio with the FDA today. Regarding our new pump, is not a mechanical/electrical pump, is actually software that is going with it that will be installed in the hospitals networks as gateway to be able to manage traffic and bring information back and forth. So that boat has shipped -- that boat has sailed. There's no way to not be in the connected market going forward."

As you know, Joe and I are both really focused on driving free cash flow and driving free cash flow performance sustainably. And frankly, we've made a series of decisions over the last couple of years to suboptimize the base case, to protect against severe situations that could emerge. All these things were absolutely the right thing to do, carrying extra inventory into the pandemic. As we sit here today, carrying select inventory of incremental product, as we look at a hurricane season, which could be a challenge. And so these things have -- we've had a little bit excess inventory relative to our normal expectations. As we move towards the end of the year, and as we've been able to improve the predictability of sales by product line in a post-pandemic world, we'll start to be able to optimize cash flow a little bit more carefully and closely.
And so I think as we move to 2022 and '23, we'll start to see more normal years for cash flow. Obviously, 2020 was a huge anomaly. 2021 continues to be anomalous because of, again, just really being sensitive to having enough product available to support patients in a very challenging situation. But as I said, I think as we emerge in 2022 and '23, we'll be able to optimize the inventory a little bit better, continue our focus on accounts receivable. And then furthermore, on the days payable really worked to optimize that, working closely with our suppliers.
And then finally, from a CapEx standpoint, there are certain investments that we always make, and we'll continue to make those, especially those that support growth in businesses like our PD business. So we'll continue to look for those value-creating opportunities, and those exist. So we'll have more CapEx, and that will be a continued area for us of great investment. But I think 2022 starts to become a more normal year and then even more so in future beyond that."

But this is an uncertainty that we're contending with, not only on the surgical procedure side, but also on the admission side.
I've talked historically about a lot of the work that we've done in terms of forecasting and modeling.

As usual, I will begin with an overview of Baxter's third quarter performance. Jay would take a closer look at the financials and outlook for the rest of the year. Then we will close with your questions. 
Clearly, the most notable highlight from the quarter is last month's announcement of our agreement to acquire Hillrom, subject to the approval of Hillrom shareholders and other customary closing conditions. I recently made site visits to select Hillrom locations as part of our integration planning process and I was joined by other members of our senior leadership team, meeting face-to-face with Hillrom's dedicated employees and touring the facilities only underscored our confidence and enthusiasm for the proposed acquisition of Hillrom. 
Upon closing of the transaction, we plan to bring a broader array of products and services to patients and clinicians across the care continuum and around the world. We are focused on identifying opportunities to further accelerate innovation to address the rapidly evolving needs of our customers. The teams are working diligently on plans to bring together these 2 complementary portfolios to deliver enhanced value for our stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on these acceleration opportunities following the close of the deal. 
Earlier this month, the Hart-Scott Rodino or HSR waiting period in the U.S. expired with no issuance of a second request by the FTC. While the FTC reserves its right to take further action, this is a key milestone to clear the way for a successful closing. We are in the process of securing all remaining global regulatory approvals required for closing and the Hillrom shareholder meeting to vote on the transaction is currently scheduled for December 2. 
In addition, our integration planning management office is up and running with teams from both organizations preparing for a swift, effective combination once the deal closes. We will expect to close by early 2022. 
Moving on to the third quarter financial performance. I'm pleased to report solid ongoing momentum as we make our way towards the close of the fiscal year. Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 9% on a reported basis, 7% at constant currency and 6% operationally. Like last quarter, growth was impacted by the continuing if somewhat erratic pace of COVID-19 pandemic recovery. While the pandemic still represented a headwind to top line sales in the quarter, the magnitude of this headwind has continued to decline, reflecting the improved rate of hospital admissions in the U.S. as well as ongoing pandemic recovery in international markets. 
This resulted in a favorable comparison to the same period last year. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.02, up 23% and exceeded our third quarter guidance. Positive mix and disciplined expense management drove the favorability. As you saw in our earnings release, all of our geographic segments and product categories contributed to the positive performance in the quarter. 
The pace of pandemic recovery continues to vary by both therapeutic and geographic market. Our broad global footprint and diverse portfolio of essential products combined to help mitigate the variability and shore up the strength of our overall enterprise. We also benefit from our resilience and agility, which have been greatly enhanced through our ongoing transformation. 
Looking at performance by business, growth was led by biopharma solutions which advanced 45% at constant currency rates. Performance was driven by revenues related to our manufacturing of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Medication Delivery grew at 11% constant currency, reflecting the improved rate of U.S. hospital admissions in new infusion pump contract with a large health system in the U.S. and increased demand for Baxter's small volume parenterals. 
With respect to our NOVUM IQ 510(k) submission, we are continuing to work with the FDA to address their questions on our submission. While we hope to receive clearance by the end of this year, it is possible it may shift into early 2022. In Pharmaceuticals, 7% constant currency growth reflects the benefit of our acquisition of specified rights outside the U.S. to Calyx and Doxil. Adjusting results for the acquisition, operational growth rose 1%. 
Year-over-year growth in the quarter reflects lower U.S. sales in part due to a large pandemic-related government order received in Q3 2020 and softness in inhaled anesthesia. This challenging comparison was offset by strong growth internationally, driven by our pharmacy compounding business. Our third quarter launch of premix norepinephrine was met with strong demand, part of an increasing trend as hospital pharmacies embrace premix formulated drugs and other products that improve efficiency, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. 
This is a key strength of our pharma portfolio, and we plan to continue launching more molecules with differentiated presentations or complex formulations in the months to come. During the quarter, advanced surgery performance in the U.S. was affected by lower surgical volumes, which remain depressed versus pre-pandemic rates. Procedure volumes were unfavorable to our prior expectations as hospitals delayed elective procedures in light of the delta variant. This was more than offset by growth in the international markets, which could slowly recover from the effects of the pandemic. 
Growth in Clinical Nutrition reflected the benefit of our new product launches particularly in international markets. Acute Therapies continues to perform very well. A year-over-year decline in U.S. sales reflects a difficult comparison in the face of last year's surge in demand for continuous renal replacement or CRRT products. Again, this was offset by international growth as an outcome of the pandemic, we now have many more CRRT devices in the food as well as heightened engagement [indiscernible] on the part of clinicians creating a platform for sustained momentum. 
Growth in Renal Care was driven by our home-based peritoneal dialysis or PD products globally. As I have mentioned on past calls, demand does continue to be dampened amid the pandemic due to higher mortality rates for patients with kidney disease and a slowdown in new patient diagnosis. We expect the ESRD market to gradually recover to pre-COVID growth rates over the next 1 to 2 years. Our Renal Care team's global safer at home campaign is dedicated to helping clinicians patients and other stakeholders learn more about the benefits of home-based PD care, especially in the context of today's pandemic conditions. 
From an ESG perspective, I'm pleased to highlight a new partnership between UNICEF USA and the Baxter International Foundation to improve access to safe water in La Guajira, Colombia, one of the country's most water-challenged regions. A $1.5 million foundation grant is helping fund the multifaceted 3-year program. This quarter, we also honored to be included on Forbes latest list of the World's Best employers and America's Best Employers for women. In addition, we are recognized as a leading organization on SURMOUNT's inclusion index. 
Looking forward, we continue to navigate with some uncertainty on the horizon. The overall trajectory of pandemic recovery appears more clear but the new geographic contours remain inconsistent. New variants may take an unknown toll on our business and our employees, and we will continue to contend with the effect of macroeconomic issues. Related to this last point, we are not immune to inflationary pressures and the rising cost of raw materials, commodities, components fuel and ongoing supply chain disruptions. 
While we are actively working to address these rapidly rising costs, we recognize these factors may continue to impact our operations into 2022. Amid these challenges, we are on pace very strong close to the year. This translates into momentum as we get set to execute on the vast potential of our proposed Hillrom acquisition and launch the next phase of our transformation journey, fueled by the commitment of our outstanding global team. 
Now I will pass it to Jay for a closer look at our financial results and outlook."

Third quarter 2021 global sales of $3.2 billion, advanced 9% on a reported basis, 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% operationally. Sal",1370,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong third quarter performance. Third quarter 2021 global sales of $3.2 billion, advanced 9% on a reported basis, 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% operationally. Sales growth this quarter reflects the benefit from revenues associated with the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, strength in medication delivery and OUS sales of Calyx and Doxil, which totaled approximately $32 million in the quarter. 
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 23% and to $1.02 per share, exceeding our guidance range, driven by a favorable product mix, primarily from better-than-expected sales of acute therapies and biopharma solutions as well as disciplined operational execution. 
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments in key product categories. Starting with our regional segments. Sales in the Americas increased 7% on both the constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 7% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally. And sales in our Asia Pacific region advanced 8% on both a constant currency and operational basis. 
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this [indiscernible] constant currency is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for the Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth, adjusting for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the U.S. for Caelyx and Doxil. 
Global sales for Renal Care were $981 million [indiscernible] on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in our PD business where we experienced year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes despite the negative impact on volumes resulting from the pandemic, including increased mortality rates in ESRD patients, delays in new patient diagnoses and market-wide staffing shortages. 
PV growth was partially offset by declining international sales in our in-center HD business and Renal Care clinics. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnosis resulting from the pandemic and expect the market to return to pre-COVID growth rates over the next 12 to 24 months. 
[indiscernible] delivery of $747 million increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in this business reflects continued recovery in the pace of hospital admissions as well as increased demand for large volume infusion pumps, IV solutions and small volume parenterals. 
During the quarter, we estimate that U.S. hospital admissions were down approximately 4% compared to pre-COVID levels, a significant improvement from the same quarter last year, which saw U.S. admissions down approximately [Audio Gap] we executed and began deliver back with a large health system in the U.S. pump placements in over. Pharmaceutical sales of $589 million advanced 7% on a constant currency basis. It was driven by demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and the contribution from OUS sales of Caelyx and Doxil. Growth in portfolio of premixes as hospitals continue combating the COVID-19 pandemic and look toward premix formulations and workflow efficiencies. 
This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. business related to lower surgical and a government order of approximately $20 million in Q3 2020. Moving to Clinical Nutrition. Total sales were $234 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by the benefit of new product launches within our broad multichamber product offering. 
Sales in Advanced Surgery were $249 million, increasing 5% on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we saw a strong growth from our international business and estimate surgical procedures improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis in many international markets. This growth was partially offset by performance in the U.S. with surgical procedures estimated at 95% of pre-COVID levels, a sequential and year-over-year decline in surgical procedure volumes due to the impact of the Delta variant and staff shortages. 
This was below our previous procedures returning to pre-COVID levels during the third quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $185 million, advancing 3% on a constant currency basis and were favorable to our expectations. Performance in the quarter continued to benefit from elevated demand for CRRT, particularly given the rise in COVID cases associated with the Delta variant. 
BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $206 million, representing growth of 45% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, which totaled more than $50 million in the quarter. 
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 44% increased by 140 basis points over the prior year, reflecting a favorable product mix and operational improvements in manufacturing. Adjusted SG&A of $640 million increased 11% as compared to the prior year period and was favorable to expectations, driven by disciplined expense management, which more than offset increased supply chain and logistics expenses recognized in the quarter. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $129 million increased 6% versus the prior year period. Both adjusted SG&A and R&D spending reflect a somewhat more normalized level of spend as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a result of the pandemic, particularly those related to employee bonus accruals. This improvement in gross margin, coupled with the continued OpEx management resulted in an adjusted operating margin in the quarter of 20.2%, an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year. 
Adjusted net interest expense totaled $32 million in the quarter and other nonoperating expense was $12 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.8%, a decrease over the prior year, driven primarily by a favorable change in earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $1.02 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share. 
With respect to cash flow, year-to-date, we've generated $1.5 billion in operating cash flow. Free cash flow totaled over $1 billion and represented growth of nearly 50% as compared to the prior year period. I would like to take a moment to reiterate our excitement around our recent announcement to acquire Hillrom. We believe the strategic rationale and underlying financials of the combination are compelling and provide us with a meaningful opportunity for value creation. Our integration teams are hard at work and we look forward to finalizing this combination by early 2022. 
In the meantime, we continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is founded on accelerating growth, driving innovation and returning value to our shareholders. Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of 7% to 8% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx Doxil and over 200 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth. 
Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates in the U.S. will remain below pre-COVID levels exiting the year down low single digits. Although surgical procedure data in the U.S. declined sequentially Q2 to Q3, our current expectation is that U.S. surgical procedures will improve sequentially and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter. 
We are continuing to monitor this assumption in light of potential impacts from COVID outbreaks and hospital staffing shortages. Moving down the P&L. We now expect adjusted operating margin to expand more than 60 basis points. For the year, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of 16.5% to 17% and and a full year diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares. 
Based on these factors, we now expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.58 to $3.62 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of 3% to 4% on a reported basis, 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis and 3% to 4% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1 to $1.04 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open the call up to Q&A."

And maybe to tie in that point, you had really good expense management down the P&L, both on SG&A and R&D a little lighter on gross margin than what The Street was thinking. So as you think about expenses, both in fourth quarter and from a high level going forward, where do you think you are in terms of percentage of normal spend, meaning how much is held back here because of the lower revenues due to COVID or the environment you're spending in? And where do you think gross margin could go from here, given that there are some higher cost inputs?"

First, I'll address the SG&A piece. SG&A in the second half of the year will be sub-20%. And certainly, as we look at that number, I would expect to see some elevation of that as we move into next year. We're going to resume more normal activities. We've still been very limited on a travel basis. we have still been very limited on a promotional basis in light of the COVID environment that we're faced with. And so we'll expect to resume normal activities as we move into next year. 
And there will be some uptick in SG&A percent of sales is our current expectation. So that's -- I think that's one thing to consider. As we look at the gross margin, this is a more interesting one for me. From our standpoint, gross margin came in, broadly speaking, in line with our expectations in the quarter. In Q4, we don't have tremendous surprises. But embedded in that, we are seeing some material and wage inflation. We're also seeing some planning and fulfillment costs in excess of our expectations. So those factors have been dragged, frankly, on our gross margin in Q3 and Q4. 
And as we look to next year, one of the big uncertainties that we're facing are these categories of spending. How much is inflation sustained versus temporal, how much disruption continues to exist in the supply chain. These are key factors that we're currently evaluating as we look at the plan. And it's a very dynamic environment. If you think about this year, we've had things like the Suez Canal, the Houston Freeze, disrupting logistics and also the resin market. But more recently, Hurricane Ida has put a fragile resin market under real pressure. And so how that evolves over the coming months is going to be a critically important input as we look at our 2022 operating plan."

It's been incredibly challenging for us to address the needs in this volatile supply chain environment. So those are -- that's really the key factor that's playing into our numbers today. 
As we think about inflation, some of the recent moves actually don't roll out until next year because as you know, we purchase a product, we manufacture the product.

But I believe that what you still have is the factor that many people in the United States are now vaccinated. And that has proven to be the Achilles' heel of the recovery in 2021 was the lack of vaccination that caused the issue. Second, hospitals have responded very differently upon the regions of the country, they've got hit the hardest. So it's tough to sit here and predict. I'm sure everybody learned a lesson. But until you get to a point that this moves from a pandemic infection to an endemic infection is going to be tough to predict. 
I believe what you -- what we are seeing, what needs to be considered, and I'm sure you've heard this from other companies is the labor shortage in hospitals, the issues with nursing availability, the travel nurses are very expensive. So inflation in hospital costs as well as the availability of nurses to be able to perform procedures in hospitals are doing just day procedures, no overnight. Some hospitals are cutting the day short because of lack of support. So this is not is not across the board everywhere. It is very regional, sometimes very local, depends upon the hospital. So I want to make sure that we're not the COVID predictors. I'm sure the country has learned very tough lesson hospitals and everybody is much better prepared today.

We'll end the year -- the second half margin should be over 20%, which is really a nice achievement in the context of the environment in which we're operating. So as we move to next year, really, there are a few factors in play. Every year, the second half margin is ahead of the first half margin in part because of larger sales contribution in the second half versus the first half. And in addition, we have a lot of spending that's concentrated in the first half of the year relative to promotional activity. And so those things sort of lower the first half margin relative to the second half. But there's a couple of other things that will happen next year that we'll be mindful of. First, and I referenced this earlier, could be a normalization of operating expenses as we resume activity, promotional activity and travel, and that's our current expectation. But then the final piece, and this is the piece, as I referenced earlier, we'll have a lot of work to do on is the inflationary impact that I referenced and Joe refenced in his prepared remarks. The impact of material inflation and wage inflation has increased throughout the year, and we had the Hurricane Ida disruption. So the full magnitude of this is something we're currently quantifying and carefully watching and sustained nature of it. We've seen resin prices abate a little bit, but how that emerges, that's an important cost category for us. All of those things will impact 2022 and so we'll watch those things very carefully."

But I will tell you that we still have some significant lingering costs even in Q3. But part of the improvement from first half to second half relates to a reduction in COVID-related costs. Now the key question for us is what happens through to next year. And so we're watching very carefully the evolution of the pandemic. And that will be an important input as we model out COVID-related costs for next year. What we've always said is we expect roughly $30 million of sustained costs. And I believe in the past, we've talked about up to $150 million of total COVID-related costs impacting our numbers. 
So we expect some sustained level of cost. And frankly, we couldn't have some costs remain in the first half of next year, depending on how things emerge. The critical variable for us and we've seen very volatile movements in this are some of the raw material costs related to resin and packaging and also accessibility of components. And so we spend a lot of time analyzing the indices. But I think the quality of the forecast of these indices only goes out so far. And what we've seen thus far is you can probably have reliable data for a few months. But beyond that, you have to take a position in terms of improving or disimproving. And so this is going to be an important part of the guidance that we put forth. 
Frankly, we'll study this for the next couple of months heading into January when we ultimately give guidance because it is such a volatile input and it's such an important input for us because a lot of our costs are related to resin, the cost of freight, the price of fuel and all of these things are key drivers for us."

First, in the U.S. regarding the sequentially slower growth. Could you talk a little bit more about relative impact of the various moving parts, new patient growth, excess mortality from COVID? I think you mentioned staffing shortages being a factor. And then my second question is on the OUS renal business. Can you talk about new PV patient trends in some of the key geographies? And then I guess question 2b is the weakness in in-center HD. Is that from price pressure or from share loss in dialyzers?"

So overall, the renal business in the third quarter grew approximately 1% and we're expecting to see that improve to the fourth quarter, a couple of hundred basis points.

So overall, the renal business in the third quarter grew approximately 1% and we're expecting to see that improve to the fourth quarter, a couple of hundred basis points. So we are seeing -- we expect to see a recovery in the renal business. And if we look at it, our PV business was sort of mid-single-digit growth and we did see declines in HD. In the fourth quarter, we'll expect to see mid-single-digit growth again in PD, and it will also be matched by an improvement in in-center HD. The improvement in in-center HD relates to the timing of tenders that we see in our ascena region. But I think your question is a good 1 related to the trajectory in this business. One, obviously, we're incredibly excited about the Renal business. In particular, as it relates to AAKHI, Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative, which we believe will provide a great incentive for movement to the home in the coming years along with patient dynamics. So long term, very excited about this, and this is an important component of the long-range plan that we've shared. But we are seeing in the short term some real disruptions in the marketplace -- And what I would say is there's really 3 factors: excess mortality, that's -- these are very vulnerable patients. And very unfortunately, we saw a lot of patients die related -- as a result of the COVID pandemic. 
And then the second thing relates to slower patient starts. And this is really a global phenomenon people have been reluctant to go to doctors and hospitals. And these catheter insertions, in some cases, have been deprioritized or other procedures are favored relative to that in today's environment. But then the final factor is one that impacts a number of our businesses, and I referenced this earlier related to advanced surgery. But I think there is a significant nursing shortage that we will -- that our country and internationally will need to be addressed nurses or in short twin that's another factor that's impacting treatment. 
So frankly, we've seen a challenging patient environment in the U.S. We did deem patients globally, but the vast majority of those came from China. Outside China, we were essentially flat Q2 to Q3. So these are all factors that ultimately, we believe, will correct in the coming months and years as we referenced earlier. But in the short term, this market is going to continue to be a challenging one."

And HD is the modality in the U.S. that not in home right in clinics is the one that drove a lot of that reduction. So what I think the outlook for the business is positive. It is going to be a 12- to 24-month climb because the death that were experienced in COVID because these patients are [indiscernible] patients of chronic disease and the effect by the virus, the death rate was higher amongst that population but we feel very positive on AAKHI going forward as we climb out of this we believe that that's something that is here to stay. It's just that COVID caused us to have a deep work on the trajectory."

So when we look at the synergies that we can achieve with the acquisition of Hillrom, none of those -- none of the sales and marketing and research and development as part of the synergies. But we want to make sure that we continue to drive and grow and hopefully accelerate growth in the future. But it's not going to be a disruption to how they go to market and how they're doing their business that now. We have synergies, of course, we do. and those are duplication of functions, different ways of doing things. And we have several shared service centers across the globe.

That's [indiscernible] 2. 
On your other question about staff shortage, this is a comment not related to Baxter only. Baxter is a health care company with with injectable pharmaceuticals and medical devices and dialysis from products, where nursing shortages affect the overall market. hospitals are dealing with this very effectively in most cases and their ability to deal with it depends upon their size and depends upon the original location. I can speak on behalf of our customers. But I can tell you that what we see is tremendous adapted on their side. It does have an overall impact for the business, but no one that we can pinpoint. It's just a headwind that the industry has seen. We're just repeating here to make sure you understand that we're not exempt of this headwind. But it's not a headwind that we can mitigate on behalf of hospitals, but we can actually, with a very diverse portfolio, as we've proven in the past, be a more resilient company."

As usual, I will begin with an overview of Baxter's third quarter performance. Jay would take a closer look at the financials and outlook for the rest of the year. Then we will close with your questions.  
Clearly, the most notable highlight from the quarter is last month's announcement of our agreement to acquire Hillrom, subject to the approval of Hillrom shareholders and other customary closing conditions. I recently made site visits to select Hillrom locations as part of our integration planning process and I was joined by other members of our senior leadership team, meeting face-to-face with Hillrom's dedicated employees and touring the facilities only underscored our confidence and enthusiasm for the proposed acquisition of Hillrom.  
Upon closing of the transaction, we plan to bring a broader array of products and services to patients and clinicians across the care continuum and around the world. We are focused on identifying opportunities to further accelerate innovation to address the rapidly evolving needs of our customers. The teams are working diligently on plans to bring together these 2 complementary portfolios to deliver enhanced value for our stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on these acceleration opportunities following the close of the deal.  
Earlier this month, the Hart-Scott-Rodino or HSR waiting period in the U.S. expired with no issuance of a second request by the FTC. While the FTC reserves its right to take further action, this is a key milestone to clear the way for a successful closing. We are in the process of securing all remaining global regulatory approvals required for closing. And the Hillrom shareholder meeting to vote on the transaction is currently scheduled for December 2.  
In addition, our integration planning management office is up and running with teams from both organizations preparing for a swift, effective combination once the deal closes. We will expect to close by early 2022.  
Moving on to the third quarter financial performance. I'm pleased to report solid ongoing momentum as we make our way towards the close of the fiscal year. Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 9% on a reported basis, 7% at a constant currency and 6% operationally. Like last quarter, growth was impacted by the continuing, if somewhat erratic, pace of COVID-19 pandemic recovery, while the pandemic still represented a headwind to top line sales in the quarter, the magnitude of this headwind has continued to decline, reflecting the improved rate of hospital admissions in the U.S. as well as ongoing pandemic recovery in international markets.  
This resulted in a favorable comparison to the same period last year. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.02, up 23% and exceeded our third quarter guidance. Positive mix and disciplined expense management drove the favorability. As you saw in our earnings release, all of our geographic segments and product categories contributed to the positive performance in the quarter.  
The pace of pandemic recovery continues to vary by both therapeutic and geographic market. Our broad global footprint and diverse portfolio of essential products combined to help mitigate the variability and shore up the strength of our overall enterprise. We also benefit from our resilience and agility, which have been greatly enhanced through our ongoing transformation.  
Looking at performance by business, growth was led by BioPharma Solutions which advanced 45% at constant currency rates. Performance was driven by revenues related to our manufacturing of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Medication Delivery grew at 11% constant currency, reflecting the improved rate of U.S. hospital admissions in new infusion pump contract with a large health system in the U.S. and increased demand for Baxter's small volume parenterals.  
With respect to our NOVUM IQ 510(k) submission, we are continuing to work with the FDA to address their questions on our submission. While we hope to receive clearance by the end of this year, it is possible it may shift into early 2022. In Pharmaceuticals, 7% constant currency growth reflects the benefit of our acquisition of specified rights outside the U.S. to Caelyx and Doxil. Adjusting results for the acquisition, operational growth rose 1%.  
Year-over-year growth in the quarter reflects lower U.S. sales in part due to a large pandemic-related government order received in Q3 2020 and softness in inhaled anesthesia. This challenging comparison was offset by strong growth internationally, driven by our pharmacy compounding business. Our third quarter launch of premix norepinephrine was met with strong demand, part of an increasing trend as hospital pharmacies embrace premix formulated drugs and other products that improve efficiency, particularly in the wake of the pandemic.  
This is a key strength of our pharma portfolio, and we plan to continue launching more molecules with differentiated presentations or complex formulations in the months to come. During the quarter, advanced surgery performance in the U.S. was affected by lower surgical volumes, which remain depressed versus pre-pandemic rates. Procedure volumes were unfavorable to our prior expectations as hospitals delayed elective procedures in light of the delta variant. This was more than offset by growth in the international markets, which could slowly recover from the effects of the pandemic.  
Growth in Clinical Nutrition reflected the benefit of our new product launches particularly in international markets. Acute Therapies continues to perform very well. A year-over-year decline in U.S. sales reflects a difficult comparison in the face of last year's surge in demand for continuous renal replacement or CRRT products. Again, this was offset by international growth as an outcome of the pandemic, we now have many more CRRT devices in the food as well as heightened engagement immunization on the part of clinicians creating a platform for sustained momentum.  
Growth in Renal Care was driven by our home-based peritoneal dialysis or PD products globally. As I have mentioned on past calls, demand does continue to be dampened amid the pandemic due to higher mortality rates for patients with kidney disease and a slowdown in new patient diagnosis. We expect the ESRD market to gradually recover to pre-COVID growth rates over the next 1 to 2 years. 
Our Renal Care team's global safer at home campaign is dedicated to helping clinicians, patients and other stakeholders learn more about the benefits of home-based PD care, especially in the context of today's pandemic conditions.  
From an ESG perspective, I'm pleased to highlight a new partnership between UNICEF USA and the Baxter International Foundation to improve access to safe water in La Guajira, Colombia, one of the country's most water-challenged regions. A $1.5 million foundation grant is helping fund the multifaceted 3-year program. This quarter, we also honored to be included on Forbes latest list of the World's Best Employers and America's Best Employers for women. In addition, we are recognized as a leading organization on Seramount's 2021 inclusion index.  
Looking forward, we continue to navigate with some uncertainty on the horizon. The overall trajectory of pandemic recovery appears more clear but the new geographic contours remain inconsistent. New variants may take an unknown toll on our business and our employees, and we will continue to contend with the effect of macroeconomic issues. Related to this last point, we are not immune to inflationary pressures and the rising cost of raw materials, commodities, components, fuel and ongoing supply chain disruptions.  
While we are actively working to address these rapidly rising costs, we recognize these factors may continue to impact our operations into 2022. Amid these challenges, we are on pace very strong close to the year. This translates into momentum as we get set to execute on the vast potential of our proposed Hillrom acquisition and launch the next phase of our transformation journey, fueled by the commitment of our outstanding global team.  
Now I will pass it to Jay for a closer look at our financial results and outlook."

As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong third quarter performance. Third quarter 2021 global sales of $3.2 billion, advanced 9% on a reported basis, 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% operationally. Sal",1410,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong third quarter performance. Third quarter 2021 global sales of $3.2 billion, advanced 9% on a reported basis, 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% operationally. Sales growth this quarter reflects the benefit from revenues associated with the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, strength in medication delivery and OUS sales of Caelyx and Doxil, which totaled approximately $32 million in the quarter.  
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 23% and to $1.02 per share, exceeding our guidance range, driven by a favorable product mix, primarily from better-than-expected sales of Acute Therapies and BioPharma Solutions as well as disciplined operational execution.  
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments in key product categories. Starting with our regional segments. Sales in the Americas increased 7% on both the constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 7% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally. And sales in our Asia Pacific region advanced 8% on both a constant currency and operational basis.  
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this [indiscernible] constant currency is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for the Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth, adjusting for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the U.S. for Caelyx and Doxil.  
Global sales for Renal Care were $981 million increased 1% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in our PD business where we experienced year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes despite the negative impact on volumes resulting from the pandemic, including increased mortality rates in ESRD patients, delays in new patient diagnoses and market-wide staffing shortages.  
PD growth was partially offset by declining international sales in our In-center HD business and Renal Care clinics. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnosis resulting from the pandemic and expect the market to return to pre-COVID growth rates over the next 12 to 24 months.  
Medication delivery of $747 million increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in this business reflects continued recovery in the pace of hospital admissions as well as increased demand for large volume infusion pumps, IV solutions and small volume parenterals.  
During the quarter, we estimate that U.S. hospital admissions were down approximately 4% compared to pre-COVID levels, a significant improvement from the same quarter last year, which saw U.S. admissions down approximately [Audio Gap] versus pre-Covid levels.
In addition, during the quarter we executed and began delivering infusion pumps under a contract with a large health system in the U.S. which resulted in our highest number of quarterly pump placements in over 5 years. 
Pharmaceutical sales of $589 million advanced 7% on a constant currency basis and 1% operationally. Performance in the quarter was driven by demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and the contribution from OUS sales of Caelyx and Doxil. Growth in the quarter also benefited from increase sales of the Dexmed and our portfolio of premixes as hospitals continue combating the COVID-19 pandemic and look toward premix formulations and workflow efficiencies.  
This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. business related to lower surgical procedures and a government order of approximately $20 million in Q3 2020. Moving to Clinical Nutrition, total sales were $244 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by the benefit of new product launches within our broad multichamber product offering.  
Sales in Advanced Surgery were $249 million, increasing 5% on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we saw a strong growth from our international business and estimate surgical procedures improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis in many international markets. This growth was partially offset by performance in the U.S. with surgical procedures estimated at 95% of pre-COVID levels, a sequential and year-over-year decline in surgical procedure volumes due to the impact of the Delta variant and staff shortages.  
This was below our previous procedures returning to pre-COVID levels during the third quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $185 million, advancing 3% on a constant currency basis and were favorable to our expectations. Performance in the quarter continued to benefit from elevated demand for CRRT, particularly given the rise in COVID cases associated with the Delta variant.  
BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $206 million, representing growth of 45% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, which totaled more than $50 million in the quarter.  
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 44% increased by 140 basis points over the prior year, reflecting a favorable product mix and operational improvements in manufacturing. Adjusted SG&A of $640 million increased 11% as compared to the prior year period and was favorable to expectations, driven by disciplined expense management, which more than offset increased supply chain and logistics expenses recognized in the quarter. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $129 million increased 6% versus the prior year period. Both adjusted SG&A and R&D spending reflect a somewhat more normalized level of spend as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a result of the pandemic, particularly those related to employee bonus accruals. This improvement in gross margin, coupled with the continued OpEx management resulted in an adjusted operating margin in the quarter of 20.2%, an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year. 
Adjusted net interest expense totaled $32 million in the quarter and other nonoperating expense was $12 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.8%, a decrease over the prior year, driven primarily by a favorable change in earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $1.02 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share. 
With respect to cash flow, year-to-date, we've generated $1.5 billion in operating cash flow. Free cash flow totaled over $1 billion and represented growth of nearly 50% as compared to the prior year period. I would like to take a moment to reiterate our excitement around our recent announcement to acquire Hillrom. We believe the strategic rationale and underlying financials of the combination are compelling and provide us with a meaningful opportunity for value creation. Our integration teams are hard at work and we look forward to finalizing this combination by early 2022. 
In the meantime, we continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is founded on accelerating growth, driving innovation and returning value to our shareholders. Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of 7% to 8% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil and over 200 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth. 
Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates in the U.S. will remain below pre-COVID levels exiting the year down low single digits. Although surgical procedure data in the U.S. declined sequentially Q2 to Q3, our current expectation is that U.S. surgical procedures will improve sequentially and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter. 
We are continuing to monitor this assumption in light of potential impacts from COVID outbreaks and hospital staffing shortages. Moving down the P&L, we now expect adjusted operating margin to expand more than 60 basis points. For the year, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of 16.5% to 17% and a full year diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares. 
Based on these factors, we now expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.58 to $3.62 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of 3% to 4% on a reported basis, 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis and 3% to 4% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1 to $1.04 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open the call up to Q&A."

For procedures and volumes, the comments really relate to the United States because outside the U.S., we are seeing more variability. But from a U.S. standpoint, our expectation is that by year-end, we'll be down low single digits and the quarter will be down low single digits from an emission standpoint, again, a third quarter where we were down 4%. And we're seeing that in the marketplace today. So far, things are tracking broadly in line with our expectations. 
For procedures, we were a little bit disappointed with procedures in the third quarter but came in below our expectations down 5%. But we are seeing some recovery, and we expect that to continue so that the year-end assumption -- the Q4 assumption is flat procedure volumes relative to prior year. Now I will tell you there are risks that we're monitoring with respect to this. 
One of the -- certainly, there's the COVID factor. But another one that's acute and we have to be mindful of is nursing and staffing shortages in hospitals. But we were just having conversations with our U.S. sales force I mean frankly, this is a factor that's coming into play. I don't necessarily think at this point, it's a meaningful factor relative to the expectations that we've shared. But as far as risk go, moving into November and December, we will continue to monitor that."

First, I'll address the SG&A piece. SG&A in the second half of the year will be sub-20%. And certainly, as we look at that number, I would expect to see some elevation of that as we move into next year. We're going to resume more normal activities. We've still been very limited on a travel basis. We have still been very limited on a promotional basis in light of the COVID environment that we're faced with. And so we'll expect to resume normal activities as we move into next year. 
And there will be some uptick in SG&A percent of sales is our current expectation. So that's -- I think that's one thing to consider. As we look at the gross margin, this is a more interesting one for me. From our standpoint, gross margin came in, broadly speaking, in line with our expectations in the quarter. In Q4, we don't have tremendous surprises. But embedded in that, we are seeing some material and wage inflation. We're also seeing some planning and fulfillment costs in excess of our expectations. So those factors have been dragged, frankly, on our gross margin in Q3 and Q4. 
And as we look to next year, one of the big uncertainties that we're facing are these categories of spending. How much is inflation sustained versus temporal, how much disruption continues to exist in the supply chain. These are key factors that we're currently evaluating as we look at the plan. And it's a very dynamic environment. If you think about this year, we've had things like the Suez Canal, the Houston Freeze, disrupting logistics and also the resin market. But more recently, Hurricane Ida has put a fragile resin market under real pressure. And so how that evolves over the coming months is going to be a critically important input as we look at our 2022 operating plan."

It's been incredibly challenging for us to address the needs in this volatile supply chain environment. So those are -- that's really the key factor that's playing into our numbers today. 
As we think about inflation, some of the recent moves actually don't roll out until next year because as you know, we purchase a product, we manufacture the product. It sits in inventory and then sold and once sold, that's when we reflect the impact in our financials. So the impact in Q3 and Q4 [indiscernible] is more limited, but that's the piece that we're watching as we move to next year."

But I believe that what you still have is the factor that many people in the United States are now vaccinated. And that has proven to be the Achilles' heel of the recovery in 2021 was the lack of vaccination that caused the issue. Second, hospitals have responded very differently upon the regions of the country, they've got hit the hardest. So it's tough to sit here and predict. I'm sure everybody learned a lesson. But until you get to a point that this moves from a pandemic infection to an endemic infection is going to be tough to predict. 
I believe what you -- what we are seeing, what needs to be considered, and I'm sure you've heard this from other companies is the labor shortage in hospitals, the issues with nursing availability, the travel nurses are very expensive. So inflation in hospital costs as well as the availability of nurses to be able to perform procedures in hospitals are doing just day procedures, no overnight. Some hospitals are cutting the day short because of lack of support. 
So this is not  across the board everywhere. It is very regional, sometimes very local, depends upon the hospital. So I want to make sure that we're not the COVID predictors. I'm sure the country has learned a very tough lesson hospitals and everybody is much better prepared today.

We'll end the year -- the second half margin should be over 20%, which is really a nice achievement in the context of the environment in which we're operating. So as we move to next year, really, there are a few factors in play. Every year, the second half margin is ahead of the first half margin in part because of larger sales contribution in the second half versus the first half. And in addition, we have a lot of spending that's concentrated in the first half of the year relative to promotional activity. 
And so those things sort of lower the first half margin relative to the second half. But there's a couple of other things that will happen next year that we'll be mindful of. First, and I referenced this earlier, could be a normalization of operating expenses as we resume activity, promotional activity and travel, and that's our current expectation. But then the final piece, and this is the piece, as I referenced earlier, we'll have a lot of work to do on is the inflationary impact that I referenced and Joe refenced in his prepared remarks. 
The impact of material inflation and wage inflation has increased throughout the year, and we had the Hurricane Ida disruption. So the full magnitude of this is something we're currently quantifying and carefully watching and the sustained nature of it. We've seen resin prices abate a little bit, but how that emerges, that's an important cost category for us. All of those things will impact 2022 and so we'll watch those things very carefully."

But I will tell you that we still have some significant lingering costs even in Q3. But part of the improvement from first half to second half relates to a reduction in COVID-related costs. 
Now the key question for us is what happens through to next year. And so we're watching very carefully the evolution of the pandemic. And that will be an important input as we model out COVID-related costs for next year. What we've always said is we expect roughly $30 million of sustained costs. And I believe in the past, we've talked about up to $150 million of total COVID-related costs impacting our numbers. 
So we expect some sustained level of cost. And frankly, we couldn't have some costs remain in the first half of next year, depending on how things emerge. The critical variable for us and we've seen very volatile movements in this are some of the raw material costs related to resin and packaging and also accessibility of components. And so we spend a lot of time analyzing the indices. But I think the quality of the forecast of these indices only goes out so far. And what we've seen thus far is you can probably have reliable data for a few months. But beyond that, you have to take a position in terms of improving or disimproving. And so this is going to be an important part of the guidance that we put forth. 
Frankly, we'll study this for the next couple of months heading into January when we ultimately give guidance because it is such a volatile input and it's such an important input for us because a lot of our costs are related to resin, the cost of freight, the price of fuel and all of these things are key drivers for us."

First, in the U.S. regarding the sequentially slower growth. Could you talk a little bit more about relative impact of the various moving parts, new patient growth, excess mortality from COVID? I think you mentioned staffing shortages being a factor. And then my second question is on the OUS renal business. Can you talk about new PD patient trends in some of the key geographies? And then I guess question 2b is the weakness in In-center HD. Is that from price pressure or from share loss in dialyzers?"
254571,1683168886,2415842,"Baxter International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Sure. So overall, the renal business in the third quarter grew approximately 1% and we're expecting to see that improve to the fourth quarter, a couple of hundred basis points.

So overall, the renal business in the third quarter grew approximately 1% and we're expecting to see that improve to the fourth quarter, a couple of hundred basis points. So we are seeing -- we expect to see a recovery in the renal business. And if we look at it, our PD business was sort of mid-single-digit growth and we did see declines in HD. 
In the fourth quarter, we'll expect to see mid-single-digit growth again in PD, and it will also be matched by an improvement in In-center HD. The improvement in In-center HD relates to the timing of tenders that we see in our EMEA region. But I think your question is a good one related to the trajectory in this business. One, obviously, we're incredibly excited about the renal business.
In particular, as it relates to AAKHI, Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative, which we believe will provide a great incentive for movement to the home in the coming years along with patient dynamics. So long term, very excited about this, and this is an important component of the long-range plan that we've shared. But we are seeing in the short term some real disruptions in the marketplace -- And what I would say is there's really 3 factors: excess mortality, that's -- these are very vulnerable patients. And very unfortunately, we saw a lot of patients die related -- as a result of the COVID pandemic. 
And then the second thing relates to slower patient starts. And this is really a global phenomenon, people have been reluctant to go to doctors and hospitals. And these catheter insertions, in some cases, have been deprioritized or other procedures are favored relative to that in today's environment. 
But then the final factor is one that impacts a number of our businesses, and I referenced this earlier related to advanced surgery. But I think there is a significant nursing shortage that we will -- that our country and internationally will need to be addressed nurses are in short supply and that's another factor that's impacting treatment. 
So frankly, we've seen a challenging patient environment in the U.S. We did deem patients globally, but the vast majority of those came from China. Outside China, we were essentially flat Q2 to Q3. So these are all factors that ultimately, we believe, will correct in the coming months and years as we referenced earlier. But in the short term, this market is going to continue to be a challenging one."

And HD is the modality in the U.S. that not in-home but HD in-clinics is the one that drove a lot of that reduction. 
So what I think the outlook for the business is positive. It is going to be a 12- to 24-month climb because the death that were experienced in COVID because these patients are extremely sick patients of chronic disease and they were effected by the virus, the death rate was higher amongst that population but we feel very positive on AAKHI going forward as we climb out of this we believe that that's something that is here to stay. It's just that COVID caused us to have a deep work on the trajectory."

And my follow-up question is just on the staffing shortage headwinds that you guys are calling out and just with your broad reach. What are hospitals capable of doing to rectify these shortages, if anything, what are they doing currently? And then just with your comments are, I think you're still optimistic that procedure volumes can get back to 2019 levels or improve from 2019 levels in 4Q.

So you're buying that because of that. So when we look at the synergies that we can achieve with the acquisition of Hillrom, none of those -- none of the sales and marketing and research and development are part of the synergies. But we want to make sure that we continue to thrive and grow and hopefully accelerate growth in the future. 
But it's not going to be a disruption to how they go to market and how they're doing their business that now. We have synergies, of course, we do. And those are duplication of functions, different ways of doing things. And we have several shared service centers across the globe. We are a larger company with our different resources. Of course, we do have the ability to take cost out and make that enhance synergies. But at the moment now sitting here today, we don't have any plans in the short term at all to make any change that would disrupt their go-to-market and serving their patients to focus its patients. That's probably do. 
On your other question about staff shortage, this is a comment not related to Baxter only. Baxter is a health care company with  injectable pharmaceuticals and medical devices and peritoneal dialysis from products, where nursing shortages affect the overall market. 
Hospitals are dealing with this very effectively in most cases and their ability to deal with it depends upon their size and depends upon their regional location. So I can't speak on behalf of our customers. But I can tell you that what we see is tremendous adapted on their side. It does have an overall impact for the business, but no one that we can pinpoint. It's just a headwind that the industry has seen. We're just repeating here to make sure you understand that we're not exempt of this headwind. But it's not a headwind that we can mitigate on behalf of hospitals, but we can actually, with a very diverse portfolio, as we've proven in the past, be a more resilient company."

As usual, I will begin with an overview of Baxter's third quarter performance. Jay would take a closer look at the financials and outlook for the rest of the year. Then we will close with your questions.  
Clearly, the most notable highlight from the quarter is last month's announcement of our agreement to acquire Hillrom, subject to the approval of Hillrom shareholders and other customary closing conditions. I recently made site visits to select Hillrom locations as part of our integration planning process and I was joined by other members of our senior leadership team, meeting face-to-face with Hillrom's dedicated employees and touring the facilities only underscored our confidence and enthusiasm for the proposed acquisition of Hillrom.  
Upon closing of the transaction, we plan to bring a broader array of products and services to patients and clinicians across the care continuum and around the world. We are focused on identifying opportunities to further accelerate innovation to address the rapidly evolving needs of our customers. The teams are working diligently on plans to bring together these 2 complementary portfolios to deliver enhanced value for our stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on these acceleration opportunities following the close of the deal.  
Earlier this month, the Hart-Scott-Rodino or HSR waiting period in the U.S. expired with no issuance of a second request by the FTC. While the FTC reserves its right to take further action, this is a key milestone to clear the way for a successful closing. We are in the process of securing all remaining global regulatory approvals required for closing. And the Hillrom shareholder meeting to vote on the transaction is currently scheduled for December 2.  
In addition, our integration planning management office is up and running with teams from both organizations preparing for a swift, effective combination once the deal closes. We will expect to close by early 2022.  
Moving on to the third quarter financial performance. I'm pleased to report solid ongoing momentum as we make our way towards the close of the fiscal year. Baxter delivered third quarter sales growth of 9% on a reported basis, 7% at a constant currency and 6% operationally. Like last quarter, growth was impacted by the continuing, if somewhat erratic, pace of COVID-19 pandemic recovery, while the pandemic still represented a headwind to top line sales in the quarter, the magnitude of this headwind has continued to decline, reflecting the improved rate of hospital admissions in the U.S. as well as ongoing pandemic recovery in international markets.  
This resulted in a favorable comparison to the same period last year. On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.02, up 23% and exceeded our third quarter guidance. Positive mix and disciplined expense management drove the favorability. As you saw in our earnings release, all of our geographic segments and product categories contributed to the positive performance in the quarter.  
The pace of pandemic recovery continues to vary by both therapeutic and geographic market. Our broad global footprint and diverse portfolio of essential products combined to help mitigate the variability and shore up the strength of our overall enterprise. We also benefit from our resilience and agility, which have been greatly enhanced through our ongoing transformation.  
Looking at performance by business, growth was led by BioPharma Solutions which advanced 45% at constant currency rates. Performance was driven by revenues related to our manufacturing of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Medication Delivery grew at 11% constant currency, reflecting the improved rate of U.S. hospital admissions in new infusion pump contract with a large health system in the U.S. and increased demand for Baxter's small volume parenterals.  
With respect to our NOVUM IQ 510(k) submission, we are continuing to work with the FDA to address their questions on our submission. While we hope to receive clearance by the end of this year, it is possible it may shift into early 2022. In Pharmaceuticals, 7% constant currency growth reflects the benefit of our acquisition of specified rights outside the U.S. to Caelyx and Doxil. Adjusting results for the acquisition, operational growth rose 1%.  
Year-over-year growth in the quarter reflects lower U.S. sales in part due to a large pandemic-related government order received in Q3 2020 and softness in inhaled anesthesia. This challenging comparison was offset by strong growth internationally, driven by our pharmacy compounding business. Our third quarter launch of premix norepinephrine was met with strong demand, part of an increasing trend as hospital pharmacies embrace premix formulated drugs and other products that improve efficiency, particularly in the wake of the pandemic.  
This is a key strength of our pharma portfolio, and we plan to continue launching more molecules with differentiated presentations or complex formulations in the months to come. During the quarter, advanced surgery performance in the U.S. was affected by lower surgical volumes, which remain depressed versus pre-pandemic rates. Procedure volumes were unfavorable to our prior expectations as hospitals delayed elective procedures in light of the delta variant. This was more than offset by growth in the international markets, which could slowly recover from the effects of the pandemic.  
Growth in Clinical Nutrition reflected the benefit of our new product launches particularly in international markets. Acute Therapies continues to perform very well. A year-over-year decline in U.S. sales reflects a difficult comparison in the face of last year's surge in demand for continuous renal replacement or CRRT products. Again, this was offset by international growth as an outcome of the pandemic, we now have many more CRRT devices in the food as well as heightened engagement immunization on the part of clinicians creating a platform for sustained momentum.  
Growth in Renal Care was driven by our home-based peritoneal dialysis or PD products globally. As I have mentioned on past calls, demand does continue to be dampened amid the pandemic due to higher mortality rates for patients with kidney disease and a slowdown in new patient diagnosis. We expect the ESRD market to gradually recover to pre-COVID growth rates over the next 1 to 2 years. 
Our Renal Care team's global safer at home campaign is dedicated to helping clinicians, patients and other stakeholders learn more about the benefits of home-based PD care, especially in the context of today's pandemic conditions.  
From an ESG perspective, I'm pleased to highlight a new partnership between UNICEF USA and the Baxter International Foundation to improve access to safe water in La Guajira, Colombia, one of the country's most water-challenged regions. A $1.5 million foundation grant is helping fund the multifaceted 3-year program. This quarter, we also honored to be included on Forbes latest list of the World's Best Employers and America's Best Employers for women. In addition, we are recognized as a leading organization on Seramount's 2021 inclusion index.  
Looking forward, we continue to navigate with some uncertainty on the horizon. The overall trajectory of pandemic recovery appears more clear but the new geographic contours remain inconsistent. New variants may take an unknown toll on our business and our employees, and we will continue to contend with the effect of macroeconomic issues. Related to this last point, we are not immune to inflationary pressures and the rising cost of raw materials, commodities, components, fuel and ongoing supply chain disruptions.  
While we are actively working to address these rapidly rising costs, we recognize these factors may continue to impact our operations into 2022. Amid these challenges, we are on pace very strong close to the year. This translates into momentum as we get set to execute on the vast potential of our proposed Hillrom acquisition and launch the next phase of our transformation journey, fueled by the commitment of our outstanding global team.  
Now I will pass it to Jay for a closer look at our financial results and outlook."

Third quarter 2021 global sales of $3.2 billion, advanced 9% on a reported basis, 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% operationally. Sal",1409,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we're pleased with our strong third quarter performance. Third quarter 2021 global sales of $3.2 billion, advanced 9% on a reported basis, 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% operationally. Sales growth this quarter reflects the benefit from revenues associated with the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, strength in medication delivery and OUS sales of Caelyx and Doxil, which totaled approximately $32 million in the quarter.  
On the bottom line, adjusted earnings increased 23% and to $1.02 per share, exceeding our guidance range, driven by a favorable product mix, primarily from better-than-expected sales of Acute Therapies and BioPharma Solutions as well as disciplined operational execution.  
Now I'll walk through performance by our regional segments in key product categories. Starting with our regional segments. Sales in the Americas increased 7% on both the constant currency and operational basis. Sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 7% on a constant currency basis and 3% operationally. And sales in our Asia Pacific region advanced 8% on both a constant currency and operational basis.  
Moving on to performance by key product category. Note that for this [indiscernible] constant currency is equal to operational sales growth for all global businesses, except for the Pharmaceuticals business, for which we will provide both constant currency and operational growth, adjusting for the acquisition of rights in select territories outside the U.S. for Caelyx and Doxil.  
Global sales for Renal Care were $981 million increased 1% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by global growth in our PD business where we experienced year-over-year improvement in global patient volumes despite the negative impact on volumes resulting from the pandemic, including increased mortality rates in ESRD patients, delays in new patient diagnoses and market-wide staffing shortages.  
PD growth was partially offset by declining international sales in our In-center HD business and Renal Care clinics. We continue to monitor the impact of excess mortality among ESRD patients and delays in new patient diagnosis resulting from the pandemic and expect the market to return to pre-COVID growth rates over the next 12 to 24 months.  
Medication delivery of $747 million increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Strong global growth in this business reflects continued recovery in the pace of hospital admissions as well as increased demand for large volume infusion pumps, IV solutions and small volume parenterals.  
During the quarter, we estimate that U.S. hospital admissions were down approximately 4% compared to pre-COVID levels, a significant improvement from the same quarter last year, which saw U.S. admissions down approximately 12% versus pre-Covid levels.
In addition, during the quarter we executed and began delivering infusion pumps under a contract with a large health system in the U.S. which resulted in our highest number of quarterly pump placements in over 5 years. 
Pharmaceutical sales of $589 million advanced 7% on a constant currency basis and 1% operationally. Performance in the quarter was driven by demand for our international pharmacy compounding business and the contribution from OUS sales of Caelyx and Doxil. Growth in the quarter also benefited from increase sales of the Dexmed and our portfolio of premixes as hospitals continue combating the COVID-19 pandemic and look toward premix formulations and workflow efficiencies.  
This growth was partially offset by declines in our U.S. business related to lower surgical procedures and a government order of approximately $20 million in Q3 2020. Moving to Clinical Nutrition, total sales were $244 million, increasing 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance in the quarter was driven by the benefit of new product launches within our broad multichamber product offering.  
Sales in Advanced Surgery were $249 million, increasing 5% on a constant currency basis. Within the quarter, we saw a strong growth from our international business and estimate surgical procedures improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis in many international markets. This growth was partially offset by performance in the U.S. with surgical procedures estimated at 95% of pre-COVID levels, a sequential and year-over-year decline in surgical procedure volumes due to the impact of the Delta variant and staff shortages.  
This was below our previous procedures returning to pre-COVID levels during the third quarter. Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $185 million, advancing 3% on a constant currency basis and were favorable to our expectations. Performance in the quarter continued to benefit from elevated demand for CRRT, particularly given the rise in COVID cases associated with the Delta variant.  
BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $206 million, representing growth of 45% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental sales related to the manufacturing of COVID vaccines, which totaled more than $50 million in the quarter.  
Moving through the rest of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 44% increased by 140 basis points over the prior year, reflecting a favorable product mix and operational improvements in manufacturing. Adjusted SG&A of $640 million increased 11% as compared to the prior year period and was favorable to expectations, driven by disciplined expense management, which more than offset increased supply chain and logistics expenses recognized in the quarter. 
Adjusted R&D spending in the quarter of $129 million increased 6% versus the prior year period. Both adjusted SG&A and R&D spending reflect a somewhat more normalized level of spend as certain expense categories were depressed last year as a result of the pandemic, particularly those related to employee bonus accruals. This improvement in gross margin, coupled with the continued OpEx management resulted in an adjusted operating margin in the quarter of 20.2%, an increase of 100 basis points versus the prior year. 
Adjusted net interest expense totaled $32 million in the quarter and other nonoperating expense was $12 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.8%, a decrease over the prior year, driven primarily by a favorable change in earnings mix. And as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings of $1.02 per diluted share exceeded our guidance of $0.93 to $0.95 per diluted share. 
With respect to cash flow, year-to-date, we've generated $1.5 billion in operating cash flow. Free cash flow totaled over $1 billion and represented growth of nearly 50% as compared to the prior year period. I would like to take a moment to reiterate our excitement around our recent announcement to acquire Hillrom. We believe the strategic rationale and underlying financials of the combination are compelling and provide us with a meaningful opportunity for value creation. Our integration teams are hard at work and we look forward to finalizing this combination by early 2022. 
In the meantime, we continue to follow a strategic approach to capital allocation that is founded on accelerating growth, driving innovation and returning value to our shareholders. Let me conclude my comments by discussing our outlook for full year 2021. For full year 2021, we expect global sales growth of 7% to 8% on a reported basis, 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and 4% to 5% on an operational basis. This assumes a benefit of approximately 100 basis points to both reported and constant currency revenue growth for the acquisition of Caelyx/Doxil and over 200 basis points of positive top line impact from foreign exchange on reported growth. 
Our expectation remains that on a full year basis, hospital admission rates in the U.S. will remain below pre-COVID levels exiting the year down low single digits. Although surgical procedure data in the U.S. declined sequentially Q2 to Q3, our current expectation is that U.S. surgical procedures will improve sequentially and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter. 
We are continuing to monitor this assumption in light of potential impacts from COVID outbreaks and hospital staffing shortages. Moving down the P&L, we now expect adjusted operating margin to expand more than 60 basis points. For the year, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of 16.5% to 17% and a full year diluted average share count of approximately 510 million shares. 
Based on these factors, we now expect 2021 adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $3.58 to $3.62 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect global sales growth of 3% to 4% on a reported basis, 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis and 3% to 4% on an operational basis. And we expect adjusted earnings, excluding special items, of $1 to $1.04 per diluted share. 
With that, we can now open the call up to Q&A."

And we're seeing that in the marketplace today. So far, things are tracking broadly in line with our expectations. 
For procedures, we were a little bit disappointed with procedures in the third quarter but came in below our expectations down 5%. But we are seeing some recovery, and we expect that to continue so that the year-end assumption -- the Q4 assumption is flat procedure volumes relative to prior year. Now I will tell you there are risks that we're monitoring with respect to this. 
One of the -- certainly, there's the COVID factor. But another one that's acute and we have to be mindful of is nursing and staffing shortages in hospitals. But we were just having conversations with our U.S. sales force I mean frankly, this is a factor that's coming into play. I don't necessarily think at this point, it's a meaningful factor relative to the expectations that we've shared.

First, I'll address the SG&A piece. SG&A in the second half of the year will be sub-20%. And certainly, as we look at that number, I would expect to see some elevation of that as we move into next year. We're going to resume more normal activities. We've still been very limited on a travel basis. We have still been very limited on a promotional basis in light of the COVID environment that we're faced with. And so we'll expect to resume normal activities as we move into next year. 
And there will be some uptick in SG&A percent of sales is our current expectation. So that's -- I think that's one thing to consider. As we look at the gross margin, this is a more interesting one for me. From our standpoint, gross margin came in, broadly speaking, in line with our expectations in the quarter. In Q4, we don't have tremendous surprises. But embedded in that, we are seeing some material and wage inflation. We're also seeing some planning and fulfillment costs in excess of our expectations. So those factors have been dragged, frankly, on our gross margin in Q3 and Q4. 
And as we look to next year, one of the big uncertainties that we're facing are these categories of spending. How much is inflation sustained versus temporal, how much disruption continues to exist in the supply chain. These are key factors that we're currently evaluating as we look at the plan. And it's a very dynamic environment. If you think about this year, we've had things like the Suez Canal, the Houston Freeze, disrupting logistics and also the resin market. But more recently, Hurricane Ida has put a fragile resin market under real pressure. And so how that evolves over the coming months is going to be a critically important input as we look at our 2022 operating plan."

It's been incredibly challenging for us to address the needs in this volatile supply chain environment. So those are -- that's really the key factor that's playing into our numbers today. 
As we think about inflation, some of the recent moves actually don't roll out until next year because as you know, we purchase a product, we manufacture the product. It sits in inventory and then sold and once sold, that's when we reflect the impact in our financials. So the impact in Q3 and Q4 [indiscernible] is more limited, but that's the piece that we're watching as we move to next year."

But I believe that what you still have is the factor that many people in the United States are now vaccinated. And that has proven to be the Achilles' heel of the recovery in 2021 was the lack of vaccination that caused the issue. Second, hospitals have responded very differently upon the regions of the country, they've got hit the hardest. So it's tough to sit here and predict. I'm sure everybody learned a lesson. But until you get to a point that this moves from a pandemic infection to an endemic infection is going to be tough to predict. 
I believe what you -- what we are seeing, what needs to be considered, and I'm sure you've heard this from other companies is the labor shortage in hospitals, the issues with nursing availability, the travel nurses are very expensive. So inflation in hospital costs as well as the availability of nurses to be able to perform procedures in hospitals are doing just day procedures, no overnight. Some hospitals are cutting the day short because of lack of support. 
So this is not  across the board everywhere. It is very regional, sometimes very local, depends upon the hospital. So I want to make sure that we're not the COVID predictors. I'm sure the country has learned a very tough lesson hospitals and everybody is much better prepared today.

We'll end the year -- the second half margin should be over 20%, which is really a nice achievement in the context of the environment in which we're operating.

We'll end the year -- the second half margin should be over 20%, which is really a nice achievement in the context of the environment in which we're operating. So as we move to next year, really, there are a few factors in play. Every year, the second half margin is ahead of the first half margin in part because of larger sales contribution in the second half versus the first half. And in addition, we have a lot of spending that's concentrated in the first half of the year relative to promotional activity. 
And so those things sort of lower the first half margin relative to the second half. But there's a couple of other things that will happen next year that we'll be mindful of. First, and I referenced this earlier, could be a normalization of operating expenses as we resume activity, promotional activity and travel, and that's our current expectation. But then the final piece, and this is the piece, as I referenced earlier, we'll have a lot of work to do on is the inflationary impact that I referenced and Joe refenced in his prepared remarks. 
The impact of material inflation and wage inflation has increased throughout the year, and we had the Hurricane Ida disruption. So the full magnitude of this is something we're currently quantifying and carefully watching and the sustained nature of it. We've seen resin prices abate a little bit, but how that emerges, that's an important cost category for us. All of those things will impact 2022 and so we'll watch those things very carefully."

But I will tell you that we still have some significant lingering costs even in Q3. But part of the improvement from first half to second half relates to a reduction in COVID-related costs. 
Now the key question for us is what happens through to next year. And so we're watching very carefully the evolution of the pandemic. And that will be an important input as we model out COVID-related costs for next year. What we've always said is we expect roughly $30 million of sustained costs. And I believe in the past, we've talked about up to $150 million of total COVID-related costs impacting our numbers. 
So we expect some sustained level of cost. And frankly, we couldn't have some costs remain in the first half of next year, depending on how things emerge. The critical variable for us and we've seen very volatile movements in this are some of the raw material costs related to resin and packaging and also accessibility of components. And so we spend a lot of time analyzing the indices. But I think the quality of the forecast of these indices only goes out so far. And what we've seen thus far is you can probably have reliable data for a few months. But beyond that, you have to take a position in terms of improving or disimproving. And so this is going to be an important part of the guidance that we put forth. 
Frankly, we'll study this for the next couple of months heading into January when we ultimately give guidance because it is such a volatile input and it's such an important input for us because a lot of our costs are related to resin, the cost of freight, the price of fuel and all of these things are key drivers for us."

First, in the U.S. regarding the sequentially slower growth. Could you talk a little bit more about relative impact of the various moving parts, new patient growth, excess mortality from COVID? I think you mentioned staffing shortages being a factor. And then my second question is on the OUS renal business. Can you talk about new PD patient trends in some of the key geographies? And then I guess question 2b is the weakness in In-center HD. Is that from price pressure or from share loss in dialyzers?"
254571,1683168886,2476658,"Baxter International Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Baxter International Inc.","Executives","Sure.

So overall, the renal business in the third quarter grew approximately 1% and we're expecting to see that improve to the fourth quarter, a couple of hundred basis points. So we are seeing -- we expect to see a recovery in the renal business. And if we look at it, our PD business was sort of mid-single-digit growth and we did see declines in HD. 
In the fourth quarter, we'll expect to see mid-single-digit growth again in PD, and it will also be matched by an improvement in In-center HD. The improvement in In-center HD relates to the timing of tenders that we see in our EMEA region. But I think your question is a good one related to the trajectory in this business. One, obviously, we're incredibly excited about the renal business.
In particular, as it relates to AAKHI, Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative, which we believe will provide a great incentive for movement to the home in the coming years along with patient dynamics. So long term, very excited about this, and this is an important component of the long-range plan that we've shared. But we are seeing in the short term some real disruptions in the marketplace -- And what I would say is there's really 3 factors: excess mortality, that's -- these are very vulnerable patients. And very unfortunately, we saw a lot of patients die related -- as a result of the COVID pandemic. 
And then the second thing relates to slower patient starts. And this is really a global phenomenon, people have been reluctant to go to doctors and hospitals. And these catheter insertions, in some cases, have been deprioritized or other procedures are favored relative to that in today's environment. 
But then the final factor is one that impacts a number of our businesses, and I referenced this earlier related to advanced surgery. But I think there is a significant nursing shortage that we will -- that our country and internationally will need to be addressed nurses are in short supply and that's another factor that's impacting treatment. 
So frankly, we've seen a challenging patient environment in the U.S. We did deem patients globally, but the vast majority of those came from China. Outside China, we were essentially flat Q2 to Q3. So these are all factors that ultimately, we believe, will correct in the coming months and years as we referenced earlier. But in the short term, this market is going to continue to be a challenging one."

And HD is the modality in the U.S. that not in-home but HD in-clinics is the one that drove a lot of that reduction. 
So what I think the outlook for the business is positive. It is going to be a 12- to 24-month climb because the death that were experienced in COVID because these patients are extremely sick patients of chronic disease and they were effected by the virus, the death rate was higher amongst that population but we feel very positive on AAKHI going forward as we climb out of this we believe that that's something that is here to stay. It's just that COVID caused us to have a deep work on the trajectory."

And my follow-up question is just on the staffing shortage headwinds that you guys are calling out and just with your broad reach. What are hospitals capable of doing to rectify these shortages, if anything, what are they doing currently? And then just with your comments are, I think you're still optimistic that procedure volumes can get back to 2019 levels or improve from 2019 levels in 4Q.

So when we look at the synergies that we can achieve with the acquisition of Hillrom, none of those -- none of the sales and marketing and research and development are part of the synergies. But we want to make sure that we continue to thrive and grow and hopefully accelerate growth in the future. 
But it's not going to be a disruption to how they go to market and how they're doing their business that now. We have synergies, of course, we do. And those are duplication of functions, different ways of doing things. And we have several shared service centers across the globe. We are a larger company with our different resources. Of course, we do have the ability to take cost out and make that enhance synergies. But at the moment now sitting here today, we don't have any plans in the short term at all to make any change that would disrupt their go-to-market and serving their patients to focus its patients. That's probably do. 
On your other question about staff shortage, this is a comment not related to Baxter only. Baxter is a health care company with  injectable pharmaceuticals and medical devices and peritoneal dialysis from products, where nursing shortages affect the overall market. 
Hospitals are dealing with this very effectively in most cases and their ability to deal with it depends upon their size and depends upon their regional location. So I can't speak on behalf of our customers. But I can tell you that what we see is tremendous adapted on their side. It does have an overall impact for the business, but no one that we can pinpoint. It's just a headwind that the industry has seen. We're just repeating here to make sure you understand that we're not exempt of this headwind. But it's not a headwind that we can mitigate on behalf of hospitals, but we can actually, with a very diverse portfolio, as we've proven in the past, be a more resilient company."
