Apologies for that quick technical glitch there, the line dropped. So as you can see from our results, we continue to prove our resilience across business cycles as a company. We delivered another year of strong earnings growth with adjusted EPS up 8% and record free cash flow despite a 2% decline on the top line. 
We said coming into this year that a key focus of ours in the lower growth environment would be to protect our overall profitability. We delivered on that promise. Margins again expanded significantly, reflecting the successful execution of our long-term strategies as well as the team's fast response in implementing temporary cost-saving actions. The result, combined with better-than-expected volumes in the second half, essentially accelerated the margin expansion we had planned for 2021 into 2020, enabling us to deliver EBITDA margins of over 15%. 
Our strong performance reflects the remarkable preparedness and incredible agility of our teams who have come together extraordinarily well in navigating one of the most challenging periods we have experienced as a company. In this environment, our focus continues to be on ensuring the health and well-being of our employees, delivering for our customers, supporting our communities and minimizing the impact of the recession for our shareholders while continuing to invest in the long-term success of the company.  I'm pleased with the progress we are making on all fronts. 
Now despite our best efforts to protect employee health, we have identified roughly 1,100 confirmed cases of the virus within our 30,000-plus workforce, with the majority of cases reflecting community spread rather than a work-based source of infection. Fortunately, over 80% of the employees impacted have already recovered. The recent surge of confirmed cases in a number of the regions in which we operate, highlights the continued uncertainty of the current environment as well as the importance of remaining vigilant with respect to safety and agile and meeting customer needs. 
In light of the significant challenges throughout 2020, we also took additional measures in support of our employees and communities. We provided additional compensation and benefits in the early stages of the pandemic to reduce the financial impact on employees in some of the hardest hit regions. We provided supplemental payments to our front-line workers to thank them for their courage and agility in serving our customers' essential needs. And we stepped up our level of community engagement, including an additional $10 million contribution for charitable causes. 
I'm pleased with the continued progress that we are making towards the success of all of our stakeholders, as evidenced by the fact that we are on track to deliver the vast majority of our long-term financial and sustainability objectives. 
Our consistent performance reflects the strength of our markets, our industry leading positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented team. We are focused on the consistent execution of our 5 key strategies: driving outsized growth in high value categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, continuing our relentless focus on productivity, being highly disciplined capital allocators and leading with environmentally and socially responsible practices and solutions. 
In 2020, we made progress on each. High-value categories again outperformed. We protected and even grew margins in our base businesses. We delivered $200 million of cost reduction, both structural and temporary. We completed 2 acquisitions, Smartrac, which significantly accelerates our strategies and capabilities to build out our intelligent label platform with RFID and AKPO, which enhances our position in our North American label and Graphics Materials business. 
Lastly, we continue to make solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. We have substantially reduced the environmental impact of our operations while focusing increasingly on the development and launch of more innovative, environmentally friendly products and solutions. 
Now a quick summary of our results by business. LGM's adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points to just above 15% for the year on a modest decline in revenue. In Label and Packaging Materials, underlying label demand has remained strong throughout the downturn, given the increased consumption of consumer packaged goods and e-commerce trends, while the somewhat more cyclical graphics and reflective solutions business declined. 
From the start-up of the pandemic until now, volume trends for LPM have varied more than usual throughout the year. From March through December, overall, our North American label business has grown mid- to high single digits, roughly double the long-term average for the region, while Europe has grown low to mid-single digits, comparable to the region's long-term average. And while the mature regions have grown at or above their long-term average since March, Asia Pacific volumes were below their long-term trend, up low single digits across the period. This lower-than-usual growth in Asia was due to declines from March to June before rebounding to mid single-digit volume growth in the second half. 
In Retail Branding and Information Solutions, revenue and margins were both down for the year. Following a sharp decline in Q2, demand improved sequentially in the second half, with Q4 coming in at 3% organic growth. We delivered more than a full point of margin expansion in the second half, driven by the better-than-anticipated volumes and tight cost controls. 
Enterprise-wide, RFID sales grew more than 40% for the year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the contribution of the Smartrac acquisition and organic growth of 9% for the year. Organic growth of RFID rebounded quickly in the second half, up roughly 20%, driven primarily by apparel. Outside of apparel, we are seeing increasing interest in new applications within food and logistics, among other categories. The momentum in these applications is focused on driving labor efficiency, improving availability of products, and the migration to e-commerce. 
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities, with industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continue to expect long-term growth of 15% to 20% as we build RFID into a broader intelligent label platform, which is now a more than $500 million business. 
And as for Industrial and Healthcare Materials, we expanded margin in this segment for the year despite lower revenue. IHM returned to growth in Q4, and we continue to make progress towards our long-term profitability target here. 
To recap, we delivered another year of strong earnings growth and free cash flow despite challenging market conditions. We entered this crisis from a position of financial, operational and commercial strength and will emerge from it even stronger. We are once again proving our resilience as a company and our ability to consistently deliver for all of our stakeholders. And we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver GDP-plus growth and top quartile return on capital. We look forward to sharing more about our long-term objectives and strategies to all of you at our Investor Day next month. And I'll now turn the call over to Greg."
252978,701917312,2190089,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide an update today on our performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2021. Slide 11 of our supplemental presentation materials p",1491,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide an update today on our performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2021. Slide 11 of our supplemental presentation materials provides an update on our progress against the 5-year targets that we communicated in 2017. And recall that this represents our third set of long-term goals after meeting or beating our previous 2 sets. 
The consistent execution of our key strategies enables us to continue delivering against our targets, with an overriding focus on delivering GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital over the long term. As you can see, we are largely on track to deliver once again. Over the 4-year period, sales growth on a constant currency basis is up nearly 4% annually, with organic growth of 2% annually. While both are below our initial target, largely due to the late-stage recession in this cycle, we are achieving our objective of growing above GDP over this period.
Reporting operating margin was 11.6% in 2020 or 12.4% on an adjusted basis, up significantly from roughly 10% in 2016. Additionally, our EBITDA margin was above 15% in 2020. And as always, our focus will continue to be the optimal balance of growth, margins and capital efficiency to drive incremental EVA over the long term. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is up over 15% annually, largely driven by the solid top line growth and strong margin expansion. And our return on total capital came in at 18% for 2020, above our 17% target, reflecting top quartile performance relative to our capital market peers.  And our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below the low end of our target range, giving us ample capacity to continue executing our strategies. 
Our consistent progress towards achieving these long-term goals reflects the diversity of our end markets, the strength of our position in those markets and our resilience and agility as an organization to adjust course when needed. 
At the same time that we communicated our financial goals through 2021, we also laid out a 5-year plan for capital allocation, which you can see on Slide 12. We're tracking well against this plan, starting with strong cash flow generation. And we've deployed a total of $3.4 billion over the last 4 years, allocating it in line with our long-term plan. And clearly, our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue investing organically as well as through strategic acquisitions. while continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way. 
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter. Overall, financial results were strong, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, up 31% versus prior year, reflecting better-than-expected top and bottom line performance in each of our segments. We grew sales by 12.3% or 3.2% on an organic basis. And currency translation increased reported sales growth by 2.3 points, and the extra week in the fourth quarter increased reported sales by 4.9%. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 160 basis points to 13.5%, reflecting significant margin expansion in each operating segment. Our tight near-term cost controls in this environment, combined with the flow-through benefit from a volume surge late in the quarter as well as our ongoing structural productivity actions and a benefit from the 53rd week, drove strong margin expansion in Q4. And we realized $18 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter, due in part to the long-term actions that we accelerated into 2020, particularly in RBIS. 
And for the year, we generated $548 million of free cash flow, up 7% compared to 2019. Total capital and IT spending came in at $219 million, higher than recent expectations as we accelerated investment in our high value categories, particularly in RFID. 
And as mentioned previously, our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at year-end of 1.7. And as we've proven our ability to manage through the compounding global crises we face this year, we've been putting that leverage capacity to work. For the year, we deployed $350 million for strategic acquisitions as well as return of $301 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and a growing dividend. 
Now let me turn to segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 3.6% on an organic basis, driven by the net effect of volume and mix and sales improved sequentially across all regions. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits organically, benefiting from a late quarter pandemic-related surge in demand. And Specialty and Durable Label categories grew high single digits with low to mid single-digit growth in the base business. Graphics and Reflective sales were down mid-single digits, reflecting modest sequential improvement after rebounding significantly in Q3, following the sharp decline in Q2 as a result of the government-mandated lockdowns then. 
Looking at the segment sales trends by region in Q4, in North America, LGM sales were up mid-single digits organically for the quarter, with LPM up high single digits, while graphics declined modestly. In Europe, LGM sales for the quarter were roughly flat on an organic basis, reflecting strong sequential improvement. LPM was up low single digits, while graphics declined by high single digits. And in Asia, LGM was up low single digits for the quarter on an organic basis, with relatively consistent growth across the countries. 
LGM's adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 15.4% as the benefits of productivity, favorable volume and mix and raw material deflation net of pricing more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 11.6% ex-currency, and up 3.1% on an organic basis, reflecting continued improvement in both the high-value categories and the base business as retailers geared up for the holiday season early on in the quarter. 
High-value categories were up nearly 20% organically, with enterprise-wide RFID sales up 55% ex-currency and up 21% on an organic basis. And the base business was down low to mid-single digits. 
Looking at the total apparel business, the value channel outperformed all the other channels and was up 40% organically for the quarter. And adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 210 basis points to 15.7%. The significant margin expansion was driven by productivity initiatives, including accelerated structural actions and temporary cost controls, along with the better-than-anticipated volumes. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related costs. 
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased by 0.7% on an organic basis as a high single-digit increase for industrial categories, reflecting continued sequential improvement in transfer automotive applications, in particular, was partially offset by a mid- single-digit decline in health care categories. Adjusted operating margin increased by 210 basis points to 12.3% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
So turning now to our outlook for 2021. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.65 to $8.05. We've outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 18 of our supplemental presentation materials. We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 3% to 7%, with the midpoint of that range, reflecting continued recovery in our end markets across the segments. 
The extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be a headwind of a little more than 1 point to reported sales growth and a roughly $0.15 headwind to EPS for the full year. We anticipate Q1 will benefit by roughly $0.10 based on the shift in the calendar, more than offset by roughly $0.25 to headwind then in Q4. 
Based on recent rates, currency translation is a roughly 2-point tailwind to reported sales growth, with an estimated $25 million benefit to operating income. And we estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, of roughly $70 million in 2021. Given we previously accelerated some 2021 actions into the second half of 2020, the vast majority of the savings represent the carryover impact from actions that we initiated last year. And we also expect the majority of the approximately $135 million in temporary cost savings we delivered in 2020 to be a headwind as markets recover. 
Moving to our outlook on the tax rate. Based on current regulations, we expect both the GAAP and adjusted tax rates will be in the mid-20s for the full year. And we expect free cash flow to be more than $600 million in 2021. 
And finally, we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of $83 million to $84 million. In summary, despite the challenging environment, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long-term goals in 2020. And we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver exceptional value through our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. 
And now we'll open up the call for your questions."

I know you mentioned that there was a late quarter surge, but GNR also got weaker, which is higher margin, I think, for that segment. So just curious if you can give us a little bit more color on the margin strength?

So on the last part of your question, certainly, as you said, you can see in the backup slide with the monthly numbers that we saw a pickup in the LPM side of the business in November and December. Yes, we think that's a function similar to earlier in the year, as there are more lockdowns, particularly in Europe and in parts of the U.S., we saw more consumption of packaged goods late in the fourth quarter. So that was part of what lifted the volume growth in Q4. And that also then helped drive part of the Q4 margins for LGM. As we've talked about in the past, we've been driving the temporary cost savings with volumes coming in better than expected in the quarter that helped deliver stronger margins overall. At the same time, we did have the extra week in Q4. That actually, we turned out to be a pretty strong week, and we did see that also have about a 30 basis point margin impact in LGM as well as the total company level."

We still expect to grow in that 15% to 20% pace, as we've talked about over the years and as we demonstrated, certainly in the back half. That by itself, given the size of the IL business now would add about 1 point to 1.5 points of overall growth for the company. At the same time, when we look versus 2020, and we see the quarters that were hit the hardest Q2 and then a little bit. If we fully recovered that, we think that would be somewhere in 3 to 4 points of growth for the year on a full year basis. We've built in about 2 to 3 points of growth on recovering some of that volume decline that we saw in those most hit quarters in '20. So those are a couple of big drivers of the growth that we see year-over-year. At the same time, we would expect in the businesses that were hit the hardest in 2020 to have the biggest growth rates as we see that recovery come through in those segments."

When you think just like you said, across the company, the range of our guidance assumptions includes a number of different factors, depending on the environment and the macro. We would start -- expect to see, certainly, when you look at the second quarter, when we had the trough in some of the businesses that had a margin impact there. We would expect to see a larger recovery, particularly in Q2. 
When we look more broadly, as you know, when we've talked about in the past, our overall focus over time is balancing our top line growth with strong margins and strong capital efficiency in order to drive long-term growth in EVA. And that's how we'll continue to think about it. So margins continues to be a big factor, of course, in continuing to drive margins, but we're looking at the balance of those 3 things that drive long-term EVA growth over time."

So overall, 2 questions there. As far as the apparel adoption rate. So apparel continue -- I mean the pandemic has really -- what we've seen is a second inflection point, if you will, an acceleration of activity, not just Tier 1, but a lot of Tier 2 retailers and brands in addition to Tier 1. So a significant amount of our pipeline is also apparel growth. We had traditionally said, we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. It's clearly a bit more than that, but we also said, over time, we expect the addressable market to increase a bit over time as well. So that's where we are in addressable market, still quite a bit of upside overall within apparel, and we see obviously huge opportunities outside of apparel. 
And so to your question, 15% to 20%, do we see upside to that? Yes, I mean, we see a huge opportunity for us. It's really around developing market opportunities and then capturing those opportunities, we see significant long-term potential here. The 15% to 20% we've created because there's a certain level of just pace of adoptions that we go through. And given the size of this business being over $500 million now, as Greg said, it's now adding 1.5 points to our overall growth. So that's a pretty significant amount of dollar growth every year if you look at it from that perspective. So we're clearly not limiting ourselves to what the upside can be. I think 15% to 20% is the right target, where clearly aspirations are to develop this into a much larger business than it is today, and we see it having a very long runway ahead of it.

We'll have a better read after January and February, we comped through the Lunar New Year. 
Overall, what you're seeing, though, is the North American market doing better than Europe. If you look at just apparel import trends alone, apparel imports in the U.S. for the full year, they were down close to 20%. If you look at the last 6 months where the data is available, it was down 11 and it's up a couple of percent, if you look at the last few months. So that does show an improving trend here in the U.S. Europe, however, continues to be down quite significantly, down around 20% or so the last few months. So a bit of a decoupling between U.S. and Europe is what we're seeing right now. And generally, holiday was a bit better than people had anticipated. And we're really going to need a little bit more time than just right after the holiday to get a good sense of where things play out. And I'd say Europe is the bigger question for us."

Within apparel, the time line has shortened quite a bit from where it was a few years ago, just because there's a -- technology is proven everybody knows that the business case is very robust.

There's not -- the average isn't that great, but say, 6 to 9 months is what I would give as an estimate. 
Within other categories, it can vary quite a bit. It obviously is longer than that, as far as the pipeline, when it starts from just the business case and then moves into pilot and testing and so forth. So that takes a bit longer. I would say the biggest area of the pipeline growth that we're seeing. We talked about apparel, having good increases within apparel overall, but outside of that. And if you look at food, our pipeline is up quite significantly as well as with logistics up quite significantly. And we're seeing a number of pilots that we expect in the pilot phase, will give us $1 million of revenue or so here in 2021, and assuming they're successful in convert, which we sure confident they will, they would turn into $5 million programs each individual one. So that's where we are in the food. We've been working for a while. I've accelerated a bit in the pandemic, along with logistics.

So I'm just wondering if that's a good characterization?  And because if I think back to early days of item level, apparel adoption, the business case was -- is very clear, right? It was inventory accuracy, preventing stockouts, a consequential sales lift and eventually that dovetailed into this transition to omnichannel and e-commerce. But help me understand like what's the business case in this logistics opportunity? It sounds like it's compelling. It sounds like it's there's more visibility in and around your traction there. So I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that."

So Chris, the business case is really around increasing productivity, becoming more touchless in your operations.

So Chris, the business case is really around increasing productivity, becoming more touchless in your operations. And that's some of the fundamental base case of what you had for apparel you have in these other categories. And that's specifically why we targeted these other categories. We looked for end markets that shared some similar characteristics and some challenges as what apparel is going through albeit in a different form. So absolutely, pandemic accelerated a lot of the activity within the pipeline. You say adoption has not yet really had a significant mover on adoption levels because it takes some time to work through the pipeline. I commented earlier about some of these programs more moving into pilot. The pandemic during the height of it, in the spring or the early phases of it, I should say, we commented it actually slowed down the amount of activity when restaurants were closed. As an example, there was a fewer opportunities for some pilots. Those have all re-ramped up again here in the second half. And I talked about the momentum going into 2021. So the use case is really around just becoming more touchless as far as interactions, driving productivity, wanting increased visibility, reducing waste RFID is a huge opportunity to reduce waste, so enabling companies to meet their own sustainability objectives. Those are all included within that, and we see tremendous opportunity here. So that's use case you should think about as very similar to apparel, albeit in a different form."

So in apparel, we actually sell just a base inlay. It's a minority of our sales to -- through the Smartrac channel and the LGM channel, through -- without managing the information and so forth to some competitors of the apparel solutions division. And the vast majority, though, of course, is what our apparels business sales fell through, as we say, we're vertically integrated, we're managing the information. 
Food will be the same as an example, where we're providing the full solution set in many areas. And I'd say the early adoption aspects will be more solution based. And so I would expect it to evolve similar to what we've seen in apparel."

Apologies for that quick technical glitch there, the line dropped. So as you can see from our results, we continue to prove our resilience across business cycles as a company. We delivered another year of strong earnings growth with adjusted EPS up 8% and record free cash flow despite a 2% decline on the top line. 
We said coming into this year that a key focus of ours in the lower growth environment would be to protect our overall profitability. We delivered on that promise. Margins again expanded significantly, reflecting the successful execution of our long-term strategies as well as the team's fast response in implementing temporary cost-saving actions. The result, combined with better-than-expected volumes in the second half, essentially accelerated the margin expansion we had planned for 2021 into 2020, enabling us to deliver EBITDA margins of over 15%. 
Our strong performance reflects the remarkable preparedness and incredible agility of our teams who have come together extraordinarily well in navigating one of the most challenging periods we have experienced as a company. In this environment, our focus continues to be on ensuring the health and well-being of our employees, delivering for our customers, supporting our communities and minimizing the impact of the recession for our shareholders while continuing to invest in the long-term success of the company.  I'm pleased with the progress we are making on all fronts. 
Now despite our best efforts to protect employee health, we have identified roughly 1,100 confirmed cases of the virus within our 30,000-plus workforce, with the majority of cases reflecting community spread rather than a work-based source of infection. Fortunately, over 80% of the employees impacted have already recovered. The recent surge of confirmed cases in a number of the regions in which we operate, highlights the continued uncertainty of the current environment as well as the importance of remaining vigilant with respect to safety and agile and meeting customer needs. 
In light of the significant challenges throughout 2020, we also took additional measures in support of our employees and communities. We provided additional compensation and benefits in the early stages of the pandemic to reduce the financial impact on employees in some of the hardest hit regions. We provided supplemental payments to our front-line workers to thank them for their courage and agility in serving our customers' essential needs. And we stepped up our level of community engagement, including an additional $10 million contribution for charitable causes. 
I'm pleased with the continued progress that we are making towards the success of all of our stakeholders, as evidenced by the fact that we are on track to deliver the vast majority of our long-term financial and sustainability objectives. 
Our consistent performance reflects the strength of our markets, our industry leading positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented team. We are focused on the consistent execution of our 5 key strategies: driving outsized growth in high value categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, continuing our relentless focus on productivity, being highly disciplined capital allocators and leading with environmentally and socially responsible practices and solutions. 
In 2020, we made progress on each. High-value categories again outperformed. We protected, even grew margins in our base businesses. We delivered $200 million of cost reduction, both structural and temporary. We completed 2 acquisitions, Smartrac, which significantly accelerates our strategies and capabilities to build out our intelligent label platform with RFID; and ACPO, which enhances our position in our North American Label and Graphics Materials business. 
Lastly, we continue to make solid progress towards our 2025 sustainability goals. We have substantially reduced the environmental impact of our operations while focusing increasingly on the development and launch of more innovative, environmentally friendly products and solutions. 
Now a quick summary of our results by business. LGM's adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points to just above 15% for the year on a modest decline in revenue. In Label and Packaging Materials, underlying label demand has remained strong throughout the downturn, given the increased consumption of consumer packaged goods and e-commerce trends, while the somewhat more cyclical Graphics and Reflective Solutions business declined. 
From the start-up of the pandemic until now, volume trends for LPM have varied more than usual throughout the year. From March through December, overall, our North American label business has grown mid- to high-single digits, roughly double the long-term average for the region, while Europe has grown low to mid-single digits, comparable to the region's long-term average. And while the mature regions have grown at or above their long-term average since March, Asia Pacific volumes were below their long-term trend, up low single digits across the period. This lower-than-usual growth in Asia was due to declines from March to June before rebounding to mid single-digit volume growth in the second half. 
In Retail Branding and Information Solutions, revenue and margins were both down for the year. Following a sharp decline in Q2, demand improved sequentially in the second half, with Q4 coming in at 3% organic growth. We delivered more than a full point of margin expansion in the second half, driven by the better-than-anticipated volume and tight cost controls. 
Enterprise-wide, RFID sales grew more than 40% for the year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the contribution of the Smartrac acquisition and organic growth of 9% for the year. Organic growth of RFID rebounded quickly in the second half, up roughly 20%, driven primarily by apparel. Outside of apparel, we are seeing increasing interest in new applications within food and logistics, among other categories. The momentum in these applications is focused on driving labor efficiency, improving availability of products, and the migration to e-commerce. 
As the leader in ultrahigh frequency RFID, we are positioned extremely well to capture these opportunities, with industry-leading innovation and manufacturing capabilities and the best, most experienced team in the space. We continue to expect long-term growth of 15% to 20% as we build RFID into a broader intelligent label platform, which is now a more than $500 million business. 
And as for Industrial and Healthcare Materials, we expanded margin in this segment for the year despite lower revenue. IHM returned to growth in Q4, and we continue to make progress towards our long-term profitability target here. 
To recap, we delivered another year of strong earnings growth and free cash flow despite challenging market conditions. We entered this crisis from a position of financial, operational and commercial strength and will emerge from it even stronger. We are once again proving our resilience as a company and our ability to consistently deliver for all of our stakeholders. And we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver GDP-plus growth and top quartile return on capital. We look forward to sharing more about our long-term objectives and strategies to all of you at our Investor Day next month. And I'll now turn the call over to Greg."
252978,701917312,2190225,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2021",2021-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide an update today on our performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2021. Slide 11 of our supplemental presentation materials p",1489,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. I'll first provide an update today on our performance against our long-term goals and then walk you through our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2021. Slide 11 of our supplemental presentation materials provides an update on our progress against the 5-year targets that we communicated in 2017. And recall that this represents our third set of long-term goals after meeting or beating our previous 2 sets. 
The consistent execution of our key strategies enables us to continue delivering against our targets, with an overriding focus on delivering GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital over the long term. As you can see, we are largely on track to deliver once again. Over the 4-year period, sales growth on a constant currency basis is up nearly 4% annually, with organic growth of 2% annually. While both are below our initial target, largely due to the late-stage recession in this cycle, we are achieving our objective of growing above GDP over this period.  
Reporting operating margin was 11.6% in 2020 or 12.4% on an adjusted basis, up significantly from roughly 10% in 2016. Additionally, our EBITDA margin was above 15% in 2020. And as always, our focus will continue to be the optimal balance of growth, margins and capital efficiency to drive incremental EVA over the long term. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is up over 15% annually, largely driven by the solid top line growth and strong margin expansion. And our return on total capital came in at 18% for 2020, above our 17% target, reflecting top quartile performance relative to our capital market peers. And our balance sheet remains strong with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below the low end of our target range, giving us ample capacity to continue executing our strategies. 
Our consistent progress towards achieving these long-term goals reflects the diversity of our end markets, the strength of our position in those markets and our resilience and agility as an organization to adjust course when needed. 
At the same time that we communicated our financial goals through 2021, we also laid out a 5-year plan for capital allocation, which you can see on Slide 12. We're tracking well against this plan, starting with strong cash flow generation. And we've deployed a total of $3.4 billion over the last 4 years, allocating it in line with our long-term plan. And clearly, our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue investing organically as well as through strategic acquisitions, while continuing to return cash to shareholders in a disciplined way. 
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter. Overall, financial results were strong, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, up 31% versus prior year, reflecting better-than-expected top and bottom line performance in each of our segments. We grew sales by 12.3% or 3.2% on an organic basis. And currency translation increased reported sales growth by 2.3 points, and the extra week in the fourth quarter increased reported sales by 4.9%. 
Adjusted operating margin increased by 160 basis points to 13.5%, reflecting significant margin expansion in each operating segment. Our tight near-term cost controls in this environment, combined with the flow-through benefit from a volume surge late in the quarter as well as our ongoing structural productivity actions and a benefit from the 53rd week, drove strong margin expansion in Q4. And we realized $18 million of restructuring savings net of transition costs in the quarter, due in part to the long-term actions that we accelerated into 2020, particularly in RBIS. 
And for the year, we generated $548 million of free cash flow, up 7% compared to 2019. Total capital and IT spending came in at $219 million, higher than recent expectations as we accelerated investment in our high value categories, particularly in RFID. And as mentioned previously, our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at year-end of 1.7. And as we've proven our ability to manage through the compounding global crises we face this year, we've been putting that leverage capacity to work. For the year, we deployed $350 million for strategic acquisitions as well as returned $301 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and a growing dividend. 
Now let me turn to segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales increased by 3.6% on an organic basis, driven by the net effect of volume and mix and sales improved sequentially across all regions. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up mid-single digits organically, benefiting from a late quarter pandemic-related surge in demand. And Specialty and Durable Label categories grew high single digits with low to mid single-digit growth in the base business. Graphics and Reflective sales were down mid-single digits, reflecting modest sequential improvement after rebounding significantly in Q3, following the sharp decline in Q2 as a result of the government-mandated lockdowns then. 
Looking at the segment sales trends by region in Q4, in North America, LGM sales were up mid-single digits organically for the quarter, with LPM up high single digits, while Graphics declined modestly. In Europe, LGM sales for the quarter were roughly flat on an organic basis, reflecting strong sequential improvement. LPM was up low single digits, while graphics declined by high single digits. And in Asia, LGM was up low single digits for the quarter on an organic basis, with relatively consistent growth across the countries. 
LGM's adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 15.4% as the benefits of productivity, favorable volume and mix and raw material deflation net of pricing more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 11.6% ex-currency, and up 3.1% on an organic basis, reflecting continued improvement in both the high-value categories and the base business as retailers geared up for the holiday season early on in the quarter. 
High-value categories were up nearly 20% organically, with enterprise-wide RFID sales up 55% ex-currency and up 21% on an organic basis. And the base business was down low to mid-single digits. 
Looking at the total apparel business, the value channel outperformed all the other channels and was up 40% organically for the quarter. And adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 210 basis points to 15.7%. The significant margin expansion was driven by productivity initiatives, including accelerated structural actions and temporary cost controls, along with the better-than-anticipated volumes. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related costs. 
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased by 0.7% on an organic basis as a high single-digit increase for industrial categories. Reflecting continued sequential improvement in transfer automotive applications, in particular, was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in health care categories. Adjusted operating margin increased by 210 basis points to 12.3% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
So turning now to our outlook for 2021. We anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.65 to $8.05. We've outlined some of the key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 18 of our supplemental presentation materials. We estimate that organic sales growth will be approximately 3% to 7%, with the midpoint of that range, reflecting continued recovery in our end markets across the segments. 
The extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be a headwind of a little more than 1 point to reported sales growth and a roughly $0.15 headwind to EPS for the full year. We anticipate Q1 will benefit by roughly $0.10 based on the shift in the calendar, more than offset by roughly $0.25 to headwind then in Q4. 
Based on recent rates, currency translation is a roughly 2-point tailwind to reported sales growth, with an estimated $25 million benefit to operating income. And we estimate incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, of roughly $70 million in 2021. Given we previously accelerated some 2021 actions into the second half of 2020, the vast majority of the savings represent the carryover impact from actions that we initiated last year. And we also expect the majority of the approximately $135 million in temporary cost savings we delivered in 2020 to be a headwind as markets recover. 
Moving to our outlook on the tax rate. Based on current regulations, we expect both the GAAP and adjusted tax rates will be in the mid-20s for the full year. And we expect free cash flow to be more than $600 million in 2021. And finally, we estimate average shares outstanding assuming dilution of 83 million to 84 million. 
In summary, despite the challenging environment, we're pleased with the strategic and financial progress we made against our long-term goals in 2020. And we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver exceptional value through our strategies for long-term profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. 
And now we'll open up the call for your questions."

I know you mentioned that there was a late quarter surge, but G&R also got weaker, which is higher margin, I think, for that segment. So just curious if you can give us a little bit more color on the margin strength?  And then on the strength in LPM from a volume standpoint in both November and December, was that just a function of expanded lockdowns in Europe and the U.S. or just a much better e-commerce season or whatever details you can provide there would be helpful also?"

So on the last part of your question, certainly, as you said, you can see in the backup slide with the monthly numbers that we saw a pickup in the LPM side of the business in November and December. Yes, we think that's a function similar to earlier in the year, as there are more lockdowns, particularly in Europe and in parts of the U.S., we saw more consumption of packaged goods late in the fourth quarter. So that was part of what lifted the volume growth in Q4. And that also then helped drive part of the Q4 margins for LGM. As we've talked about in the past, we've been driving the temporary cost savings with volumes coming in better than expected in the quarter that helped deliver stronger margins overall. At the same time, we did have the extra week in Q4, that actual week turned out to be a pretty strong week, and we did see that also have about a 30 basis point margin impact in LGM as well as the total company level."

We still expect to grow in that 15% to 20% pace, as we've talked about over the years and as we demonstrated, certainly in the back half of 2020. That by itself, given the size of the IL business now would add about 1 point to 1.5 points of overall growth for the company. At the same time, when we look versus 2020, and we see the quarters that were hit the hardest Q2 and then a little bit of Q3, if we fully recovered that, we think that would be somewhere in 3 to 4 points of growth for the year on a full year basis. We've built in about 2 to 3 points of growth on recovering some of that volume decline that we saw in those most hit quarters in 2020. So those are a couple of big drivers of the growth that we see year-over-year. At the same time, we would expect in the businesses that were hit the hardest in 2020 to have the biggest growth rates as we see that recovery come through in those segments."

When you think just like you said, across the company, the range of our guidance assumptions includes a number of different factors, depending on the environment and the macro. We would start -- expect to see, certainly, when you look at the second quarter, when we had the trough in some of the businesses that had a margin impact there. We would expect to see a larger recovery, particularly in Q2. 
When we look more broadly, as you know, when we've talked about in the past, our overall focus over time is balancing our top line growth with strong margins and strong capital efficiency in order to drive long-term growth in EVA. And that's how we'll continue to think about it. So margins continues to be a big factor, of course, in continuing to drive margins, but we're looking at the balance of those 3 things that drive long-term EVA growth over time."

So overall, 2 questions there. As far as the apparel adoption rate. So apparel continue -- I mean the pandemic has really -- what we've seen is a second inflection point, if you will, an acceleration of activity, not just Tier 1, but a lot of Tier 2 retailers and brands in addition to Tier 1. So a significant amount of our pipeline is also apparel growth. We had traditionally said, we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. It's clearly a bit more than that, but we also said, over time, we expect the addressable market to increase a bit over time as well. So that's where we are in addressable market, still quite a bit of upside overall within apparel, and we see obviously huge opportunities outside of apparel. 
And so to your question of 15% to 20%, do we see upside to that? Yes, I mean, we see a huge opportunity for us. It's really around developing market opportunities and then capturing those opportunities, we see significant long-term potential here. The 15% to 20% we've created because there's a certain level of just pace of adoptions that we go through. And given the size of this business being over $500 million now, as Greg said, it's now adding 1.5 points to our overall growth. So that's a pretty significant amount of dollar growth every year if you look at it from that perspective. So we're clearly not limiting ourselves to what the upside can be. I think 15% to 20% is the right target, where clearly aspirations are to develop this into a much larger business than it is today, and we see it having a very long runway ahead of it.

We'll have a better read after January and February, we comped through the Lunar New Year. 
Overall, what you're seeing, though, is the North American market doing better than Europe. If you look at just apparel import trends alone, apparel imports in the U.S. for the full year, they were down close to 20%. If you look at the last 6 months where the data is available, it was down 11 and it's up a couple of percent, if you look at the last few months. So that does show an improving trend here in the U.S. Europe, however, continues to be down quite significantly, down around 20% or so the last few months. So a bit of a decoupling between U.S. and Europe is what we're seeing right now. 
And generally, holiday was a bit better than people had anticipated. And we're really going to need a little bit more time than just right after the holiday to get a good sense of where things play out. And I'd say Europe is the bigger question for us."

There's not -- the average isn't that great, but say, 6 to 9 months is what I would give as an estimate. 
Within other categories, it can vary quite a bit. It obviously is longer than that, as far as the pipeline, when it starts from just the business case and then moves into pilot and testing and so forth. So that takes a bit longer. I would say the biggest area of the pipeline growth that we're seeing, we talked about apparel, having good increases within apparel overall, but outside of that. 
And if you look at food, our pipeline is up quite significantly as well as with logistics up quite significantly. And we're seeing a number of pilots that we expect in the pilot phase, will give us $1 million of revenue or so here in 2021, and assuming they're successful in convert, which we sure confident they will, they would turn into $5 million programs each individual one. So that's where we are in the food. We've been working for a while. They've accelerated a bit in the pandemic, along with logistics.

We see that continuing here in the first quarter and then starting to also rise in Europe at the same time here in Q1. So right now, based on what we've been seeing, we would expect somewhere in the low single digit inflation based on what we've seen so far without predicting what may happen as we go forward."

And then as far as IHM, we're still targeting, our objective here for 2021 was 12.5% operating margins or more for this business. We're not quite there yet. The team has done a great job. And I will say, under Greg's leadership, Greg has been overseeing this group of divisions for the last couple of years. And our objective, if you look at the high end of our range, is to be within that targeted range by next year. So continued margin expansion is the goal."

I wanted to take a step back and talk a bit more about return on capital, Mitch and Greg. So Avery has a long successful track record, you pointed to that at the beginning of your presentation in terms of capital allocation, return on capital, and that's all well and good. We have seen over the last 3 to 4 years, and it's not just the result of COVID, the return on capital for the company begin to tick lower. 
If you've evaluated that and you agree with that point, what do you think is driving that? And then relatedly, it looks like COVID has really changed the growth outlook for a lot of your businesses, whether it's RFID or LPM. You're going to have to spend money. It sounds like you've already begun to do so on capacity. How do you continue the return on capital trajectory that you'd been seeing longer-term as you're now needing to spend behind this growth?

And the last couple of years, there's been some of the pension impacts when you look at those in '17 and '18, and you can see the adjusted numbers in the appendix of our slides. But when you adjust out that, we're roughly 19% the last couple of years, and in that 18% level here in 2020. So we feel like we have been continuing to expand ROTC above the baseline where we started that back in 2016. And that's what this year, of course, includes a couple of acquisitions that we're in the first year of still. So feel good about the progress we're continuing to make on a return perspective and continuing to be in the top quartile among our capital market peers there. 
And when we think about investments going forward, we -- and Mitch talked already about RFID overall as EBITDA margins above our average for the segments and the company. And that generates good returns for us, and we continue to invest in areas where we think we'll have strong returns. So a lot of our CapEx is in areas like RFID and it's also another high-value segments like specialty labels within LGM or industrial within IHM and also looking at some of the emerging regions. So we're investing in areas that we think are high return and where we can continue to generate strong return on capital."

And when we haven't done M&A for a while and then started doing M&A over the last 4 years, it takes a while from a returns perspective for the returns to match the invested capital base that you have in there. And once we have a series of these in the years going forward and so forth, and it all starts comping in and the returns are catching up on acquisitions you've done a few years ago, you'll see that continue to flow through."

I know that's a broad question and hard to answer in a sense or 2, but how would you have us think about it?

It would be disproportionately in high-value categories, particularly in RFID. So that's been a significant part of our growth investments. 
And as far as the base goes, what you've seen in our investments, we just go back over the last 5 years. When we need to invest for growth, we also concurrently invest for productivity. So if you look at the investment we did in Europe a few years ago, we did a significant expansion where we needed capacity to one of our plants. And we subsequently were able to take offline some capacity to drive productivity. So both enabled growth for that market, at the same time is lowering our cost base.

And if I look back, it looks like you closed on Smartrac early March, so it's probably just weeks before the pandemic lockdowns ensued. And it sounds, generally, the consensus is coalesced around this idea that the pandemic has increased your addressable market opportunities in RFID. But I'm curious to peel that back a little bit more. If you look at the apparel and food applications, it looks like what's happened is the behavioral changes have maybe accelerated the adoption in those applications. But I'm curious about, in the case of logistics because you're talking about having traction in logistics, it sounds like maybe the pandemic influenced the business case there. 
So I'm just wondering if that's a good characterization? And because if I think back to early days of item level, apparel adoption, the business case was -- is very clear, right? It was inventory accuracy, preventing stockouts or consequential sales lift and eventually that dovetailed into this transition to omnichannel and e-commerce. But help me understand like what's the business case in this logistics opportunity? It sounds like it's compelling. It sounds like it's -- there's more visibility in and around your traction there. So I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that."

So Chris, the business case is really around increasing productivity, becoming more touchless in your operations. And that's some of the fundamental base case of what you had to look for apparel you have in these other categories. And that's specifically why we targeted these other categories. We looked for end markets that shared some similar characteristics and some challenges as what apparel is going through albeit in a different form. 
So absolutely, pandemic accelerated a lot of the activity within the pipeline. You say adoption has not yet really had a significant mover on adoption levels because it takes some time to work through the pipeline. I commented earlier about some of these programs more moving into pilot. The pandemic during the height of it, in the spring or the early phases of it, I should say, we commented it actually slowed down the amount of activity when restaurants were closed. As an example, there was a fewer opportunities for some pilots. 
Those have all re-ramped up again here in the second half. And I talked about the momentum going into 2021. So the use case is really around just becoming more touchless as far as interactions, driving productivity, wanting increased visibility, reducing waste. RFID is a huge opportunity to reduce waste, so enabling companies to meet their own sustainability objectives. Those are all included within that, and we see tremendous opportunity here. So that used case you should think about is very similar to apparel, albeit in a different form."

It's a minority of our sales to -- through the Smartrac channel and the LGM channel, through -- without managing the information and so forth to some competitors of the apparel solutions division. 
And the vast majority, though, of course, is what our apparels business sales fell through, as we say, we're vertically integrated with managing the information.

We are off to a strong start to the year with revenue up 11%, EPS up 45%, both well above expectations and strong free cash flow. The favorable results were driven by improving and broad-based volume and productivity gains across the portfolio as all 3 of our operating segments delivered strong sales growth and significant margin expansion. 
We experienced strong demand as many economies emerged from the depths of the recession amidst rising confidence. This, combined with both the structural and temporary productivity initiatives we've implemented, drove a strong quarter. 
Now while we are pleased with the results, our strong performance comes at a time of continued uncertainty, given the global health crisis and constraints within supply chains. The current environment further reinforces our determination to remain vigilant in protecting the health and well-being of our team and agile to ensure we continue to meet our customers' needs. 
While the rate of COVID-19 infections declined in a number of countries, including the U.S., and optimism increases as vaccines roll out, much of Continental Europe has been in lockdown, and other countries such as India and Brazil have experienced a significant rise in infection rates. Fortunately, the rate of new cases among the team remains relatively stable. 
In addition to the effects of the pandemic, natural disasters such as the Texas winter storm and other factors, the microchip shortage being an example, are constricting supply chains even further, affecting our end markets and adding to inflationary pressures. Despite these supply chain constraints, we've been able to deliver record volumes as our team has done a great job of leveraging our global network and scale to ensure we continue to meet customers' needs. 
Now a quick update by business. Label and Graphic Materials posted strong top line growth for the quarter as demand for consumer packaged goods and e-commerce trends continue to drive strong volume in our Label and Packaging Materials business, while our Graphic and Reflective Solutions business rebounded faster than expected. LGM's margin was strong in the quarter, ahead of expectations actually, as the flow-through from higher volume, including strength in high-value categories coupled with productivity gains, enabled significant margin expansion. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered strong sales growth in the quarter driven by both high-value product categories, particularly RFID and the core apparel business. The strong top line was driven by retailers and brands gearing up for a rebound in demand and, to a lesser extent, easier comps. 
Enterprise-wide Intelligent Labels sales were up 40% ex currency and up 20% on an organic basis. As expected, the strong growth of our RFID business was primarily driven by apparel. While outside of apparel, we continued to see strong momentum building for new applications. 
As we outlined in detail at our Investor Day last month, we have a tremendous amount of opportunity in this space, in apparel, food, logistics and more. And as you also heard, our focus is not only to be the world's leading RFID supplier. We are creating a broader Intelligent Labels platform to bridge the physical and digital worlds. As part of this, we are investing in digital identification technologies that enhance the ability to manage and store item level information. 
To this end, we recently announced 2 digital initiatives: one, the acquisition of a small software startup, ZippyYum; and the other being the launch of a connected product cloud platform start-up [ .io ]. 
As for the bottom line, RBIS delivered significant margin expansion in the quarter driven by higher volume and productivity initiatives. Given the margin and growth profile of this business, we will continue to ramp up our pace of investments in this segment, particularly in Intelligent Labels with an accelerated pace throughout the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials. The segment delivered strong sales growth in the quarter driven by a significant rebound in demand for industrial products, while we continue to make good progress towards achieving the long-term margin target for this business. We continue to invest in this segment, including the acquisition of JDC Solutions, a small manufacturer of specialty tapes for use in a variety of high-value industrial applications that we closed in March. 
Now given our strong performance in Q1 and our revised expectations for the rest of the year, we have raised our full year outlook and now anticipate top line growth of 9% to 11% ex currency and earnings per share of $8.40 to $8.80. We are pleased with the continued progress we are making towards the success of all of our stakeholders. 
Our consistent performance reflects the strength of our markets, our industry leading positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented team. We remain focused on our 5 key strategies: driving outsized growth in high-value categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, focusing relentlessly on productivity, effectively allocating capital and leading in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. 
We are confident that the consistent execution of these strategies will enable us to achieve our long-term goals, including consistently delivering GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns. And once again, I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts to keep one another safe, while continuing to deliver for our customers during this challenging period, bringing a whole new level of agility and dedication to address the unique challenges at hand. 
Over to you, Greg."

As Mitch said, we delivered a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, above our expectations. This roughly $0.75 increase over prior year was driven by strong growth and productivity gains a",1193,"Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. As Mitch said, we delivered a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, above our expectations. This roughly $0.75 increase over prior year was driven by strong growth and productivity gains as well as an estimated $0.25 benefit from the combined impact from the calendar shift and prebuys. 
Sales grew ex currency 11% and 9% on an organic basis driven by strong broad-based demand as well as a modest benefit from easier comps as the pandemic began to impact the results in Q1 of last year. Given the strong revenue, combined with productivity gains, we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5% and adjusted operating margin of 13.9%, both up roughly 2 points. 
And we realized $19 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter, the majority of which represented carryover from projects we had pulled forward into 2020. And we continue to expect roughly $70 million from net restructuring savings this year. 
As Mitch mentioned, to begin the year, supply chains have remained tight, and input costs have been increasing. As a result, raw material and freight inflation were above our initial expectations, and we have continued to see costs rise as we enter the second quarter. 
We now expect mid- to high single-digit inflation for the year with variations by region and product category. As we typically do, we will address this through a combination of both product reengineering and pricing. 
We've announced price increases in most of our businesses and regions across the world. And given the pricing announcements, some customers accelerated orders into the first quarter, ahead of pricing adjustments. We estimate the prebuy benefit to Q1 was roughly 2 points of revenue growth, and we anticipate this impact will largely come out of Q2. 
We generated $182 million of free cash flow in the quarter, up substantially compared to last year primarily driven by improved working capital and higher operating results. Working capital as a percent of sales improved compared to prior year driven by better receivables and inventory turns. 
And our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at quarter end of 1.6. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders. 
Last week, we announced that the Board approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend rate, following the 7% increase last year. And in the quarter, we paid $52 million in dividends and repurchased roughly 300,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $56 million. And as you know, we increased our pace of inorganic investments last year, and we've continued on that front, deploying $31 million for acquisitions in the first quarter, including JDC Solutions in ZippyYum. 
Now turning to segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 8.4%, excluding currency and 7.6% on an organic basis driven by higher volume. Sales were up roughly 7% organically in Label and Packaging Materials with strong volume growth in both the high-value product categories and the base business, partially offset by carryover price reductions. Graphics and Reflective sales continued to rebound nicely and were up 9% organically. 
Looking at the segment's organic sales growth in the quarter by region, North America and Western Europe sales were up low single digits, while emerging markets overall were up mid-teens. The Asia Pacific region grew roughly 20% led by growth in China and India, although the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in India has heightened uncertainty in the region. And Latin America grew mid-teens with particular strength in Brazil. 
LGM's adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 16.3% as the benefits from strong volume, including the benefit of the calendar shift in prebuy and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs and the net impact of pricing and raw material costs. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 15% ex currency and 9.3% on an organic basis as growth was strong in both the high-value categories and the base business. The core apparel business was up mid- to high single digits as retailers and brands prepare for the stronger demand with particular strength in the value and performance channels. And as Mitch indicated, excluding currency, Intelligent Label sales were up 40% and up 20% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 440 basis points to 12.9% as the benefits from higher volume, lower receivables reserves and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs and growth investments. 
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased 18.8%, excluding currency and 16.3% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in industrial categories, particularly in automotive applications, which more than offset a modest decline in health care. Adjusted operating margin increased 190 basis points to 12.3% as a benefit from higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs. 
Now shifting to our outlook for 2021. While there is a continued high level of uncertainty from the pandemic and tight supply chains, we have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.40 and $8.80, a $0.75 increase to the midpoint of the range. The increase reflects the strong performance in Q1 as well as an increased outlook for organic sales growth for the balance of the year. We now anticipate 9% to 11%, excluding currency sales growth for the full year, above our previous expectation driven by both the higher volume outlook and the impact of higher prices. 
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 12 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be a headwind of a little more than 1 point to reported sales growth and a roughly $0.15 headwind to EPS to 2021. 
We estimate Q1 benefited by roughly $0.15 based on the shift in the calendar and anticipate then a roughly $0.30 headwind in Q4. As noted earlier, we estimate the pre-buy benefit to Q1 was roughly $0.10 of EPS, which will come out of future quarters, mainly Q2. 
And the anticipated tailwind from currency translation is roughly 2 points to sales growth and $25 million in operating income for the full year based on recent rates. And the majority of our 2020 temporary cost reductions have come back in at this point. The exception is our belt-tightening costs, travel expenses, for example, which have remained low to start the year with many of our employees still in lockdown or working from home. And we expect these costs to come back in later through 2021. And finally, given the increased outlook for earnings and working capital productivity, we're now targeting to generate over $675 million of free cash flow this year. 
So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in a challenging environment. And we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital, which together drives sustained growth in EVA. 
And now we'll open up the call for your questions."

And then you have the India and Brazil and other parts of the world virus flare-up. 
So I guess in context of that and what you called out in the past in terms of sort of limited visibility on a go-forward basis for your businesses being that they're short-cycle, I guess, what gives you confidence to be able to raise organic sales guidance this early in the year? And also in terms of share gains, are you embedding any sort of future share gains in that?"

So yes, just maybe to give you a view of how we're thinking about it. When we look at the full year, obviously, in the first quarter, we delivered strong volume growth of about 9%, which added a little more than 2 points to the full year growth rate. We then look at the second and third quarters, which obviously, Q2 last year was the trough in the pandemic for us. And we still had a decline of about 4 points in the third quarter last year as well. 
So just looking at if, we can recover the declines that we saw in the businesses most impacted last year by the pandemic in Q2 and Q3. Those quarters would add another 4 or 4.5 points of growth to the full year growth rate. So between Q1 and just recovering the declines that we had last year in Q2 and Q3 will get us to about 7 points. And then in addition to that, you'd be looking at an impact from the incremental pricing actions that we've talked about, given the inflationary environment this year. 
So that's kind of how we thought about getting to that 8- to 10-point range. The strong growth we had in the first quarter, in addition to recovering the volume declines that we had last year plus the incremental impact of the pricing."

So overall, April, the trends early on broad-based are continuing what we saw in Q1. The impact of the prebuy from the pricing is now we're just starting to see visibility of that to our orders because when we receive the orders, we continue to ship into early April. So we do -- are starting to see as far as order trends that impact a bit from the prebuy. But overall, right now, we're seeing some of the trends continuing into Q2 what we saw in Q1, which further reinforces the guidance that Greg just spoke to. 
So as far as -- if you look at from a market perspective, you asked about share a little bit because we have a little bit of share movement each quarter. We believe share in Q1 was comparable to what we had in North America the last couple of years over the average. And in Europe, we captured some of the share we talked about that we had ceded a year or so ago within the quarter as well. 
Now all that data is not finalized. That's based on our estimates. So the markets overall for mature regions actually, we believe, moderated in Q1, and  that's off of a very tough comp of Q1 of last year, Ghansham. So that's kind of already baked in a little bit of that tough comps, if you will, from last year as far as the growth within the markets, what we're seeing. 
Now conversely, what you're seeing in emerging markets, as we said, those are up significantly within LGM. So China was pretty soft. Q1 of last year was soft relatively throughout much of the year. And we saw a big, strong performance here in Q1 and would expect, as that economy continues to rebound, we continue to see a good, strong momentum on volumes and so forth within that business."

Thanks, Anthony. So I think to the last part of your question, of course, at the beginning of the year, particularly in North America or really at the end of last year, in North America, we started to see their spike in chemicals and films with propylene going up. And we did implement a surcharge there. And I think we've also implemented a surcharge in a couple of other regions as well when we've seen some chemical increases through the first quarter. 
At the same time, though, as we moved through Q1, we started to see inflationary pressures continue to increase as I talked about a bit earlier. And we expect more of a sequential increase here in the second quarter, probably in the mid-single-digit range from Q1 to Q2, in particular. So from a perspective of managing that or covering that, we always take a 2-pronged approach as you've heard us talk about before, looking at material cost reengineering to take cost out as well as reducing pricing or increasing prices to cover the rest of that. 
So I think overall, we're looking at over a period of time, continuing to be able to cover the inflationary pressures between those 2 levers. Typically, we do have a quarter or so lag as we've talked about before as well, and we'd expect to see a similar level here this year. We, actually in the Q1 year-over-year, still had some price down for some of the deflation we had last year."

So we did raise organic, maybe not -- or the volume growth, I guess, maybe not quite as much as you indicated. But we certainly raised it just based on the strong growth that we saw coming out of the first quarter across the portfolio really. And then as Mitch already talked about, in April, we're really seeing the rebound and especially in the businesses that were most hardest hit last year. 
So looking at the year-over-year comps in April isn't as meaningful just given that was really the trough month for a lot of the declines last year in RBIS and Graphics and IHM. But overall, net of the price -- the preprice increase, prebuy, continue to see strong volumes as we entered April. So that's what gives us the confidence increase the range for the year."

So we think the 15% to 20% is the right range overall, George, as we've reiterated. And as far as the gating factor, if you look at within apparel, it's not our ability to roll this out or anything.

And as far as the gating factor, if you look at within apparel, it's not our ability to roll this out or anything. It's just there's a normal adoption curve as you go through these things. And we're always -- when you actually go to first adoption for a particular retailer or brand, there's a big surge for that individual retail brand, creating tougher comps for the next level of rollout, so forth and so on. So we think that's the right target overall for the business. So that's on apparel. 
If you look outside of apparel, I mean, it's very nascent, but we see a huge amount of opportunity there and a lot of pilots going on. And it's where apparel was 5, 6 years ago, we expect the lead time between much greater adoption and being at the pilot phase to be shorter than what it was in apparel. But that's essentially where it is. So very different whether you look at apparel, which is the primary driver of growth if you look at growth dollars right now and for the coming years and the newer categories we talked through. 
The only other thing I'll say is the pipeline has been up quite significantly within apparel even. So that was an accelerant. What happened with COVID was an accelerant within the apparel category, specifically, over the last -- from where we were 12 months ago. And we expect that we'll continue to see momentum and rollouts from those customers that we're working with now."

And then if you could talk about the other costs. I think the majority of the other temporary cost savings have come back into the P&L, but there's still some amount related to travel that hasn't come in, recognizing that's not going to come in until the business actually can sustain that, right, because you're required to travel and so on for commercial purposes.

Just on your first question, this is really about in the first quarter of last year, if you recall, at the start of the pandemic when really retail apparel started to get impacted heavily in the month of March. We saw some delays in payments and some things happening in the market there where we took more receivables reserves. We since worked through that through most of last year. So it wasn't really an item in Q1 of this year. It's really just more about the comparison to prior year, where we had a headwind last year in the first quarter that didn't repeat this year. 
And then on the temp cost piece, as we talked about earlier, last year, we had about $135 million of temporary cost savings, and that was split into a few buckets. One was really volume-related items. And that was more about half -- or sorry, about half of the overall savings. That's items like temporary cost reduction, overtime reduction, some furloughs, et cetera. And the majority of that, by the way, is really in Q2 of last year when we had the volume trough. And then another portion of that was incentive compensation, and the remainder was belt-tightening costs such as travel and other type of expenses like that. 
So the volume piece has clearly come back as we saw volume return late last year and into the first quarter as well as the incentive compensation pieces coming back here in the first quarter of 2021 as well. So it's really that last piece around more discretionary type of spend, belt-tightening type of spend that we would expect. Some of that have come back already in Q1 and the rest to come back as we move through the year and people start traveling more and things like that. 
So we still would expect the majority of those savings to be a headwind this year versus what it was a year ago. And that would reduce a little bit, particularly in Q2, where we had the bulk of that savings last year. That would reduced a little bit of the flow-through from the incremental growth year-over-year as well."

It's been a heavy amount of volume growth that we talked about in Q1 as well as a significant amount of productivity. 
So a lot of the restructuring costs that we talked about came in LGM, particularly in the Graphics side of the business, but also with some footprint actions in North America over the last year or so as well. So it's been a combination of driving productivity and continuing to drive that over time, the ongoing every year productivity as well as periodic restructuring type of productivity that's helped drive those margins, in addition to the strong volumes that we've seen recently."

In Q1 specifically, if you recall, we had accelerated a number of restructuring actions. We still have the temporary cost savings as well as the fact that we had the variable flow-through of the prebuy happening. And the margin you see, we remain confident in our ability to hold the margin level based on what we see now, hold the margin level that we had last year. 
Now that is the total across the regions. A lot of the cost pressures, both raw material as well as the other factors that Greg called out, are disproportionately in Q1 were in North America. So North America is actually having a profitability challenge right now as far as where they are. 
So the average doesn't necessarily tell the story of what's happening within each region. And I know a lot of us here sitting in the States can see things more of what's happening here.

So Smartrac has been a very fortuitous acquisition for us thus far, given just the continued ramp across all end markets. Specifically, your question around industrial and automotive applications, those actually, as you would expect, given the end markets declined a bit since the acquisition due to COVID. But as far as the pipeline and the customers are working with a number of programs where we've already got ramping up adoption right now, we do continue to see good opportunity there. 
The key element here was the end market access, you mentioned, Rosemarie, as well as the just broader capabilities, they are very complementary to what we had as a legacy RFID business as well. So overall, the acquisition is meeting and exceeding our expectations on top and bottom line."

So when you look at a sequential Q1 to Q2, it's pretty broad-based overall.

We are off to a strong start to the year with revenue up 11%, EPS up 45%, both well above expectations, and strong free cash flow.

We are off to a strong start to the year with revenue up 11%, EPS up 45%, both well above expectations, and strong free cash flow. The favorable results were driven by improving and broad-based volume and productivity gains across the portfolio as all 3 of our operating segments delivered strong sales growth and significant margin expansion. We experienced strong demand as many economies emerged from the depths of the recession amidst rising confidence. This, combined with both the structural and temporary productivity initiatives we've implemented, drove a strong quarter.
Now while we are pleased with the results, our strong performance comes at a time of continued uncertainty, given the global health crisis and constraints within supply chains. The current environment further reinforces our determination to remain vigilant in protecting the health and well-being of our team and agile to ensure we continue to meet our customers' needs.
While the rate of COVID-19 infections declined in a number of countries, including the U.S., and optimism increases as vaccines roll out, much of Continental Europe has been in lockdown, and other countries such as India and Brazil have experienced a significant rise in infection rates. Fortunately, the rate of new cases among the team remains relatively stable.
In addition to the effects of the pandemic, natural disasters such as the Texas winter storm and other factors, the microchip shortage being an example, are constricting supply chains even further, affecting our end markets and adding to inflationary pressures. Despite these supply chain constraints, we've been able to deliver record volumes as our team has done a great job of leveraging our global network and scale to ensure we continue to meet customers' needs.
Now a quick update by business. Label and Graphic Materials posted strong top line growth for the quarter as demand for consumer packaged goods and e-commerce trends continue to drive strong volume in our Label and Packaging Materials business, while our Graphics and Reflective Solutions business rebounded faster than expected. LGM's margin was strong in the quarter, ahead of expectations actually, as the flow-through from higher volume, including strength in high-value categories, coupled with productivity gains, enabled significant margin expansion.
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered strong sales growth in the quarter driven by both high-value product categories, particularly RFID and the core apparel business. The strong top line was driven by retailers and brands gearing up for a rebound in demand and, to a lesser extent, easier comps.
Enterprise-wide Intelligent Labels sales were up 40% ex currency and up 20% on an organic basis. As expected, the strong growth of our RFID business was primarily driven by apparel, while outside of apparel, we continued to see strong momentum building for new applications.
As we outlined in detail at our Investor Day last month, we have a tremendous amount of opportunity in this space, in apparel, food, logistics and more. And as you also heard, our focus is not only to be the world's leading RFID supplier. We are creating a broader Intelligent Labels platform to bridge the physical and digital worlds. As part of this, we are investing in digital identification technologies that enhance the ability to manage and store item level information. To this end, we recently announced 2 digital initiatives: one, the acquisition of a small software start-up, ZippyYum; and the other being the launch of a connected product cloud platform start-up, atma.io.
As for the bottom line, RBIS delivered significant margin expansion in the quarter driven by higher volume and productivity initiatives. Given the margin and growth profile of this business, we will continue to ramp up our pace of investments in this segment, particularly in Intelligent Labels, with an accelerated pace throughout the remainder of the year.
Turning to Industrial and Healthcare Materials. The segment delivered strong sales growth in the quarter driven by a significant rebound in demand for industrial products, while we continue to make good progress towards achieving the long-term margin target for this business. We continue to invest in this segment, including the acquisition of JDC Solutions, a small manufacturer of specialty tapes for use in a variety of high-value industrial applications, that we closed in March.
Now given our strong performance in Q1 and our revised expectations for the rest of the year, we have raised our full year outlook and now anticipate top line growth of 9% to 11% ex currency and earnings per share of $8.40 to $8.80. We are pleased with the continued progress we are making towards the success of all of our stakeholders.
Our consistent performance reflects the strength of our markets, our industry-leading positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented team. We remain focused on our 5 key strategies: driving outsized growth in high-value categories, growing profitably in our base businesses, focusing relentlessly on productivity, effectively allocating capital and leading in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We are confident that the consistent execution of these strategies will enable us to achieve our long-term goals, including consistently delivering GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns.
And once again, I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts to keep one another safe while continuing to deliver for our customers during this challenging period, bringing a whole new level of agility and dedication to address the unique challenges at hand. Over to you, Greg."

As Mitch said, we delivered a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, above our expectations.

As Mitch said, we delivered a strong start to the year with adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, above our expectations. This roughly $0.75 increase over prior year was driven by strong growth and productivity gains as well as an estimated $0.25 benefit from the combined impact from the calendar shift and prebuys.
Sales grew ex currency 11% and 9% on an organic basis driven by strong broad-based demand as well as a modest benefit from easier comps as the pandemic began to impact the results in Q1 of last year. Given the strong revenue, combined with productivity gains, we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5% and adjusted operating margin of 13.9%, both up roughly 2 points. And we realized $19 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter, the majority of which represented carryover from projects we had pulled forward into 2020. And we continue to expect roughly $70 million from net restructuring savings this year.
As Mitch mentioned, to begin the year, supply chains have remained tight, and input costs have been increasing. As a result, raw material and freight inflation were above our initial expectations, and we have continued to see costs rise as we enter the second quarter. We now expect mid- to high single-digit inflation for the year, with variations by region and product category. As we typically do, we will address this through a combination of both product reengineering and pricing.
We've announced price increases in most of our businesses and regions across the world. And given the pricing announcements, some customers accelerated orders into the first quarter, ahead of pricing adjustments. We estimate the prebuy benefit to Q1 was roughly 2 points of revenue growth, and we anticipate this impact will largely come out of Q2.
We generated $182 million of free cash flow in the quarter, up substantially compared to last year, primarily driven by improved working capital and higher operating results. Working capital as a percent of sales improved compared to prior year driven by better receivables and inventory turns.
And our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at quarter end of 1.6. Our current leverage position gives us ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including investing in organic growth and acquisitions while continuing to return cash to shareholders.
Last week, we announced that the Board approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend rate, following the 7% increase last year. And in the quarter, we paid $52 million in dividends and repurchased roughly 300,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $56 million. And as you know, we increased our pace of inorganic investments last year, and we've continued on that front, deploying $31 million for acquisitions in the first quarter, including JDC Solutions and ZippyYum.
Now turning to segment results for the quarter. Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 8.4% excluding currency and 7.6% on an organic basis driven by higher volume. Sales were up roughly 7% organically in Label and Packaging Materials, with strong volume growth in both the high-value product categories and the base business, partially offset by carryover price reductions. Graphics and Reflective sales continued to rebound nicely and were up 9% organically.
Looking at the segment's organic sales growth in the quarter by region, North America and Western Europe sales were up low single digits, while emerging markets overall were up mid-teens. The Asia Pacific region grew roughly 20%, led by growth in China and India, although the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in India has heightened uncertainty in the region. And Latin America grew mid-teens, with particular strength in Brazil.
LGM's adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 16.3% as the benefits from strong volume, including the benefit of the calendar shift in prebuy, and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs and the net impact of pricing and raw material costs.
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 15% ex currency and 9.3% on an organic basis as growth was strong in both the high-value categories and the base business. The core apparel business was up mid- to high single digits as retailers and brands prepare for the stronger demand, with particular strength in the value and performance channels. And as Mitch indicated, excluding currency, Intelligent Labels sales were up 40% and up 20% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 440 basis points to 12.9% as the benefits from higher volume, lower receivables reserves and productivity more than offset higher employee-related costs and growth investments.
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased 18.8% excluding currency and 16.3% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in industrial categories, particularly in automotive applications, which more than offset a modest decline in health care. Adjusted operating margin increased 190 basis points to 12.3% as the benefit from higher volume more than offset higher employee-related costs.
Now shifting to our outlook for 2021. While there is a continued high level of uncertainty from the pandemic and tight supply chains, we have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.40 and $8.80, a $0.75 increase to the midpoint of the range. The increase reflects the strong performance in Q1 as well as an increased outlook for organic sales growth for the balance of the year. We now anticipate 9% to 11% excluding currency sales growth for the full year, above our previous expectation, driven by both the higher volume outlook and the impact of higher prices.
We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 12 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be a headwind of a little more than 1 point to reported sales growth and a roughly $0.15 headwind to EPS to 2021. We estimate Q1 benefited by roughly $0.15 based on the shift in the calendar and anticipate then a roughly $0.30 headwind in Q4. As noted earlier, we estimate the prebuy benefit to Q1 was roughly $0.10 of EPS, which will come out of future quarters, mainly Q2. And the anticipated tailwind from currency translation is roughly 2 points to sales growth and $25 million in operating income for the full year based on recent rates.
And the majority of our 2020 temporary cost reductions have come back in at this point. The exception is our belt-tightening costs, travel expenses, for example, which have remained low to start the year, with many of our employees still in lockdown or working from home. And we expect these costs to come back in later through 2021. And finally, given the increased outlook for earnings and working capital productivity, we're now targeting to generate over $675 million of free cash flow this year.
So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in a challenging environment. And we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital, which together drives sustained growth in EVA. And now we'll open up the call for your questions."

And then you have the India and Brazil and other parts of the world virus flare-ups.
So I guess in context of that and what you called out in the past in terms of sort of limited visibility on a go-forward basis for your businesses being that they're short-cycle, I guess, what gives you confidence to be able to raise organic sales guidance this early in the year?

So yes, just maybe to give you a view of how we're thinking about it, when we look at the full year, obviously, in the first quarter, we delivered strong volume growth of about 9%, which added a little more than 2 points to the full year growth rate. We then look at the second and third quarters, which obviously, Q2 last year was the trough in the pandemic for us. And we still had a decline of about 4 points in the third quarter last year as well.
So just looking at it, if we can recover the declines that we saw in the businesses most impacted last year by the pandemic in Q2 and Q3, those quarters would add another 4 or 4.5 points of growth to the full year growth rate. So between Q1 and just recovering the declines that we had last year in Q2 and Q3 will get us to about 7 points. And then in addition to that, you'd be looking at an impact from the incremental pricing actions that we've talked about, given the inflationary environment this year.
So that's kind of how we've thought about getting to that 8- to 10-point range. The strong growth we had in the first quarter, in addition to recovering the volume declines that we had last year, plus the incremental impact of the pricing."

Or you still see elevated demand?"

So overall, April, the trends early on broad-based are continuing what we saw in Q1. The impact of the prebuy from the pricing is now we're just starting to see visibility of that to our orders because when we receive the orders, we continue to ship",318,"Yes. So overall, April, the trends early on broad-based are continuing what we saw in Q1. The impact of the prebuy from the pricing is now we're just starting to see visibility of that to our orders because when we receive the orders, we continue to ship into early April. So we do -- are starting to see as far as order trends that impact a bit from the prebuy. But overall, right now, we're seeing some of the trends continuing into Q2 what we saw in Q1, which further reinforces the guidance that Greg just spoke to.
So as far as -- if you look at it from a market perspective, you asked about share a little bit because we have a little bit of share movement each quarter. We believe share in Q1 was comparable to what we had in North America the last couple of years over the average. And in Europe, we captured some of the share we talked about that we had ceded a year or so ago within the quarter as well.
Now all that data is not finalized. That's based on our estimates. So the markets overall for mature regions actually, we believe, moderated in Q1, and  that's off of a very tough comp of Q1 of last year, Ghansham. So that's kind of already baked in, a little bit of that tough comps, if you will, from last year as far as the growth within the markets, to what we're seeing.
Now conversely, what you're seeing in the emerging markets, as we said, those are up significantly within LGM. So China was pretty soft. Q1 of last year was soft relatively throughout much of the year. And we saw a big, strong performance here in Q1 and would expect, as that economy continues to rebound, we continue to see good, strong momentum on volumes and so forth within that business."

Thanks, Anthony. So I think to the last part of your question, of course, at the beginning of the year, particularly in North America -- or really at the end of last year, in North America, we started to see the spike in chemicals and films with propylene going up. And we did implement a surcharge there. And I think we've also implemented a surcharge in a couple of other regions as well when we've seen some chemical increases through the first quarter.
At the same time, though, as we moved through Q1, we started to see inflationary pressures continue to increase as I talked about a bit earlier. And we expect more of a sequential increase here in the second quarter, probably in the mid-single-digit range from Q1 to Q2, in particular. So from a perspective of managing that or covering that, we always take a 2-pronged approach as you've heard us talk about before, looking at material cost reengineering to take cost out as well as reducing pricing or increasing pricing to cover the rest of that.
So I think overall, we're looking at over a period of time, continuing to be able to cover the inflationary pressures between those 2 levers. Typically, we do have a quarter or so lag as we've talked about before as well, and we'd expect to see a similar level here this year. We, actually in the Q1 year-over-year, still had some price down [ from some ] of the deflation we had last year."

And kind of the first part of that, in particular, with Intelligent Labels, the 15% to 20% long-term target and the 20% growth that you saw in the first quarter is certainly very, very good. If there was a gating factor in terms of demand or the ability to grow even beyond that, where would it lie? Would it be your customers' willingness to trial and have the capital to do these trials? Or is it on the Avery side in terms of your ability to manage that type of growth? Or is it in the supply chain? How should we think about that if you -- if there is, in fact, growth beyond the current range?"

So we think the 15% to 20% is the right range overall, George, as we've reiterated. And as far as the gating factor, if you look at within apparel, it's not our ability to roll this out or anything. It's just there's a normal adoption curve as you go",273,"Yes. So we think the 15% to 20% is the right range overall, George, as we've reiterated. And as far as the gating factor, if you look at within apparel, it's not our ability to roll this out or anything. It's just there's a normal adoption curve as you go through these things. And we're always -- when you actually go to first adoption for a particular retailer or brand, there's a big surge for that individual retail brand, creating tougher comps for the next level of rollout, so forth and so on. So we think that's the right target overall for the business. So that's on apparel.
If you look outside of apparel, I mean, it's very nascent, but we see a huge amount of opportunity there and a lot of pilots going on. And it's where apparel was 5, 6 years ago. We expect the lead time between much greater adoption and being at the pilot phase to be shorter than what it was in apparel. But that's essentially where it is. So very different whether you look at apparel, which is the primary driver of growth, if you look at growth dollars right now and for the coming years, and the newer categories we talked through.
The only other thing I'll say is the pipeline has been up quite significantly within apparel even. So that was an accelerant. What happened with COVID was an accelerant within the apparel category, specifically, over the last -- from where we were 12 months ago. And we expect that we'll continue to see momentum and rollouts from those customers that we're working with now."

Or if I didn't catch that correctly, just state what you were getting at there.
And then if you could talk about the other costs. I think you said the majority of the other temporary cost savings have come back into the P&L, but there's still some amount related to travel that hasn't come in, recognizing that's not going to come in until the businesses actually can sustain that, right, because you're required to travel and so on for commercial purposes. How would those numbers -- how would you parse that? What's come in? What has yet to come in from the temporary cost saves?"

Just on your first question, this is really about in the first quarter of last year, if you recall, at the start of the pandemic when really retail apparel started to get impacted heavily in the month of March, we saw some delay",369,"All right. Thanks, George. Just on your first question, this is really about in the first quarter of last year, if you recall, at the start of the pandemic when really retail apparel started to get impacted heavily in the month of March, we saw some delays in payments and some things happening in the market there where we took more receivables reserves. We since worked through that through most of last year. So it wasn't really an item in Q1 of this year. It's really just more about the comparison to prior year, where we had a headwind last year in the first quarter that didn't repeat this year.
And then on the temp cost piece, as we talked about earlier, last year, we had about $135 million of temporary cost savings, and that was split into a few buckets. One was really volume-related items. And that was more about half -- or sorry, about half of the overall savings. That's items like temporary cost reduction, overtime reduction, some furloughs, et cetera. And the majority of that, by the way, was really in Q2 of last year when we had the volume trough. And then another portion of that was incentive compensation, and the remainder was belt-tightening costs such as travel and other type of expenses like that.
So the volume piece has clearly come back as we saw volume return late last year and into the first quarter as well as the incentive compensation pieces coming back here in the first quarter of 2021 as well. So it's really that last piece around more discretionary type of spend, belt-tightening type of spend that we would expect some of that to have come back already in Q1 and the rest to come back as we move through the year and people start traveling more and things like that.
So we still would expect the majority of those savings to be a headwind this year versus what it was a year ago. And that would reduce a little bit -- particularly in Q2, where we had the bulk of that savings last year, that would reduce a little bit of the flow-through from the incremental growth year-over-year as well."

In LGM, had already grown a couple of points last year as you said, just looking more to hold that this year. And we've done that, obviously, in the first quarter, but it's not just really about price. It's a bit in the heavy amount of volume growth that we talked about in Q1 as well as a significant amount of productivity.
So a lot of the restructuring costs that we talked about came in LGM, particularly in the graphics side of the business, but also with some footprint actions in North America over the last year or so as well. So it's been a combination of driving productivity and continuing to drive that over time, the ongoing every year productivity as well as periodic restructuring type of productivity that's helped drive those margins, in addition to the strong volumes that we've seen recently."

And we had expanded LGM margins quite a bit going -- last year. We said our objective, as Greg already said, was to hold it this year. So that's the overall context.
In Q1 specifically, if you recall, we had accelerated a number of restructuring actions. We still have the temporary cost savings as well as the fact that we had the variable flow-through of the prebuy happening. And the margin you see, we remain confident in our ability to hold the margin level based on what we see now, hold the margin level that we had last year.
Now that is the total across the regions. A lot of the cost pressures, both raw material as well as the other factors that Greg called out, are disproportionately in Q1 were in North America. So North America is actually having a profitability challenge right now as far as where they are.
So the average doesn't necessarily tell the story of what's happening within each region. And I know a lot of us here sitting in the States can see things more of what's happening here. So there's definitely a little bit more of a challenge there that we're working through in both from driving productivity, working with our supply chain partners as well as raising prices right now."

Where we actually saw a decline in this quarter was in diaper tapes. So a year ago, we actually saw an increase there, partially due to some of the surge in stocking up by consumers at the beginning of the pandemic in the U.S. and Europe, in particular.

We delivered another strong quarter ahead of our expectations, raised our outlook for the second half and announced an agreement to acquire Vestcom, a leader in shelf-edge pricing and branded labeling solutions in the",902,"Thanks, John, and good day, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter ahead of our expectations, raised our outlook for the second half and announced an agreement to acquire Vestcom, a leader in shelf-edge pricing and branded labeling solutions in the U.S. 
Vestcom has roughly $400 million in revenue with a consistent history of strong growth and above company average margins. Vestcom will further expand our position in high-value categories, while adding channel access and data management capabilities that have the potential to further advance our label strategy. Deon will tell you more about the acquisition, both the strength of the company and how it will accelerate our strategies in a moment. 
Turning to results. In the second quarter, earnings rebounded significantly as sales grew 29% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a strong rebound in RBIS and IHM and continued strength in LGM. The quarter was even more impressive relative to 2019, with revenue up 14%, EBITDA margins up 80 basis points and EPS up 30%. 
Now while we are pleased with the results, our strong performance comes at a time of continued uncertainty, given the global health crisis and constraints within supply chains. While the rate of new cases among our team remained stable, many parts of the world are experiencing an increase in COVID-19 cases. Certain countries, particularly in South Asia, have experienced a significant rise in infection rates leading to the recent disruptions at a few RBS manufacturing locations. While this is impacting July, we don't anticipate these disruptions will impact demand in the back half of the year. 
In addition to the effects of the pandemic, supply chains remain constricted affecting end markets and adding to inflationary pressures. This constraint on the availability of raw materials, freight and in the U.S., labor, continues to impact the industries in which we operate. Despite these constraints, we've been able to deliver record volumes as our team continues to leverage our global network and scale to minimize disruptions to our customers. The current environment further reinforces our determination to remain vigilant in protecting the health and well-being of our team and agile to ensure we continue to meet customer needs. 
Now a quick update by business. Label and Graphic Materials posted strong top line growth for the quarter and demand for consumer packaged goods and e-commerce labels continued to drive strong volume in our Label and Packaging Materials business, while our Graphics and Reflective Solutions business rebounded significantly off prior year lows. 
As for profitability, LGM margins remained strong despite increasing inflationary headwinds, including costs in the quarter from the supply chain constraints. Given the increasing inflationary pressures, we are redoubling our efforts on material reengineering and again raising prices. We are targeting to close the inflation gap relative to mid last year by the fourth quarter. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered robust growth in the quarter and expanded margins significantly compared to prior year lows. Compared to 2019, margins expanded further as the segment grew 25% on a constant currency basis and 14% organically, driven by strength in both high-value product categories, particularly intelligent labels, as well as the core apparel label business as retailers and brands continue to gear up for a strong rebound in end demand. 
Enterprise-wide, intelligent label sales were up 40% compared to 2019. As expected, the strong growth in our RFID business was primarily driven by apparel. While outside of apparel, we continue to see strong momentum building for new applications in all key geographies. 
In the Food segment, for example, a North American restaurant chain recently began rolling out RFID across their network after a successful pilot over the past year. And in logistics, we saw positive momentum, including the adoption of an intelligent label solution at a large global player in the transport of hazardous materials such as batteries, which requires special shipping protocols. These are just 2 examples of programs of what will be many in the years to come. 
In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales rebounded off prior year lows, showing positive growth compared to 2019 as the segment is on pace for its fourth consecutive year of margin expansion. Given our strong performance in the second quarter and our increased expectations for the rest of the year, we have raised our full year outlook for the company, both on the top and bottom lines. 
Overall, I am pleased with the continued progress we are making towards the success of all of our stakeholders. Our consistent performance reflects the strength of our markets, our industry-leading positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented team. We remain focused on the consistent execution of our 5 key strategies to drive outsized growth in high-value categories, grow profitably in our base businesses, focused relentlessly on productivity, effectively allocate capital and lead in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. 
We are confident that a consistent execution of these strategies, both organically and through M&A such as the Vestcom acquisition, will enable us to achieve our long-term goals, including consistently delivering GDP+ growth and top quartile returns. And once again, I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts to keep one another safe while continuing to deliver for our customers during this challenging period. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Deon to provide more color on the high-performing and high potential acquisition we announced today. Deon?"

Vestcom is a market-leading provider of pricing and branded labeling solutions for the retail shelf edge powered by advanced data management capabilities. It's a high-growth high-margin business generating rough $400 mi",677,"Thanks, Mitch. Turning to Slide 14. Vestcom is a market-leading provider of pricing and branded labeling solutions for the retail shelf edge powered by advanced data management capabilities. It's a high-growth high-margin business generating rough $400 million in annual revenue. 
Vestcom is a highly synergistic adjacency to RBIS, building on our pricing and data management capabilities in adjacent markets and increasing our presence in high-value categories. Vestcom, led by an excellent management team, has been consistently growing at a high single-digit rate organically over the long term with strong track records across cycles and highly accretive EBITDA margins. 
As you may recall back in March at the Investor Day, we outlined RBIS' key strategies, which include delivering outsized growth in high-value categories, unlocking growth in value in food and logistics, growing profitably in the base business and strengthening our digital capabilities and solutions. Vestcom is an accelerator for all of these strategies. In particular, Vestcom provides an opportunity to help accelerate our Intelligent Labels ambitions in food through their additional access to end users in retail, grocery, drug and dollar in particular, and to consumer packaged goods companies who are key decision makers in the food ecosystem as well as their sophisticated and complementary data management capabilities. 
Turning to how Vestcom delivers for its customers. As you can see on Slide 15, Vestcom solutions create real value for retailers and brands, and they do so by combining data management with outstanding customer service delivery. 
Vestcom solutions start were taking multiple data files, including price, promotion, planogram and brand content files and merging these to create uniquely integrated shelf-edge labels that have impact at the point where the majority of consumers make their purchase decisions. Their solutions, which provide both productivity and consumer engagement benefits include stats which delivers integrated price and promotion labels to each store in time for store associates to label the shelf with the latest pricing and promotion updates in sequence that is sorted and ready to walk and tag based on the exact planogram layout for that particular store. 
As Slide 16 indicates, the reduction in store labor time to execute these weekly price and promotion changes so efficiently is significant. And in addition, the improved level of pricing and planogram compliance drives greater consumer impact and commensurate higher sales lift for the retailer. 
Vestcom then builds on this effective productivity and pricing solution by uniquely leveraging the same label real estate to add branded content from CPGs or the retailer to support their time-specific marketing campaigns. These consumer engagement solutions include shelf adds, which allows for highly effective in-store shelf-edge advertising with the unique advantage of combining all 3 elements in front of the consumer, the price, the promotion and the brand message of content. This solution provides real value in both sales lift and return on advertising spend for both CPGs and retailers. 
The strong return on investments delivered by both their productivity and consumer engagement solutions positioned Vestcom as a strategic partner to their customers, reflected in the deep relationships they have across the grocery, drug and dollar segments they serve. It is these relationships and solutions in combination with our own that will help complement our strategy to accelerate IL adoption beyond apparel. This is particularly true in food, where we are already investing in our IL and digital capabilities and where the need for visibility and problems through the supply chain, inventory and date freshness accuracy on shelf, pricing effectiveness and managing an increasingly omnichannel environment are key success factors for retailers. 
Additionally, the combination of our businesses provides the opportunity to create a unique end-to-end inventory management and pricing solution for retail in the next evolution of our data solutions and digital journey, building on the acquisition of and the launch of our Atma.IO platform. 
Lastly, we are pleased to add this high-performing business to our portfolio, and I am personally looking forward to both welcoming the Vestcom team and the future prospects of the combined businesses. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Greg."
252978,1674086341,2353021,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Deon, and hello, everybody. I'd like to first add a few points about Vestcom, and I'll be referring to the transaction summary on Slide 17 of our supplemental materials. As Mitch and Deon already mentioned, Vestcom's annual revenue is roughly $400",1556,"Thanks, Deon, and hello, everybody. I'd like to first add a few points about Vestcom, and I'll be referring to the transaction summary on Slide 17 of our supplemental materials. As Mitch and Deon already mentioned, Vestcom's annual revenue is roughly $400 million, with strong historical growth and EBITDA margins above our company average, including synergies. The purchase price of $1.45 billion represents an EBITDA multiple below our overall company multiple, and we expect this deal to be accretive to EPS by 2022. 
We're currently planning to fund the acquisition through a combination of cash and debt. If the deal closes in Q3, as anticipated, we expect our leverage ratio to be near the low end of our target range at the end of this year, giving us ample capacity to continue executing our capital allocation strategy. 
Now jumping back to our Q2 results. As Mitch said earlier, we delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.25, which was above our expectations by about $0.10 and roughly $1 per share above prior year, driven by significant revenue growth. 
Sales were up 29% ex-currency and 28% on an organic basis compared to prior year, driven by strong broad-based demand and the benefit from easier comparisons, given that the pandemic had the biggest impact on our results in Q2 of last year. Compared to 2019, our growth has also been strong with organic sales up 11% versus Q2 2019. 
Our strong growth, combined with productivity gains, more than offset the headwind of last year's temporary cost reduction actions as well as an increasing inflation and new organic investments to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 12.8%, up 210 basis points from last year. We realized $17 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter, the majority of which represented carryover from projects we have pull forward into 2020. 
We also recorded 2 items, which largely offset each other in our GAAP results in the quarter. The first is a gain related to the recovery of Brazilian indirect taxes paid in previous years, and the second is a liability related to the previously disclosed ruling in the ADASA legal matter, which the company disputes and remains confident in the prospects of a more favorable outcome upon appeal. 
Now as Mitch mentioned, supply chains remained tight and input costs have been increasing. Both raw material and freight inflation were above our initial expectations, and we have continued to see costs rise as we entered the third quarter with expected sequential inflation in Q3 at a mid- to high single-digit rate with variations by region and product category. We are addressing the cost increases through a combination of product reengineering and pricing and have announced additional price increases in most of our businesses and regions across the world. 
Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $388 million of free cash flow with $206 million in the second quarter, up significantly compared to previous years. In the first half of the year, we paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased over 500,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $95 million, for a total of $203 million returned in cash to shareholders so far this year. 
And as I said earlier, our balance sheet is strong with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.3 at quarter end. This gives us ample capacity even after the Vestcom acquisition to continue executing our capital allocation strategy. 
Now turning to the segment results. Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 17% ex-currency and 16% on an organic basis, driven by higher volume and pricing. Compared to 2019, sales were up 11% on an organic basis. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up roughly 12% organically, with strong volume growth in both the high-value product categories and the base business. Graphics and Reflective sales continued to rebound nicely compared to the trough we saw in Q2 of last year and were up 49% organically. Now similar to last quarter, we do believe that Q2 benefited from customers pulling forward some volume from Q3, ahead of new price increases. 
Looking at the segment's organic sales growth in the quarter by region, North America sales were up high single digits. In Western Europe, sales were up mid-teens as demand in both regions increased from Q1. And emerging markets overall were up roughly 20%, continuing their strength from the first quarter. 
The Asia-Pacific region grew roughly 20%, led by significant growth in India, in the ASEAN region with easier comps, given the pandemic impacts we saw in Q2 last year. And then we had low double-digit growth in China. And Latin America grew over 30% with particular strength in Brazil. 
And while LGM's adjusted operating margin remained strong, it decreased slightly from last year to 14.5%. This was partially driven by the impact of supply constraints, which led to both increase in inflation and some incremental costs in the quarter such as expedited freight and overtime to ensure we had supply to service our customers' needs. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS sales were up 73% ex-currency and 72% on an organic basis, as growth was strong in both the high-value categories and the base business due in part to lower prior year comps. Compared to 2019, organic growth was 14%. The apparel business continued its strength as retailers and brands prepared for increasing demand with particular strength in the value and performance channels and continued double-digit growth in external embellishments. 
Intelligent label sales were up organically roughly 65% and up 40% compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 13.1% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset the headwind from prior year temporary cost reduction actions, higher employee-related costs and growth investments. The RBIS team has continued to deliver increasing their top line growth and margins significantly over the last 4 years with margin expansion of more than 4 points since 2016. 
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased 39% ex-currency and 33% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in industrial categories, particularly in automotive applications, which more than offset a decline in personal care tapes due to tougher comps. Compared to 2019, sales were up 6% on an organic basis. 
Adjusted operating margin increased 490 basis points to 11.7% as the benefit from higher volume more than offset the headwind from prior year temporary cost reduction actions and higher employee-related costs. 
Now shifting to our outlook for 2021. We have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.65 and $8.95, a $0.20 increase to the midpoint of the range. The increase reflects the strong performance in Q2 as well as an increased expectation for the rest of the year, driven by continued strong organic sales growth. And as a reminder, this guidance does not yet include the impact of the Vestcom acquisition, which is expected to close later in the third quarter. 
We now anticipate 14% to 16% ex-currency sales growth for the full year above our previous expectations, driven by both higher volume and the impact of higher prices. We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 12 of our supplemental presentation materials. 
In particular, the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be a headwind of a little more than 1 point to reported sales growth and a roughly $0.15 headwind to EPS in 2021. We estimate Q1 benefited by roughly $0.15 based on the shift of the calendar and then anticipate a roughly $0.30 headwind in Q4. The anticipated tailwind from currency translation is now roughly 3.5 points to sales growth and $35 million in operating income for the year based on current rates. And we now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute $60 million to $65 million, down somewhat from our April estimate as the strong demand environment has led us to delay certain projects. 
And given the increased outlook for earnings and working capital productivity, we are now targeting to generate over $700 million of free cash flow this year, which is up roughly 30% from last year and 40% from 2019. 
Now given the distortion in our year-over-year comparisons due to the pandemic last year, let me provide you with some color on our second half outlook in relation to the first half of this year. There are 4 primary drivers which are each worth roughly $0.15 plus or minus, in the second half compared to the first half. 
First item is the calendar shift I just mentioned a minute ago. Secondly is the impact from the pre-buy of volume from Q3 into Q2. Third, there is a sequential price inflation gap in the third quarter, which we expect to close in Q4, driven by the timing of passing new pricing increases through. And lastly, given our continued confidence in our business, we are ramping up our pace of investments to drive our long-term strategies. 
So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in a challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital, which, together, drives sustained growth in EVA. 
We'll now open up the call for your questions."

So let me just start by saying, for us, the acquisition is perfectly aligned with our strategic initiatives and our strategies overall. It firstly increases our exposure to high-value categories, given the high-performing, high-value business as it is. And second is highly synergistic, as you pointed out, George, to our RBIS business with complementary channel access and strong variable data management capability. And the third thing is it really helps leverage and grow our IL ambitions and particularly in food, where they specifically have access and deep relationships in a channel that we are just starting to build traction in and in combination with our variable data management capabilities, we're able to execute more efficiently. 
And then finally, I think more importantly, in the longer term is that the combination of both businesses, I think, will help accelerate the innovation that really needed at retail level to provide better and more integrated inventory management, pricing and consumer engagement solutions. And some of the stuff that we started to build on already with platform launch. 
From a competitive position, they are clearly the market leader in their segment by some distance. And we believe that the complementary skill sets that we both have, both in variable data management and the access that will create from an intelligent labels perspective, will be value additive to all of our stakeholders."

So we have been announcing new pricing. It will take a little bit of time for that new pricing and/or finding new ways to take costs out of our materials to kick in. 
So we have a little bit of a gap from the first half to the second half from that timing of passing that through.

If you look at last year, they both had periods early in the spring of some high levels of growth in the teens and then things fell off in June and July for both regions. So they're both comping actually in the second quarter, pretty strong demand, on and off in Q2 of last year. 
Within Europe, we basically -- if you recall last year, we said in both regions that we had thought we had seen some share during that period. We've recovered that fully within Europe. We have not yet in North America, and that's basically just because we've had a very long -- just a big order book. We're going to be seeing a tremendous amount of orders from the demand levels. We've got longer lead times in North America than we usually do because of the surge in demand as well as the supply constraints that are disproportionately in North America. So that's a little bit of a distinction between the 2. 
As far as how it plays out through the rest of the year, I mean when we look at it, e-commerce demand remains robust. We expect that to continue. As far as the demand for branded labels at the end market, those remain strong. They're clearly softening and I'm talking about the end market, but the CPGs are reporting. There's softened growth from where it was last year when you had a lot of the loading and so forth. But overall, consumption looks to be pretty high from that standpoint. 
So there is a question, and we talked about this last quarter at some point at some of the high levels of demand is any of that around inventory building and so forth. There is a potential for that. So that's something in the range of our guidance that we have and why mid-year -- midway through the year, we still have a relatively wide range on our guidance on the top line."

So in general, we've been looking -- when we look at -- think about capital allocation, our investments are focused, as you know, disproportionately towards higher-value categories, and we're obviously looking for spaces with -- things within intelligent label space or adjacent to that. And this fits both of those criteria. So we've got, as we've talked about before, quite a few companies we have on our radar from an M&A pipeline perspective. So that's what I'll say about that. 
As far as direct overlap, this is an adjacent market to RBIS. It's, as I said, very synergistic, very similar as far as what they do and how they do it. But it's -- as far as selling to dollar stores and grocery stores and drugstores here in the U.S., that is not something we do a lot of where the synergistic overlap based on customers is really around our pipeline development and business development we're doing for intelligent labels and food. We are working with grocery stores, some at business case, some of pilot. We're working with restaurants, which Vestcom doesn't focus on, of course. So that's where I think the emerging territory we received with IL, intelligent label, sorry, and Vestcom is where we see the opportunity.

We also think that that's what's driving some of this demand quite high of people building some inventories and so forth. And so it might be a bit elevated across multiple industries. And as that -- you see some abatement of that, that should ease on the supply chain. So we don't have clear visibility overall.

And I think just to add to that, the way we've thought about this, obviously, in terms of capital allocation and our focus on EVA is we would expect this business to be EVA accretive, excluding any amortization within the second year. So we're literally looking at this being pretty quickly EVA accretive. And we thought about this and relative to our long-term targets we just issued a few months ago. We're talking about continuing our strong growth rates, continuing to expand our margins, continue to deliver double-digit EPS growth and deliver top quartile returns on capital.

John, as it relates to intelligence we continue to see a healthy appetite interest and focus on leveraging the technology from our customers. Our overall pipeline has increased by almost 20% year-on-year since last year. And bear in mind, that was during also a period when retailers, particularly in apparel, were also increasing their interest as they were thinking about dealing with the COVID crisis and much more of a touchless environment really. 
So specifically in apparel, we continue to see growth and interest in the pilot in our pipeline. But across a number of vectors, the first of which is just new customers, apparel retailers and brands that are getting to the point of saying they want to use the technology. There's always been the interest. It's been a relative decision for them as to how they decide on what they allocate their capital to. 
The second area is just on existing customers, a continued expansion for customers using the technology to leverage into new categories or to promote into new geographies they occupy. And then on our non-apparel customers, broadly, we continue to see a significant uptick in interest. More than 60% of that pipeline increase is largely in non-apparel. And particularly, I think, as Mitch touched on earlier on both in food and logistics. In food, particularly the whole drive around provenance and freshness with also the associated labor savings that will go into making sure that's clear for the retailer is starting to resonate and Mitch talked about the rollout that's not progressing underway in the United States, but we're seeing similar demand in Europe and in China. 
And then on the logistics side, the ability to make sure that you can identify clear line of sight throughout the supply chain, in particular when it comes to routing of, let's say, for example, high value or high variable -- or highly hazardous materials through the supply chain is also attracting a lot of interest and where we're seeing expansion and drive"

The payback continues to be significant and strong for apparel customers and increasingly based on the pilots and trials we're seeing for both food and logistics customers. and inclusive, we typically tend to see paybacks within the year from a customer program deployment overall. 
I'd also say that the ancillary benefits that are starting to accrue at the various end customers are seeing more. So for example, where in apparel, it might have been much more around inventory actress in store. There is now much more use of the same technology, the same labeling, for example, to say what is the supply chain visibility. And increasingly, how are they going to start tying that to some degree of consumer engagement as well. 
And similarly then in food, for example, where there may be a big focus on productive use of labor, let's say, in quick-service restaurants, that's now extending using the same technology backwards to say, well, how do we also make sure that we have provenance of where products are coming from and ensuring the freshness of those items as well, George."

We delivered another strong quarter ahead of our expectations, raised our outlook for the second half and announced an agreement to acquire Vestcom, a leader in shelf-edge pricing and branded labeling solutions in the U.S. 
Vestcom has roughly $400 million in revenue with a consistent history of strong growth and above company average margins. Vestcom will further expand our position in high-value categories, while adding channel access and data management capabilities that have the potential to further advance our Intelligent Labels strategy. Deon will tell you more about the acquisition, both the strength of the company and how it will accelerate our strategies, in a moment. 
Turning to results. In the second quarter, earnings rebounded significantly as sales grew 29% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a strong rebound in RBIS and IHM and continued strength in LGM. The quarter was even more impressive relative to 2019, with revenue up 14%, EBITDA margins up 80 basis points and EPS up 30%. 
Now while we are pleased with the results, our strong performance comes at a time of continued uncertainty, given the global health crisis and constraints within supply chains. While the rate of new cases among our team remained stable, many parts of the world are experiencing an increase in COVID-19 cases. Certain countries, particularly in South Asia, have experienced a significant rise in infection rates leading to the recent disruptions at a few RBS (sic) [ RBIS ] manufacturing locations. While this is impacting July, we don't anticipate these disruptions will impact demand in the back half of the year. 
In addition to the effects of the pandemic, supply chains remain constricted, affecting end markets and adding to inflationary pressures. This constraint on the availability of raw materials, freight and in the U.S., labor, continues to impact the industries in which we operate. Despite these constraints, we've been able to deliver record volumes as our team continues to leverage our global network and scale to minimize disruptions to our customers. The current environment further reinforces our determination to remain vigilant in protecting the health and well-being of our team and agile to ensure we continue to meet customer needs. 
Now a quick update by business. Label and Graphic Materials posted strong top line growth for the quarter and demand for consumer packaged goods and e-commerce labels continued to drive strong volume in our Label and Packaging Materials business, while our Graphics and Reflective Solutions business rebounded significantly off prior year lows. 
As for profitability, LGM margins remained strong despite increasing inflationary headwinds, including costs in the quarter from the supply chain constraints. Given the increasing inflationary pressures, we are redoubling our efforts on material reengineering and again raising prices. We are targeting to close the inflation gap relative to mid last year by the fourth quarter. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered robust growth in the quarter and expanded margins significantly compared to prior year lows. Compared to 2019, margins expanded further as the segment grew 25% on a constant currency basis and 14% organically, driven by strength in both high-value product categories, particularly Intelligent Labels as well as the core apparel label business as retailers and brands continued to gear up for a strong rebound in end demand. 
Enterprise-wide, Intelligent Labels sales were up 40% compared to 2019. As expected, the strong growth in our RFID business was primarily driven by apparel. While outside of apparel, we continue to see strong momentum building for new applications in all key geographies. 
In the food segment, for example, a North American restaurant chain recently began rolling out RFID across their network after a successful pilot over the past year. And in logistics, we saw positive momentum, including the adoption of an Intelligent Labels solution at a large global player in the transport of hazardous materials, such as batteries, which requires special shipping protocols. These are just 2 examples of programs of what will be many in the years to come. 
In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales rebounded off prior year lows, showing positive growth compared to 2019 as the segment is on pace for its fourth consecutive year of margin expansion. Given our strong performance in the second quarter and our increased expectations for the rest of the year, we have raised our full year outlook for the company, both on the top and bottom lines. 
Overall, I am pleased with the continued progress we are making towards the success of all of our stakeholders. Our consistent performance reflects the strength of our markets, our industry-leading positions, the strategic foundations we've laid and our agile and talented team. We remain focused on the consistent execution of our 5 key strategies to drive outsized growth in high-value categories, grow profitably in our base businesses, focused relentlessly on productivity, effectively allocate capital and lead in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We are confident that a consistent execution of these strategies, both organically and through M&A, such as the Vestcom acquisition, will enable us to achieve our long-term goals, including consistently delivering GDP+ growth and top quartile returns. 
And once again, I want to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts to keep one another safe while continuing to deliver for our customers during this challenging period. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Deon to provide more color on the high-performing and high-potential acquisition we announced today. Deon?"

Turning to Slide 14. Vestcom is a market-leading provider of pricing and branded labeling solutions for the retail shelf-edge powered by advanced data management capabilities. It's a high-growth, high-margin business generating rough $400 million in annual revenue. 
Vestcom is a highly synergistic adjacency to RBIS, building on our pricing and data management capabilities in adjacent markets and increasing our presence in high-value categories. Vestcom, led by an excellent management team, has been consistently growing at a high single-digit rate organically over the long term with strong track records across cycles and highly accretive EBITDA margins. 
As you may recall back in March at the Investor Day, we outlined RBIS' key strategies, which include delivering outsized growth in high-value categories, unlocking growth in value in food and logistics, growing profitably in the base business and strengthening our digital capabilities and solutions. Vestcom is an accelerator for all of these strategies. In particular, Vestcom provides an opportunity to help accelerate our Intelligent Labels ambitions in food through their additional access to end users in retail, grocery, drug and dollar in particular, and to consumer packaged goods companies, who are key decision makers in the food ecosystem as well as their sophisticated and complementary data management capabilities. 
Turning to how Vestcom delivers for its customers. As you can see on Slide 15, Vestcom solutions create real value for retailers and brands, and they do so by combining data management with outstanding customer service delivery. Vestcom solutions start with taking multiple data files, including price, promotion, planogram and brand content files and merging these to create uniquely integrated shelf-edge labels that have impacts at the point where the majority of consumers make their purchase decisions. Their solutions, which provide both productivity and consumer engagement benefits, include stats which delivers integrated price and promotion labels to each store in time for store associates to label the shelf with the latest pricing and promotion updates in walk sequence that is sorted and ready to walk and tag based on the exact planogram layout for that particular store. 
As Slide 16 indicates, the reduction in store labor time to execute these weekly price and promotion changes so efficiently is significant. And in addition, the improved level of pricing and planogram compliance drives greater consumer impact and commensurate higher sales lift for the retailer. 
Vestcom then builds on this effective productivity and pricing solution by uniquely leveraging the same label real estate to add branded content from CPGs or the retailer to support their time-specific marketing campaigns. These consumer engagement solutions include shelfAdz, which allows for highly effective in-store shelf-edge advertising with the unique advantage of combining all 3 elements in front of the consumer, the price, the promotion and the brand message of content. This solution provides real value in both sales lift and return on advertising spend for both CPGs and retailers. 
The strong return on investments delivered by both their productivity and consumer engagement solutions positioned Vestcom as a strategic partner to their customers, reflected in the deep relationships they have across the grocery, drug and dollar segments they serve. It is these relationships and solutions in combination with our own that will help complement our strategy to accelerate IL adoption beyond apparel. This is particularly true in food, where we are already investing in our IL and digital capabilities and where the need for visibility and problems through the supply chain, inventory and date freshness accuracy on shelf, pricing effectiveness and managing an increasingly omnichannel environment are key success factors for retailers. 
Additionally, the combination of our businesses provides the opportunity to create a unique end-to-end inventory management and pricing solution for retail in the next evolution of our data solutions and digital journey, building on the acquisition of ZippyYum and the launch of our atma.io platform. 
Lastly, we are pleased to add this high-performing business to our portfolio. And I am personally looking forward to both welcoming the Vestcom team and the future prospects of the combined businesses. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Greg."
252978,1674086341,2353241,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Deon, and hello, everybody. I'd like to first add a few points about Vestcom, and I'll be referring to the transaction summary on Slide 17 of our supplemental materials. As Mitch and Deon already mentioned, Vestcom's annual revenue is roughly $4",1566,"Thanks, Deon, and hello, everybody. 
I'd like to first add a few points about Vestcom, and I'll be referring to the transaction summary on Slide 17 of our supplemental materials. As Mitch and Deon already mentioned, Vestcom's annual revenue is roughly $400 million, with strong historical growth and EBITDA margins above our company average, including synergies. The purchase price of $1.45 billion represents an EBITDA multiple below our overall company multiple, and we expect this deal to be accretive to EPS by 2022. 
We're currently planning to fund the acquisition through a combination of cash and debt. If the deal closes in Q3, as anticipated, we expect our leverage ratio to be near the low end of our target range at the end of this year, giving us ample capacity to continue executing our capital allocation strategy. 
Now jumping back to our Q2 results. As Mitch said earlier, we delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.25, which was above our expectations by about $0.10 and roughly $1 per share above prior year, driven by significant revenue growth. Sales were up 29% ex currency and 28% on an organic basis compared to prior year, driven by strong, broad-based demand and the benefit from easier comparisons, given that the pandemic had the biggest impact on our results in Q2 of last year. Compared to 2019, our growth has also been strong with organic sales up 11% versus Q2 2019. 
Our strong growth, combined with productivity gains, more than offset the headwind of last year's temporary cost reduction actions as well as an increasing inflation and new organic investments to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 12.8%, up 210 basis points from last year. We realized $17 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter, the majority of which represented carryover from projects we have pulled forward into 2020. 
We also recorded 2 items, which largely offset each other in our GAAP results in the quarter. The first is a gain related to the recovery of Brazilian indirect taxes paid in previous years, and the second is a liability related to the previously disclosed ruling in the ADASA legal matter, which the company disputes and remains confident in the prospects of a more favorable outcome upon appeal. 
Now as Mitch mentioned, supply chains remained tight and input costs have been increasing. Both raw material and freight inflation were above our initial expectations, and we have continued to see costs rise as we entered the third quarter with expected sequential inflation in Q3 at a mid- to high single-digit rate with variations by region and product category. We are addressing the cost increases through a combination of product reengineering and pricing and have announced additional price increases in most of our businesses and regions across the world. 
Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $388 million of free cash flow with $206 million in the second quarter, up significantly compared to previous years. In the first half of the year, we paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased over 500,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $95 million, for a total of $203 million returned in cash to shareholders so far this year. 
And as I said earlier, our balance sheet is strong with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.3 at quarter end. This gives us ample capacity, even after the Vestcom acquisition, to continue executing our capital allocation strategy. 
Now turning to the segment results. Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 17% ex currency and 16% on an organic basis, driven by higher volume and pricing. Compared to 2019, sales were up 11% on an organic basis. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up roughly 12% organically, with strong volume growth in both the high-value product categories and the base business. Graphics and Reflective sales continued to rebound nicely compared to the trough we saw in Q2 of last year and were up 49% organically. Now similar to last quarter, we do believe that Q2 benefited from customers pulling forward some volume from Q3, ahead of new price increases. 
Looking at the segment's organic sales growth in the quarter by region, North America sales were up high single digits. In Western Europe, sales were up mid-teens as demand in both regions increased from Q1. And emerging markets overall were up roughly 20%, continuing their strength from the first quarter. The Asia Pacific region grew roughly 20%, led by significant growth in India, in the ASEAN region with easier comps, given the pandemic impacts we saw in Q2 last year. And then low -- and then we had low double-digit growth in China. And Latin America grew over 30% with particular strength in Brazil. 
And while LGM's adjusted operating margin remained strong, it decreased slightly from last year to 14.5%. This was partially driven by the impact of supply constraints, which led to both increase in inflation and some incremental costs in the quarter such as expedited freight and overtime to ensure we had supply to service our customers' needs. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS sales were up 73% ex currency and 72% on an organic basis, as growth was strong in both the high-value categories and the base business due in part to lower prior year comps. Compared to 2019, organic growth was 14%. The apparel business continued its strength as retailers and brands prepared for increasing demand with particular strength in the value and performance channels and continued double-digit growth in external embellishments. 
Intelligent Labels sales were up organically roughly 65% and up 40% compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 13.1% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset the headwind from prior year temporary cost reduction actions, higher employee-related costs and growth investments. The RBIS team has continued to deliver, increasing their top line growth and margins significantly over the last 4 years with margin expansion of more than 4 points since 2016. 
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased 39% ex currency and 33% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in industrial categories, particularly in automotive applications, which more than offset a decline in personal care tapes due to tougher comps. Compared to 2019, sales were up 6% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating margin increased 490 basis points to 11.7% as the benefit from higher volume more than offset the headwind from prior year temporary cost reduction actions and higher employee-related costs. 
Now shifting to our outlook for 2021. We have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.65 and $8.95, a $0.20 increase to the midpoint of the range. The increase reflects the strong performance in Q2 as well as an increased expectation for the rest of the year, driven by continued strong organic sales growth. And as a reminder, this guidance does not yet include the impact of the Vestcom acquisition, which is expected to close later in the third quarter. We now anticipate 14% to 16% ex currency sales growth for the full year above our previous expectations, driven by both higher volume and the impact of higher prices. We've outlined some of the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 12 of our supplemental presentation materials. 
In particular, the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be a headwind of a little more than 1 point to reported sales growth and a roughly $0.15 headwind to EPS in 2021. We estimate Q1 benefited by roughly $0.15 based on the shift of the calendar and then anticipate a roughly $0.30 headwind in Q4. The anticipated tailwind from currency translation is now roughly 3.5 points to sales growth and $35 million in operating income for the year based on current rates. And we now estimate that incremental pretax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, will contribute $60 million to $65 million, down somewhat from our April estimate as the strong demand environment has led us to delay certain projects. And given the increased outlook for earnings and working capital productivity, we are now targeting to generate over $700 million of free cash flow this year, which is up roughly 30% from last year and 40% from 2019. 
Now given the distortion in our year-over-year comparisons due to the pandemic last year, let me provide you with some color on our second half outlook in relation to the first half of this year. There are 4 primary drivers which are each worth roughly $0.15 plus or minus, in the second half compared to the first half. 
First item is the calendar shift I just mentioned a minute ago. Secondly is the impact from the prebuy of volume from Q3 into Q2. Third, there is a sequential price inflation gap in the third quarter, which we expect to close in Q4, driven by the timing of passing new pricing increases through. And lastly, given our continued confidence in our business, we are ramping up our pace of investments to drive our long-term strategies. 
So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in a challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP+ growth and top quartile returns on capital, which, together, drives sustained growth in EVA. 
We'll now open up the call for your questions."

So let me just start by saying, from -- for us, the acquisition is perfectly aligned with our strategic initiatives and our strategies overall. It firstly increases our exposure to high-value categories, given the high-performing, high-value business as it is. And secondly, it's highly synergistic, as you pointed out, George, to our RBIS business with complementary channel access and strong variable data management capability. And the third thing is it really helps leverage and grow our IL ambitions and particularly in food, where they specifically have access and deep relationships in a channel that we are just starting to build traction in and secondarily, in combination with our variable data management capabilities, we're able to execute more efficiently. 
And then finally, I think more importantly, in the longer term is that the combination of both businesses, I think, will help acceleration -- accelerate the innovation that's really needed at retail level to provide better and more integrated inventory management, pricing and consumer engagement solutions. And some of the stuff that we started to build on already with the atma.io platform launch. From a competitive position, they are clearly the market leader in their segment by some distance. And we believe that the complementary skill sets that we both have, both in variable data management and the access that will create from an Intelligent Labels perspective, will be value additive to all of our stakeholders."

So we have been announcing new pricing. It will take a little bit of time for that new pricing and/or finding new ways to take costs out of our materials to kick in. So we have a little bit of a gap from the first half to the second half from that timing of passing that through. We think that's roughly in that $0.15 plus or minus range that I talked about a little bit earlier.

If you look at last year, they both had periods early in the spring of some high levels of growth in the teens and then things fell off in June and July for both regions. So they're both comping actually in the second quarter, pretty strong demand, on and off in Q2 of last year. 
Within Europe, we basically -- if you recall last year, we said in both regions that we had thought we had seen some share during that period. We've recovered that fully within Europe. We have not yet in North America, and that's basically just because we've had a very long -- just a big order book. We're going to be seeing a tremendous amount of orders from the demand levels. We've got longer lead times in North America than we usually do because of the surge in demand as well as the supply constraints that are disproportionately in North America. So that's a little bit of a distinction between the two. 
As far as how it plays out through the rest of the year, I mean when we look at it, e-commerce demand remains robust. We expect that to continue. As far as the demand for branded labels at the end market, those remain strong. They're clearly softening and I'm talking about the end market, but the CPGs are reporting. There's softened growth from where it was last year when you had a lot of the pantry loading and so forth. But overall, consumption looks to be pretty high from that standpoint. 
So there is a question, and we talked about this last quarter at some point at some of the high levels of demand is any of that around inventory building and so forth. There is a potential for that. So that's something in the range of our guidance that we have and why mid-year -- midway through the year, we still have a relatively wide range on our guidance on the top line."

As far as direct overlap, this is an adjacent market to RBIS. It's, as I said, very synergistic, very similar as far as what they do and how they do it. But it's -- as far as selling to dollar stores and grocery stores and drugstores here in the U.S., that is not something we do a lot of where the synergistic overlap based on customers is really around our pipeline development and business development we're doing for Intelligent Labels and food. We are working with grocery stores, some with business case, some with pilot. We're working with restaurants, which Vestcom doesn't focus on, of course.

John, given the relative size of this business, we're not going to get into a bunch of specifics around that. But overall, as we said, the multiple that we are paying is below the company average for a business that is higher growth than the average, higher margin than the average. And so -- and the multiple that we're paying being less is both before and after synergies, of course. 
And I think just to add to that, the way we've thought about this, obviously, in terms of capital allocation and our focus on EVA is we would expect this business to be EVA accretive, excluding any amortization within the second year. So we're literally looking at this being pretty quickly EVA accretive. And we thought about this and relative to our long-term targets we just issued a few months ago. We're talking about continuing our strong growth rates, continuing to expand our margins, continue to deliver double-digit EPS growth and deliver top quartile returns on capital. 
And we look at this business, it's accretive to our top line growth rate. It's accretive to our EBITDA margins. It's also accretive to our EPS growth, of course. And we think we can continue to deliver top quartile capital and meet our long-term target for ROTC with this acquisition. So really fits and helps us accelerate all of our key financial long-term targets that we communicated a couple of months ago."

And particularly when you get out of the U.S. and maybe Western Europe and China, it's still, depending on which region you're in, they are experiencing an increase in infection rates. And so as we called out specifically, there is an impact here in July from some disruptions in RBIS in South Asia, specifically. Now given our experience in managing through in the past, we expect, especially since demand and demand is strong, that we'll be able to work that through here in the second half. But I would say that COVID is still something top of mind for the leadership and something we're continuing to manage on a regular basis. So looking forward to being in a rearview mirror.

John, as it relates to Intelligent Labels, we continue to see a healthy appetite interest and focus on leveraging the technology from our customers. Our overall pipeline has increased by almost 20% year-on-year since last year. And bear in mind, that was during also a period when retailers, particularly in apparel, were also increasing their interest as they were thinking about dealing with the COVID crisis and much more of a touchless environment really. 
So specifically in apparel, we continue to see growth and interest in the pilot in our pipeline. But across a number of vectors, the first of which is just new customers, apparel retailers and brands that are getting to the point of saying they want to use the technology. There's always been the interest. It's been a relative decision for them as to how they decide on what they allocate their capital to. 
The second area is just on existing customers, a continued expansion for customers using the technology to leverage into new categories or to promote into new geographies they occupy. And then on our nonapparel customers, broadly, we continue to see a significant uptick in interest. More than 60% of that pipeline increase is largely in nonapparel. And particularly, I think, as Mitch touched on earlier on both in food and logistics. In food, particularly the whole drive around provenance and freshness with also the associated labor savings that will go into making sure that's clear for the retailer is starting to resonate, and Mitch talked about the rollout that's not progressing underway in the United States, but we're seeing similar demand in Europe and in China. 
And then on the logistics side, the ability to make sure that you can identify clear line of sight throughout the supply chain, in particular when it comes to routing of, let's say, for example, high value or high variable -- or highly hazardous materials through the supply chain is also attracting a lot of interest and where we're seeing expansion requirements and drivers."

And outside of automotive, the revenue growth trends softened a little bit -- softened a bit from Q1, and that was largely the prebuy that we had seen in the Q1 that we talked about last quarter.

George, that specific point, I think the last time we've touched on this, the payback continues to be significant and strong for apparel customers and increasingly based on the pilots and trials we're seeing for both food and logistics customers. And inclusively, we typically tend to see paybacks within the year from a customer program deployment overall. 
I'd also say that the ancillary benefits that are starting to accrue at the various end customers are seeing more. So for example, where in apparel, it might have been much more around inventory actually in store. There is now much more use of the same technology, the same labeling, for example, to say what is the supply chain visibility. And increasingly, how are they going to start tying that to some degree of consumer engagement as well. 
And similarly then in food, for example, where there may be a big focus on productive use of labor, let's say, in quick-service restaurants, that's now extending using the same technology backwards to say, well, how do we also make sure that we have provenance of where products are coming from and ensuring the freshness of those items as well, George."

I'm pleased to report we delivered another strong quarter. Our 2 primary businesses achieved impressive top and bottom line growth and momentum in our Intelligent Labels platform continues. We are in a higher demand",710,"Thanks, John, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to report we delivered another strong quarter. Our 2 primary businesses achieved impressive top and bottom line growth and momentum in our Intelligent Labels platform continues. 
We are in a higher demand environment that comes at a time of continued and increasing challenges. The ramping up of COVID infections and restrictions in some countries, continued supply chain challenges and additional inflationary pressures are taxing in the industry, our customers and our teams. The biggest challenges have been in LGM North America due to raw material shortages and labor and capacity constraints and in RBIS Vietnam, where output was significantly constrained in the quarter due to COVID restrictions. 
While we are encouraged by recent trends in these businesses as we've been able to increase output in recent weeks, the supply chain constraints continue. As for inflation, the pressures continue to increase. We previously expected some abatement in raw material input costs towards the end of the year whereas we now expect additional inflation in Q4 as well as Q1 of next year. 
Now for context on the magnitude of the inflation,  in our Materials businesses alone, we will be exiting this year with annualized inflation of more than $600 million. That's a nearly 20% increase, a rate we have not seen in decades. We are thus in the midst of another round of price increases. Despite these hurdles, we continue to achieve impressive results. The team is doing a tremendous job managing through these compounding challenges, focusing on keeping our teams safe and delivering for our customers. 
Now a brief recap of the segments. Label and Graphic Materials posted strong top line growth for the quarter, overcoming the challenges I just highlighted, as demand for consumer packaged goods and e-commerce trends continue to drive strong volume growth in our Label and Packaging Materials business, while growth in our Graphics and Reflective Solutions business continues to rebound. 
LGM's profitability remained strong, though margins were down from last year due to the increasing inflationary headwinds and higher costs in the quarter from the supply chain constraints. Given the increasing inflationary pressures, we have redoubled our efforts on material reengineering and as I mentioned previously, are raising prices again. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter and continued to expand margins significantly. The segment grew 22% on a constant currency basis and 14% organically, driven by strength in both high-value product categories as well as the core apparel business. Impressive performance despite the significant constraint in South Asia, where we have major manufacturing hubs once again demonstrating the advantages of our global manufacturing network. 
Intelligent Label sales, enterprise-wide, were up 15% in the quarter, and we are on track for approximately 30% organic growth for the year versus 2020 and 40% versus 2019, towards the higher end of our long-term target. As expected, the continued strong growth in our RFID business was primarily driven by apparel. Applications outside of apparel, particularly food and logistics, grew faster than the average, though obviously off of a small base. And in Q3, we also closed the acquisition of Vestcom, a business that further expands our position in high-value categories and has the potential to further advance our Intelligent Label strategy. 
In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales continued to rebound off prior year lows and were up relative to 2019 by 11% on a constant currency basis. As for margins, they are down as inflationary pressures part and costs from supply chain disruptions have impacted the segment to a greater degree than LGM. 
Overall, I am pleased with the progress we're making as a company on our long-term strategies while also executing in the near term. We are providing superior service to our customers despite the challenging environment, keeping our teams safe and engaged, ramping up investments for the long term and ensuring we continue to deliver for our shareholders. Given our strong performance in the quarter, we have raised our outlook for the year, now anticipating earnings growth of roughly 25% over last year's record and are on track to achieve all of our 5-year company-wide goals that we established in early 2017. 
With that, I'll now hand it over to Greg."
252978,1684721158,2414401,"Avery Dennison Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Avery Dennison Corporation","Executives","All right. Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up 12% over prior year and up 29% compared to 2019, driven by significant revenue growth and strong margins. Sales were up 17%",1196,"All right. Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up 12% over prior year and up 29% compared to 2019, driven by significant revenue growth and strong margins. 
Sales were up 17% ex currency and 14% on an organic basis compared to prior year, driven by strong volume across the portfolio and higher prices. We also delivered strong growth compared to 2019, with organic sales up 10% versus 2 years ago. As Mitch mentioned, our supply chains remain tight and input costs have continued to rise. Both raw material and freight inflation were above our expectations for the quarter, and we've continued [indiscernible] rise as we enter the fourth quarter. We continue to address the cost increases through a combination of product reengineering and pricing and have announced additional price increases in most of our businesses and regions across the world. 
Despite the impact of inflation, supply chain disruptions and the headwind of last year's temporary cost reduction actions, we delivered a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, down 70 basis points from last year and up 120 basis points compared to 2019. 
Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $639 million of free cash flow, up over $251 million in the third quarter. That's up significantly compared to previous years, driven by our strong net income growth and working capital productivity. And we closed the Vestcom acquisition in the quarter for a total purchase price of roughly $1.45 billion. To fund the acquisition, we used the net proceeds from an $800 million senior note offering in August, along with cash and commercial paper. 
Additionally, in the first 3 quarters of the year, we returned a total of $290 million in cash to shareholders through $164 million in dividends and the repurchase of over 700,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $126 million. 
Our balance sheet continues to be strong with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 at quarter end at the bottom end of our long-term target leverage range. This gives us significant capacity to continue the disciplined execution of our capital allocation strategy. 
Now turning to the segment results. Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 15% ex currency and 14% on an organic basis, driven by strong volume and roughly 5 points from higher prices. Compared to 2019, sales were up 11% on an organic basis. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up roughly 15% organically, with strong volume growth in both the high-value product categories and the base business. 
Graphics and Reflective sales were up 11% organically. And looking at the segment's organic sales growth in the quarter by region, North America sales were up low double digits despite raw material availability challenges that have continued to create extended lead times. Western Europe grew more than 20%, partially due to easier comps given the impact of the pandemic we saw in Q3 last year. With that said, the business was still up double digits versus 2019. And overall, emerging market sales were up low double digits in the quarter with double-digit growth in both ASEAN and Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in China. 
While LGM's profitability remained strong, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from last year to 15.9%. This was partially driven by the increased inflationary pressures and the impact of supply constraints, which led to some incremental costs in the quarter such as expedited freight and overtime to minimize disruptions to customers. And as you know, our goals are to deliver GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital with a focus on driving EVA. 
Our approach to price increases and material reengineering is designed to do just that as we look to offset higher material costs on a dollar basis by the end of an inflationary cycle. However, the revenue base from such price increases alone, especially at the magnitude we are seeing in the back half of this year reduces operating margin on a percentage basis with no impact to returns. This pricing impact led to a reduction in operating margin by roughly 0.75 point in the third quarter. 
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 22% ex currency and 14% on an organic basis, as growth remains strong in both the high-value categories and the base business, due in part to lower prior year comps. Compared to 2019, organic growth was up 9%. The apparel business saw a particular strength in the performance and premium channels and continued double-digit growth in external embellishments. 
As Mitch mentioned, Intelligent Label sales were up organically roughly 15% and up about 40% compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 13.8% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset the headwind from prior year temporary cost reduction actions, higher employee-related costs and growth investments. The RBS team is continuing to deliver in this high-growth, high-margin business. 
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment.  Sales increased 20% ex currency and 15% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in both the industrial and health care categories. Compared to 2019, sales were up 6% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating margin decreased to roughly 10%, as the benefit from higher volume was more than offset by the net impact of pricing, higher freight and raw material costs and higher employee-related costs. Freight in particular, had an outsized impact on IHM in the quarter, given the significant increases in global shipping costs. 
Now shifting to our outlook for 2021. We have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.80 and $8.95, a roughly $0.08 increase to the midpoint of the range. And we now anticipate roughly 15% organic sales growth for the full year at the high end of our previous range, reflecting strong volume growth and the impact from higher prices. 
We've outlined some of the key -- the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 12 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 and  the resulting calendar shift will be a headwind to reported sales growth of roughly 8 points in the fourth quarter this year, with a roughly $0.30 EPS headwind. 
The anticipated tailwind from currency translation is now $30 million in operating income for the full year based on current rates. Most of this benefit came in the first half and will create a headwind as we go into 2022 if rates stay where they are now. 
And we expect a modest EPS benefit from Vestcom in 2021, and net of purchase accounting amortization, which we estimate to be nearly $60 million on an annualized basis and net of financing costs due to target over $700 million of free cash flow this year, up significantly from previous years. 
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in a challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital, which together drives sustained growth in EVA. We will now open up the call for your questions."

But throughout the pandemic, there's actually been different regions that have been impacted more than others, and we've been flexing the global manufacturing network to help offset that. 
And so specifically here, if you're asking about Vietnam, we are able to leverage specifically China to be able to service that demand in Vietnam. We still impacted growth by a couple of points overall.  Question is how much of that is just end demand that won't happen now because the retailers and apparel brand owners won't be able to fulfill more end consumer demand or not.

I think the biggest regions where we're seeing the largest inflation is probably both in North America and Europe. And North America really started late last year. As you recall, with some of the chemical increases and that's continue to grow as we move through this year and then Europe continued shortly after that with paper really kicking in here in the third quarter. It's been the biggest sequential increase."

So we're looking at somewhere kind of low to mid-single-digit further inflation from Q3 to Q4. And now we're implementing additional pricing actions. So I think our view is that it takes us a few months, 3 to 4 months to pass pricing or reengineer some materials to take cost out to manage the inflation. So when we start to see inflation stabilize 3 or 4 months after that is probably when we expect to be able to cover that on an ongoing basis."

First question I wanted to ask is around what you're doing to offset inflation. Good companies play to their strengths and advantages during periods of stress to gain position to gain share. As you think about LGM versus RBIS and you think about the broad buckets, reengineering and cost versus commercial and price versus, I don't know, new products and innovation, how would you say that sort of mix varies in terms of how you're behaving in the market, LGM versus RBIS. I know LGM is heavy on the reformulation and pricing. 
And then the second question related to it is, is there a horizon? Is there a practical limit where you really can't do any further reformulation where certainly the incremental benefit isn't what we've been seeing this year and in prior years, which would mean that you'd have to raise pricing further -- And is there a practical limit in terms of how much more pricing you can get before you would worry about the strong demand."

So  your first question, which was talking about the relative levers within between RBIS and LGM, as an example. I mean, first off, the inflation is much larger in LGM. Our levers within that -- all of our businesses are on just -- our  relentless focus on productivity is both focusing on variable costs, so things like innovating material reengineering and so forth, restructuring. So touching on both of those, as you highlighted, the material reengineering is more to do within the Materials businesses, as you'd expect. 
You asked, are there limits to that within a given time period. Yes, there are some limits to that. But over the long horizon, we continue to have a pretty consistent ability to  deliver material cost out, we call it, every single year, and we've been doing that for decades. So I don't see a long-term one to that, but definitely a short cycle, there's some limits to what we can do there, which then you move to pricing. 
Within RBIS, they're having some inflation as well, not nearly the magnitude that we're seeing within materials. And there, we've been raising prices as well. It's a little bit of a different impact because every year, there's a different program, just the way that industry works, and so you're constantly kind of repricing for new programs going from different designs of of information and branding solutions for the apparel and retailers out there. 
And then last thing I'll say is just restructuring. That's been a consistent focus of ours.  In times that are relatively come, that's when you want to focus on the restructuring as we've been doing over the years. We accelerated a lot of restructuring, as you know, into last year, and so we're in a position of strength right now. When you're in a high-volume environment, it's -- that's when you taper back a bit of your restructuring. So long term, that's something that's going to be a key lever for our -- of ours across the portfolio. But clearly, we accelerated some of our actions in the last year from what we have here on the near horizon."

For the full year, we're probably still around what our initial expectations would have been. But just given supply chain challenges and some things getting delayed from an equipment production perspective, building perspective, things like that. We expect to have more CapEx here in Q4. And we normally do, but I think probably more relative to the first 3 quarters than what we normally would have. So that's 1 driver. 
So overall, I think our view is that we've got about $630 million, as you said, year-to-date,  our target is to deliver over $700 million. We're very confident in that and that's still about $150 million more than last year, which was a record free cash flow year for us.

I think overall, as you said, part of what you see when you look at the segments is some improvements in RBS, particularly sequentially Q2 to Q3. And in the materials businesses where we saw a little bit more of the sequential inflation in the third quarter, is where we saw a little bit of sequential decline Q2 to Q3. 
So I think overall, a big part of that overall flatness was really driven by the strengthening of RBS from Q2 to Q3. So we look at Q3 to Q4, we expect to continue delivering strong margins in the RBS segment. We did talk about having further sequential inflation that we're now working through passing prices through. So that will be a little bit more of a gap in the fourth than what we would have expected before as well."

And as far as adopting across the entire network, which we see a significant opportunity just when you think about the amount of automation required and trying to reduce costs, but also increase speed. We see that this technology, RFID and our broader Intelligent Label Solutions as being a key enabler to helping companies achieve that. So you ask what can the size of the market be.

In the fourth quarter, we expect that to be a little bit higher year-over-year as we've been implementing prices in the third quarter and some new increases that take effect at some point in Q4.

I'm pleased to report we delivered another strong quarter. Our 2 primary businesses achieved impressive top and bottom line, growth and momentum in our Intelligent Labels platform continues. We are in a higher demand",711,"Thanks, John, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to report we delivered another strong quarter. Our 2 primary businesses achieved impressive top and bottom line, growth and momentum in our Intelligent Labels platform continues. We are in a higher demand environment that comes at a time of continued and increasing challenges. The ramping up of COVID infections and restrictions in some countries, continued supply chain challenges and additional inflationary pressures are taxing the industry, our customers and our teams. The biggest challenges have been in LGM North America due to raw material shortages and labor and capacity constraints, and in RBIS Vietnam, where output was significantly constrained in the quarter due to COVID restrictions.  
While we are encouraged by recent trends in these businesses as we've been able to increase output in recent weeks, the supply chain constraints continue. As for inflation, the pressures continue to increase. We previously expected some abatement in raw material input costs towards the end of the year, whereas we now expect additional inflation in Q4 as well as Q1 of next year.  
Now for context on the magnitude of the inflation, in our Materials businesses alone, we will be exiting this year with annualized inflation of more than $600 million. That's a nearly 20% increase, a rate we have not seen in decades. We are thus in the midst of another round of price increases. Despite these hurdles, we continue to achieve impressive results. The team is doing a tremendous job managing through these compounding challenges, focusing on keeping our teams safe and delivering for our customers.  
Now a brief recap of the segments. Label and Graphic Materials posted strong top line growth for the quarter, overcoming the challenges I just highlighted, as demand for consumer packaged goods and e-commerce trends continue to drive strong volume growth in our Label and Packaging Materials business, while growth in our Graphic and Reflective Solutions business continues to rebound.  
LGM's profitability remained strong, though margins were down from last year due to the increasing inflationary headwinds and higher costs in the quarter from the supply chain constraints. Given the increasing inflationary pressures, we have redoubled our efforts on material reengineering and, as I mentioned previously, are raising prices again. 
Retail Branding and Information Solutions delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter and continued to expand margins significantly. The segment grew 22% on a constant currency basis and 14% organically, driven by strength in both high-value product categories as well as the core apparel business. Impressive performance despite the significant constraint in South Asia, where we have major manufacturing hubs, once again demonstrating the advantages of our global manufacturing network. 
Intelligent Label sales enterprise-wide were up 15% in the quarter, and we are on track for approximately 30% organic growth for the year versus 2020 and 40% versus 2019, towards the higher end of our long-term target. As expected, the continued strong growth in our RFID business was primarily driven by apparel. Applications outside of apparel, particularly food and logistics, grew faster than the average, though obviously off of a small base. And in Q3, we also closed the acquisition of Vestcom, a business that further expands our position in high-value categories and has the potential to further advance our Intelligent Label strategy.  
In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales continued to rebound off prior year lows and were up relative to 2019 by 11% on a constant currency basis. As for margins, they are down as inflationary pressures [ dipped ] and costs from supply chain disruptions have impacted the segment to a greater degree than LGM.  
Overall, I am pleased with the progress we're making as a company on our long-term strategies while also executing in the near term. We are providing superior service to our customers despite the challenging environment, keeping our teams safe and engaged, ramping up investments for the long term and ensuring we continue to deliver for our shareholders. Given our strong performance in the quarter, we have raised our outlook for the year, now anticipating earnings growth of roughly 25% over last year's record and are on track to achieve all of our 5-year company-wide goals that we established in early 2017.  
With that, I'll now hand it over to Greg."

Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up 12% over prior year and up 29% compared to 2019, driven by significant revenue growth and strong margins. Sales were up 17% e",1195,"All right. Thanks, Mitch, and hello, everybody. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up 12% over prior year and up 29% compared to 2019, driven by significant revenue growth and strong margins. Sales were up 17% ex currency and 14% on an organic basis compared to prior year, driven by strong volume across the portfolio and higher prices. We also delivered strong growth compared to 2019, with organic sales up 10% versus 2 years ago. 
As Mitch mentioned, our supply chains remain tight and input costs have continued to rise. Both raw material and freight inflation were above our expectations for the quarter, and we've continued [indiscernible] rise as we enter the fourth quarter. We continue to address the cost increases through a combination of product reengineering and pricing and have announced additional price increases in most of our businesses and regions across the world.  
Despite the impact of inflation, supply chain disruptions and the headwind of last year's temporary cost reduction actions, we delivered a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, down 70 basis points from last year and up 120 basis points compared to 2019.  
Turning to cash generation and allocation. Year-to-date, we've generated $639 million of free cash flow, up over $251 million in the third quarter. That's up significantly compared to previous years, driven by our strong net income growth and working capital productivity. And we closed the Vestcom acquisition in the quarter for a total purchase price of roughly $1.45 billion. To fund the acquisition, we used the net proceeds from an $800 million senior note offering in August, along with cash and commercial paper. 
Additionally, in the first 3 quarters of the year, we returned a total of $290 million in cash to shareholders through $164 million in dividends and the repurchase of over 700,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $126 million. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 at quarter end, at the bottom end of our long-term target leverage range. This gives us significant capacity to continue the disciplined execution of our capital allocation strategy.  
Now turning to the segment results. Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 15% ex currency and 14% on an organic basis, driven by strong volume and roughly 5 points from higher prices. Compared to 2019, sales were up 11% on an organic basis. Label and Packaging Materials sales were up roughly 15% organically, with strong volume growth in both the high-value product categories and the base business.  
Graphics and Reflective sales were up 11% organically. And looking at the segment's organic sales growth in the quarter by region, North America sales were up low double digits despite raw material availability challenges that have continued to create extended lead times. Western Europe grew more than 20%, partially due to easier comps given the impact of the pandemic we saw in Q3 last year. With that said, the business was still up double digits versus 2019. And overall, emerging market sales were up low double digits in the quarter with double-digit growth in both ASEAN and Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in China.  
While LGM's profitability remained strong, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from last year to 15.9%. This was partially driven by the increased inflationary pressures and the impact of supply constraints, which led to some incremental costs in the quarter such as expedited freight and overtime to minimize disruptions to customers. And as you know, our goals are to deliver GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital with a focus on driving EVA.  
Our approach to price increases and material reengineering is designed to do just that as we look to offset higher material costs on a dollar basis by the end of an inflationary cycle. However, the revenue base from such price increases alone, especially at the magnitude we are seeing in the back half of this year, reduces operating margin on a percentage basis with no impact to returns. This pricing impact led to a reduction in operating margin by roughly 0.75% in the third quarter.  
Shifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions. RBIS sales were up 22% ex currency and 14% on an organic basis, as growth remains strong in both the high-value categories and the base business, due in part to lower prior year comps. Compared to 2019, organic growth was up 9%. The apparel business saw a particular strength in the performance and premium channels and continued double-digit growth in external embellishments.  
As Mitch mentioned, Intelligent Label sales were up organically, roughly 15%, and up about 40% compared to 2019. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 13.8% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset the headwinds from prior year temporary cost reduction actions, higher employee-related costs and growth investments. The RBIS team is continuing to deliver in this high-growth, high-margin business.  
Turning to the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment. Sales increased 20% ex currency and 15% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in both the industrial and health care categories. Compared to 2019, sales were up 6% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating margin decreased to roughly 10%, as the benefit from higher volume was more than offset by the net impact of pricing, higher freight and raw material costs and higher employee-related costs. Freight in particular had an outsized impact on IHM in the quarter, given the significant increases in global shipping costs. 
Now shifting to our outlook for 2021. We have raised our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.80 and $8.95, a roughly $0.08 increase to the midpoint of the range. And we now anticipate roughly 15% organic sales growth for the full year, at the high end of our previous range, reflecting strong volume growth and the impact from higher prices. 
We've outlined some of the key -- the other key contributing factors to this guidance on Slide 12 of our supplemental presentation materials. In particular, the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 and  the resulting calendar shift will be a headwind to reported sales growth of roughly 8 points in the fourth quarter this year, with a roughly $0.30 EPS headwind. The anticipated tailwind from currency translation is now $30 million in operating income for the full year based on current rates. Most of this benefit came in the first half and will thus create a headwind as we go into 2022 if rates stay where they are now. And we expect a modest EPS benefit from Vestcom in 2021, net of purchase accounting amortization, which we estimate to be nearly $60 million on an annualized basis and net of financing costs. We're to target over $700 million of free cash flow this year, up significantly from previous years.  
In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in a challenging environment, and we remain on track to deliver on our long-term objectives to achieve GDP-plus growth and top quartile returns on capital, which together drives sustained growth in EVA.

And so specifically here, if you're asking about Vietnam, we're able to leverage specifically China to be able to service that demand in Vietnam. 
Still impacted growth by a couple of points overall. Question is, how much of that is just end demand that won't happen now because the retailers and apparel brand owners won't be able to fulfill more end consumer demand or not.

So I think we've seen the acceleration in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter here really across the different component categories.  
I think the biggest regions where we're seeing the largest inflation is probably both in North America and Europe, and North America really started late last year. As you recall, with some of the chemical increases and that's continued to grow as we moved through this year and then Europe continued shortly after that with paper really kicking in here in the third quarter. It's been the biggest sequential increase."

So we're looking at somewhere kind of low to mid-single-digit further inflation from Q3 to Q4. And now we're implementing additional pricing actions. 
So I think our view is that it takes us a few months, 3 to 4 months to pass pricing or reengineer some materials to take cost out to manage the inflation. So when we start to see inflation stabilize 3 or 4 months after that is probably when we expect to be able to cover that on an ongoing basis."

Good companies play to their strengths and advantages during periods of stress to gain position to gain share. As you think about LGM versus RBIS and you think about the broad buckets, reengineering and cost versus commercial and price versus, I don't know, new products and innovation, how would you say that sort of mix varies in terms of how you're behaving in the market, LGM versus RBIS? I know LGM is heavy on the reformulation and pricing. 
And then the second question related to it is, is there a horizon? Is there a practical limit where you really can't do any further reformulation where certainly the incremental benefit isn't what we've been seeing this year and in prior years, which would mean that you'd have to raise pricing further. And is there a practical limit in terms of how much more pricing you can get before you would worry about the strong demand?"

So  your first question, which was talking about the relative levers within between RBIS and LGM, as an example. I mean, first off, the inflation is much larger in LGM. Our levers within that -- all of our businesses are, one, just our relentless focus on productivity is both focusing on variable costs, so things like innovating material reengineering and so forth, restructuring. So touching on both of those, as you highlighted, the material reengineering is more to do within the Materials businesses, as you'd expect. 
You asked, are there limits to that within a given time period. Yes, there are some limits to that. But over the long horizon, we continue to have a pretty consistent ability to deliver material cost out, we call it, every single year, and we've been doing that for decades. So I don't see a long-term limit to that, but definitely within a short cycle, there's some limits to what we can do there, which then you move to pricing. 
Within RBIS, they're having some inflation as well, not nearly the magnitude that we're seeing within materials. And there, we've been raising prices as well. It's a little bit of a different impact because every year, there's a different program, just the way that industry works, and so you're constantly kind of repricing for new programs going from different designs of information and branding solutions for the apparel and retailers out there. 
And then last thing I'll say is just restructuring. That's been a consistent focus of ours. In times that are relatively calm, that's when you want to focus on the restructuring, as we've been doing over the years. We accelerated a lot of restructuring, as you know, into last year, and so we're in a position of strength right now.

So I think generally, what you're seeing, we see what's going on in the macro around increasing inflation, labor constraints, it actually further heightens the need around information solutions labels, whether that be classic barcode labels or RFID and intelligent labels. And so we think it's just going to -- while there are inflationary pressures, it also further increases the business case for a lot of the solutions that we've been focusing on and investing in."

Specifically, your question about constraints, yes, we were constrained. The challenges in South Asia I referenced, we had Vietnam. So our Intelligent Labels, a biggest portion of that, 75%, is for apparel. With the constraints we saw in Vietnam, just as I mentioned, for RBS overall, impacted the Intelligent Labels businesses by a couple of points, as well as Malaysia in the middle of the quarter, it was just a couple of weeks, but Malaysia had a lot of lockdowns, and that's where we have one of our RFID inlay manufacturing plants.

So overall, I think our view is that we've got about $630 million, as you said, year-to-date. Our target is to deliver over $700 million.

So we look at Q3 to Q4, we expect to continue delivering strong margins in the RBS segment. We did talk about having further sequential inflation that we're now working through passing prices through.

And as far as adopting across the entire network, which we see a significant opportunity just when you think about the amount of automation required and trying to reduce costs, but also increase speed. We see that this technology, RFID and our broader Intelligent Label solutions, as being a key enabler to helping companies achieve that. So you ask what can the size of the market be.

Again, in periods of stress, the big companies usually gain capabilities, gain share. The smaller companies would tend to fall back. Are there any companies in the pipeline that would be helpful to you from a value-add because that's one of the components in terms of your capital allocation strategy and would be complementary to Avery. Would you have the willingness to do anything like that? And relative to some of the experiences some of your peers had back in early 2000s, would you have the ability to add anything in LGM?"

And as far as specifically the LGM, yes, LGM, each of our divisions have a pipeline that we continue to work and we definitely have an appetite for areas that -- we look at M&A as opportunities to accelerate our strategy. So we're focused on M&A that is disproportionately focused on high-value categories and give us new capabilities that, as you mentioned, can enhance the overall capabilities of the portfolio. 
So there's a number of angles we look here, but those are the 2 broad thrust is high-value categories emphasis and bringing on new capabilities overall, and obviously, the financial one. So we're continuing to work it. We just spent $1.45 billion on Vestcom, and we feel good with the early results of that and the outlook for that business and are confident we're going to achieve a good return there. And then we're also looking to deploy our capital that we have going forward."
