With the vaccination gaining more traction every day, we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Yet our intense effort executing through COVID will most certainly continue for a while yet. Despite the enormous challenges of 2020 for Healthpeak, I believe we will exit the pandemic in a stronger place than where we started. More on that shortly, but first, let me temporarily digress. 
Around a year ago, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was identified in the United States and then spread insidiously across the country. Like so many companies at the time, our executive team and Board were busy determining how best to navigate the imminent crisis with consideration to its then uncertain penetration and duration on human beings and on the market. At the time, we identified 5 priorities. First, to protect the health of our teammates, residents and tenants without overwriting consideration to expense. Second, to guard our balance sheet, liquidity and credit ratings to ensure we remained rock-solid on the other side of the crisis. Third, to communicate frequently and openly with our investors, analysts and rating agencies as best we could with the facts we had at the time. Fourth, in a post COVID world, we consider key societal and market trends and determine that all of our classes of real estate would remain vital after the pandemic was resolved. And fifth, we aim to take advantage of any opportunities that might result from disruptions caused by the pandemic. 
Initially, we thought it possible there may arise distressed buying opportunities, but that never did transpire in our desired asset classes of anchored MOBs and purpose-built life science. we saw cap rates compress rather than rise. Fortunately, that positively impacted our gross asset values for these portfolios. 
Execution on these 5 priorities turned out to be critical and guiding our path through the And relative to our priority of identifying opportunities created by the crisis, we decided to test the market to determine if it might be feasible to lighten up or even exit our rental senior housing business without undue incremental dilution. That was half a year ago. So after 6 months of hard work on this plan, yesterday, we announced that during the fourth quarter and year-to-date 2021, we closed on $2.5 billion of SHOP and triple-net sales, with the remaining $1.5 billion under binding and nonbinding contracts. 
In aggregate, this $4 billion of rental senior housing sales is right on top of the estimate we provided in our Q3 earnings call. We're now very far along to a full exit of rental senior housing with some work left to do. Accordingly, we will soon be able to focus our team entirely on growing and operating our biotech centric life science and our primarily on-campus MOB portfolios, which together will soon represent 85% of our company. And additionally, we continue to hold a relatively smaller portfolio of high-quality and high-yielding CCRCS. 
Importantly and fundamental tenant to our strategy, we believe all 3 of these businesses represent irreplaceable, high barrier to entry portfolios that are impossible to replicate and provide a strong growth trajectory based on demographic tailwinds. Additionally, our land bank and densification opportunities aggregate to $7 billion plus, which will keep us busy for around a decade without the need to purchase any additional land. But inevitably, I'm sure we will do that, too. In our purpose-built life science business, available land in the 3 hot bed markets is scarce, and competition from office conversions is typically cost prohibitive. And even if such versions are completed, they do not provide the same heavy lab usability as purpose-built life science. 
In addition to our 10 million square feet of operating life science properties, we have another 5-plus million square feet available through our land bank and densification pipeline, which represents $6 billion plus of embedded accretive development spend. The majority of this consists of low-rise properties in the heart of some of the strongest life science locations in San Francisco and San Diego. Some of these assets were developed 25-plus years ago by our pioneering predecessor  states. The current market conditions and land use regulations allow for much higher FARs. This represents an enormous within our portfolio, and we will unlock this value over time. 
In our on-campus and affiliated MOB business, we currently own and operate 23 million square feet, and future typically requires invitations from hospitals and health systems. Fortunately, we have a number of strong and time-tested relationships that will allow continued future development and acquisition growth, plus we have a number of land bank opportunities. In CCRCs, we have 15 communities, each with an average of 500 units located on 50-acre parcels of infill land. Such campuses have high barriers to entry given the typical 8 to 10-year development concept to stabilization period and heavy infrastructure required to operate. And of course, we do like the high-yield produced by this asset class, which I think is quite attractive given the quality of the cash flows. 
Our 15 campuses also provide future densification opportunities, aggregating to more than $500 million. Additionally, from time to time, certain not-for-profit owners, sometimes capital constrained, may choose to exit, and we will be natural buyers if the properties meet our criteria. With consideration to all of this, it is important to note that we believe rental senior housing will continue to be a vital and growing business that serves an important need within the health care continuum. While we concluded that for Healthpeak, our more focused portfolio mix will create a strong and unique investment opportunity and one that cannot be synthetically replicated through investment in pure-play REIT alternatives given our platform, replaceable portfolios and embedded growth opportunities. 
Moving on to our dividend. Yesterday, we announced that we have adjusted our dividend in Q1 to $0.30 per share or $1.20 per share annualized. Our full year 2020 dividend payout ratio came in at 102%, and in Q4 was 106%. But we held off adjusting in prior quarters to wait for sufficient visibility into our future portfolio mix and related cash flows. We estimate the $1.20 per share annualized dividend will represent 2021 payout ratio in the high 80s to low 90s, but result in a stabilized payout ratio of around 80%, which will be our target going forward. 
Stabilized earnings will follow the completion of our SHOP and triple-net sales, ultimate reinvestment of our sales proceeds in core life science and MOB assets, and reaching the COVID inflection point for our CCRC operations. The $0.30 quarterly dividend currently represents an approximate 4% yield on our share price; and on a stabilized basis, will provide incremental positive cash flow of around $150 million per year for reinvestment into our accretive development and densification activities. 
Finally, before turning the call over to Scott, I would like to inform you that Barbat Rodgers will be leaving Healthpeak in late February for Investor Relations leadership role with a mixed-use REIT in Maryland, which is closer to our extended family on the East Coast. Barbat, your contributions have been immense and your hard work, dedication and great attitude will be missed by the entire team, and me, in particular. Andrew Johns, who most of you know well, will have his responsibilities expanded to include leadership of our Investor Relations department, in addition to his continued strategic contributions to our FP&A team. With that, let me turn it over to Scott."

I'll begin with a life science leadership update, followed by operating results for each business segment and close with transactions. I'm pleased to announce that Scott and Mike have been named Co Heads of Life Science continuing to report up to me. They have been on the ground in San Francisco and San Diego, respectively, for the past decade for Healthpeak. They will now take on broader responsibilities, including expanded roles in our development and acquisition strategy and P&L responsibility. Same with life science, we reported same-store cash NOI growth of 7.8% for the fourth quarter, an outstanding result driven by strong leasing, mark-to-market on renewals and rent collections at 99-plus percent. Sector fundamentals are strong, and we're capturing more than our fair share of the demand. 
Our full year cash NOI growth was 6.2%, exceeding the high end of our pre COVID outlook by 120 basis points and driven by the same factors as above. We executed 300,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter, including renewals at a 13% cash mark-to-market. For the full year, we executed 1.6 million square feet, which was 180% of our pre COVID expectations. Leasing was particularly strong on early renewals and our development pipeline. We continue to excel by growing with our existing biotech heavy tenant base. So far in 2021, we signed 115,000 square feet of leases and the pipeline is significant, with an additional 360,000 square feet under letters of intent. There is strong demand in all 3 of our core markets. 
Turning to medical office. We reported same-store cash NOI growth of 1.2% and 2.1% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Performance was driven by contractual rent escalators and 5.1% cash mark-to-market on renewals, partially offset by COVID related reductions in parking income. Also the addition of our small hospital portfolio to the pool, which Pete will discuss, reduced same-store results in the fourth quarter by 40 basis points. Fourth quarter and full year rent collections exceeded 99%. 
During the course of 2020, we commenced leases on approximately 3 million square feet, slightly above our pre COVID expectations. We ended the year with 90.4% occupancy, down 30 basis points from the prior quarter. The small decline was driven by moving recently completed development and redevelopment projects in the operating portfolio. In addition, we signed nearly 700,000 square feet of leases that will commence in 2021, and our leasing pipeline is solid with 560,000 square feet under letters of intent. 
Turning to CCRCs. They continue to outperform rental senior housing. Occupancy declined 100 basis points from September to December. The occupancy decline was a bit below our outlook, driven by the intensity of the third wave of the virus. CCRC performance did improve throughout the quarter, with occupancy being flat in December and the momentum carried through to January with occupancy up 20 basis points over the prior months. Notably, new entrance fee contracts in the fourth quarter increased nearly 100% in comparison to the low point in the second quarter. New entrance fees are still 30% below the prior year, but clearly heading in a positive direction. 
We're also pleased to report that all of our CCRCs have received or been scheduled for the first dose of the vaccine and are open in person tours, move-ins and visits with family. Moving to the SHOP portfolio, all of which is held for sale. Occupancy was down 170 basis points from September to December toward the low end of our outlook range. SHOP occupancy fell an additional 230 basis points in January, driven by the third wave of the virus. 
Turning to our development pipeline. In the fourth quarter, we signed leases totaling 175,000 square feet at The Shore, expanding our relationship with 2 existing tenants. Phases 2 and 3 at The Shore are now 91% pre-leased with occupancy expected in 4Q '21 and 1Q '22, respectively. The economics on the new leases were above our underwriting as life science rents in the Bay Area remained strong. Growing with our existing biotech tenant base is a competitive advantage for owners who lack the scale to accommodate the growth of their tenants. As an example, 75% of the leases we signed at the in The Shore or 1.1 million square feet of space was signed with existing Healthpeak tenants who were looking to grow. 
During the fourth quarter, we delivered 173,000 square feet of life science development, including the final building at Phase 1 of The Shore, and the final building at the Ridgeview campus in San Diego. Both developments were 100% leased upon delivery. In medical office, we continue to execute on our proprietary HA development program, delivering a 42,000 square foot building in the fourth quarter. The project is located on the campus of the Oak Hill Hospital in Florida and was 65% leased to HCA upon delivery. In total, our $1 billion active development pipeline was 68% pre-leased at year-end. 
Upon delivery and stabilization, these projects will generate significant earnings and NAV accretion. Moving to transactions. We're finding strategic ways to recycle capital into our core segments through both acquisitions and new development. In December, we closed on the previously announced off-market Cambridge Discovery Park acquisition for $664 million at a 5% stabilized cash yield and 6.5% yield. This 600,000 square foot campus enhances our #1 market share in the dynamic and growing West Cambridge submarket, which is highly convenient to Alewife Station, Route 2 and the bike. The campus also provides a future densification opportunity. 
Also in December, we acquired an off-market 5.4 acre land parcel on our Medical City Dallas campus for $33.5 million. The land currently houses a behavioral facility that is leased to HCA. Over the next few years, we expect the parcel to be developed into an inpatient and outpatient tower to accommodate HCA's growth on this world-class campus. In early February, we acquired an off-market $13 million MOB on the campus of HCA's Centennial Medical center, a leading hospital in Nashville, stabilized cash yield is 6%. 
We already own more than 600,000 square feet of highly successful MOBs on the campus, plus a large new development that delivers in 4Q '21. This campus is one of the trophies in our MOB portfolio. In senior housing, we've made tremendous progress on the previously announced sale of approximately $4 billion of SHOP and triple-net assets. We've now closed on 12 separate transactions, generating gross proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. There was wide variance by portfolio in press per unit and cap rate given the highly disparate asset quality. Importantly, overall pricing is in line with previous disclosures. 
The larger SHOP sales include a 32 property Sunrise portfolio, a 12 property Atria portfolio and a 16 property portfolio operated primarily by Atria and Capital Senior living. If we look at the entire portfolio of shop sales, both completed and under contract, the cap rate on annualized fourth quarter NOI is roughly 3%, excluding CARES Act revenue. The blended cap rate on pre COVID NOI is approximately 6%. The  larger triple-net sales include the 10 property Aegis portfolio, the 8 propery HRA portfolio and the 24 property Brookdale portfolio, in which we were relieved funding a $30 million remaining CapEx obligation. 
The blended cap rate on the aggregate triple-net portfolio, including assets currently under contract is approximately 8% on rent and in the low 5% range on property level, trailing 3-month EBITDA excluding CARES Act revenue. In the aggregate, we have provided $620 million in first mortgage seller financing to date with approximately $250 million of that amount expected to be repaid in the next few weeks. The seller financing is in the 65% loan-to-value range, with terms ranging from 1 year to 3 years and escalating rates to encourage early repayment. 
We've signed purchase agreements or letters of intent on all of our remaining SHOP and triple-net properties, representing an additional $1.5 billion in gross proceeds. These remaining asset sales do not include any material amounts of seller financing. Upon completion of the sales, our only remaining exposure to rental senior housing, be our sovereign wealth joint venture, a small handful of legacy loans and the short-term seller financing. 
With the significant asset sale proceeds, we're in great shape to continue executing on a pipeline of strategic acquisitions and new development. As an example, we are essentially out of space in South San Francisco and San Diego, so we're looking closely at our land bank and densification opportunities, and we're seeing opportunities in medical office. We expect to share more news on these activities shortly. And now over to Pete."

I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the fourth quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.41",1279,"Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the fourth quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.41 per share and blended same-store growth of 4.2%. For the full year, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.64 per share and blended same-store growth of 3.8%. Our earnings and same-store growth numbers continue to be fueled by an irreplaceable life science portfolio located in the 3 hot bed markets of San Francisco, San Diego and Boston. That is in the midst of a virtuous cycle and shows no signs of abating. 
A differentiated medical office portfolio, that is 84% on-campus, 97% affiliated and continues to outperform, producing consistent and reliable results. We have experienced headwinds in our CCRC portfolio, but we are encouraged by the successful rollout of the COVID vaccine, which should be a catalyst for improving results in the near term. There are a few reporting items I would like to mention. 
First, during the fourth quarter, all remaining triple-net and SHOP assets were sold or classified as held for sale. As a result, in accordance with GAAP, these segments are now characterized as discontinued operations. On Pages 37 to 39 of the supplemental, we have provided detailed operating results for our discontinued operations, including a reconciliation that ties back to our income statement. Second, we moved the sovereign wealth SHOP joint venture which we expect to have approximately $10 million to $20 million of pro rata annual NOI 2021 into the other nonreportable segment. Third, we moved our small hospital portfolio into the medical office segment. As a reminder, once our near-term hospital purchase options are exercised, we have only $15 million of total annual NOI. 
All of these changes are effective for the fourth quarter. And our supplemental on Page 40, we have included a pro forma table showing what our same-store results would have been before the aforementioned changes. For the full year, our pro forma blended same-store growth was positive 1%. Turning to our balance sheet. When we announced our intention to exit the SHOP and triple-net segments, we outlined a clear plan of what we intended to do in the near-term with the $4 billion of expected proceeds. At a high level, that plan included approximately $1 billion of identified acquisitions, including Cambridge Discovery Park, the Midwest MOB portfolio and the South San Francisco land acquisition. 
We discussed some amount of short-term seller financing to expedite sales. We now expect total seller financing of approximately $300 million to $400 million after incorporating an approximate $250 million repayment we expect shortly, and the balance of the proceeds would be utilized for the repayment of nearer-term debt and unidentified acquisitions to the extent we are able to match funds. Accordingly, in January, we announced the repurchase of $1.45 billion of bonds maturing in 2023 and 2024. 
In late January, through a tender offering, we closed on the repurchase of $782 million of these bonds. In late February, we will repurchase the remaining $668 million balance. With additional senior housing proceeds expected on the horizon, during the first quarter, we will likely repay another $400 million to $500 million a month. Pro forma all of our anticipated debt repayment activity, our net debt-to-EBITDA is expected to temporarily drop to approximately 5.0. This use of proceeds plan provides us with significant benefits, including: first, it is our intent to not sit on cash since it would be significantly dilutive. The debt repayment allowed us to put cash to work immediately. 
Second, the debt repayment materially enhances our already strong credit profile by improving our weighted average tenor to approximately 7.5 years and eliminating bond maturities until 2025. Third, it provides our investments team with the time necessary to reinvest the proceeds into accretive portfolio enhancing acquisitions funded with new long-term debt, bringing our leverage to approximately 5.5x. 
Turning to our 2021 guidance. As a result of where our portfolio mix stands today, we are in a position to provide earnings guidance for 2021. Before I get into the details, I did want to spend a moment level setting our approach to guidance this year. First, the near-term outlook for life science and medical office, which equals 85% of our portfolio NOI, remains as robust as it has ever been. We are seeing increased leasing demand, positive mark-to-market and continued lease-up of our development and redevelopment projects. The other 15% of our portfolio NOI, primarily our CCRCs remains challenged, but with positive trends starting to take hold with the rollout of the COVID vaccine. 
Second, there are several important variables that are extremely difficult to predict which is why we are guiding to a wider earnings range. These variables include timing of our senior housing sales, the reinvestment of sale proceeds into acquisitions and the inflection point of CCRCs and our SHOP Third, we have made the important decision to operate going forward with less leverage than we have in the past. Our target net debt-to-EBITDA is now 5.5x compared to the near 6x we constantly operated at pre COVID. The impact of this is moderately reduced earnings relative to what may be in your models. So with that as the backdrop, our 2021 guidance is as follows. FFO is adjusted ranging from $1.50 per share to $1.60 per share, blended same-store NOI ranging from 1.5% to 3%. The components of blended same-store NOI growth are life science, which is 50% of the pool, ranging from 4% to 5%; medical office, which is 47% of the pool, ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%; CCRC which is only 3% of the pool, ranging from minus 15% to minus 30%. 
In 2021, our full year same-store pool for CCRCs consists of just 2 Sunrise assets. Furthermore, a large negative decline is primarily from the significant roll down of CARES Act grants. The 13 property LCS portfolio will enter our core pool starting in the second quarter and enter our full year pool in 2022. Let me provide more color on the range of potential guidance outcomes. 
Please refer to Page 41 of the supplemental, if you would like to follow along. The low end of guidance assumes a more prolonged impact from COVID, resulting in an inflection point in CCRCs during the third quarter and no additional acquisitions beyond what we have already announced. The high end of guidance assumes an accelerated COVID recovery, resulting in an inflection point in CCRCs during the second quarter and a full redeployment of $1.5 billion of senior housing proceeds into accretive acquisitions. The major earnings variances from the low end to high-end of guidance include $10 million of earnings or approximately $0.02 a share from our same-store portfolio. $35 million of earnings or approximately $0.06 to $0.07 a share from our LCS CCRC portfolio and our sovereign wealth SHOP and $10 million of earnings or approximately $0.02 a share from the timing of accretive acquisition. 
Our assumption on the high end is we invest over $1 billion into unidentified acquisitions in the second half of the year at a 5% cash yield, funded entirely with debt, taking our net debt-to-EBITDA back to target. In closing, our 2021 guidance is based on our best information and estimates as of today. I would caution against drawing too many conclusions from the midpoint of our range as there are many puts and takes that could cause us to tighten, increase or reduce the range as circumstances dictate during the course of the year. With that, operator, please open the line for any questions."

Over the last quarter, we closed about $1 billion of really strategic acquisitions in both life science and medical office, virtually all of it off market. We added to 2 of our most successful medical office campuses with Medical City Dallas as well as Centennial in Nashville, and then, of course, the big acquisition in West Cambridge to solidify #1 market share. And then we took down some land in South San Francisco to really position us as the market leader in that important submarket really indefinitely. So we're being pretty selective about what we're acquiring, even though we do have a significant amount of proceeds from these asset sales and more coming. And we are seeing attractive opportunities. With a focus, of course, on medical office and life science, we may find 1 or 2 CCRCs, as Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks. But by paying down the debt, we've really got flexibility to wait and make sure that we find something that's particularly attractive. The team has been pretty focused on executing the senior housing sales between what's closed and what's in process. It's almost 30 separate transactions. I mean it's astounding number. Virtually, all of that done internally without relying on third-party advisers. So the team has been running pretty hard on the dispositions. But I will say that the pipeline is significant and it is attractive and it's strategic.

We've been able to find some more one-off, one at a time acquisitions that are a bit better than that. But any reasonably sized portfolio is probably going to be in that 5% to 5.5% range. Life science, it depends on the submarket, of course, but there have been some pretty sizable portfolio trades in the core markets that are more in the mid-4s for good quality product. Of course, those are big portfolios that may be traded a bit better than an individual asset. But certainly, there's a lot of interest in that sector. So cap rates certainly haven't gone up over the past 12 months, they'd probably come down a little bit, which obviously benefits the incumbent players with big portfolios. In terms of the mix of the acquisition pipeline, it really is a combination of one-off acquisitions like the ones we announced that with Medical City Dallas and Centennial, where we know an existing submarket or campus extremely well, and maybe there's 1 or 2 buildings that we don't own, and we're proactive in trying to capture that last remaining asset on a particular campus. And then there are some portfolios that we're looking at. But I don't want to say more than that in terms of the mix between the 2 business segments until we actually get them done."

We do think about $250 million of that gets paid back in the next few weeks, leaving us with plus or minus $300 million to $400 million remaining. And of the $1.5 billion of asset sales that are left and under contract, there's really not any material amount of seller financing. There'll be a bit, but nothing significant. So actually, at the end of the day, the net amount of seller financing that we're providing is a lot less than what we thought we might have to.

A few are bigger, a couple of hundred million plus, and then a bunch of smaller transactions. So it's a pretty diversified pool of assets. So the buyer pool is naturally diverse. But there are 2 common characteristics. One is it's a counterparty that we know pretty well. So it's a lot of repeat buyers, which gives us a good confidence; and then the other category is very well capitalized buyers who seem particularly motivated to get into the sector and obviously play in the 5 to 7-year IRR turnaround opportunity, and that's a good fit for the private equity groups that have done the predominant buyers. So we're far down the path. We're making good progress. If everything went well, I think we could close all of it by the end of the second quarter. But transactions are all somewhat uncertain, even in a great environment and still a pretty choppy environment for senior housing.

But Rich, I would say that, MOBs for the last decade plus have produced any on-campus affiliated type product have produced 2% to 3% same-store growth literally every year. So it's a very, very stable product, somewhat immune to new supply because it requires that invitation from hospitals and health institutions in order to be able to grow those portfolios. And then with the specialists that reside in those properties, it produces a very consistent result, where life science has been subject to some more cycles, but biology based drugs have become so explosive in recent years for the whole variety of reasons that we all know that the demand has been very strong and they're not producing any more new land in these hot bed markets. So it does feel to us like there's going to be a nice runway of continued strong demand without a lot of new supply. So we feel that there's going to be strong returns on that front. But of course, that is more volatile than MOBs. We like the fact that, that produces some diversification between those 2 asset classes. Then of course, CCRCs, which is only about 10% of our business is very different, produces a high yield, high barrier to entry, irreplaceable product, 8 to 10-year development period for new product and then the interest fee concept creates a very different -- in the IL environment, produces a very different type of to match off against our other 2 businesses.

We would never rule it out. There are other opportunities out there. But one of the things that we've used as a central tenet of our investment approach is that we believe strongly in high barrier to entry portfolios. And within the clusters that we operate in San Francisco, San Diego and Boston, it's very difficult for new participants to come in and compete effectively because biotechs really rely on that cluster concept where all that talent resides, and they can grow with a landlord, rip up 1 lease to form a larger lease in a sister property within our campus. So because we have that huge competitive benefit, we've been more inclined to stay within the 3 markets that we have this, huge competitive advantage. And we'll keep an eye on the other markets.

With the densification opportunities added to that, with a lot of 25-plus year old product built on low-rise properties in some of the best markets in San Francisco and San Diego, it definitely provides some highly accretive development and redevelopment possibilities for us. So you could certainly see us grow that we'll always take into account how much drag we want to add at any point in time. I'm a big believer in the rollover effect taking place and making sure that we've got very clear funding for whatever it is that we add to our portfolio and also look a lot of pre leasing.

I mean, as we look forward over the next 2 years in our core markets, I mean, in San Francisco, there's plus or minus 3 million square feet underway. But it's 80% pre-leased, and that's going out 24 months. So we can see pretty high confidence that anyone in the life science sector opening a building over the next 24 months is likely going to have a huge amount of success. San Diego has similar dynamics. It's a bit smaller in terms of the development pipeline. It's just a smaller market, but similar pre-leasing. And Boston is similar to San Francisco as well, a little bit lower. As you look out to 2023 and beyond, it's hard to say. There's a huge potential pipeline, but it's unclear how many of those projects would proceed, when they would proceed, when they would open. In trying to time your project so that it matches up well with the competitive supply that's coming is critically important. So any time we pull the trigger on a development, there's a pretty intense deep dive done on the local supply and demand dynamics as well as timing and submarket location, so that we feel really good about the next 2 years. Beyond that, we just have to continue to assess. I mean, it could go up, it could go down. It just depends on what the dynamics look like at the time."

Any change in RevPAR quarter-to-quarter is impacted as much by the service mix as anything because there is the full continuum of care, obviously. So change in independent living versus a change in skilled nursing has a pretty dramatic difference on the RevPAR, but we're not discounting the monthly rate or the entry fee. So we've seen continued strength there. In terms of forward looking indicators, we've grown pretty significantly off of the base in 2Q. Entrance fees in the fourth quarter were up 100% versus 2Q and up about 30% versus the third quarter. So there's good momentum. And now that all of our CCRCs have received or been scheduled for the first dose of the vaccine, that's obviously a good sign. Today, we're entirely open to move-ins in tours and family visitation, but with limits. So it still doesn't feel like the operating environment that would have existed 12 months ago. I think over the next 2 to 3 months, it will increasingly return to businesses normal as the portfolio is fully vaccinated. So we are starting to see a pickup.

If you look at the independent assisted portion of the CCRCs, the occupancy was down less than 500 basis points during COVID. So pretty dramatically better outcome than, say, rental senior housing, which was down more than 1,000 basis points, driven obviously by the length of stay. Skilled nursing was down more than 10,000 basis points. So a pretty significant decline. There's obviously a lot of short-term rehab business running through the communities, and that business got decimated early in the pandemic. Even today, our skilled nursing units in keeping only 15% of the total units at these buildings. So it's not hugely material, but it does move the needle. We're in the mid-60s as an occupancy percentage when the historical run rate is more in the mid-80. So we're comfortably above where we were in April and May, but still significantly below a stabilized level. And it bounces around. We had started to come back over the summer. And then we fell back when the virus took off again, we came back again in October, November. And then in December, we fell again as the virus picked up. And of course, once again, now in January into February, it's picking up again. So it really does follow the trend of the virus, which hopefully is a good sign, given that the numbers nationally are coming down pretty significantly and the vaccine rollout seems to be picking up some significant momentum."

And again, I'm repeating myself, but they're impossible to replace these portfolios. New supply is almost nonexistent due to the 8 to 10-year development period. And we've got this enormous embedded densification opportunities within our campuses. And you almost have to see these to fully appreciate what a high-quality CCRC looks like with 500 units sitting on 50 acres of infill land. It has a very different look and feel than what you'd expect if you haven't toured them. So it's so hard to replace. The yields are so high and we have a strong infrastructure in place. So our view that for 10% of our company at this type of a yield that it produces another element of nice diversification and one that we think we can build slowly over time. But every time we add one, it's going to be at a very nice yield. So we've continued to conclude that it is a business that we would like to own and maybe grow slowly.

And we wanted the $150 million or so of stabilized retained earnings as we went forward for reinvestment into our accretive development and densification opportunities. So those were all the different things that we discussed at length over a period of about 3/4 as we came into the decision of $1.20 per share."

I will point out that some of the revenue is up a little bit this year relative to last year. There are 2 actually important items. One, we're actually doing more spend in MOBs on green initiatives. So there'll be a nice return on that. And then two, we did slow down a little bit as well last year, just given the fact that COVID made it difficult to do some revenue-enhancing CapEx at our CCRCs. So we're projecting that, that picks up again in in 2021. And then we also do give some recurring CapEx above -- on Page 42. I won't go through all of those, but it's all lined out in there."

With the vaccination gaining more traction every day, it seems we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Yet our intense effort executing through COVID will most certainly continue for a while yet. Despite the enormous challenges of 2020 for Healthpeak, I believe we will exit the pandemic in a stronger place than where we started. More on that shortly, but first, let me temporarily digress. 
Around a year ago, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was identified in the United States and then spread insidiously across the country. Like so many companies at the time, our executive team and Board were busy determining how best to navigate the imminent crisis with consideration to its then uncertain penetration and duration on human beings and on the market. At that time, we identified 5 priorities. First, to protect the health of our teammates, residents and tenants without overwriting consideration to expense. Second, to guard our balance sheet, liquidity and credit ratings to ensure we remained rock-solid on the other side of the crisis. Third, to communicate frequently and openly with our investors, analysts and rating agencies as best we could with the facts we had at the time. Fourth, in a post COVID world, we consider key societal and market trends and determine that all of our classes of real estate would remain vital after the pandemic was resolved. And fifth, we aim to take advantage of any opportunities that might result from disruptions caused by the pandemic. 
Initially, we thought it possible there may arise distressed buying opportunities, but that never did transpire in our desired asset classes of anchored MOBs and purpose-built life science. And in fact, we saw cap rates compress rather than rise. Fortunately, that positively impacted our gross asset values for these portfolios. 
Execution on these 5 priorities turned out to be critical and guiding our path through the fog. And relative to our priority of identifying opportunities created by the crisis, we decided to test the market to determine if it might be feasible to lighten up or even exit our rental senior housing business without undue incremental dilution. That was half a year ago. So after 6 months of hard work on this plan, yesterday, we announced that during the fourth quarter and year-to-date 2021, we closed on $2.5 billion of SHOP and triple-net sales, with the remaining $1.5 billion under binding and nonbinding contracts. 
In aggregate, this $4 billion of rental senior housing sales is right on top of the estimate we provided in our Q3 earnings call. We're now very far along to a full exit of rental senior housing with some work left to do. Accordingly, we will soon be able to focus our team entirely on growing and operating our biotech centric life science and our primarily on-campus MOB portfolios, which together will soon represent 85% of our company. And additionally, we continue to hold a relatively smaller portfolio of high-quality and high-yielding CCRCs. 
Importantly and fundamental tenant to our strategy, we believe all 3 of these businesses represent irreplaceable, higher barrier to entry portfolios that are impossible to replicate and provide a strong growth trajectory based on demographic tailwinds. 
Additionally, our land bank and densification opportunities aggregate to $7 billion plus, which will keep us busy for around a decade without the need to purchase any additional land. But inevitably, I'm sure we will do that too. In our purpose-built life science business, available land in the 3 hotbed markets is scarce, and competition from office conversions is typically cost prohibitive. And even if such conversions are completed, they do not provide the same heavy lab usability as purpose-built life science.  
In addition to our 10 million square feet of operating life science properties, we have another 5-plus million square feet available through our land bank and densification pipeline, which represents $6 billion plus of embedded accretive development spend. The majority of this consists of low-rise properties in the heart of some of the strongest life science locations in San Francisco and San Diego. Some of these assets were developed 25-plus years ago by our pioneering predecessor, Slough Estates. The current market conditions and land use regulations allow for much higher FARs. This represents an enormous gem within our portfolio, and we will unlock this value over time.
In our on-campus and affiliated MOB business, we currently own and operate 23 million square feet, and future growth typically requires invitations from hospitals and health systems. Fortunately, we have a number of strong and time-tested relationships that will allow continued future development and acquisition growth, plus we have a number of land bank opportunities. In CCRCs, we have 15 communities, each with an average of 500 units located on 50-acre parcels of infill land. Such campuses have high barriers to entry given the typical 8 to 10-year development concept to stabilization period and heavy infrastructure required to operate. And of course, we do like the high-yield produced by this asset class, which I think is quite attractive given the quality of the cash flows. 
Our 15 campuses also provide future densification opportunities, aggregating to more than $500 million. Additionally, from time to time, certain not-for-profit owners, sometimes capital constrained, may choose to exit and we will be natural buyers if the properties meet our criteria. With consideration to all of this, it is important to note that we believe rental senior housing will continue to be a vital and growing business that serves an important need within the healthcare continuum. While we concluded that for Healthpeak, our more focused portfolio mix will create a strong and unique investment opportunity and one that cannot be synthetically replicated through investment in pure-play REIT alternatives given our platform, irreplaceable portfolios and embedded growth opportunities.
Moving on to our dividend. Yesterday, we announced that we have adjusted our dividend in Q1 to $0.30 per share or $1.20 per share annualized. Our full year 2020 dividend payout ratio came in at 102%, and in Q4 was 106%. But we held off adjusting in prior quarters to wait for sufficient visibility into our future portfolio mix and related cash flows. We estimate the $1.20 per share annualized dividend will represent a 2021 payout ratio in the high 80s to low 90s, but result in a stabilized payout ratio of around 80%, which will be our target going forward.
Stabilized earnings will follow the completion of our SHOP and triple-net sales, ultimate reinvestment of our sales proceeds in core life science and MOB assets, and reaching the COVID inflection point for our CCRC operations. The $0.30 quarterly dividend currently represents an approximate 4% yield on our share price; and on a stabilized basis, will provide incremental positive cash flow of around $150 million per year for reinvestment into our accretive development and densification activities. 
Finally, before turning the call over to Scott, I would like to inform you that Barbat Rodgers will be leaving Healthpeak in late February for Investor Relations leadership role with a mixed-use REIT in Maryland, which is closest to our extended family on the East Coast. Barbat, your contributions have been immense and your hard work, dedication and great attitude will be missed by the entire team, and me, in particular. Andrew Johns, who most of you know well, will have his responsibilities expanded to include leadership of our Investor Relations department, in addition to his continued strategic contributions to our FP&A team. With that, let me turn it over to Scott."

I'll begin with a life science leadership update, followed by operating results for each business segment and close with transactions. I'm pleased to announce that Scott Bohn and Mike Dorris have been named co-heads of life science continuing to report up to me. They have been on the ground in San Francisco and San Diego, respectively, for the past decade for Healthpeak. They will now take on broader responsibilities, including expanded roles in our development and acquisition strategy and P&L responsibility. Same with life science, we reported same-store cash NOI growth of 7.8% for the fourth quarter, an outstanding result driven by strong leasing, mark-to-market on renewals and rent collections at 99-plus percent. Sector fundamentals are strong, and we're capturing more than our fair share of the demand. 
Our full year cash NOI growth was 6.2%, exceeding the high end of our pre-COVID outlook by 120 basis points and driven by the same factors as above. We executed 300,000 square feet of leases in the fourth quarter, including renewals at a 13% cash mark-to-market. For the full year, we executed 1.6 million square feet, which was 180% of our pre-COVID expectations. Leasing was particularly strong on early renewals and our development pipeline. We continue to excel by growing with our existing biotech heavy tenant base. So far in 2021, we signed 115,000 square feet of leases and the pipeline is significant with an additional 360,000 square feet under letters of intent. There is strong demand in all 3 of our core markets. 
Turning to medical office. We reported same-store cash NOI growth of 1.2% and 2.1% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Performance was driven by contractual rent escalators and 5.1% cash mark-to-market on renewals, partially offset by COVID related reductions in parking income. Also the addition of our small hospital portfolio to the pool, which Pete will discuss, reduced same-store results in the fourth quarter by 40 basis points. Fourth quarter and full year rent collections exceeded 99%.
During the course of 2020, we commenced leases on approximately 3 million square feet, slightly above our pre-COVID expectations. We ended the year with 90.4% occupancy, down 30 basis points from the prior quarter. The small decline was driven by moving recently completed development and redevelopment projects into the operating portfolio. In addition, we signed nearly 700,000 square feet of leases that will commence in 2021, and our leasing pipeline is solid with 560,000 square feet under letters of intent. 
Turning to CCRCs. They continue to outperform rental senior housing. Occupancy declined 100 basis points from September to December. The occupancy decline was a bit below our outlook, driven by the intensity of the third wave of the virus. CCRC performance did improve throughout the quarter, with occupancy being flat in December and the momentum carried through to January with occupancy of 20 basis points over the prior months. Notably, new entrance fee contracts in the fourth quarter increased nearly 100% in comparison to the low point in the second quarter. New entrance fees are still 30% below the prior year, but clearly heading in a positive direction. 
We're also pleased to report that all of our CCRCs have received or been scheduled for the first dose of the vaccine and are open in person tours, move-ins and visits with family. Moving to the SHOP portfolio, all of which is held for sale. Occupancy was down 170 basis points from September to December toward the low end of our outlook range. SHOP occupancy fell an additional 230 basis points in January, driven by the third wave of the virus. 
Turning to our development pipeline. In the fourth quarter, we signed leases totaling 175,000 square feet at The Shore, expanding our relationship with 2 existing tenants. Phases 2 and 3 at The Shore are now 91% pre-leased with occupancy expected in 4Q '21 and 1Q '22, respectively. The economics on the new leases were above our underwriting as life science rents in the Bay Area remained strong. Growing with our existing biotech heavy tenant base is a competitive advantage for owners who lack the scale to accommodate the growth of their tenants. As an example, 75% of the leases we signed at The Cove and The Shore or 1.1 million square feet of space was signed with existing Healthpeak tenants who were looking to grow. 
During the fourth quarter, we delivered 173,000 square feet of life science development, including the final building at Phase 1 of The Shore, and the final building at the Ridgeview campus in San Diego. Both developments were 100% leased upon delivery. In medical office, we continue to execute on our proprietary HA development program, delivering a 42,000 square foot building in the fourth quarter. The project is located on the campus of the Oak Hill Hospital in Florida and was 65% leased to HCA upon delivery. In total, our $1 billion active development pipeline was 68% pre-leased at year-end. 
Upon delivery and stabilization, these projects will generate significant earnings and NAV accretion. Moving to transactions. We're finding strategic ways to recycle capital into our core segments through both acquisitions and new development. In December, we closed on the previously announced off-market Cambridge Discovery Park acquisition for $664 million at a 5% stabilized cash yield and 6.5% GAAP yield. This 600,000 square foot campus enhances our #1 market share in the dynamic in growing the West Cambridge submarket, which is highly convenient to Alewife Station, Route 2 and the Minuteman Bikeway. The campus also provides a future densification opportunity. 
Also in December, we acquired an off-market 5.4 acre land parcel on our Medical City Dallas campus for $33.5 million. The land currently houses a behavioral facility that is leased to HCA. Over the next few years, we expect the parcel to be developed into an inpatient and outpatient tower to accommodate HCA's growth on this world-class campus. In early February, we acquired an off-market $13 million MOB on the campus of HCA's Centennial Medical Center, a leading hospital in Nashville, and stabilized cash yield is 6%. 
We already own more than 600,000 square feet of highly successful MOBs on the campus, plus a large new development that delivers in 4Q '21. This campus is one of the trophies in our MOB portfolio. In senior housing, we've made tremendous progress on the previously announced sale of approximately $4 billion of SHOP and triple-net assets. We've now closed on 12 separate transactions, generating gross proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. There was wide variance by portfolio in price per unit and cap rate given the highly disparate asset quality. Importantly, overall pricing is in line at previous disclosures. 
The larger SHOP sales include a 32 property Sunrise portfolio, a 12 property Atria portfolio and a 16 property portfolio operated primarily by Atria and Capital Senior Living. If we look at the entire portfolio of shop sales, both completed and under contract, the cap rate on annualized fourth quarter NOI is roughly 3%, excluding CARES Act revenue. The blended cap rate on pre-COVID NOI is approximately 6%. The  larger triple-net sales include the 10 property Aegis portfolio, the 8 propery HRA portfolio and the 24 property Brookdale portfolio, in which we were relieved funding a $30 million remaining CapEx obligation. 
The blended cap rate on the aggregate triple-net portfolio, including assets currently under contract is approximately 8% on rent and in the low 5% range on property level, trailing 3-month EBITDA excluding CARES Act revenue. In the aggregate, we have provided $620 million in first mortgage seller financing to date with approximately $250 million of that amount expected to be repaid in the next few weeks. The seller financing is in the 65% loan-to-value range, with terms ranging from 1 year to 3 years and escalating rates to encourage early repayment. 
We've signed purchase agreements or letters of intent on all of our remaining SHOP and triple-net properties, representing an additional $1.5 billion in gross proceeds. These remaining asset sales do not include any material amounts of seller financing. Upon completion of the sales, our only remaining exposure to rental senior housing, be our sovereign wealth joint venture, a small handful of legacy loans and the short-term seller financing. 
With the significant asset sale proceeds, we're in great shape to continue executing on a pipeline of strategic acquisitions and new development. As an example, we are essentially out of space in South San Francisco and San Diego, so we're looking closely at our land bank and densification opportunities, and we're seeing opportunities in medical office. We expect to share more news on these activities shortly. And now over to Pete."

I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the fourth quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.41",1280,"Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the fourth quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.41 per share and blended same-store growth of 4.2%. For the full year, we reported FFO as adjusted of $1.64 per share and blended same-store growth of 3.8%. Our earnings and same-store growth numbers continue to be fueled by an irreplaceable life science portfolio located in the 3 hotbed markets of San Francisco, San Diego and Boston. That is in the midst of a virtuous cycle and shows no signs of abating.
A differentiated medical office portfolio, that is 84% on-campus, 97% affiliated and continues to outperform, producing consistent and reliable results. We have experienced headwinds in our CCRC portfolio, but we are encouraged by the successful rollout of the COVID vaccine, which should be a catalyst for improving results in the near term. There are a few reporting items I would like to mention. 
First, during the fourth quarter, all remaining triple-net and SHOP assets were sold or classified as held for sale. As a result, in accordance with GAAP, these segments are now characterized as discontinued operations. On Pages 37 to 39 of the supplemental, we have provided detailed operating results for our discontinued operations, including a reconciliation that ties back to our income statement. Second, we moved the sovereign wealth SHOP joint venture which we expect to have approximately $10 million to $20 million of pro rata annual NOI 2021 into the other nonreportable segment. Third, we moved our small hospital portfolio into the medical office segment. As a reminder, once our near-term hospital purchase options are exercised, we have only $15 million of total annual NOI. 
All of these changes are effective for the fourth quarter. And our supplemental on Page 40, we have included a pro forma table showing what our same-store results would have been before the aforementioned changes. For the full year, our pro forma blended same-store growth was positive 1%. Turning to our balance sheet. When we announced our intention to exit the SHOP and triple-net segments, we outlined a clear plan of what we intended to do in the near-term with the $4 billion of expected proceeds. At a high level, that plan included approximately $1 billion of identified acquisitions, including Cambridge Discovery Park, the Midwest MOB portfolio and the South San Francisco land acquisition. 
We discussed some amount of short-term seller financing to expedite sales. We now expect total seller financing of approximately $300 million to $400 million after incorporating an approximate $250 million repayment we expect shortly, and the balance of the proceeds would be utilized for the repayment of nearer-term debt and unidentified acquisitions to the extent we are able to match funds. Accordingly, in January, we announced the repurchase of $1.45 billion of bonds maturing in 2023 and 2024.
In late January, through a tender offering, we closed on the repurchase of $782 million of these bonds. In late February, we will repurchase the remaining $668 million balance. With additional senior housing proceeds expected on the horizon, during the first quarter, we will likely repay another $400 million to $500 million a month. Pro forma all of our anticipated debt repayment activity, our net debt-to-EBITDA is expected to temporarily drop to approximately 5.0x. This use of proceeds plan provides us with significant benefits, including: first, it is our intent to not sit on debt cash since it would be significantly dilutive. The debt repayment allowed us to put cash to work immediately. Second, the debt repayment materially enhances our already strong credit profile by improving our weighted average tenor to approximately 7.5 years and eliminating bond maturities until 2025. Third, it provides our investments team with the time necessary to reinvest the proceeds into accretive portfolio enhancing acquisitions funded with new long-term debt, bringing our leverage to approximately 5.5x. 
Turning to our 2021 guidance. As a result of where our portfolio mix stands today, we are in a position to provide earnings guidance for 2021. Before I get into the details, I did want to spend a moment level-setting our approach to guidance this year. First, the near-term outlook for life science and medical office, which equals 85% of our portfolio NOI, remains as robust as it has ever been. We are seeing increased leasing demand, positive mark-to-market and continued lease-up of our development and redevelopment projects. The other 15% of our portfolio NOI, primarily our CCRCs remains challenged, but with positive trends starting to take hold with the rollout of the COVID vaccine. 
Second, there are several important variables that are extremely difficult to predict which is why we are guiding to a wider earnings range. These variables include timing of our senior housing sales, the reinvestment of sale proceeds into acquisitions and the inflection point of CCRCs and our SHOP JV. Third, we have made the important decision to operate going forward with less leverage than we have in the past. Our target net debt-to-EBITDA is now 5.5x compared to the near 6x we constantly operated at pre COVID. The impact of this has moderately reduced earnings relative to what may be in your models. So with that as the backdrop, our 2021 guidance is as follows. FFO as adjusted ranging from $1.50 per share to $1.60 per share, blended same-store NOI ranging from 1.5% to 3%. The components of blended same-store NOI growth are life science, which is 50% of the pool, ranging from 4% to 5%; medical office, which is 47% of the pool, ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%; CCRC which is only 3% of the pool, ranging from minus 15% to minus 30%. 
In 2021, our full year same-store pool for CCRCs consists of just 2 Sunrise assets. Furthermore, a large negative decline is primarily from the significant roll down of CARES Act grants. The 13 property LCS portfolio will enter our quarterly pool starting in the second quarter and enter our full year pool in 2022. Let me provide more color on the range of potential guidance outcomes.
Please refer to Page 41 of the supplemental, if you would like to follow along. The low end of guidance assumes a more prolonged impact from COVID, resulting in an inflection point in CCRCs during the third quarter and no additional acquisitions beyond what we have already announced. The high end of guidance assumes an accelerated COVID recovery, resulting in an inflection point in CCRCs during the second quarter and a full redeployment of $1.5 billion of senior housing proceeds into accretive acquisitions. The major earnings variances from the low end to high-end of guidance include $10 million of earnings or approximately $0.02 a share from our same-store portfolio. $35 million of earnings or approximately $0.06 to $0.07 a share from our LCS CCRC portfolio and our sovereign wealth SHOP JV. And $10 million of earnings or approximately $0.02 a share from the timing of accretive acquisition. 
Our assumption on the high end is we invest over $1 billion into unidentified acquisitions in the second half of the year at a 5% cash yield, funded entirely with debt, taking our net debt-to-EBITDA back to target. In closing, our 2021 guidance is based on our best information and estimates as of today. I would caution against drawing too many conclusions from the midpoint of our range as there are many puts and takes that could cause us to tighten, increase or reduce the range as circumstances dictate during the course of the year. With that, operator, please open the line for any questions."

Over the last quarter, we closed about $1 billion of really strategic acquisitions in both life science and medical office, virtually all of it off market. We added to 2 of our most successful medical office campuses with Medical City Dallas as well as Centennial in Nashville, and then, of course, the big acquisition in West Cambridge to solidify #1 market share. And then we took down some land in South San Francisco to really position us as the market leader in that important submarket really indefinitely. So we're being pretty selective about what we're acquiring, even though we do have a significant amount of proceeds from these asset sales and more coming. And we are seeing attractive opportunities. With a focus, of course, on medical office and life science, we may find 1 or 2 CCRCs, as Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks. But by paying down the debt, we've really got flexibility to wait and make sure that we find something that's particularly attractive. The team has been pretty focused on executing the senior housing sales between what's closed and what's in process. It's almost 30 separate transactions. I mean, it's an astounding number. Virtually, all of that done internally without relying on third-party advisers. So the team has been running pretty hard on the dispositions. But I will say that the pipeline is significant and it is attractive and it's strategic. There is some development, including activating land bank opportunities that we're looking closely at, but we do expect there will be some acquisitions. But we usually prefer to wait until those are closed before we actually talk about them in detail. Tom, anything you'd add to that?"

We've been able to find some more one-off, one at a time acquisitions that are a bit better than that. But any reasonably sized portfolio is probably going to be in that 5% to 5.5% range. Life science, it depends on the submarket, of course, but there have been some pretty sizable portfolio trades in the core markets that are more in the mid-4s for good quality product. Of course, those are big portfolios that may be traded a bit better than an individual asset. But certainly, there's a lot of interest in that sector. So cap rates certainly haven't gone up over the past 12 months, they'd probably come down a little bit, which obviously benefits the incumbent players with big portfolios. In terms of the mix of the acquisition pipeline, it really is a combination of one-off acquisitions like the ones we announced that with Medical City Dallas and Centennial, where we know an existing submarket or campus extremely well, and maybe there's 1 or 2 buildings that we don't own, and we're proactive in trying to capture that last remaining asset on a particular campus. And then there are some portfolios that we're looking at. But I don't want to say more than that in terms of the mix between the 2 business segments until we actually get them done."

We do think about $250 million of that gets paid back in the next few weeks, leaving us with plus or minus $300 million to $400 million remaining. And of the $1.5 billion of asset sales that are left and under contract, there's really not any material amount of seller financing. There'll be a bit, but nothing significant. So actually, at the end of the day, the net amount of seller financing that we're providing is a lot less than what we thought we might have to. And we really did provide it so that we could get to a commitment in a closing sooner than later because some of the portfolios are just more challenging to finance.

More than half of that is a PSA and the balance is an offer letter. And the makeup of the buyer pool is diverse because more than 15 separate transactions. A few are bigger, a couple of hundred million plus, and then a bunch of smaller transactions. So it's a pretty diversified pool of assets. So the buyer pool is naturally diverse. But there are 2 common characteristics. One is, it's a counterparty that we know pretty well. So it's a lot of repeat buyers, which gives us a good confidence. And then the other category is very well capitalized buyers who seem particularly motivated to get into the sector and obviously play in the 5 to 7-year IRR turnaround opportunity, and that's a good fit for the private equity groups that have done the predominant buyers. So we're far down the path. We're making good progress. If everything went well, I think we could close all of it by the end of the second quarter. But transactions are all somewhat uncertain, even in a great environment and still pretty choppy environment for senior housing.

But Rich, I would say that, MOBs for the last decade-plus have produced any on-campus affiliated type product have produced 2% to 3% same-store growth literally every year. So it's a very, very stable product, somewhat immune to new supply because it requires that invitation from hospitals and health institutions in order to be able to grow those portfolios. And then with the specialists that reside in those properties, it produces a very consistent result, whereas life science has been subject to some more cycles, but biology based drugs have become so explosive in recent years for the whole variety of reasons that we all know that the demand has been very strong and they're not producing any more new land in these hotbed markets. So it does feel to us like there's going to be a nice runway of continued strong demand without a lot of new supply. So we feel that there's going to be strong returns on that front. But of course, that is more volatile than MOBs. We like the fact that, that produces some diversification between those 2 asset classes. Then of course, CCRCs, which is only about 10% of our business is very different, produces a high yield, high barrier to entry, irreplaceable product, 8 to 10-year development period for new product and then the interest fee concept creates a very different -- in the IL environment, produces a very different type of portfolio to match off against our other 2 businesses. So we like the way the 3 come together.

With the densification opportunities added to that, with a lot of 25-plus-year-old product built on low-rise properties in some of the best markets in San Francisco and San Diego, it definitely provides some highly accretive development and redevelopment possibilities for us. So you could certainly see us grow that. We'll always take into account how much drag we want to add at any point in time. I'm a big believer in the rollover effect taking place and making sure that we've got very clear funding for whatever it is that we add to our portfolio and also looked a lot at pre leasing.

But it's 80% pre-leased, and that's going out 24 months. So we can see the pretty high confidence that anyone in the life science sector opening a building over the next 24 months is likely going to have a huge amount of success. San Diego has similar dynamics. It's a bit smaller in terms of the development pipeline. It's just a smaller market, but similar pre leasing. And Boston is similar to San Francisco as well, a little bit lower. As you look out to 2023 and beyond, it's hard to say. There's a huge potential pipeline, but it's unclear how many of those projects would proceed, when they would proceed, when they would open. In trying to time your project so that it matches up well with the competitive supply that's coming is critically important. So any time we pull the trigger on a development, there's a pretty intense deep dive done on the local supply and demand dynamics as well as timing and submarket location, so that we feel really good about the next 2 years. Beyond that, we just have to continue to assess. I mean, it could go up, it could go down. It just depends on what the dynamics look like at the time."

Entrance fees in the fourth quarter were up 100% versus 2Q and up about 30% versus the third quarter. So there's good momentum. And now that all of our CCRCs have received or been scheduled for the first dose of the vaccine, that's obviously a good sign. Today, we're entirely open to move-ins and tours and family visitation, but with limits. So it still doesn't feel like the operating environment that would have existed 12 months ago.

So pretty dramatically better outcome than, say, rental senior housing which was down more than 1,000 basis points, driven obviously by the length of stay. Skilled nursing was down more than 2,000 basis points. So a pretty significant decline. There's obviously a lot of short-term rehab business running through the communities, and that business got decimated early in the pandemic. Even today, our skilled nursing units in keeping only 15% of the total units at these buildings. So it's not hugely material, but it does move the needle. We're in the mid-60s as an occupancy percentage when the historical run rate is more in the mid-80. So we're comfortably above where we were in April and May, but still significantly below a stabilized level. And it bounces around. We had started to come back over the summer. And then we fell back when the virus took off again, we came back again in October, November. And then in December, we fell again as the virus picked up.

One, we're actually doing more spend in MOBs on green initiatives. So there'll be a nice return on that.

On the call with me today are Scott Brinker, our President and CIO; and Pete Scott, our CFO. Also on the line and available for the Q&A portion of the call are Tom Klaritch, our COO; and Troy McHenry, our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel. 
We had a strong start to the year and continued executing on all aspects of the plan we communicated over the past few quarters. Let me hit the high points. Our operations across all 3 of our core businesses were ahead of expectations. We closed on an additional $1 billion of rental senior housing sales and have over $400 million of additional sales under hard or soft contract. 
We completed proprietary acquisitions of $422 million of on-campus or affiliated MOBs with another $150 million under fixed price purchase option. Also, we have a strong pipeline for additional off-market acquisitions. Our development pipeline progress and projected deliveries and pre-leasing remained favorable. And as we previously announced, we added 1 new developed from our land bank in South San Francisco and a densification development start in Torrey Pines, San Diego, and are already seeing strong leasing in interest in both. 
As we alluded to last quarter, yesterday, we announced an additional tender for $550 million of bonds. Our decade-long ESG commitment continues to produce notable achievements. Later this month, we look forward to publishing our tenth annual ESG report. And given our operational progress, transaction timing and stronger-than-expected trends, we raised our FFO as adjusted guidance by a couple of pennies at the midpoint and same-store guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint. Everything is progressing very well. 
Brinker and Pete will provide the details. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker."

I'll start with operating results, then provide an update on senior housing sales and with investments. In life science, we're very well positioned with our footprint, relationships and strong industry fundamentals. We reported 8.5% same-store cash NOI growth in the first quarter, driven by rent escalators, higher occupancy and mark-to-market on renewals. The results were above our internal expectations as we saw an acceleration of leasing activity and rental rates across the Bay Area, San Diego and Boston, which comprise 97% of our life science NOI. Our momentum continued into April as we signed 290,000 square feet of leases with another 310,000 currently under letter of intent. 
Turning to medical office. Same-store cash NOI grew 2.1% in the first quarter, driven by rent escalators, 2% cash mark-to-market on renewals and favorable expenses. The results exceeded our internal forecast for the quarter. Leasing demand remains robust. Over 615,000 square feet of leases commenced in the first quarter, including more than 500,000 square feet on renewals, contributing to a trailing 12-month retention rate of 80%. We're seeing the benefit of our digital marketing initiatives as MOB virtual tours have increased dramatically. Our digital tour technology in all 3 business segments will benefit the platform long after COVID is behind us. 
Turning to CCRCs. The inflection point occurred sooner than we expected as occupancy across the portfolio increased 10 basis points from December to March and an additional 40 basis points in April. The trends are encouraging, especially at LCS, where the first quarter exceeded 2019 levels and tours increased by nearly 70%, driven in part by our digital marketing initiatives. 
Entry fee sales are up 80% from the low point in 2Q '20. The effective vaccine rollout and a strong housing market support continued improvement. Same-store cash NOI growth was negative 16.5% for the quarter driven by year-over-year occupancy declines from COVID. The first quarter pool consists of just 2 properties, which limits the usefulness of the metric. As the LCS properties entered the pool starting in 2Q and a quarterly same-store result will become more representative. The fiscal year pool will remain just the 2 Sunrise properties in 2021. 
Moving to senior housing dispositions. We closed on an additional $1 billion since our last earnings call. We signed purchase agreements or letters of intent on all of our remaining SHOP and triple-net properties with the closing time lines driven by licensure and debt assumption. The majority are under hard contracts with money at risk, and we continue to evaluate our sovereign wealth joint venture alongside our partners. 
Overall pricing remains in line with previous disclosures. The most recent $1 billion of SHOP assets were sold a 2.6% cap rate on annualized trailing 3-month NOI, excluding CARES Act revenue, and a 4.9% cap rate on pre-COVID NOI. With the vast majority of the asset sales now behind us, we're able to shift nearly 100% of our transaction focus to strategic investments in our 3 core business segments, and advancing our densification opportunities. 
For example, with our life science occupancy in the high 90s, we announced in March the commencement of the $159 million Nexus development in South San Francisco and the $135 million Callan Ridge densification in Torrey Pines. Both projects have generated significant interest from tenants before we started to dig foundations. We also completed development at 75 Hayden and Lexington, the campus sits strategically at the intersection of Route 128 and 2 and now totals more than 600,000 square feet across 3 buildings that are 100% leased. We continue to advance our shadow development and densification pipeline. 
In April, we closed on the first phase of the previously announced acquisition of land on Forbes Boulevard in the heart of South San Francisco. The remaining parcels of that acquisition should close later this year. Combined with our existing holdings, we branded the 20-acre site under the new name of Vantage. The project will become a highly prominent phased development totaling 1 million square feet or more. 
Demand in South San Francisco remains robust, and we hold a dominant position in the submarket, controlling nearly 50% of the landlord owned lab inventory. We have the ability to double our footprint in the submarket over time through our existing land bank and densification opportunities. Moving to acquisitions. We've been active in medical office, finding attractive opportunities to redeploy senior housing sale proceeds. All of the acquisitions I'll describe today were done on a proprietary basis through relationships. 
In some cases, we effectively executed asset swaps and with the same counterparty, trading senior housing assets for life science and medical office, which eliminated our risk around execution, timing and tax on more than $2 billion of transactions. In April, we acquired a 14-property MOB portfolio with 833,000 square feet for $371 million. The portfolio is 100% on campus or affiliated with a 7-year weighted average lease term. 
The acquisition expands and/or creates relationships with leading regional health systems, including Bon Secours in Virginia; Inova in Washington, D.C.; North Shore in Chicago; HCA in Los Angeles and Fairview in Minneapolis. The year 1 cash cap rate is 5.2%. There's occupancy upside at several other properties, so the stabilized cap rate is in the high 5s. 
Stepping back, 1 unique aspect of Healthpeak across all 3 business segments is our campus model, where we have significant scale in a single location, and we're strategically adding to 3 of our most important MOB campuses. You'll recall that we recently acquired a 5.4 acre parcel at Medical City Dallas that will support up to 1 million square feet of expansion, which is on top of the existing 2.1 million square feet that we already own. And in February, we acquired a 6% stabilized cap rate, a 48,000 square foot MOB on the Centennial Campus in Nashville, including our development that delivers in the fourth quarter, helped people own 830,000 square feet across 9 MOBs on this market-leading campus. 
And most recently, in April, we acquired for a 5.5% stabilized cap rate, a recently developed 80,000 square foot MOB located on the market-leading Sky Ridge Hospital campus in Denver. This brings our ownership at the campus to 420,000 square feet. Our acquisition pipeline is sizable as well, including an option agreement for $150 million of MOBs with strong health system affiliation. 
We're in a good position to capitalize on these opportunities, which is a good segue to to cover financial results and the balance sheet."

I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. The first quarter, we reported FFO as ad",787,"Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. The first quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.40 per share and blended same-store growth of 4.3%. In addition, on April 29, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share, representing a payout ratio of approximately 88% for the first quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.4x, in line with our expectations. As previously announced, we intended to use a portion of our senior housing disposition proceeds to repay near-term debt. As such, during the first quarter, we completed the repayment of $1.45 billion of bonds maturing in 2023 and 2024. Yesterday, we announced the tender offer to purchase up to $550 million of 2025 bonds, allowing us to minimize dilution from sitting on debt cash and further improve our balance sheet. 
Pro forma for the $550 million repayment, our weighted average maturity improves to 6.5 years. With our senior housing dispositions now largely complete, we are not planning any further bond repayments beyond the $2 billion that has been completed or announced. Turning to our guidance. As Tom and Scott mentioned, we have started the year on a strong note with all of our segments performing above our initial expectations. As a result, we have made the decision to increase our guidance as follows: FFO adjusted revised from $1.50 to $1.60 per share to $1.53 to $1.61 per share, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint. Blended same-store NOI growth revised from 1.5% to 3% to 1.75% to 3.25%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint. 
Let me spend a minute level setting all the major components of our revised guidance. First, we see an increase in FFO of roughly $0.01 to $0.02 from improved performance across all 3 of our segments, which impacts both the low and high end of our guidance range. 
In life science, as Scott mentioned, we had a very strong first quarter. As a result, we have increased our full year same-store range to 4.5% to 5.5%, an increase of 50 basis points. We do expect some modest deceleration as the year progresses, plus we proactively terminated an 80,000 square foot lease at our Redwood City campus to allow an existing tenant to grow within our portfolio. The positive rent mark-to-market is over 40%, but as a result of downtime, it will negatively impact 2021 same-store results by 75 basis points. However, it provides a significant earnings and same-store benefit to 2022 and beyond. 
In medical office, we have started the year with stronger-than-expected leasing with demand for outpatient elective procedures continuing to improve. We had originally expected a more challenging first quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comp. Based on the first quarter performance exceeding our forecast, we have increased our full year same-store range to 1.75% to 2.75%, an increase of 25 basis points. 
In CCRCs, with the success of the vaccine rollout and 100% of our properties open to new we are beginning to see improved performance. Recent occupancy trends are favorable, expenses have moderated, and we are seeing an uptick in entrance fees. As a result, we have increased the midpoint of our LCS portfolio guidance range by $7.5 million and tightened the range. While there are still a lot of moving pieces, if the trends we are seeing continue to ramp at the current pace, perhaps we are still a bit conservative with our forecast, and we will assess as the year progresses. 
Second, we see an increase in FFO roughly $0.01 to $0.02 from the timing and amount of acquisition activity from the reinvestment of sale proceeds. We have increased the lower end of our acquisition guidance to $700 million, an increase of $550 million. As a reminder, our plan assumed funding all acquisition activity with newly issued debt, bringing net debt to EBITDA back to our target of 5.5x at the high end. For now, we have kept the high end of our acquisition assumptions unchanged, although our pipeline has been building, so stay tuned. 
Third, Interest rates have ticked up a bit, so we have increased our expected issuance rate to 2.75%, an increase of 25 basis points from our prior assumption. One last item before Q&A. With our portfolio repositioning winding down, we completed a comprehensive review of our supplemental and realigned our disclosures to the current portfolio. On Page 40 of the supplemental, we have provided a table summarizing the key additions.

But the 2 most recent additions to our development pipeline from the land bank, Callan Ridge, which is really a densification as well. We're underwriting an 8-plus percent yield on that. Now that's helped by the fact that we've owned the land for a long time and are able to significantly densify that site. I mean, at current market value for the land, the return on cost is probably 4% to 6% range, just realistically from trades we've seen recently. And that project will start probably in the third quarter of this year. We still have a couple of tenants in the existing building through June. The second project that we recently announced is Nexus in South San Francisco and the underwritten yield there is a little bit lower, although certainly still higher than what we would achieve if we had to pay current market value for the land. In that project, we had the strength in existing building. So that's now complete. We'll start construction soon. It's obviously shovel-ready site now and should deliver probably early first or second quarter of 2023. So we feel really good about both projects given the supply/demand dynamics. And if anything, there's probably some upside in the yields versus what we've disclosed today, we're giving a lot of interest on both sides. And then in terms of what could come next, the land bank intensification opportunity exceeds 5 million square feet on land that we already control. The 2 highest priorities are probably the 2 shovel-ready land sites, 1 in South San Francisco, 1 in Sorrento Mesa in San Diego. That totals about 500,000 square feet. Both of those sites are essentially shovel-ready. And we could start those really at our discretion. And if we start seeing significant momentum on the other projects that we just commenced, it may be that We go ahead and start those as well, but we haven't made any final decisions. Tom, anything you'd add?"

And that's land at market, which has become very competitive, as I think everybody knows. But regardless how we think about it is we can certainly make money at 150 basis point plus spread, it produces a couple of hundred basis points spread to our year 1 funding costs. It's probably 25% to 30% accretive to NAV when you think about the yields versus the cap rates in those markets. But you really need that to compensate for the drag and the risk that's encountered with development. But the significant advantage that we have is we've got a good-sized land bank and even a much bigger densification pipeline that will create really strong land in very well-positioned locations in the 3 core markets over the next decade."

So I would say from a revolver perspective, we feel quite good about where we are from a floating rate debt and the amount that's outstanding on the revolver.

So about $800 million of capacity from an acquisition perspective. So hopefully, that's helpful. And happy to take it off line, I don't know if you have any additional questions on that."

So we're currently seeing transaction opportunities in both of the major sectors of life science and MOBs. The market for purpose-built lab and well-located land in the core markets for life science has been driving very strong pricing, as I'm sure you've all seen, which has caused us to stand down on a lot of the auction deals or maybe all the auction deals that we've looked at. However, this is in our view, plus for us is we have the embedded densification opportunities given our premium land locations. So that just really increases the value of those opportunities in that land given we've got about a decade run on that side. Well, if I look to MOBs for the high-quality MOBs, it's also been quite competitive and challenging, especially in the auction markets. But all the completed deals that we have done have been off-market as of the past several months. And our acquisition pipeline is entirely relationship driven. So we feel quite good on that front. So yes, there's a lot of competition out there, Jordan, but I think we've got a position where when we think about build versus buy in each of our 3 major segments with life science being primarily build given our land bank and the value-add opportunities that we have, MOBs, it's a blend of buy and build, as long as their relationship-based deals where the health service companies value our partnership to help them achieve their objectives, which has been building on that for 30 years. And then CCRCs, it's more generally buy versus build given the typical 8- to 10-year from inception development and stabilization period. We're a natural counterparty for those that are capital constrained and want to find a capital partner and it creates a great yield for us. And we've also got some densification in our CCRC campuses that sum up to about $0.5 billion over time, where the delivery is reduced to probably about 3 years in the land free. So if I was to just summarize all those components in 1 remark that, that would probably be it."

And we are expecting that the improvement that we saw in the first quarter, but then in particular, in April, will continue. So that might lead you to believe that there's a lot of upside in the NOI and maybe there is. But in the first quarter, we did have some expenses that were quite a bit lower than we thought, including bad debt and insurance and even labor. So we wanted to maintain a little bit of conservatism just to make sure we understood exactly how expenses would shake out the balance of the year. And the other thing is that the merit increases for the workers tends to be on April 1. So that number is obviously meaningful and that will impact the balance of the year in 2021.

So I think it's reasonable to say that we're buying from sophisticated sellers who aren't going to accept a big discount. I know we wouldn't if we were on the opposite side of the table. So I don't know that the valuation is some material discount to fair market value. The way we think about it more is that you're able to create a transaction and customize it in a way that really makes sense for both parties. We're able to ensure that there's a relationship going forward with the particular health system, in the case of medical office buildings. So maybe at the margin, there's a slight valuation difference between an auction and an off-market transaction. I think it's more of the softer points that ultimately are probably more important than the hard points on an acquisition that really drive, in our view, the differences between doing things on a proprietary basis versus an auction."

In some cases, it's building more independent cottages or high-rise. In some cases, it's actually building out a full continuum of care if a particular campus happens to lack assisted living or lack memory care. So it's a combination of things across.

And then if you look, quite frankly, on-campus has always outperformed off-campus in a number of our key growth metrics. We did a study recently, looked at over 300 of our properties over a 10-year period, and it was pretty consistent, that on-campus outperformed. Off-campus adjacent, which are fairly close to the hospital, also did quite well.

So that should continue. The mark-to-market in the portfolio is somewhere in the 15% range. That's probably a bit conservative given how much rents have continued to run. And with current vacancy across all 3 markets being so low, it's certainly possible that rents will continue growing much faster than our escalator, which they have for, I don't know, at least 5 years in a row.

It's been kind of an odd year with construction pricing due to the pandemic. Things were rolling along and then the pandemic hit and construction kind of ground to a halt, created an abundance of construction supplies out there, production ramp down. Pricing was actually relatively flat to down a little bit during the pandemic. And then at year-end, just as quickly things ramp back up, production had been shut down. So what we're seeing is pretty high demand for certain of the basic materials out there, steel, lumber, all have had significant increases because of that. But we've had other cost categories that, quite frankly, have been relatively flat. Cement is around 1% increases. Lighting fixtures 1.4%. So it's kind of been a mixed bag. And if you look at our construction projects, probably the 2 biggest supply areas are steel, which obviously makes up the structure of the building, that's about 9%. Still seeing a fairly significant increase of about 40% since last March to this March, and that's actually up pretty significantly from February. And then on the flip side, you've got cement products, which make up again, about 9% of the cost of a building, and those have been relatively flat. We're also seeing labor at this point, only at about 2.5%, although that may tick up as construction has been picking up, but for the -- both the MOB side and the life science side, it's been only about 2.5%. And we really think a lot of the surge pricing, once production starts ramping up again and the kind of the supplies getting balanced, we'll see that kind of normalize. So we don't see it as a major impact to our yields. We're still on our projects, forecasting the same yields we did about a year ago. And quite frankly, in life science, the rate increases have kind of been matched any increase in construction. So we're pretty comfortable right now where those yields sit."

I don't think so -- I think that that's probably I'll call it maybe a $75 million year expenditure. We've got a lot of off-campus irreplaceable assets on these campuses, and these have, on average, its 22-, 23-year redevelopment lives, so they get a real IRR in the spend. And so it's actually quite economical for us to time it when there are proper leases turning. We've coordinated it with the hospitals and have a really successful effort in MOBs.

Also on the line and available for the Q&A portion of the call are Tom Klaritch, our COO; and Troy McHenry, our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel.  
We had a strong start to the year and continued executing on all aspects of the plan we communicated over the past few quarters. Let me hit the high points. Our operations across all 3 of our core businesses were ahead of expectations. We closed on an additional $1 billion of rental senior housing sales and have over $400 million of additional sales under hard or soft contract.  
We completed proprietary acquisitions of $422 million of on-campus or affiliated MOBs with another $150 million under fixed price purchase option. Also, we have a strong pipeline for additional off-market acquisitions. Our development pipeline progress and projected deliveries and pre-leasing remained favorable. And as we previously announced, we added one new development start from our land bank in South San Francisco and a densification development start in Torrey Pines, San Diego, and are already seeing strong leasing and interest in both.  
As we alluded to last quarter, yesterday, we announced an additional tender for $550 million of bonds. Our decade-long ESG commitment continues to produce notable achievements. Later this month, we look forward to publishing our tenth annual ESG report. And given our operational progress, transaction timing and stronger-than-expected trends, we raised our FFO as adjusted guidance by a couple of pennies at the midpoint and same-store guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint. Everything is progressing very well.  
Brinker and Pete will provide the details.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker."

I'll start with operating results, then provide an update on senior housing sales and finish with investments. In Life Science, we're very well positioned with our footprint, relationships and strong industry fundamentals. We reported 8.5%",1082,"Thank you, Tom. I'll start with operating results, then provide an update on senior housing sales and finish with investments. In Life Science, we're very well positioned with our footprint, relationships and strong industry fundamentals. We reported 8.5% same-store cash NOI growth in the first quarter, driven by rent escalators, higher occupancy and mark-to-market on renewals. The results were above our internal expectations as we saw an acceleration of leasing activity and rental rates across the Bay Area, San Diego and Boston, which comprise 97% of our life science NOI. Our momentum continued into April as we signed 290,000 square feet of leases with another 310,000 currently under letter of intent.  
Turning to medical office. Same-store cash NOI grew 2.1% in the first quarter, driven by rent escalators, 2% cash mark-to-market on renewals and favorable expenses. The results exceeded our internal forecast for the quarter. Leasing demand remains robust. Over 615,000 square feet of leases commenced in the first quarter, including more than 500,000 square feet on renewals, contributing to a trailing 12-month retention rate of 80%. We're seeing the benefit of our digital marketing initiatives as MOB virtual tours have increased dramatically. Our digital tour technology in all 3 business segments will benefit the platform long after COVID is behind us.  
Turning to CCRCs. The inflection point occurred sooner than we expected as occupancy across the portfolio increased 10 basis points from December to March and an additional 40 basis points in April. The trends are encouraging, especially at LCS, where leases in the first quarter exceeded 2019 levels and tours increased by nearly 70%, driven in part by our digital marketing initiatives.  
Entry fee sales are up 80% from the low point in 2Q '20. The effective vaccine rollout and a strong housing market support continued improvement. Same-store cash NOI growth was negative 16.5% for the quarter driven by year-over-year occupancy declines from COVID. The first quarter pool consists of just 2 properties, which limits the usefulness of the metric. As the LCS properties entered the pool starting in 2Q a quarterly same-store result will become more representative. The fiscal year pool will remain just the 2 Sunrise properties in 2021.  
Moving to senior housing dispositions. We closed on an additional $1 billion since our last earnings call. We signed purchase agreements or letters of intent on all of our remaining SHOP and triple-net properties with the closing time lines driven by licensure and debt assumption. The majority are under hard contracts with money at risk, and we continue to evaluate our sovereign wealth joint venture alongside our partners.  
Overall pricing remains in line with previous disclosures. The most recent $1 billion of SHOP assets were sold a 2.6% cap rate on annualized trailing 3-month NOI, excluding CARES Act revenue, and a 4.9% cap rate on pre-COVID NOI. With the vast majority of the asset sales now behind us, we're able to shift nearly 100% of our transaction focus to strategic investments in our 3 core business segments, and advancing our densification opportunities.  
For example, with our life science occupancy in the high 90s, we announced in March the commencement of the $159 million Nexus development in South San Francisco and the $135 million Callan Ridge densification in Torrey Pines. Both projects have generated significant interest from tenants before we started to dig foundations. We also completed development at 75 Hayden in Lexington, the campus sits strategically at the intersection of Route 128 and Route 2 and now totals more than 600,000 square feet across 3 buildings that are 100% leased. We continue to advance our shadow development and densification pipeline.  
In April, we closed on the first phase of the previously announced acquisition of land on Forbes Boulevard in the heart of South San Francisco. The remaining parcels in that acquisition should close later this year. Combined with our existing holdings, we branded the 20-acre site under the new name of Vantage. The project will become a highly prominent phased development totaling 1 million square feet or more.  
Demand in South San Francisco remains robust, and we hold a dominant position in the submarket, controlling nearly 50% of the landlord owned lab inventory. We have the ability to double our footprint in the submarket over time through our existing land bank and densification opportunities.
Moving to acquisitions. We've been active in medical office, finding attractive opportunities to redeploy senior housing sale proceeds. All of the acquisitions I'll describe today were done on a proprietary basis through relationships.  
In some cases, we effectively executed asset swaps with the same counterparty, trading senior housing assets for life science and medical office, which eliminated our risk around execution, timing and tax on more than $2 billion of transactions. In April, we acquired a 14-property MOB portfolio with 833,000 square feet for $371 million. The portfolio is 100% on campus or affiliated with a 7-year weighted average lease term.  
The acquisition expands and/or creates relationships with leading regional health systems, including Bon Secours in Virginia; Inova in Washington, D.C.; NorthShore in Chicago; HCA in Los Angeles and Fairview in Minneapolis. The year 1 cash cap rate is 5.2%. There's occupancy upside at several of the properties, so the stabilized cap rate is in the high 5s.  
Stepping back, one unique aspect of Healthpeak across all 3 business segments is our campus model, where we have significant scale in a single location, and we're strategically adding to 3 of our most important MOB campuses. You'll recall that we recently acquired a 5.4 acre parcel at Medical City Dallas that will support up to 1 million square feet of expansion, which is on top of the existing 2.1 million square feet that we already own. 
And in February, we acquired a 6% stabilized cap rate, a 48,000 square foot MOB on the Centennial Campus in Nashville, including our development that delivers in the fourth quarter, helped people own 830,000 square feet across 9 MOBs on this market-leading campus.  
And most recently, in April, we acquired for a 5.5% stabilized cap rate, a recently developed 80,000 square foot MOB located on the market-leading Sky Ridge Hospital campus in Denver. This brings our ownership at the campus to 420,000 square feet. Our acquisition pipeline is sizable as well, including an option agreement for $150 million of MOBs with strong health system affiliation.  
We're in a good position to capitalize on these opportunities, which is a good segue to Pete to cover financial results and the balance sheet."

I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the first quarter, we reported FFO",790,"Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. 
Starting with our financial results. For the first quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.40 per share and blended same-store growth of 4.3%. In addition, on April 29, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share, representing a payout ratio of approximately 88% for the first quarter.  
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.4x, in line with our expectations. As previously announced, we intended to use a portion of our senior housing disposition proceeds to repay near-term debt.
As such, during the first quarter, we completed the repayment of $1.45 billion of bonds maturing in 2023 and 2024. Yesterday, we announced the tender offer to purchase up to $550 million of 2025 bonds, allowing us to minimize dilution from sitting on debt cash and further improve our balance sheet.  
Pro forma for the $550 million repayment, our weighted average maturity improves to 6.5 years. With our senior housing dispositions now largely complete, we are not planning any further bond repayments beyond the $2 billion that has been completed or announced. 
Turning to our guidance. As Tom and Scott mentioned, we have started the year on a strong note with all of our segments performing above our initial expectations. As a result, we have made the decision to increase our guidance as follows: FFO adjusted revised from $1.50 to $1.60 per share to $1.53 to $1.61 per share, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint. Blended same-store NOI growth revised from 1.5% to 3% to 1.75% to 3.25%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint.  
Let me spend a minute level setting all the major components of our revised guidance. First, we see an increase in FFO of roughly $0.01 to $0.02 from improved performance across all 3 of our segments, which impacts both the low and high end of our guidance range.  
In life science, as Scott mentioned, we had a very strong first quarter. As a result, we have increased our full year same-store range to 4.5% to 5.5%, an increase of 50 basis points. We do expect some modest deceleration as the year progresses, plus we proactively terminated an 80,000 square foot lease at our Redwood City campus to allow an existing tenant to grow within our portfolio. The positive rent mark-to-market is over 40%, but as a result of downtime, it will negatively impact 2021 same-store results by 75 basis points. However, it provides a significant earnings and same-store benefit to 2022 and beyond.  
In medical office, we have started the year with stronger-than-expected leasing with demand for outpatient elective procedures continuing to improve. We had originally expected a more challenging first quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comp. Based on the first quarter performance exceeding our forecast, we have increased our full year same-store range to 1.75% to 2.75%, an increase of 25 basis points.  
In CCRCs, with the success of the vaccine rollout and 100% of our properties open to new admissions we are beginning to see improved performance. Recent occupancy trends are favorable, expenses have moderated, and we are seeing an uptick in entrance fees. As a result, we have increased the midpoint of our LCS portfolio guidance range by $7.5 million and tightened the range. While there are still a lot of moving pieces, if the trends we are seeing continue to ramp at the current pace, perhaps we are still a bit conservative with our forecast, and we will assess as the year progresses.  
Second, we see an increase in FFO of roughly $0.01 to $0.02 from the timing and amount of acquisition activity from the reinvestment of sale proceeds. We have increased the lower end of our acquisition guidance to $700 million, an increase of $550 million. As a reminder, our plan assumed funding all acquisition activity with newly issued debt, bringing net debt to EBITDA back to our target of 5.5x at the high end. For now, we have kept the high end of our acquisition assumptions unchanged, although our pipeline has been building, so stay tuned.  
Third, Interest rates have ticked up a bit, so we have increased our expected issuance rate to 2.75%, an increase of 25 basis points from our prior assumption. One last item before Q&A. With our portfolio repositioning winding down, we completed a comprehensive review of our supplemental and realigned our disclosures to the current portfolio. On Page 40 of the supplemental, we have provided a table summarizing the key additions.  
With that, operator, let's open the line for Q&A."

But the 2 most recent additions to our development pipeline from the land bank, Callan Ridge, which is really a densification as well. We're underwriting an 8-plus percent yield on that. Now that's helped by the fact that we've owned the land for a long time and are able to significantly densify that site. I mean, at current market value for the land, the return on cost is probably 4% to 6% range, just realistically from trades we've seen recently. And that project will start probably in the third quarter of this year. We still have a couple of tenants in the existing building through June. 
The second project that we recently announced is Nexus in South San Francisco and the underwritten yield there is a little bit lower, although certainly still higher than what we would achieve if we had to pay current market value for the land. In that project, we had to scrape an existing out-lorded building. So that's now complete. We'll start the construction soon. It's obviously shovel-ready site now and should deliver probably early first or second quarter of 2023. So we feel really good about both projects given the supply/demand dynamics. And if anything, there's probably some upside in the yields versus what we've disclosed today, we're getting a lot of interest on both sides. 
And then in terms of what could come next, the land bank intensification opportunity exceeds 5 million square feet on land that we already control. The 2 highest priorities are probably the 2 shovel-ready land sites, one in South San Francisco, one in Sorrento Mesa in San Diego. That totals about 500,000 square feet. Both of those sites are essentially shovel-ready. And we could start those really at our discretion. And if we start seeing significant momentum on the other projects that we just commenced, it may be that we go ahead and start those as well, but we haven't made any final decisions. Tom, anything you'd add?"

Nick, assuming that land is that market, we would say that spread is probably in that 150 or probably closer to 200 basis point range relative to cap rates in those markets. And that's land at market, which has become very competitive, as I think everybody knows. But regardless how we think about it is, we can certainly make money at 150 basis point plus spread, it produces a couple of hundred basis points spread to our year 1 funding costs. It's probably 25% to 30% accretive to NAV when you think about the yields versus the cap rates in those markets. But you really need that to compensate for the drag and the risk that's encountered with development. But the significant advantage that we have is we've got a good-sized land bank and even a much bigger densification pipeline that will create really strong land in very well-positioned locations in the 3 core markets over the next decade."

And we've got some other transactions that we'll close plus we've got the bond tenders you just mentioned. So I would say from a revolver perspective, we feel quite good about where we are from a floating rate debt and the amount that's outstanding on the revolver. And like I said, we have some dry powder built in with our leverage because that tender will take us down into the low 5s, around 5x. So about $800 million of capacity from an acquisition perspective. So hopefully, that's helpful. And happy to take it off line, if you have any additional questions on that."

So we're currently seeing transaction opportunities in both of the major sectors of life science and MOBs. The market for purpose-built lab and well-located land in the core markets for life science has been driving very strong pricing, as I'm sure you've all seen, which has caused us to stand down on a lot of the auction deals or maybe all the auction deals that we've looked at. However, this is in our view, a plus for us as we have the embedded densification opportunities given our premium land locations. 
So that just really increases the value of those opportunities in that land given we've got about a decade run on that side. Well, if I look to MOBs, for the high-quality MOBs, it's also been quite competitive and challenging, especially in the auction markets. But all the completed deals that we have done have been off-market as of the past several months. And our acquisition pipeline is entirely relationship driven. So we feel quite good on that front. 
So yes, there's a lot of competition out there, Jordan, but I think we've got a position where when we think about build versus buy in each of our 3 major segments with life science being primarily build given our land bank and the value-add opportunities that we have, MOBs, it's a blend of buy and build. as long as they're relationship-based deals where the health service companies value our partnership to help them achieve their objectives, which Klaritch has been building on that for 30 years. 
And then CCRCs, it's more generally buy versus build given the typical 8- to 10-year from inception, development, and stabilization period. We're a natural counterparty for those that are capital constrained and want to find a capital partner and it creates a great yield for us. And we've also got some densification in our CCRC campuses that sum up to about $0.5 billion over time, where the delivery is reduced to probably about 3 years and the land is free. So if I was to just summarize all those components in one remark  that would probably be it."

And we are expecting that the improvement that we saw in the first quarter, but then in particular, in April, will continue. So that might lead you to believe that there's a lot of upside in the NOI and maybe there is. But in the first quarter, we did have some expenses that were quite a bit lower than we thought, including bad debt and insurance and even labor. So we wanted to maintain a little bit of conservatism just to make sure we understood exactly how expenses would shake out the balance of the year. And the other thing is that the merit increases for the workers tends to be on April 1. So that number is obviously meaningful and that will impact the balance of the year in 2021.

So anything we do from here on out should be upside as we've pretty close to achieve their full year leasing already, especially if we can convert those existing LOIs into signed leases. 
On the credit quality at the tenant side, there's a lot less risk today than there would have been a couple of years ago, for sure, given how much money has been raised in the sector, we have a number of watch list tenants from the past and are no longer on the watch list, which is great. It's a very, very small number today. It doesn't mean we're not actively managing the portfolio, of course, but just very few tenants that we're actually concerned about. So those are probably the biggest variables. And for sure, we feel really good about the environment.

The way we think about it more is that you're able to create a transaction and customize it in a way that really makes sense for both parties. We're able to ensure that there's a relationship going forward with the particular health system, in the case of medical office buildings. So maybe at the margin, there's a slight valuation difference between an auction and an off-market transaction. I think it's more of the softer points that ultimately are probably more important than the hard points on an acquisition that really drive, in our view, the differences between doing things on a proprietary basis versus an auction."

Obviously, as part of that, as you develop relationships, you also end up with adjacent and affiliated off-campus, which quite frankly, we like, but we want to make sure when we look at those, that they have a heavy hospital presence in them, either certainly employed physicians, but also hospital outpatient departments such as imaging or cancer treatment or whatever might fit into the building and the surrounding service area.
And then if you look, quite frankly, on-campus has always outperformed off-campus in a number of our key growth metrics. We did a study recently, looked at over 300 of our properties over a 10-year period, and it was pretty consistent, that on-campus outperformed. 
Off-campus adjacent, which are fairly close to the hospital, also did quite well.

So yes, we will pull the trigger on a couple more because the dilution from it or the drag from it will be quite small as long as they're pre-leased. That produces a great outcome for us."

So it's harder to make a black-and-white comment on conversions and the risk.

It's been kind of an odd year with construction pricing due to the pandemic. Things were rolling along and then the pandemic hit and construction kind of ground to a halt, created an abundance of construction supplies out there, production ramp down. Pricing was actually relatively flat to down a little bit during the pandemic. 
And then at year-end, just as quickly things ramp back up, production had been shut down. So what we're seeing is pretty high demand for certain of the basic materials out there, steel, lumber, all have had significant increases because of that. But we've had other cost categories that, quite frankly, have been relatively flat. Cement is around 1% increases. Lighting fixtures 1.4%. So it's kind of been a mixed bag. 
And if you look at our construction projects, probably the 2 biggest supply areas are steel, which obviously makes up the structure of the building, that's about 9%. Steel seeing a fairly significant increase of about 40% since last March to this March, and that's actually up pretty significantly from February. And then on the flip side, you've got cement products, which make up again, about 9% of the cost of a building, and those have been relatively flat. 
We're also seeing labor at this point, only at about 2.5%, although that may tick up as construction has been picking up, but for the -- both the MOB side and the life science side, it's been only about 2.5%. And we really think a lot of the surge pricing, once production starts ramping up again and the kind of the supplies getting balanced, we'll see that kind of normalize. 
So we don't see it as a major impact to our yields. We're still on our projects, forecasting the same yields we did about a year ago. And quite frankly, in life science, the rate increases have kind of more than matched any increase in construction. So we're pretty comfortable right now with where those yields sit."

We've got a lot of off-campus irreplaceable assets on these campuses, and these have, on average, its 22-, 23-year redevelopment lives, so they get a real IRR in the spend.

We have a competitive edge in that business in that it's so hard to start a CCRC business because it requires real scale, real infrastructure, real expertise and you really can't build it by development. 
So what that means is that growth in that business really needs to occur through acquisition, and it can be fully stabilized properties or those that have some form of value-add, and there are plenty of not for profits that are mission-driven that might turn up short on funds, but want to retain their mission. And we're the ideal candidate to be the capital partner with them, and we've got the best operator in the business in LCS to join forces with us on that. 
So we do see some annual activity that we're working toward that we'd like to see some growth. We're not going to make that an outsized business, probably no bigger on a percentage basis than it is today. But every time we do a deal, it comes with a yield that is quite strong, stronger than what really would typically be the case other than the barrier to entry to enter that business is just so darn difficult."

Also on the line and available for the Q&A portion of the call are Tom Klaritch, our COO; and Troy McHenry, our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel.  
We had a strong start to the year and continued executing on all aspects of the plan we communicated over the past few quarters. Let me hit the high points. Our operations across all 3 of our core businesses were ahead of expectations. We closed on an additional $1 billion of rental senior housing sales and have over $400 million of additional sales under hard or soft contract.  
We completed proprietary acquisitions of $422 million of on-campus or affiliated MOBs with another $150 million under fixed price purchase option. Also, we have a strong pipeline for additional off-market acquisitions. Our development pipeline progress and projected deliveries and pre-leasing remained favorable. And as we previously announced, we added 1 new development start from our land bank in South San Francisco and a densification development start in Torrey Pines, San Diego, and are already seeing strong leasing interest in both.  
As we alluded to last quarter, yesterday, we announced an additional tender for $550 million of bonds. Our decade-long ESG commitment continues to produce notable achievements. Later this month, we look forward to publishing our tenth annual ESG report. And given our operational progress, transaction timing and stronger-than-expected trends, we raised our FFO as adjusted guidance by a couple of pennies at the midpoint and same-store guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint. So everything is progressing very well.  
Brinker and Pete will provide the details.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker."

I'll start with operating results, then provide an update on senior housing sales and finish with investments. In Life Science, we're very well positioned with our footprint, relationships and strong industry fundamentals. We reported 8.5%",1082,"Thank you, Tom. I'll start with operating results, then provide an update on senior housing sales and finish with investments. In Life Science, we're very well positioned with our footprint, relationships and strong industry fundamentals. We reported 8.5% same-store cash NOI growth in the first quarter, driven by rent escalators, higher occupancy and mark-to-market on renewals. The results were above our internal expectations as we saw an acceleration of leasing activity and rental rates across the Bay Area, San Diego and Boston, which comprise 97% of our life science NOI. Our momentum continued into April as we signed 290,000 square feet of leases with another 310,000 currently under letter of intent.  
Turning to medical office. Same-store cash NOI grew 2.1% in the first quarter, driven by rent escalators, 2% cash mark-to-market on renewals and favorable expenses. The results exceeded our internal forecast for the quarter. Leasing demand remains robust. Over 615,000 square feet of leases commenced in the first quarter, including more than 500,000 square feet on renewals, contributing to a trailing 12 month retention rate of 80%. We're seeing the benefit of our digital marketing initiatives as MOB virtual tours have increased dramatically. Our digital tour technology in all 3 business segments will benefit the platform long after COVID is behind us.  
Turning to CCRCs. The inflection point occurred sooner than we expected as occupancy across the portfolio increased 10 basis points from December to March and an additional 40 basis points in April. The trends are encouraging, especially at LCS, where leads in the first quarter exceeded 2019 levels and tours increased by nearly 70%, driven in part by our digital marketing initiatives.  
Entry fee sales are up 80% from the low point in 2Q '20. The effective vaccine rollout and a strong housing market support continued improvement. Same-store cash NOI growth was negative 16.5% for the quarter driven by year-over-year occupancy declines from COVID. The first quarter pool consists of just 2 properties, which limits the usefulness of the metric. As the LCS properties enter the pool starting in 2Q, the quarterly same-store result will become more representative. The fiscal year pool will remain just the 2 Sunrise properties in 2021.  
Moving to senior housing dispositions. We closed on an additional $1 billion since our last earnings call. We signed purchase agreements or letters of intent on all of our remaining SHOP and triple-net properties with the closing time lines driven by licensure and debt assumption. The majority are under hard contracts with money at risk, and we continue to evaluate our sovereign wealth joint venture alongside our partners.  
Overall pricing remains in line with previous disclosures. The most recent $1 billion of SHOP assets were sold a 2.6% cap rate on annualized trailing 3-month NOI, excluding CARES Act revenue, and a 4.9% cap rate on pre-COVID NOI. With the vast majority of the asset sales now behind us, we're able to shift nearly 100% of our transaction focus to strategic investments in our 3 core business segments, and advancing our densification opportunities.  
For example, with our life science occupancy in the high 90s, we announced in March the commencement of the $159 million Nexus development in South San Francisco and the $135 million Callan Ridge densification in Torrey Pines. Both projects have generated significant interest from tenants before we started to dig foundations. We also completed development at 75 Hayden in Lexington, the campus sits strategically at the intersection of Route 128 and Route 2 and now totals more than 600,000 square feet across 3 buildings that are 100% leased. We continue to advance our shadow development and densification pipeline.  
In April, we closed on the first phase of the previously announced acquisition of land on Forbes Boulevard in the heart of South San Francisco. The remaining parcels in that acquisition should close later this year. Combined with our existing holdings, we branded the 20-acre site under the new name of Vantage. The project will become a highly prominent phased development totaling 1 million square feet or more.  
Demand in South San Francisco remains robust, and we hold a dominant position in the submarket, controlling nearly 50% of the landlord owned lab inventory. We have the ability to double our footprint in the submarket over time through our existing land bank and densification opportunities.
Moving to acquisitions. We've been active in medical office, finding attractive opportunities to redeploy senior housing sale proceeds. All of the acquisitions I'll describe today were done on a proprietary basis through relationships.  
In some cases, we effectively executed asset swaps with the same counterparty, trading senior housing assets for life science and medical office, which eliminated our risk around execution, timing and tax on more than $2 billion of transactions. In April, we acquired a 14-property MOB portfolio with 833,000 square feet for $371 million. The portfolio is 100% on campus or affiliated with a 7-year weighted average lease term.  
The acquisition expands and/or creates relationships with leading regional health systems, including Bon Secours in Virginia; Inova in Washington, D.C.; NorthShore in Chicago; HCA in Los Angeles and Fairview in Minneapolis. The year 1 cash cap rate is 5.2%. There's occupancy upside at several other properties, so the stabilized cap rate is in the high 5s.  
Stepping back, 1 unique aspect of Healthpeak across all 3 business segments is our campus model, where we have significant scale in a single location, and we're strategically adding to 3 of our most important MOB campuses. You'll recall that we recently acquired a 5.4 acre parcel at Medical City Dallas that will support up to 1 million square feet of expansion, which is on top of the existing 2.1 million square feet that we already own. 
And in February, we acquired a 6% stabilized cap rate, a 48,000 square foot MOB on the Centennial Campus in Nashville, including our development that delivers in the fourth quarter, Healthpeak will own 830,000 square feet across 9 MOBs on this market-leading campus.  
And most recently, in April, we acquired for a 5.5% stabilized cap rate, a recently developed 80,000 square foot MOB located on the market-leading Sky Ridge Hospital campus in Denver. This brings our ownership at the campus to 420,000 square feet. Our acquisition pipeline is sizable as well, including an option agreement for $150 million of MOBs with strong health system affiliation.  
We're in a good position to capitalize on these opportunities, which is a good segue to Pete to cover financial results and the balance sheet."

I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. The first quarter, we reported FFO as",789,"Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. 
Starting with our financial results. The first quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.40 per share and blended same-store growth of 4.3%. In addition, on April 29, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share, representing a payout ratio of approximately 88% for the first quarter.  
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.4x, in line with our expectations. As previously announced, we intended to use a portion of our senior housing disposition proceeds to repay near-term debt.
As such, during the first quarter, we completed the repayment of $1.45 billion of bonds maturing in 2023 and 2024. Yesterday, we announced the tender offer to purchase up to $550 million of 2025 bonds, allowing us to minimize dilution from sitting on dead cash and further improve our balance sheet.  
Pro forma for the $550 million repayment, our weighted average maturity improves to 6.5 years. With our senior housing dispositions now largely complete, we are not planning any further bond repayments beyond the $2 billion that has been completed or announced. 
Turning to our guidance. As Tom and Scott mentioned, we have started the year on a strong note with all of our segments performing above our initial expectations. As a result, we have made the decision to increase our guidance as follows: FFO as adjusted revised from $1.50 to $1.60 per share to $1.53 to $1.61 per share, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint. Blended same-store NOI growth revised from 1.5% to 3% to 1.75% to 3.25%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint.  
Let me spend a minute level setting all the major components of our revised guidance. First, we see an increase in FFO of roughly $0.01 to $0.02 from improved performance across all 3 of our segments, which impacts both the low and high end of our guidance range.  
In life science, as Scott mentioned, we had a very strong first quarter. As a result, we have increased our full year same-store range to 4.5% to 5.5%, an increase of 50 basis points. We do expect some modest deceleration as the year progresses, plus we proactively terminated an 80,000 square foot lease at our Redwood City campus to allow an existing tenant to grow within our portfolio. The positive rent mark-to-market is over 40%, but as a result of downtime, it will negatively impact 2021 same-store results by 75 basis points. However, it provides a significant earnings and same-store benefit to 2022 and beyond.  
In medical office, we have started the year with stronger-than-expected leasing with demand for outpatient elective procedures continuing to improve. We had originally expected a more challenging first quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comp. Based on the first quarter performance exceeding our forecast, we have increased our full year same-store range to 1.75% to 2.75%, an increase of 25 basis points.  
In CCRCs, with the success of the vaccine rollout and 100% of our properties open to new admission, we are beginning to see improved performance. Recent occupancy trends are favorable, expenses have moderated, and we are seeing an uptick in entrance fees. As a result, we have increased the midpoint of our LCS portfolio guidance range by $7.5 million and tightened the range. While there are still a lot of moving pieces, if the trends we are seeing continue to ramp at the current pace, perhaps we are still a bit conservative with our forecast, and we will assess as the year progresses.  
Second, we see an increase in FFO roughly $0.01 to $0.02 from the timing and amount of acquisition activity from the reinvestment of sale proceeds. We have increased the lower end of our acquisition guidance to $700 million, an increase of $550 million. As a reminder, our plan assumed funding all acquisition activity with newly issued debt, bringing net debt to EBITDA back to our target of 5.5x at the high end. For now, we have kept the high end of our acquisition assumptions unchanged, although our pipeline has been building, so stay tuned.  
Third, Interest rates have ticked up a bit, so we have increased our expected issuance rate to 2.75%, an increase of 25 basis points from our prior assumption. One last item before Q&A. With our portfolio repositioning winding down, we completed a comprehensive review of our supplemental and realigned our disclosures to the current portfolio. On Page 40 of the supplemental, we have provided a table summarizing the key additions.  
With that, operator, let's open the line for Q&A."

Now",341,"Scott here. I'll cover that, and Tom may have something to add. But the 2 most recent additions to our development pipeline from the land bank, Callan Ridge, which is really a densification as well, we're underwriting an 8-plus percent yield on that. Now that's helped by the fact that we've owned the land for a long time and are able to significantly densify that site. I mean, at current market value for the land, the return on cost is probably 4% to 6% range, just realistically from trades we've seen recently. And that project will start probably in the third quarter of this year. We still have a couple of tenants in the existing building through June. 
The second project that we recently announced is Nexus in South San Francisco and the underwritten yield there is a little bit lower, although certainly still higher than what we would achieve if we had to pay current market value for the land. In that project, we had to scrape an existing outmoded building. So that's now complete. We'll start construction soon. It's obviously shovel-ready site now and should deliver probably early first or second quarter of 2023. So we feel really good about both projects given the supply/demand dynamics. And if anything, there's probably some upside in the yields versus what we've disclosed today, we're getting a lot of interest on both sides. 
And then in terms of what could come next, the land bank and densification opportunity exceeds 5 million square feet on land that we already control. The 2 highest priorities are probably the 2 shovel-ready land sites, 1 in South San Francisco, 1 in Sorrento Mesa in San Diego. That totals about 500,000 square feet. Both of those sites are essentially shovel-ready. And we could start those really at our discretion. And if we start seeing significant momentum on the other projects that we just commenced, it may be that we go ahead and start those as well, but we haven't made any final decisions. Tom, anything you'd add?"

Nick, assuming that land is at market, we would say that spread is probably in that 150 or probably closer to 200 basis point range relative to cap rates in those markets. And that's with land at market, which has become very competitive, as I think everybody knows. But regardless how we think about it is, we can certainly make money at 150 basis point plus spread, it produces a couple of hundred basis points spread to our year 1 funding costs. It's probably 25% to 30% accretive to NAV when you think about the yields versus the cap rates in those markets. But you really need that to compensate for the drag and the risk that's encountered with development. But the significant advantage that we have is we've got a good-sized land bank and even a much bigger densification pipeline that will create really strong land in very well-positioned locations in the 3 core markets over the next decade."

And we've got some other transactions that we'll close plus we've got the bond tenders you just mentioned. So I would say from a revolver perspective, we feel quite good about where we are from a floating rate debt and the amount that's outstanding on the revolver. And like I said, we have some dry powder built in with our leverage because that tender will take us down into the low 5s, around 5x. So about $800 million of capacity from an acquisition perspective. So hopefully, that's helpful. And happy to take it off line if you have any additional questions on that."

So we're currently seeing transaction opportunities in both of the major sectors of life science and MOBs. The market for purpose-built lab and well-located land in the core markets for life science has been driving very strong pricing, as I'm sure you've all seen, which has caused us to stand down on a lot of the auction deals or maybe all the auction deals that we've looked at. However, this is in our view a plus for us is we have the embedded densification opportunities given our premium land locations. 
So that just really increases the value of those opportunities in that land given we've got about a decade run on that side. Well, if I look to MOBs, for the high-quality MOBs, it's also been quite competitive and challenging, especially in the auction markets. But all the completed deals that we have done have been off-market as of the past several months. And our acquisition pipeline is entirely relationship driven. So we feel quite good on that front. 
So yes, there's a lot of competition out there, Jordan, but I think we've got a position where when we think about build versus buy in each of our 3 major segments with life science being primarily build given our land bank and the value-add opportunities that we have, MOBs, it's a blend of buy and build as long as they're relationship-based deals where the health service companies value our partnership to help them achieve their objectives, which Klaritch has been building on that for 30 years. 
And then CCRCs, it's more generally buy versus build given the typical 8- to 10-year from inception, development, and stabilization period.  We're a natural counterparty for those that are capital constrained and want to find a capital partner and it creates a great yield for us. And we've also got some densification in our CCRC campuses that sum up to about $0.5 billion over time, where the delivery is reduced to probably about 3 years and the land is free. So if I was to just summarize all those components in 1 remark that, that would probably be it."

But if you look at the first quarter, Jordan, and just annualize the NOI that we reported, you come up to about $82 million. Our new guidance is $70 million to $90 million. And we do expect occupancy to increase fairly materially through year-end. The range we gave is 79% to 87%. Today, we're just above 79%. And we are expecting that the improvement that we saw in the first quarter, but then in particular, in April, will continue. So that might lead you to believe that there's a lot of upside in the NOI and maybe there is. But in the first quarter, we did have some expenses that were quite a bit lower than we thought, including bad debt and insurance and even labor. So we wanted to maintain a little bit of conservatism just to make sure we understood exactly how expenses would shake out the balance of the year. And the other thing is that the merit increases for the workers tends to be on April 1. So that number is obviously meaningful and that will impact the balance of the year in 2021. So hopefully, that helps."

We've achieved a good portion of the speculative leasing in the 2021 budget. So anything we do from here on out should be upside as we've pretty close to achieved our full year leasing already, especially if we can convert those existing LOIs into signed leases. 
On the credit quality of the tenant side, there's a lot less risk today than there would have been a couple of years ago, for sure, given how much money has been raised in the sector.  We had a number of watch list tenants from the past and are no longer on the watch list, which is great. It's a very, very small number today. It doesn't mean we're not actively managing the portfolio, of course, but just very few tenants that we're actually concerned about. So those are probably the biggest variables. And for sure, we feel really good about the environment.

So maybe at the margin, there's a slight valuation difference between an auction and an off-market transaction.

Obviously, as part of that, as you develop relationships, you also end up with adjacent and affiliated off-campus, which quite frankly, we like, but we want to make sure when we look at those, that they have a heavy hospital presence in them, either certainly employed physicians, but also hospital outpatient departments such as imaging or cancer treatment or whatever might fit into the building and the surrounding service area.
And then if you look, quite frankly, on-campus has always outperformed off-campus in a number of our key growth metrics. We did a study recently, looked at over 300 of our properties over a 10-year period, and it was pretty consistent, that on-campus outperformed. 
Off-campus adjacent, which are fairly close to the hospital, also did quite well. But off-campus affiliated, while not as good as on-campus, they certainly perform better than just unaffiliated off-campus.

There's just less frictional vacancy than, say, in the medical office business. The rent escalator is the primary, most consistent source of growth. We're in the low 3s today. So that should continue. The mark-to-market in the portfolio is somewhere in the 15% range. That's probably a bit conservative given how much rents have continued to run. And with current vacancy across all 3 markets being so low, it's certainly possible that rents will continue growing much faster than our escalator, which they have for, I don't know, at least 5 years in a row.

It's been kind of an odd year with construction pricing due to the pandemic. Things were rolling along and then the pandemic hit and construction kind of ground to a halt, created an abundance of construction supplies out there, production ramped down. Pricing was actually relatively flat to down a little bit during the pandemic. And then at year-end, just as quickly things ramped back up. Production had been shut down. So what we're seeing is pretty high demand for certain of the basic materials out there, steel, lumber, all have had significant increases because of that. But we've had other cost categories that, quite frankly, have been relatively flat. Cement is around 1% increased. Lighting fixtures 1.4%. So it's kind of been a mixed bag. 
And if you look at our construction projects, probably the 2 biggest supply areas are steel, which obviously makes up the structure of the building, that's about 9%. Steel seeing a fairly significant increase of about 40% since last March to this March, and that's actually up pretty significantly from February. And then on the flip side, you've got cement products, which make up again, about 9% of the cost of a building, and those have been relatively flat. 
We're also seeing labor at this point, only at about 2.5%, although that may tick up as construction has been picking up, but for the -- both the MOB side and the life science side, it's been only about 2.5%. And we really think a lot of the surge pricing, once production starts ramping up again and the kind of the supplies getting balanced, we'll see that kind of normalize. 
So we don't see it as a major impact to our yields. We're still on our projects, forecasting the same yields we did about a year ago. And quite frankly, in life science, the rate increases have kind of more than matched any increase in construction. So we're pretty comfortable right now with where those yields sit."

So they did pay a little more in rent. We gave them a little bit more TI. And then we had a renewal that was coupled with an expansion. So that drove the price of the TI even though it was all -- it was a combination of new and renewal, we called it renewal.

But I would think as the company continues to grow, probably you see the development increase some, although carefully due to the densification opportunities. Redev, I don't think so -- I think that that's probably I'll call it maybe a $75 million year expenditure. 
We've got a lot of off-campus irreplaceable assets on these campuses, and these have, on average, its 22-, 23-year redevelopment lives, so they get a real IRR in the spend. And so it's actually quite economical for us to time it when there are proper leases turning. We've coordinated it with the hospitals and have a really successful redev effort in MOBs. 
I think you'll see that every year. But yes, I think we'll probably see development grow slowly over time, but we're not going to double down and surprise you with a monstrous development program. Because we're always looking at demand and supply. We like to make sure we know where the funding is coming from in advance and that there's plenty of pre-leasing.

Also on the line and available for the Q&A portion of the call are Tom Klaritch, our COO; and Troy McHenry, our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel. 
We've maintained our strong start to the year. Our life science, MOB and CCRC businesses continue to perform well. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Our exit from rental senior housing is substantially complete, and we are having good success redeploying excess sales proceeds and have built a strong acquisition pipeline. Let me hit the high points. Operating results across all 3 of our core businesses were ahead of our expectations. We're down to the final $150 million of rental senior housing sales, which are all under binding contracts. This leaves us with our interest in the sovereign wealth JV, which we will continue to evaluate with our partner. We acquired $425 million of MOBs in Q2 and another $205 million in July and which combined with our first quarter activity brings our year-to-date MOB acquisitions to $640 million, all of which were done on an off-market basis. 
On the development side, life science market dynamics, projected deliveries and pre-leasing all remain favorable. During the second quarter, we signed a full campus lease for our Callan Ridge densification project. And yesterday, announced Sorrento Gateway is also fully spoken for, bringing our active life science development pipeline to 73% pre-leased or committed. Earlier this month, we issued $450 million of senior unsecured bonds due in 2027 in our inaugural green bond offering. 
Given our operational progress, we raised our FFO adjusted guidance by $0.01 at the midpoint and same-store guidance by 50 basis points at the midpoint. Finally, in July, we published our tenth annual ESG report. Our ESG program continues to produce meaningful results and received industry and global recognition. Our team at Healthpeak is very pleased with the progress we've made over the last decade and are continuing to pursue and invest in initiatives that improve our overall ESG performance and support our long-term goals. So everything is progressing very well. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker."

I'll begin with operating results, then provide an update on our development and investment activities. 
Starting with life science. 2020 saw record-setting biotech capital raising. 2021 is on pace to exceed those records. Capital inflows are fueling scientific breakthroughs and leading to accelerating real estate fundamentals. Demand continues to exceed supply and vacancies are at all-time lows, driving market rent growth of 10% or more over the past year. During the quarter, we signed 233,000 feet of renewals at a 22% cash mark-to-market plus 121,000 feet of new leases. We've already exceeded our full year internal leasing budget and 3Q is off to a strong start. 
In July, we signed 90,000 feet of new leases, and we currently have a large pipeline under signed letters of intent, including 345,000 feet of renewals, 70,000 feet of new leasing and 415,000 feet on new developments. Same-store NOI growth for the quarter was 7.4% and bringing year-to-date growth to 7.9%. The results were driven by in-place escalators, leasing activity, mark-to-market on renewals and burn off of free rent from the prior year. 
As discussed on the last call, we do expect same-store growth to moderate in the second half of the year due to difficult comps and proactive early terminations that will benefit future years. 
Moving to medical office. Same-store NOI growth this quarter was 4.1%, driven by leasing activity, ad rents, strong collections and parking income. Hospital inpatient and outpatient volumes have returned to pre-COVID levels benefiting our unique on-campus portfolio. Leasing activity continues to outperform. We had more than 800,000 feet of commencements in the quarter, which is 200,000 feet ahead of plan. Retention is strong at 78% for the trailing 12 months, including 93% in June. Year-to-date, we've already completed 90% of our full year internal leasing budget. Note that total portfolio occupancy declined a bit last quarter. This was driven by recently completed development and redevelopment properties entering the portfolio that are still in lease-up, plus a few recent acquisitions, lease-up opportunity. This gives us more NOI to capture in the future. 
Finishing with CCRCs, where performance continues to recover. Occupancy was up 90 basis points from March to June. Entry fee cash receipts were $24 million, representing the highest level since 2019 and leading indicators are now in line with 2019 levels. With current occupancy at 80%, we have significant upside to capture, at least 500 basis points on the low end. Same-store cash NOI growth was negative 23% for the quarter, driven by the CARES Act payments received in 2Q '20. Absent these onetime payments, same-store growth was positive 23% this quarter. 
Turning to our development pipeline. We've executed guaranteed maximum price contracts on all of our active development projects, so we have very limited exposure to rising construction costs. Lease-up continues to exceed our underwriting on both rental rate and timing. In June, we signed a full building lease on our Callan Ridge densification project in San Diego. We expect to deliver the $140 million project in the first half of 2023, with a yield on cost in the low 9s based on the book value of our land. 
In July, we signed a binding term sheet for the entire 163,000 square foot rental gateway development also in San Diego. We expect to deliver the $117 million project in the first half of 2023, with a yield on cost in the mid-8s based on the book value of our land. Those yields are far above what's achievable at today's land prices. If we mark our land to market, the yield on cost in the core markets where we play is more in the 6% to 7% range at today's construction costs and rental rates. 
Moving to investments. In July, we closed the off-market acquisition of 3 MOBs that are leased to Atlantic Health. The asset share a campus proximate to the Morristown Medical Center, generally regarded as the #1 hospital in New Jersey. The stabilized cash cap rate is in the mid-5s. The acquisition also included a land parcel on the same campus that can accommodate up to 80,000 square feet of medical office development. Also in July, we acquired a $50 million medical building in Wichita that's 100% leased to HCA. The price represents a 6.1% initial cash cap rate. This was an off-market acquisition and expands our existing presence in the market. In June, we acquired a $16 million MOB located on the campus of HCA's Westside hospital in Fort Lauderdale. The initial cash cap rate is 5.5%. Again, this was an off-market acquisition and expand our existing presence on this campus. 
Looking forward, we have a strategic acquisition and development pipeline across our business segments. Against the backdrop of compressing cap rates, we remain focused on using our relationships to create opportunities not available to the broader market. We also continue to advance densification opportunities across all 3 of our business segments, which will be a source of growth for the next decade plus on land we already own. Finally, we're balancing acquisitions that are immediately accretive with value-creating development opportunities that naturally come with short-term earnings track. As a result, our acquisition pipeline is a mix of stabilized assets, lease-up properties and covered land plays. The blended initial yield will depend on the relative mix of opportunities that ultimately proceed. With that, I'll turn it to Pete."
277966,1673196848,2362627,"Healthpeak Properties, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the second quarter, we reported FFO",624,"Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the second quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.40 per share and blended same-store growth of 1.2%. Two notable same-store items. First, our 13 LCS operated CCRCs entered the quarterly same-store pool in the second quarter and accounted for 12% of the overall pool. Second, as Scott mentioned, our CCRCs were significantly impacted by the onetime CARES Act grant we received in the second quarter of 2020. 
Adjusting for CARES Act grants, pro forma blended second quarter same-store growth across the portfolio was 7.6%. Until the LCS operated CCRCs enter the full year same-store pool in 2022, we believe our quarterly same-store results are more reflective of how our overall portfolio is performing. Last item within financial results. On July 29, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share, representing an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 86% for the second quarter. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Since our last earnings call, we continue to improve upon our fortress balance sheet. We completed the repayment of $550 million of bonds maturing in 2025. We issued $450 million of 5-year green bond at a rate of 1.35%. We completed the repayment of our $250 million term loan maturing in 2024, and we received $246 million of seller financing early repayments. As a result of our balance sheet activity, we ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.6x, providing us with dry powder for acquisitions. We have no significant debt maturities until February 2025, and we have ample open maturity slots in 2028, 2032 and beyond allowing us to fund near-term transactions with 5-year and 10-year debt. 
Turning to our guidance. We are increasing our guidance as follows: FFO's adjusted revised from $1.53 to $1.61 per share; two, $1.55 to $1.61 per share, an increase of $0.01 at the midpoint. Blended same-store NOI growth revised from 1.75% to 3.25%, two, 2.25% to 3.75%, an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint. 
Let me spend a minute level setting all the major components of our revised guidance. Starting with FFO as adjusted. We have had a strong start to the year with $0.80 per share FFO as adjusted, inclusive of $0.01 of nonrecurring CARES Act grants. As a result, we have increased the midpoint of guidance by $0.03 per share compared to our original 2021 guidance. While we are trending towards the higher end of our revised guidance range, we feel it is prudent to maintain some conservatism given the uncertain market conditions. 
Turning to acquisitions. We have increased the low end of our acquisition guidance to $800 million, an increase of $100 million to account for our recent closed transaction. We will update our guidance further as transactions firm up and we get a better sense for timing and pricing. As a reminder, we intend to fund acquisitions with debt until we hit our target leverage of 5.5x. 
Turning to CCRC. We are reaffirming the $70 million to $90 million NOI range for the LCS CCRCs. While performance has been strong year-to-date, we have determined it is too early to adjust guidance given the uncertainty of the COVID Delta variant and increased labor costs. 
One last item on CARES Act grants. We have reduced our guidance for CARES Act grants from $9 million to $6 million, which represent all the grants we have received year-to-date. Any additional CARES Act funding we could potentially receive for the balance of the year would be upside to guidance. With that, operator, let's open the line for Q&A."

It obviously varies from quarter-to-quarter depending upon which leases are renewing, just given that there is a spread across the portfolio, some are bigger than others. This quarter, we were at 22%. Year-to-date, we're in the high teens. And that's probably reflective of where the portfolio is overall. If we look across the 10-plus years that the current leases maturity is going to bounce around, but that's our best guess as to our mark-to-market across the whole portfolio.

We're believers that you don't want too many JVs out there, it complicates the organization. And if an investment is a strong investment, we prefer typically to own it on balance sheet, or 100% on balance sheet. So the fund aspect to us doesn't light us up all that much. As to JVs, we felt differently in Boston, where we needed to build the business, get our foot in. There was a lot of expertise there with King Street Bulfinch that we tapped into. And we would consider continuing that in Boston. There's an element with JVs and life science within clusters where joint ventures really are disadvantageous because the objective is to allow biotechs to grow and easily move between our properties within clusters. And joint ventures, obviously create other interest from partners that can stand in the way of smooth transactions in that respect. So that's not something that we're looking to do a lot of on the life science side. 
On the MOB side, those are relationship-driven deals, and we typically prefer -- almost always prefer to own 100%. Of those deals, the time when it can occur where a joint venture might make sense is if we're doing a development deal with a player that has lots of contacts they're identifying the business. They use their relationships. We come in with the money. They get some kind of a promote on the back end, and we ultimately own the real estate, those are attractive to us as well. So that's how we think about JVs and funds are not something that we would consider."

So we really don't lose that aspect of it. And then obviously, on the system side, we have our VPs, myself are dealing with the major systems. So I don't really see it as a real negative to relationships. We maintain those pretty well. And having that structure just allows us to move in and out of markets really easily. 
If you look at the the 2 larger acquisitions we did in the past couple of months, the Midwest portfolio and Harrison Street, we very easily moved into those markets, took over management and literally overnight, we're managing those properties without having to deal with all of the personnel issues that you would have to if you internalize it.

It came with a lot of excess land, either totally unimproved or surface parking that when we made the acquisition, we always had in mind that if demand continues to be strong, there could be the opportunity to utilize some of that excess land on the campus for more density. It does require entitlements. So that process is underway at a couple of our sites. Similar example at our West Cambridge campus, the Discovery Park, where the purchase came with some vacant land and excess FAR. 
In terms of the purchase price, we like the deal on a stand-alone basis. The cap rate made a lot of sense. The geography made sense. But this added benefit of having excess land on the campus that could be densified with additional entitlements over time was pretty intriguing to us. So we do have examples like that in the portfolio, and we're in the middle of that entitlement process now. So that's attractive and that land across the 3 core markets is trading for probably at least $200 per developable foot. And if you're able to build new properties without purchasing land, that obviously makes the economics much more accretive."

But one of the things that we have the advantage of is we already have huge scale. And just adding more huge scale just for the sake of getting bigger is not what we're about. We're seeking to grow our earnings on a consistent basis. And singles and doubles and occasional triples allow us to look at each transaction 1 by 1 to ensure that we believe that those are individually good decisions. When you take a whole company down, and I've done that a few times in my career, there's always a group of assets that you're really like, maybe some that you like a little and maybe some of you really wish you didn't have to deal with. So that is one thing when you do M&A that does come to mind. 
Oftentimes, it gets very competitive in the process as we all know. And by the time you end up being the winning better if you are, you're almost at that point where you're not sure if you wish you won the deal or didn't. Unless it's going to be clearly accretive, which in today's environment, MOBs are a hot commodity, maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't. And so oftentimes, you just be playing for synergies. 
We do have a tendency to look at the portfolio to see how strategic it is, how does it fit in, how much real estate really doesn't fit our profile that we would need to deal with. And then there's always a social issues, too. I mean there's a whole group of find people on the other side of this that are trying to figure out their path and their career as well. And then how does that fit in? So just a lot of different things to consider with M&A that it seems so obvious that go out and get as big as you can and grow, but it comes with pros and cons. And the scale of an advantage, but you got to recognize, too, it's also a disadvantage. It's a lot easier to move the needle with growth when you've got a smaller company than if you get huge. So I'm not saying that we're forward or against it. In some cases, it would make sense. Some cases, it wouldn't, but those are the types of things we look at."

I'll start and then let Pete cover the other part of your question, but there are actually 2 proactive terminations, 1 in Redwood City that you mentioned and then 1 in San Diego, in the aggregate, it's about 125,000 feet. So these releases that were due to expire over the next 1 to 4 years, tenants that we're not going to renew, and we had growth tenants in those local markets looking to expand. So from an economic standpoint, it's a very easy decision to do those early terminations. In both cases, we did get termination fees. So economically, we were made all for the balance of the year until the new leases start. But obviously, we don't count that for cash NOI in terms of same-store, and it also impacts occupancy. So the answer to your question is those 2 proactive terminations alone represent about 140 basis points of occupancy in the portfolio, and those are in same store. And the impact on cash NOI in the second half of the year in the aggregate, it's about 170, 180 basis points. So it's material to the second half of the year. 
Obviously, if we were managing the portfolio based on same-store NOI, we would not make those decisions, but we're not. We're managing it to make the best economic decisions over time. So it will be a drag in the second half of the year, but a long-term benefit.

So there are thresholds. I won't share the specifics on the call, but certainly, when we have our committee discussions, it's not just a discussion around a particular project, but how does it fit into the balance of the portfolio. Clearly, every time we sign a new lease, like we have quite a few times this year, particularly in San Diego, it gives us a little more confidence to commence the next development project. And we definitely feel like the remaining unleased portion of our development pipeline is showing great momentum as well. So hopefully, we'll have more news to report in terms of new development starts. But trying to balance that with more accretive near-term acquisitions, that is a goal. We've done almost $650 million of medical office to date. 
Now they stabilize in the 5% to 6% range, but not all of them achieve those yields right away. So there is some lease-up potential within that big acquisition portfolio as well. And it's a balance. We evaluate each individual asset and opportunity on its own, but also have to put it in the context of a desire to deliver some near-term earnings growth in addition to the tremendous longer-term value creation that comes with these big development projects. Covered land is an interesting play because it allows you to generate some level of earnings. And given our current cost of capital, it might be modestly dilutive but certainly not as dilutive as it would be to buy vacant land and then go through an entitlement process. So we try to balance all of those different metrics as we deploy capital. Pete, anything you'd add?"

I also encourage you to take a look at 41 and 42, the pages within the supplemental since we give a lot of detailed information on what builds up for the low and the high end. But $0.01 raise for this quarter comes from a bunch of different items, right? One, we did increase life sciences and MOB same-store 75 and 25 basis points, respectively. So those businesses are doing great. We lowered the interest expense a bit given the success of that green bond deal. And then we moderately increased our acquisition guidance. So what would be the 2 areas where we could see some risk today, I'd say the first would be on CCRC. And if you look at where we are year-to-date, we're at $40 million for the LCS CCRCs that annualized is right to the midpoint, it's $70 million to $90 million. So there's probably $0.02 there from the midpoint down to the lower end. And then I would also point you to acquisition guidance. We've got $800 million of unidentified at this point built in. So the 2 items of risk would be firming up that acquisition pipeline and the timing of that as well as the yields and then on the CCRCs again, we're trending well and that's something I want to reiterate. But I think at this point, we felt like a $0.01 increase is what made sense, and we'll continue to reevaluate as the pipeline firms up and as the year progresses."

We're constantly working on our land bank densification opportunities within life science. And within the clusters that we built in the built-in natural demand that comes from a tenant base, based on demand, supply characteristics, the continued boom in biotech and the growth of those companies we do believe that there's going to be substantial opportunity there for the foreseeable future, call that at least the next 2 to 3 years. So we feel that we'll have strong growth in that business. 
In the MOB side, it comes down substantially to relationships for the types of MOB assets that we want to add, either on-campus or strongly affiliated off-campus. Those relationships are critical because you have to have an invitation from the health system or the hospital. And so we have people that are working those relationships continuously. We've had good success with that. We've got people that have been in the business for decades. Tom Klaritch, just got about 3 decades in this business. I think he knows just about everybody out there. Justin Hill, others. And with that, we think we'll get more than our fair share. So some of that can be through development in the MOB side as with our HCA development program and others that we're working on with some health systems as well as being able to go out and compete with our scale and our cost of capital at times when assets come to market that fit our investment profile. 
So it's certainly competitive out there. There's no question about that. but we're very well positioned to get more than our fair share. And then occasionally, there will be a CCRC that pops up or 2 or 3 that there could be not-for-profit that based on their capitalization or it could be a for-profit that would like to connect in with a well-capitalized entity and we're the natural player to go to. And those types of transactions are going to yield 8%, 9%, even 10% FFO yields when we identify those. So yes, I think we've got opportunities in about 3 different fronts, both from an acquisition and from a development perspective. And the same thing applies in CCRCs. We've got a lot of will just call adjacent developable land to expand on these huge parcels. We've got over 150 acres of land connected with 15 different mega campuses and infill locations that are irreplaceable. So we've been -- we're going to move forward on a couple of those developments as well where we've got waiting lists in our independent living units, and those are going to be profitable for us too. So those are probably, Jordan, the plays that we're looking to make."

Just to update people or refresh memories, we had done a 10-year study, a very extensive study. It took us, I forget now is like about a quarter to complete it across our entire portfolio to look at every asset that as to what the outcome had been within our portfolio on on-campus versus off-campus affiliated versus off-campus unaffiliated. And just based on our knowledge and intuition as to what our portfolio has done, we had a pretty good sense for what the answer would be. But the NOI less CapEx returns, we wanted to get to a total cash flow return. We ended up across our entire portfolio at a plus 2.3% growth for on-campus. For off-campus affiliated, it was a positive 1.4%. And for off-campus unaffiliated, it was a minus 1.7%. And based on our sample size, which was pretty extensive, far fewer on the off-campus unaffiliated, so I recognize some others could have different outcomes. But that has dictated our approach from the very beginning of MedCap before we acquired MedCap and for the couple of decades since that we've always had a view that on-campus would perform better in off-campus affiliated would also perform quite well due to the fact that there are specialists, the stickiness of the nature of those tenants and the difficulty in adding new supply. 
And in the off-campus unaffiliated, especially the single tenant lease -- triple net lease exposure where a property can do great during the lease period and then it can end up empty or you're at the mercy of the 1 tenant. So how does that affect us going forward? It does not change our fundamental view on the value of on-campus and off-campus affiliated that we will lean in that direction. Off-campus unaffiliated would be very rare you'll see us seeking those types of assets. But I'm going to turn it to Tom and to Brinker to see if -- Klaritch, especially why don't you jump in first.

As far as CapEx redevelopment, Vikram, when you think in terms of an MOB, it has a much longer life to the improvements that are added through redev. So when we do a redev on an MOB, those improvements last anywhere from somewhere in the low 20s as far as the years. And if you went out and toured with us before and after property, on an on-campus where we're trying to maintain a high-quality product, it would become very, very apparent the difference that it makes in an MOB and how you can then capture rents and have a a happy hospital partner, and it produces real IRR. So we've been projecting to spend about $75 million a year on that, and we have been somewhere in that range, maybe a little less, at times, it could be a little bit more but it's in that range. We've been quite happy with that, and that does produce real long-term returns in IRR. 
As far as inflation on MOBs, that's kind of a broad question. I always think in terms of inflation with REITs in general. So why don't I just take a moment on that, and I'm not going to get too deep into it because I think everyone on this call has a pretty informed view on this topic, maybe not everybody has the same opinion, but a pretty informed view, but I'll give you my take, which is only my take. There are simply elements of any REIT that are both bond like and stock like. Inflation drives higher rental rates over time, but it also puts pressure on REITs in the short term as they act a little bit bond like as well. So the interaction of that almost becomes impossible to break apart into its components. I thought had a pretty nice study on this, by the way, whenever it was 3, 6 months ago, where he lined out different sectors and what the historical impact of inflation has been. I studied it. I talked to Steve about it. I thought it was quite interesting. But it's -- I think it's, again, well known that bond like, stock like and then how do you how do you figure out what the interaction of those 2 is. It's kind of impossible. 
But I do come back to real estate produces a yield. It produces a hedge against inflation and it's based on tangible assets. And when you think about people that are of retirement age, they want to yield on their money, they want inflation hedge, and they want to be intangible assets for the obvious reasons. Real estate creates an outstanding opportunity and will continue to. So I think inflation just becomes noise in the process. But over time, I think that, that balances out and it will be a very strong investment over time."

With the cluster concept and the inability to typically buy quality product at a reasonable price, while you have a growing tenant base. Fortunately, we've got some form of land bank and densification and life science development has produced a tremendous return for us. We're still modeling even today. 150 to 200 basis points amazingly exceed that even at current land costs. So it's a natural way to invest in life science. I would say it's a natural way to invest in MOBs too with relationship with health systems, but that -- there's a lot of work involved in capturing those relationships, identifying the opportunities and moving them forward. We've been successful in that front, too. And if you look at our pipeline, we do have a pretty good sized pipeline right now of MOB development opportunities, and I think that will continue to grow. I think life science though, the development side will continue to be a larger opportunity. And probably on the acquisition side, we may see more activity that makes sense for us across the MOB portfolio. Scott Brinker, what would you add to that or modify?"

I'll tell you what, Lucas, 1 of the things about being a seller is the money then has to go somewhere. I recognize there's always opportunities for special dividends and whatnot, but that's not really the play that we would typically be looking at. The fact is, is that if life science is continuing to have a decline in and cap rates is because the growth opportunity in rents and the supply demand dynamic continues to be strong. I've always said we're in the real estate business to be in the real estate business. And we want to diversify between the 2 businesses and even the third with CCRCs to smooth out the inevitable cyclical nature of each of the 3 businesses. So at the same time, I recognize there can be times when there's a price that somebody is willing to pay that you absolutely cannot refuse, and that always comes into play. But when I look at life science, in the, let's just call it for quality product in the low 4 cap rates, it's because there is such an enormous demand for this quality product within these clusters. And obviously, that means our NAV has gone up some and that's a good thing. At the same time, then it becomes harder to grow. So thank goodness, we've got a good-sized densification pipeline to grow high-quality product to meet our tenant demand. So I don't know, this could -- that's probably the topic of a 15-minute conversation because it's a great question. But if I was just to give you a quick answer, that's how I might respond.

One can look at the same thing today in MOB and life science against some of the other really hot sectors and make the argument that these 2 businesses, especially with the high barrier to entry for on-campus MOBs and life science in the 3 big markets and the clusters are of very high quality, irreplaceable and probably still have some value to capture to equate to cap rates in some other sectors. So that's an arguable item that, again, the investors and analysts on the screen are experts on that, and that's up for you guys to decide, but we still feel quite comfortable that the value is there in those assets, and there's further upside."

I might ask Mike and Scott to comment too. But if you just go 1 market at a time, in Boston, there's about 6 million square feet underway that will deliver through year-end 2022. It's about 80-plus percent pre-leased at least for the counts that are delivering in 2021. We're getting great traction on our 101 Cambridge Park Drive development that delivers in late '22. So we feel really good about the near-term outlook. Now there is a shadow pipeline of another 6 million square feet. The timing of that is obviously less certain. Some projects may get pushed back, some may get delayed indefinitely. And some of them may go tech because in the 3 core markets, that market for tech tenants continues to be really strong. We've seen that happen in the past. It will probably continue to be the case that some of this ""lab product "" will end up being occupied by tech tenants. And all these numbers that we quote do include conversions, even though in many cases, those aren't as competitive, we certainly don't ignore them. So that's the Boston outlook. 
In the Bay Area, today, there's about 2 million square feet underway. Virtually everything that's delivering through year-end 2021 is pre-leased. And we're getting great traction on some of our deliveries in 2022, really into 2023. So we feel really good about the outlook over the next 2 to 3 years in the Bay Area. There is a shadow pipeline there as well naturally. By our estimate, it's about 3 million square feet, subject to all the same comments I made about Boston. 
And then San Diego, there's about 2 million square feet underway. It's about 50% preleased. Most importantly, our 3 projects totaling almost 600,000 feet are 100% pre-leased. So that's the most relevant from our standpoint. And again, there is a shadow pipeline of about 2 million square feet in San Diego that we're keeping a very close eye on. That applies to all 3 markets, right? There's a lot of demand, but certainly, there is the potential for increased supply. It's something that we continue to monitor on a regular and very, very detailed basis."

Also on the line and available for the Q&A portion of the call are Tom Klaritch, our COO; and Troy McHenry, our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel.
We've maintained our strong start to the year. Our life science, MOB and CCRC businesses continue to perform well. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Our exit from rental senior housing is substantially complete, and we are having good success redeploying excess sales proceeds and have built a strong acquisition pipeline. Let me hit the high points.
Operating results across all 3 of our core businesses were ahead of our expectations. We're down to the final $150 million of rental senior housing sales, which are all under binding contracts. This leaves us with our interest in the sovereign wealth JV, which we will continue to evaluate with our partner. We acquired $425 million of MOBs in Q2 and another $205 million in July and which combined with our first quarter activity brings our year-to-date MOB acquisitions to $640 million, all of which were done on an off-market basis.
On the development side, life science market dynamics, projected deliveries and pre-leasing all remain favorable. During the second quarter, we signed a full campus lease for our Callan Ridge densification project. And yesterday, announced Sorrento Gateway is also fully spoken for, bringing our active life science development pipeline to 73% pre-leased or committed. Earlier this month, we issued $450 million of senior unsecured bonds due in 2027 in our inaugural green bond offering.
Given our operational progress, we raised our FFO adjusted guidance by $0.01 at the midpoint and same-store guidance by 50 basis points at the midpoint. Finally, in July, we published our tenth annual ESG report. Our ESG program continues to produce meaningful results and received industry and global recognition. Our team at Healthpeak is very pleased with the progress we've made over the last decade and are continuing to pursue and invest in initiatives that improve our overall ESG performance and support our long-term goals. So everything is progressing very well.
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker."

I'll begin with operating results, then provide an update on our development and investment activities. Starting with life science. 2020 saw record-setting biotech capital raising. 2021 is on pace to exceed those records. Capital inflows are fueling scientific breakthroughs and leading to accelerating real estate fundamentals. Demand continues to exceed supply and vacancies are at all-time lows, driving market rent growth of 10% or more over the past year.
During the quarter, we signed 233,000 feet of renewals at a 22% cash mark-to-market plus 121,000 feet of new leases. We've already exceeded our full year internal leasing budget and 3Q is off to a strong start. In July, we signed 90,000 feet of new leases, and we currently have a large pipeline under signed letters of intent, including 345,000 feet of renewals, 70,000 feet of new leasing and 415,000 feet on new developments.
Same-store NOI growth for the quarter was 7.4%, bringing year-to-date growth to 7.9%. The results were driven by in-place escalators, leasing activity, mark-to-market on renewals and burn off of free rent from the prior year. As discussed on the last call, we do expect same-store growth to moderate in the second half of the year due to difficult comps and proactive early terminations that will benefit future years.
Moving to medical office. Same-store NOI growth this quarter was 4.1%, driven by leasing activity, ad rents, strong collections and parking income. Hospital inpatient and outpatient volumes have returned to pre-COVID levels benefiting our unique on-campus portfolio. Leasing activity continues to outperform. We had more than 800,000 feet of commencements in the quarter, which is 200,000 feet ahead of plan. Retention is strong at 78% for the trailing 12 months, including 93% in June. Year-to-date, we've already completed 90% of our full year internal leasing budget.
Note that total portfolio occupancy declined a bit last quarter. This was driven by recently completed development and redevelopment properties entering the portfolio that are still in lease-up, plus a few recent acquisitions, lease-up opportunity. This gives us more NOI to capture in the future.
Finishing with CCRCs, where performance continues to recover. Occupancy was up 90 basis points from March to June. Entry fee cash receipts were $24 million, representing the highest level since 2019 and leading indicators are now in line with 2019 levels. With current occupancy at 80%, we have significant upside to capture at least 500 basis points on the low end. Same-store cash NOI growth was negative 23% for the quarter, driven by the CARES Act payments received in 2Q '20. Absent these onetime payments, same-store growth was positive 23% this quarter.
Turning to our development pipeline. We've executed guaranteed maximum price contracts on all of our active development projects, so we have very limited exposure to rising construction costs. Lease-up continues to exceed our underwriting on both rental rate and timing. In June, we signed a full building lease on our Callan Ridge densification project in San Diego. We expect to deliver the $140 million project in the first half of 2023, with a yield on cost in the low 9s based on the book value of our land.
In July, we signed a binding term sheet for the entire 163,000 square foot Sorrento Gateway development also in San Diego. We expect to deliver the $117 million project in the first half of 2023, with a yield on cost in the mid-8s based on the book value of our land. Those yields are far above what's achievable at today's land prices. If we mark our land to market, the yield on cost in the core markets where we play is more in the 6% to 7% range at today's construction costs and rental rates.
Moving to investments. In July, we closed the off-market acquisition of 3 MOBs that are leased to Atlantic Health. The asset share a campus proximate to the Morristown medical center, generally regarded as the #1 hospital in New Jersey. The stabilized cash cap rate is in the mid-5s. The acquisition also included a land parcel on the same campus that can accommodate up to 80,000 square feet of medical office development.
Also in July, we acquired a $50 million medical building in Wichita that's 100% leased to HCA. The price represents a 6.1% initial cash cap rate. This was an off-market acquisition and expands our existing presence in the market. In June, we acquired a $16 million MOB located on the campus of HCA's Westside hospital in Fort Lauderdale. The initial cash cap rate is 5.5%. Again, this was an off-market acquisition and expands our existing presence on this campus.
Looking forward, we have a strategic acquisition and development pipeline across our business segments. Against the backdrop of compressing cap rates, we remain focused on using our relationships to create opportunities not available to the broader market. We also continue to advance densification opportunities across all 3 of our business segments, which will be a source of growth for the next decade plus on land we already own.
Finally, we're balancing acquisitions that are immediately accretive with value-creating development opportunities that naturally come with short-term earnings drag. As a result, our acquisition pipeline is a mix of stabilized assets, lease-up properties and covered land plays. The blended initial yield will depend on the relative mix of opportunities that ultimately proceed.
With that, I'll turn it to Pete."
277966,1673196848,2362843,"Healthpeak Properties, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Healthpeak Properties, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the second quarter, we reported FFO",624,"Thanks, Scott. I'll start today with a review of our financial results, provide an update on our recent balance sheet activity and finish with a discussion of our 2021 guidance. Starting with our financial results. For the second quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.40 per share and blended same-store growth of 1.2%.
Two notable same-store items. First, our 13 LCS operated CCRCs entered the quarterly same-store pool in the second quarter and accounted for 12% of the overall pool. Second, as Scott mentioned, our CCRCs were significantly impacted by the onetime CARES Act grant we received in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusting for CARES Act grants, pro forma blended second quarter same-store growth across the portfolio was 7.6%. 
Until the LCS operated CCRCs enter the full year same-store pool in 2022, we believe our quarterly same-store results are more reflective of how our overall portfolio is performing. Last item within financial results. On July 29, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share, representing an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 86% for the second quarter.
Turning to our balance sheet. Since our last earnings call, we continue to improve upon our fortress balance sheet. We completed the repayment of $550 million of bonds maturing in 2025. We issued $450 million of 5-year green bonds at a rate of 1.35%. We completed the repayment of our $250 million term loan maturing in 2024, and we received $246 million of seller financing early repayments.
As a result of our balance sheet activity, we ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.6x, providing us with dry powder for acquisitions. We have no significant debt maturities until February 2025, and we have ample open maturity slots in 2028, 2032 and beyond, allowing us to fund near-term transactions with 5-year and 10-year debt.
Turning to our guidance. We are increasing our guidance as follows: FFO's adjusted revised from $1.53 to $1.61 per share; two, $1.55 to $1.61 per share, an increase of $0.01 at the midpoint. Blended same-store NOI growth revised from 1.75% to 3.25%, to 2.25% to 3.75%, an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint.
Let me spend a minute level setting all the major components of our revised guidance. Starting with FFO as adjusted. We have had a strong start to the year with $0.80 per share FFO as adjusted, inclusive of $0.01 of nonrecurring CARES Act grants. As a result, we have increased the midpoint of guidance by $0.03 per share compared to our original 2021 guidance. While we are trending towards the higher end of our revised guidance range, we feel it is prudent to maintain some conservatism given the uncertain market conditions.
Turning to acquisitions. We have increased the low end of our acquisition guidance to $800 million, an increase of $100 million to account for our recent closed transaction. We will update our guidance further as transactions firm up and we get a better sense for timing and pricing. As a reminder, we intend to fund acquisitions with debt until we hit our target leverage of 5.5x.
Turning to CCRC. We are reaffirming the $70 million to $90 million NOI range for the LCS CCRCs. While performance has been strong year-to-date, we have determined it is too early to adjust guidance given the uncertainty of the COVID Delta variant and increased labor costs.
One last item on CARES Act grants. We have reduced our guidance for CARES Act grants from $9 million to $6 million, which represent all the grants we have received year-to-date. Any additional CARES Act funding we could potentially receive for the balance of the year would be upside to guidance.
With that, operator, let's open the line for Q&A."

It obviously varies from quarter-to-quarter depending upon which leases are renewing, just given that there is a spread across the portfolio, some are bigger than others. This quarter, we were at 22%. Year-to-date, we're in the high teens. And that's probably reflective of where the portfolio is overall.
If we look across the 10-plus years that the current leases maturity is going to bounce around, but that's our best guess as to our mark-to-market across the whole portfolio. But with rents growing at 10-plus percent in all 3 core markets over the past year, obviously, that mark-to-market could continue to grow. We do see demand continuing to exceed supply, at least in the foreseeable future. So we would expect to have continued success on that metric."

We're believers that you don't want too many JVs out there, it complicates the organization. And if an investment is a strong investment, we prefer typically to own it on balance sheet, or 100% on balance sheet.
So the fund aspect to us doesn't light us up all that much. As to JVs, we felt differently in Boston, where we needed to build the business, get our foot in. There was a lot of expertise there with King Street Bulfinch that we tapped into. And we would consider continuing that in Boston.
There's an element with JVs and life science within clusters where joint ventures really are disadvantageous because the objective is to allow biotechs to grow and easily move between our properties within clusters. And joint ventures, obviously create other interest from partners that can stand in the way of smooth transactions in that respect. So that's not something that we're looking to do a lot of on the life science side.
On the MOB side, those are relationship-driven deals, and we typically prefer -- almost always prefer to own 100%. Of those deals, the time when it can occur where a joint venture might make sense is if we're doing a development deal with a player that has lots of contacts, they're identifying the business, they use their relationships. We come in with the money. They get some kind of a promote on the back end, and we ultimately own the real estate, those are attractive to us as well. So that's how we think about JVs and funds are not something that we would consider."

And then we have an asset management team and a leasing team that oversees the property managers and the leasing agents out in the field. Those guys are out meeting with hospitals, meeting with major tenants really weekly. They travel as much as 50% to 60% of the time, and they're maintaining the relationships at the hospital level. So we really don't lose that aspect of it.
And then obviously, on the system side, we have our VPs, myself, are dealing with the major systems. So I don't really see it as a real negative to relationships. We maintain those pretty well. And having that structure just allows us to move in and out of markets really easily.
If you look at the 2 larger acquisitions we did in the past couple of months, the Midwest portfolio and Harrison St, we very easily moved into those markets, took over management and literally overnight we're managing those properties, without having to deal with all of the personnel issues that you would have to if you internalize it.

It came with a lot of excess land, either totally unimproved or surface parking that when we made the acquisition, we always had in mind that if demand continues to be strong, there could be the opportunity to utilize some of that excess land on the campus for more density.
It does require entitlements. So that process is underway at a couple of our sites. Similar example at our West Cambridge campus, the Discovery Park, where the purchase came with some vacant land and excess FAR.
In terms of the purchase price, we like the deal on a stand-alone basis. The cap rate made a lot of sense. The geography made sense. But this added benefit of having excess land on the campus that could be densified with additional entitlements over time was pretty intriguing to us.
So we do have examples like that in the portfolio, and we're in the middle of that entitlement process now. So that's attractive and that land across the 3 core markets is trading for probably at least $200 per developable foot. And if you're able to build new properties without purchasing land, that obviously makes the economics much more accretive."

But one of the things that we have the advantage of is we already have huge scale. And just adding more huge scale just for the sake of getting bigger is not what we're about. We're seeking to grow our earnings on a consistent basis. And singles and doubles and occasional triples allow us to look at each transaction 1 by 1 to ensure that we believe that those are individually good decisions.
When you take a whole company down, and I've done that a few times in my career, there's always a group of assets that you're really like, maybe some that you like a little and maybe some of you really wish you didn't have to deal with. So that is one thing when you do M&A that does come to mind.
Oftentimes, it gets very competitive in the process as we all know. And by the time you end up being the winning better if you are, you're almost at that point where you're not sure if you wish you won the deal or didn't. Unless it's going to be clearly accretive, which in today's environment, MOBs are a hot commodity, maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't. And so oftentimes, you'd just be playing for synergies.
We do have a tendency to look at the portfolio to see how strategic it is, how does it fit in, how much real estate really doesn't fit our profile that we would need to deal with. And then there's always social issues, too. I mean there's a whole group of find people on the other side of this that are trying to figure out their path and their career as well. And then how does that fit in?
So just a lot of different things to consider with M&A that it seems so obvious that go out and get as big as you can and grow, but it comes with pros and cons. And the scale of an advantage, but you got to recognize, too, it's also a disadvantage. It's a lot easier to move the needle with growth when you've got a smaller company than if you get huge. So I'm not saying that we're forward or against it. In some cases, it would make sense. Some cases, it wouldn't, but those are the types of things we look at."

So economically, we were made whole for the balance of the year until the new leases start. But obviously, we don't count that for cash NOI in terms of same-store, and it also impacts occupancy.
So the answer to your question is those 2 proactive terminations alone represent about 140 basis points of occupancy in the portfolio, and those are in same store. And the impact on cash NOI in the second half of the year in the aggregate, it's about 170, 180 basis points. So it's material to the second half of the year.
Obviously, if we were managing the portfolio based on same-store NOI, we would not make those decisions, but we're not. We're managing it to make the best economic decisions over time. So it will be a drag in the second half of the year, but a long-term benefit. And fortunately, we were still able to increase guidance now twice in a pretty material way due to the strength and the balance of the portfolio. Pete, anything you'd add?"

And I will just reiterate, and as I said in the prepared remarks, we are trending towards the higher end of our revised guidance range. But given the uncertain market conditions as well as what's embedded within the high end of our guidance too is our transaction pipeline firming up. So as we factored all of those things into the equation, we felt that a $0.01 increase in the midpoint made sense right now."

So there are thresholds. I won't share the specifics on the call, but certainly, when we have our committee discussions, it's not just a discussion around a particular project, but how does it fit into the balance of the portfolio. Clearly, every time we sign a new lease, like we have quite a few times this year, particularly in San Diego, it gives us a little more confidence to commence the next development project.
And we definitely feel like the remaining unleased portion of our development pipeline is showing great momentum as well. So hopefully, we'll have more news to report in terms of new development starts. But trying to balance that with more accretive near-term acquisitions, that is a goal. We've done almost $650 million of medical office to date.
Now they stabilize in the 5% to 6% range, but not all of them achieve those yields right away. So there is some lease-up potential within that big acquisition portfolio as well. And it's a balance. We evaluate each individual asset and opportunity on its own, but also have to put it in the context of a desire to deliver some near-term earnings growth in addition to the tremendous longer-term value creation that comes with these big development projects.
Covered land is an interesting play because it allows you to generate some level of earnings. And given our current cost of capital, it might be modestly dilutive but certainly not as dilutive as it would be to buy vacant land and then go through an entitlement process. So we try to balance all of those different metrics as we deploy capital. Pete, anything you'd add?"

I'd also encourage you to take a look at 41 and 42, the pages within the supplemental since we give a lot of detailed information on what builds up for the low and the high end.
But $0.01 raise for this quarter comes from a bunch of different items, right? One, we did increase life sciences and MOB same-store 75 and 25 basis points, respectively. So those businesses are doing great. We lowered the interest expense a bit given the success of that green bond deal. And then we moderately increased our acquisition guidance.
So what would be the 2 areas where we could see some risk today, I'd say the first would be on CCRC. And if you look at where we are year-to-date, we're at $40 million for the LCS CCRCs that annualized is right to the midpoint, it's $70 million to $90 million. So there's probably $0.02 there from the midpoint down to the lower end.
And then I would also point you to acquisition guidance. We've got $800 million of unidentified at this point built in. So the 2 items of risk would be firming up that acquisition pipeline and the timing of that as well as the yields and then on the CCRCs again, we're trending well and that's something I want to reiterate. But I think at this point, we felt like a $0.01 increase is what made sense, and we'll continue to reevaluate as the pipeline firms up and as the year progresses."

We're constantly working on our land bank densification opportunities within life science. And within the clusters that we built in and the built-in natural demand that comes from a tenant base, based on demand, supply characteristics, the continued boom in biotech and the growth of those companies, we do believe that there's going to be substantial opportunity there for the foreseeable future, call that at least the next 2 to 3 years. So we feel that we'll have strong growth in that business.
In the MOB side, it comes down substantially to relationships for the types of MOB assets that we want to add, either on-campus or strongly affiliated off-campus. Those relationships are critical because you have to have an invitation from the health system or the hospital.
And so we have people that are working those relationships continuously. We've had good success with that. We've got people that have been in the business for decades. Tom Klaritch, just got about 3 decades in this business. I think he knows just about everybody out there. Justin Hill, others. And with that, we think we'll get more than our fair share.
So some of that can be through development in the MOB side as with our HCA development program and others that we're working on with some health systems as well as being able to go out and compete with our scale and our cost of capital at times when assets come to market that fit our investment profile.
So it's certainly competitive out there. There's no question about that. but we're very well positioned to get more than our fair share. And then occasionally, there will be a CCRC that pops up or 2 or 3 that there could be a not-for-profit that based on their capitalization or it could be a for-profit that would like to connect in with a well-capitalized entity and we're the natural player to go to.
And those types of transactions are going to yield 8%, 9%, even 10% FFO yields when we identify those. So yes, I think we've got opportunities in about 3 different fronts, both from an acquisition and from a development perspective. And the same thing applies in CCRCs. We've got a lot of will just call adjacent developable land to expand on these huge parcels. We've got over 150 acres of land connected with 15 different mega campuses and infill locations that are irreplaceable.
So we've been -- we're going to move forward on a couple of those developments as well where we've got waiting lists in our independent living units, and those are going to be profitable for us too. So those are probably, Jordan, the plays that we're looking to make."

It took us, I forget now is like about a quarter to complete it across our entire portfolio to look at every asset that as to what the outcome had been within our portfolio on on-campus versus off-campus affiliated versus off-campus unaffiliated.
And just based on our knowledge and intuition as to what our portfolio has done, we had a pretty good sense for what the answer would be. But the NOI less CapEx returns, we wanted to get to a total cash flow return. We ended up across our entire portfolio at a plus 2.3% growth for on-campus. For off-campus affiliated, it was a positive 1.4%. And for off-campus unaffiliated, it was a minus 1.7%.
And based on our sample size, which was pretty extensive, far fewer on the off-campus unaffiliated, so I recognize some others could have different outcomes. But that has dictated our approach from the very beginning of MedCap before we acquired MedCap and for the couple of decades since that we've always had a view that on-campus would perform better and off-campus affiliated would also perform quite well due to the fact that there are specialists, the stickiness of the nature of those tenants and the difficulty in adding new supply.
And in the off-campus unaffiliated, especially the single tenant lease -- triple net lease exposure where a property can do great during the lease period and then it can end up empty or you're at the mercy of the 1 tenant. So how does that affect us going forward? It does not change our fundamental view on the value of on-campus and off-campus affiliated that we will lean in that direction. Off-campus unaffiliated would be very rare, you'll see us seeking those types of assets. But I'm going to turn it to Tom and to Brinker to see if -- Klaritch, especially why don't you jump in first.

As far as CapEx redevelopment, Vikram, when you think in terms of an MOB, it has a much longer life to the improvements that are added through redev. So when we do a redev on an MOB, those improvements last anywhere from somewhere in the low 20s as far as the years.
And if you went out and toured with us before and after property,on an on-campus where we're trying to maintain a high-quality product, it would become very, very apparent the difference that it makes in an MOB and how you can then capture rents and have a happy hospital partner, and it produces real IRR.
So we've been projecting to spend about $75 million a year on that, and we have been somewhere in that range, maybe a little less, at times it could be a little bit more, but it's in that range. We've been quite happy with that, and that does produce real long-term returns in IRR.
As far as inflation on MOBs, that's kind of a broad question. I always think in terms of inflation with REITs in general. So why don't I just take a moment on that, and I'm not going to get too deep into it because I think everyone on this call has a pretty informed view on this topic, maybe not everybody has the same opinion, but a pretty informed view, but I'll give you my take, which is only my take.
There are simply elements of any REIT that are both bond like and stock like. Inflation drives higher rental rates over time, but it also puts pressure on REITs in the short term as they act a little bit bond like as well. So the interaction of that almost becomes impossible to break apart into its components.
I thought [ Zackway ] had a pretty nice study on this, by the way, whenever it was 3, 6 months ago, where he lined out different sectors and what the historical impact of inflation has been. I studied it. I talked to Steve about it. I thought it was quite interesting. But it's -- I think it's, again, well known that bond like, stock like and then how do you figure out what the interaction of those 2 is. It's kind of impossible.
But I do come back to real estate produces a yield. It produces a hedge against inflation and it's based on tangible assets. And when you think about people that are of retirement age that want yield on their money, they want inflation hedge, and they want to be intangible assets for the obvious reasons. Real estate creates an outstanding opportunity and will continue to. So I think inflation just becomes noise in the process. But over time, I think that, that balances out and it will be a very strong investment over time."

With the cluster concept and the inability to typically buy quality product at a reasonable price, while you have a growing tenant base. Fortunately, we've got some form of land bank and densification and life science development has produced a tremendous return for us. We're still modeling even today, 150 to 200 basis points amazingly exceed that even at current land costs. So it's a natural way to invest in life science.
I would say it's a natural way to invest in MOBs too with relationship with health systems, but that -- there's a lot of work involved in capturing those relationships, identifying the opportunities and moving them forward. We've been successful in that front, too. And if you look at our pipeline, we do have a pretty good sized pipeline right now of MOB development opportunities, and I think that will continue to grow.
I think life science though, the development side will continue to be a larger opportunity. And probably on the acquisition side, we may see more activity that makes sense for us across the MOB portfolio. Scott Brinker, what would you add to that or modify?"

I'll tell you what, Lukas, one of the things about being a seller is the money then has to go somewhere. I recognize there's always opportunities for special dividends and whatnot, but that's not really the play that we would typically be looking at.
The fact is, is that if life science is continuing to have a decline in and cap rates is because the growth opportunity in rents and the supply demand dynamic continues to be strong. I've always said we're in the real estate business to be in the real estate business. And we want to diversify between the 2 businesses and even the third with CCRCs to smooth out the inevitable cyclical nature of each of the 3 businesses.
So at the same time, I recognize there can be times when there's a price that somebody is willing to pay that you absolutely cannot refuse, and that always comes into play. But when I look at life science, in the -- let's just call it for quality product in the low 4 cap rates, it's because there is such an enormous demand for this quality product within these clusters. And obviously, that means our NAV has gone up some and that's a good thing.
At the same time, then it becomes harder to grow. So thank goodness, we've got a good-sized densification pipeline to grow high-quality product to meet our tenant demand. So I don't know, this could -- that's probably the topic of a 15-minute conversation because it's a great question. But if I was just to give you a quick answer, that's how I might respond.

One can look at the same thing today in MOB and life science against some of the other really hot sectors and make the argument that these 2 businesses, especially with the high barrier to entry for on-campus MOBs and life science in the 3 big markets and the clusters are of very high quality, irreplaceable and probably still have some value to capture to equate to cap rates in some other sectors.

It's about 80-plus percent pre-leased, at least for the malls that are delivering in 2021. We're getting great traction on our 101 Cambridge Park Drive development that delivers in late '22. So we feel really good about the near-term outlook.
Now there is a shadow pipeline of another 6 million square feet. The timing of that is obviously less certain. Some projects may get pushed back, some may get delayed indefinitely. And some of them may go tech because in the 3 core markets, that market for tech tenants continues to be really strong.
We've seen that happen in the past. It will probably continue to be the case that some of this ""lab product "" will end up being occupied by tech tenants. And all these numbers that we quote, Lukas, do include conversions, even though in many cases, those aren't as competitive, we certainly don't ignore them. So that's the Boston outlook.
In the Bay Area, today, there's about 2 million square feet underway. Virtually everything that's delivering through year-end 2021 is pre-leased. And we're getting great traction on some of our deliveries in 2022, really into 2023. So we feel really good about the outlook over the next 2 to 3 years in the Bay Area. There is a shadow pipeline there as well naturally. By our estimate, it's about 3 million square feet, subject to all the same comments I made about Boston.
And then San Diego, there's about 2 million square feet underway. It's about 50% preleased. Most importantly, our 3 projects totaling almost 600,000 feet are 100% pre-leased. So that's the most relevant from our standpoint. And again, there is a shadow pipeline of about 2 million square feet in San Diego that we're keeping a very close eye on. That applies to all 3 markets, right? There's a lot of demand, but certainly, there is the potential for increased supply.

Our Q3 operating and earnings results were favorable. Meanwhile, we have been very active and productive in our transaction, development and leasing activities. Let me hit the high points. 
Starting with operations. Our life science and MOB businesses, which represent close to 90% of our Q3 NOI continued to perform above expectations, while our combined CCRC and sovereign wealth fund JV performance was roughly in line with expectations. 
On the transaction front, we closed our remaining $150 million of rental senior housing sales, bringing total sales since July of 2020 to $4 billion. And we redeployed the entire of sales proceeds into our core life science and MOB acquisitions and debt reduction. 
In Life Science, we announced a $625 million largely contiguous assemblage of operating and covered land investments in West Cambridge. With the strategic play, we have now captured the majority of the high-quality developable land in this important submarket and plan to develop multiple Class A life science properties over the next decade plus. 
In MOBs, we added 3 new acquisitions, bringing our year-to-date MOB acquisitions to approximately $780 million, which are primarily on-campus. We were also awarded 3 new developments from HCA, 2 traditional medical office buildings, along with a standalone nursing school that will be fully leased by HCA. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to continue to focus our MOB growth on flow business to leverage our platform, scale and relationships, hitting accretive singles and doubles. 
Moving to development. Our Life Science development program continues to see positive momentum as fundamentals remain strong across our 3 core markets of San Francisco, Boston and San Diego. A $1.2 billion active development pipeline is 87% pre-leased with the remaining unleased space and active discussions. Given this, yesterday, we announced the commencement of our $393 million Vantage Phase 1 development in South San Francisco. 
With the scheduled closings of the remaining West Cambridge acquisitions, we will have aggregated 7 million square feet or $10 billion plus of embedded development and densification opportunities across our 3 businesses and all fully under our ownership and control. 
One final comment. This quarter, we added to our ESG recognition with the GRESB Green Star designation and inclusion in the FTSE4Good Sustainability Index, both for the tenth consecutive year. We're proud that ESG has and will continue to be woven into the fabric of our corporate culture. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

I'll cover operating results then discuss acquisitions and development. Starting with Life Science results. Virtually, our entire footprint is in the 3 hot beds of biotech innovation, Boston, San Francisco and San Diego. Over the past 4 decades, these markets have developed an unmatched ecosystem of academics, capital and scientific talent, placing the heart of the biotech revolution that's just getting started. 
We've purposely chosen to concentrate our resources and build a strong position in these markets, which is driving strong performance. Year-to-date, we signed 2.2 million square feet of leases, which is 2x our full year budget from the beginning of the year. The leasing success was broad-based across all 3 markets and included new developments, renewals and expansions. 
In the third quarter, we signed 406,000 square feet of renewals at a 20% cash mark-to-market, that's in line with the current upside across our entire life science rent roll. So of course, the mark-to-market will vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 
Same-store cash NOI growth for the quarter was 6.8%, bringing year-to-date growth to 7.7%. The results were driven by contractual escalators, leasing activity and mark-to-market on renewals. Looking forward, we have a leasing pipeline of nearly 600,000 square feet under signed letters of intent, including new developments, renewals and expansions with existing tenants. 
Our run rate, annual cash NOI for Life Science now exceeds $500 million and is in the $600 million range, including development leases that have been signed but not yet commenced. 
Moving to medical office. Leasing activity continues to outperform our expectations. We had 700,000 square feet of commencements in the quarter. Mark-to-market on renewals was 2.3% and retention was strong at 80% for the trailing 12 months, both in line with historical averages. 
We're seeing strong demand in Nashville, Seattle, Dallas and Denver, all markets where you've seen us grow in recent quarters. Thanks to our cash NOI growth, this quarter was 2.9%, toward the high end of our historical range, driven by leasing activity, strong collections and part the income. We're also benefiting from our green investments to reduce carbon footprint and operating cost. 
Hospital inpatient and outpatient volumes are strong and hospitals continue to invest in our affiliated properties, benefiting our unique on-campus portfolio. Finishing with CCRCs. Our concentration in Florida is a long-term positive, but made for a more challenging third quarter as the state was hit hard by the Delta variant. This had a temporary impact on occupancy, especially in assisted living and skilled. Consistent with the national headlines, labor is a headwind. As a result, same-store cash NOI growth was negative 1.7% for the quarter, excluding CARES Act funding. 
Independent living represents 2/3 of the total unit count at our campuses and demand for those units is strong. The number of entry fee sales in 3Q was nearly back to 2019 levels, and entry free cash receipts in the quarter exceeded historical levels. We have strong pricing power in most of our markets, supported by the housing market. 
Moving to medical office acquisitions. In September, we acquired 2 on-campus MOBs in Dallas, affiliated with the Baylor Scott & White system for $60 million. This was an off-market acquisition and expands our #1 medical office market share in Dallas. 
In October, we acquired an MOB in Seattle for $43 million. The building expands our footprint on the campus of Swedish Medical Center to 600,000 square feet. We see potential to significantly densify the site over time, taking advantage of the land locked location next to one of Seattle's leading hospitals. Also in October, we acquired a 55,000 square foot MOB on the campus of an HA Hospital in New Orleans at $34 million. Once again, this acquisition was done off market. 
Turning to life science development. Lease up is exceeding our underwriting on both the rate and timing. Our active development pipeline is now 87% pre-leased, excluding Vantage Phase 1, which commenced yesterday. The final phase of the shore is now 100% pre-leased and the rate on the final lease was 32% higher than the initial lease we signed at the shore just 3 years ago. 
Then, San Francisco with very strong leasing activity at our Nexus project, Nextdoor, we chose to commence development at Vantage. A picture can say a thousand words, so please take a look at the investment deck we published yesterday. On Page 7, you'll see that the Vantage campus sits in the heart of South San Francisco, adjacent to our Nexus and Point Brand campuses. Phase 1 will include 343,000 square feet and deliver in the second half of 2023. Upon completion of all phases, the Vantage campus will include at least 1 million square feet of Class A lab and potentially far more subject to entitlements which are ongoing. 
Moving to San Diego, where we fully pre-leased our 540,000 square feet of active development. In the third quarter, we secured the next phase of our growth with a covered land play acquisition. The site sits between our existing Sorrento Gateway and Sorrento Summit campuses, all of which have excellent visibility and accessibility from Interstate 805. Once the site is developed, we'll have 700,000 square feet across these 3 campuses. 
In Boston, our 101 CambridgePark Drive project in Alewife delivered in 4Q '22 is now 88% pre-leased. The average lease rate is $99 per foot or 27% above our underwriting. This project brings our footprint in the Alewife submarket of West Cambridge to 1.1 million square feet across 18 acres. And that brings us to the series of acquisitions we announced yesterday. 
In 8 separate transactions totaling $625 million of initial investment, we assembled 36 acres of largely contiguous land in the AOA submarket West Cambridge. We now have a significant development opportunity on the East Coast to balance our enormous development pipeline in South San Francisco. 
The blended Year 1 FFO yield is 4.2% with the potential for huge earnings and NAV upside in the future. Roughly 1/4 of the $625 million investment represents stabilized cash flowing acquisitions, the remainder are covered land plays, primarily single-store industrial and flex office that we intend to eventually replace with Class A lab buildings in phases over the next decade plus. We'll be working with the City of Cambridge on the development plan and have more to share in coming quarters. 
If you turn to Page 4 of yesterday's investment deck, you'll see the assemblages within walking distance to our existing holdings in Both sites have commuter access by train, car and bike. In particular, we're within walking distance to the train station and adjacent to Route 2 in the bike path, all of which connect Cambridge, Downtown Boston and the Western suburbs. These campus settings are a competitive advantage for leasing because we can provide world-class amenities, infrastructure and flexibility for tenants to grow without relocating. This is very, very different than owning a single lab building in an isolated location. 
I'll turn it to Pete."

For the third quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.40 per share and blended same-store growth of 3.2%. Our strong results are driven by continued outperformance in both life science and medical office. And for the third quarter, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 5x. We expect to reach our mid-5x target leverage ratio by the end of the year with the majority of our announced acquisition activity closing in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, we closed on an upsized $3 billion revolving credit facility, an increase of $500 million. The upsized revolver provides us with significant benefits. It increases our liquidity position. It extends our debt maturity profile, and it reduces our overall borrowing costs. We had 100% of our banking group re-up their commitment, which is a testament to their confidence in our company and our future. 
Also, during the quarter, we raised net proceeds of approximately $320 million of equity under our ATM program at a blended gross stock price of approximately $35.60 per share. All of the equity was raised under 18-month forward contracts. Pro forma the settlement of our equity forwards, third quarter net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is reduced to 4.7x. 
Turning to our guidance. We are increasing our 2021 guidance as follows: FFO as adjusted revised from $1.55 to $1.61 per share to $1.58 to $1.62 per share, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint; blended same-store NOI growth revised from 2.25% in to 3.75% to 3.5% to 4%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. 
The major components of our revised guidance are as follows: in Life Sciences, we had increased the midpoint of our same-store guidance by 75 basis points to 6.5%; in medical office, we have increased the midpoint of our same-store guidance by 25 basis points to 2.75%. For our significant nonsame-store portfolios, we have tightened our guidance range to $85 million to $105 million, leaving the midpoint unchanged. 
Finishing with acquisition. Year-to-date, we have announced $1.6 billion of acquisitions that have either closed or are under contract. Accordingly, we have updated our acquisition guidance to reflect this activity. Please refer to Pages 41 and 42 of our supplemental for additional details on our guidance revision. 
With that, operator, let's open the line for Q&A."

When you look at our land plays across the country, it does sum up to at this point for what we've acquired and we're in a contract to acquire 7-plus million square feet across our life science business, $10 billion-plus opportunity. So it is a massive opportunity over the next decade plus. I would think in terms of maybe 2.5 million square feet of that being in the East Coast now in the Greater Boston area, primarily West Cambridge and probably 4.5 million of it sitting in South San Francisco, Brisbane, and then some down in Sorrento Mesa. 
So we have an enormous opportunity without any need to purchase additional land for a long time. These are going to be in what we would think of as very substantial campuses that create strong clusters over time, which is, obviously, I think, as you all know, vital to success in life science. It takes advantage of the virtuous cycle of aging population and new biologics live organism-type drug discoveries, the FDA approval time, the heavy VC, NIH, IPO funding, which has quadrupled in the last decade, along with the ecosystem of research universities and scientific talent and like I said, all this venture capital being deeply engaged in these markets. 
So we think that that's going to create an enormous opportunity for us across -- on both coasts, and that probably lines us out for quite a while, some very accretive opportunities with land that could not be replicated today. The land sites that we picked up are in the heart of some of the best life science markets really in the world. And when we think about we just acquired this assemblage in West Cambridge that, that was about a 6-month effort, it -- we did not think we could put something together that substantial during that period of time. Unfortunately, we were able to. So the vast majority of the strong developable land in that submarket is going to pay great dividends to us, we believe. 
So Brinker, anything you would add on that and how you're thinking about it?"

Maybe I'll try to also address that question about the location and what we found attractive about it, and it's a couple of things we'd point to. One is to -- it does have the Cambridge address, which is obviously an important factor for the tenants and yet it's $20 to $30 per foot cheaper than East Cambridge, which realistically is sold out anyway, but economically more attractive. 
It does have the strong accessibility, which is obviously important in a big market like Boston with Route 2, the red line, bike path. So really, no matter how you're commuting, you've got pretty good access to this location. And then it does have an established reputation. It's not like we're breaking new ground here. There's a strong life science history in West Cambridge around 2 million square feet today, of which we're by far the biggest player. And then the fact that we're able to develop something in scale was ultimately what was the deciding factor here. It was just a single parcel with 1 building that's not nearly as interesting. There's a lot of new entrants doing that. There's a lot of conversions that can do that. But the ability to put together 36 acres with the Cambridge address is pretty much unheard of, and that was ultimately the deciding factor and deciding to proceed. 
We put together 8 separate transactions, but it was really 2 fairly big parcels that were the Linchpin, the Muni Street campus and then the Concord Avenue campus. And then once we got clarity that we could get those, we wanted to work and put together the surrounding parcels as well. And who knows, there might be more to do in that submarket."

Now some of those buildings have mark-to-market built into them. But oftentimes, that's pretty far into the future. So it's probably still a pretty realistic. Cap rate, that's probably down 50 basis points at least over the past 12 months given the strength in the marketplace and just the number of capital sources looking to invest in builder presence in life science. 
And then in medical office, I mean, similar forces, given the interest in the sector, but the cap rates there for quality product, they're probably in the mid-4s to mid-5s. So a broader range because there's just more variability in the building by building in terms of who the tenants are on-campus versus off-campus, but it's hard to find really high-quality buildings that fit our criteria for anything more than a 5 cap in today's market.

We recognize it's a bit unique to disclose an FFO yield as opposed to a cap rate. But given the unique nature of this portfolio, which is a combination of stabilized properties and covered land, we thought an FFO yield was most appropriate. So investors and yourselves on the research side to better understand the Year 1 impact. 
If you refer to Page 5 of our investor deck, it provides details on each transaction. So of the 8 assets and $625 million purchase price, 3 of the assets we categorized and stabilized with a total purchase price of $187, million. That's 10 Bos 7 25 and 25 plus the Concorde Avenue campus, which we do categorize as covered land and which we acquired for $180 million, that asset is currently 100% leased to Raytheon for 6 more years. 
So the stabilized asset plus the Concord Avenue campus, which together totals around $370 million. The blended Year 1 GAAP cap rate, so from an NOI -- GAAP NOI perspective is approximately a 5% yield across all of those. So the balance of the portfolio, which we call covered land which is around $255 million, we will capitalize interest on those assets at approximately 3%. That's our current weighted average debt interest rate. And since we started this effort about 6 months ago to assemble all of these assets, we already -- we're well underway on our internal and external design team and we're working towards entitlement planning and ultimate design of this campus over time. So we're capitalizing interest on those already. 
So if you add all that up, I know that's a lot, but I want to make sure you have all the pieces, that's around $370 million out of 5 cap and then it's around $255 million at a 3% capitalized interest with Blend 2042. Maybe I'll turn it over to Tom, if you want to add anything to that?"

We're having really solid leasing momentum. We announced that project earlier this year. We were projecting more of a mid- to high 6s return. It looks like we'll do quite a bit better than that. 
And then in West Cambridge, it is a bit more expensive to build there, not dramatically so, but the all-in cost for our underwriting. It's somewhere in the $1,300 per foot range. And I say range because it's still a little unclear exactly how much we'll be able to build, and that will obviously impact our land prices, but a decent estimate would be $1,300 per foot in West Cambridge, if you were building today, given our land cost. And then obviously, we just announced last night that we signed leases at $99 per foot on average within walking distance of that site. So the simple math on that one is a mid-7s return on cost as well.
And Tom, you wanted to add something?"

When you talked about new supply in these 2 markets and how do we think about, how they make money and Brinker mentioned the $1,300 a foot in West Cambridge, $1,100 a foot to develop inclusive of land in San Francisco, West Cambridge $100 rents, South San Francisco $85 rents, producing something in the mid-7s. 
Those are obviously returns that are higher than what somebody would achieve in the market today if they bought land at market, which we've seen a solid 30% to 50% increase in high-quality land as far as pricing, bringing those spreads down if one was to do a market transaction today, if you could find the high-quality land probably more back to that 150, 200 basis point spread in the mid-7s against our cost of capital, if that held, that's a solid 300-plus basis point spread in 4.25 cap type assets, do the math on that on the NAV accretion and on the earnings accretion, it's quite substantial. 
And I'm not trying to speak to returns that will be years down the road. But when you think in terms of the value of having locked up some of the best land and some of the best submarkets in the world, it really is going to allow us to be in a position where we're aware of new supply like everybody is. But if you've got -- if our land locations are in some of the hottest markets and the ecosystems with the greatest energy, we do think we'll get far more than our fair share of that leasing and that that's going to be a profitable outcome for us for years to come. I think if we were starting from scratch, we would have an absolute possible time replicating that potential outcome. So I think it's a very strategic point that you've raised."

Steve, if we roll back a half a dozen years, we were spending just on pure development, I'm not talking readout about $100 million a year in development, that's ramped up. That's easily in the 400-plus range at this point. We would see that ramping up further to probably $600 million a year and maybe over time higher. But one of the things that we do pay a lot of attention to is the demand/supply work that we're doing so that we can time it appropriately. We look at pre-leasing. We look at funding risk, being very clear on where our funding is going to come from and Pete Scott has done a lot of work on that, that we've got internal work that we're glad to share it NAREIT as to how we think about that. But I would see that ramping up. 
I think it's realistic, Steve, that we're not going to be sitting at 99% occupancy at South San Francisco forever. That just won't happen. So you're going to have some diminution of of occupancy over time, and that would be natural. So then it comes down to is the land locations that we have that we'll be providing our new product, Class A product, is that going to be highly sought after, which we think it will be. And if some of it -- if you have -- if you return to a little bit more toward a normal vacancy, is it still profitable? And we've got so much cushion in our numbers that the answer is yes, it would still be profitable, very profitable. 
So those are things we're paying a lot of attention to. We spent a lot of time with our Board over the last couple of board meetings, going to the risks, how we mitigate those risks and why we're comfortable that this is a very sound play. 
The other thing I'd point out is even though we're talking about $600 million year of development, it could be $700 million or $800 million at some point or $900 million or it could drop back down to $300 million or $400 million. It's not like we've got a gun to our head as far as timing on putting that product out. So pre-leasing demand and supply are something that we're working on, on a monthly basis to have our thumb on the pulse of what's going on in the market."

We have the big concentration in Florida, which we think is a good thing. It's primarily an independent living business. So most of the economics in CCRCs are driven through the entry fee. And fortunately, the contracts there are really strong. 
So the fundamental demand for that business is good and the underlying profit center, which is the independent living is strong as well. But definitely, we had headwinds on labor in the third quarter, in particular. So we had a pretty significant increase in expenses. If you just look sequentially, we were up almost $5 million. That's about 5% just sequentially. And most of that was driven by labor. Now there's a labor shortage nationwide, but in Florida, it's particularly acute. 
And then on the health care side, it's been particularly meaningful. So we don't see that changing overnight. At the same time, it's unlikely to last indefinitely. So for sure, had a short-term impact on margin. We even had to reduce admissions in some cases. So it impacted revenue as well. But we do see that improving, but it's going to take some time.

The other thing I'd point out is if you were to go to the other math that we've shown in the deck that we provided on Page 7, you'll see that -- on that page, you'll see the shore, you'll see the peak Oyster Point, Nexus, Vantage, Point Gram. On the shore, we have very significant development opportunity in that vacant land space that we're able to pick up with Sierra Point towers and that substantial. In Vantage, that's an enormous piece of land that we're going to be developing out. 
Nexus, we've got very, very strong traction, not quite enough to have announced it on this call, but as far as lease-up of that space, which inquired us to kick off the Vantage project. And Point Grand, we're going to be having a few of those buildings that are coming due at the end of 2022 on their leases, thank goodness, so we can start taking advantage of that huge densification opportunity asset by asset. I mean that thing was built at a 0.5 FAR a way back in the day, and that likely goes to -- I won't fill the number out, but something much, much higher. 
So when you start looking at -- and we have opportunities in San Diego as well or Sorrento Mesa. So when you start looking at what we have in West Cambridge, we have in South San Francisco, we have in Sorrento Mesa. We have to look at pre-leasing. We have to look at demand and supply. We have to look at where we have tenants that are seeking to grow that need space sooner to be able to the sequence as we take -- as we move each of these projects forward and how quickly, I do think, Michael, to your point, we're going to get the entitlement work done as quickly as we can. 
A lot of the soft work done and move forward with West Cambridge, that's not something that's going to sell up there for a long period of time, but we may have some other projects that have more immediacy in their ability to meet the demands of our tenants and the demands of our non-tenants in those particular markets. So I don't know the answer to that yet, but you can be sure, over the next few years that we'll have clearer and clearer answers as the markets play out."

We spend a lot of time on that exact question, Jordan. Today, MOBs high-quality probably come in at 50 to 100 basis points higher cap rate, so the initial yield. There is a little bit more CapEx drag on MOB, in general, probably in the 20% range just",420,"Yes. We spend a lot of time on that exact question, Jordan. Today, MOBs high-quality probably come in at 50 to 100 basis points higher cap rate, so the initial yield. There is a little bit more CapEx drag on MOB, in general, probably in the 20% range just on average CapEx -- total CapEx as a percentage of NOI. Obviously, will be higher or lower, but that's a decent average across the portfolio, and we've had 2.5 type percent growth for a decade or more. 
So the economics of that business are pretty straightforward. And when we compare that to life science, if you're starting at a 4 cap, just as an example, in today's market, high-quality building that would fit within our strategy and portfolio. The contractual escalators in that business tend to be in the 3% to 3.5% range, depending on which market you're in, South San Francisco being at the high end, Boston and San Diego be more in the 3% range. So the escalator is higher, just the contractual growth with lower CapEx. 
So just in theory, obviously, that would lead to a lower initial cap rate, which is exactly what you see, what has really turbocharged the Life Science returns over the past decade, of course, is the dramatic escalation in rents. They're up at least 10%, arguably closer to 20% over the past 12 months in our 3 core markets, which has obviously helped our mark-to-market across the portfolio that today is in the 20% range. That's on a $500-plus million base. So that's a lot of upside to capture as leases roll over the next decade or so. 
So you combine all of that, you start with the lower yield in life science, but obviously, a much higher growth rate that today, you probably come out to a higher  realistically in life science. But we're not assuming that rents are going to grow at 10% to 20% forever in life science. We think it's a great business. We think we have great locations, great team, in a really strong market position, but it's probably not realistic to think that rents grow at 10-plus percent forever. So we do still like the stability of that MOB business, but we don't think all of are created equal. So we're pretty careful about exactly what we put into the portfolio. And I think that is something that when you compare the different companies, you'll increasingly see that play out in the returns from that business."

Over the last decade, it's been more in the 5% to 7% range across our 3 markets. So that's the 10-year history. Obviously, it's been even stronger.

So that's the 10-year history. Obviously, it's been even stronger. Over the past couple of years, there is a fair amount of new supply coming into the marketplace. So that could potentially weigh on rent growth at the same time, the escalation in demand is equally off the charts. We thought 2020 was a strong year for venture capital and IPOs. 
And on an annualized basis, it looks like 2021 is going to be 50% higher than 2020. And all of that capital leads to more real estate demand, obviously. It varies by company, but our math is that, on average, every $1 million of BC and IPO that translates to about 400 square feet of additional space. So $100 million raise is another 40,000 feet of space. Obviously, some tenants will need more, some less, but on average, that's a pretty significant amount of real estate that's needed to meet the growing demand. And given the success that these BCs have had, they're obviously having an equally enormous success raising their next funds, which will fund the next round of growth on top of the NIH funding, which just continues to grow. And that's really the first wave of capital in the pipeline that over the next 5 to 10 years, all that NIH funding, it's really basic science will start turning into the next clinical candidate. That is really the sweet spot for our business. Tom, anything to add?"

When you look at the last 3 years, we've been following very closely the NIH, BC, SEO partnership funding, which helps drive life science, it's hattrupled in the last decade.

Vacancy has obviously fallen to practically 0 in most of these -- of the big 3 markets in the better locations. So no surprise that you've seen rent growth that has been in the 5% to 7% CAGR range. 
You've seen land rise rapidly in price, along with labor and construction costs, which will put some pressure on the spreads that these are developed at unless you already own the land and you own it right. So we do think that, that is probably our great opportunity within this is this massive land holding. So I think that's just an add-on to the comments that made did are probably important."

If we continue seeing this kind of demand and then just look at what took place with the pandemic and vaccines and CRISPR technologies and all these cancer treatments and live molecule, live organism drugs that are curing diseases that you simply used to die from, that kind of demand is going to continue fueling, we believe, this continued growth in the biotech companies. And with that, there's going to be a lot of demand for space. And to be able to have these new start-ups, especially and then grow within these, the hottest biotech markets where all the energy, all the scientific talent, BC, et cetera, are located, there's just -- there's a big opportunity. It's almost hard to measure.

And across various different functions, you've had some inflation in wages across the country. And we and everybody listening on this call have been reading about this in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, whatever, on a weekly basis. So that's no secret. So we're putting a lot of time in making sure that we approach this appropriately and that we have a fair response to our team on this front. And that applies to senior housing as well and CCRCs. You have to pay people appropriately for the conditions and the cost of living has gone up and the labor pool has shrunk some, and that's going to have some impact. So that's just the reality of doing business and those are things that we're dialing into what we're forecasting. It's nothing unique to our business, but I think we and everybody else are dealing with that issue right now."

Also on the line and available for the Q&A portion of the call are: Tom Klaritch, our COO; and Troy McHenry, our Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel.  
Our Q3 operating and earnings results were favorable. Meanwhile, we have been very active and productive in our transaction, development and leasing activities. Let me hit the high points.
Starting with operations. Our life science and MOB businesses, which represent close to 90% of our Q3 NOI continued to perform above expectations. While our combined CCRC and sovereign wealth fund JV performance was roughly in line with expectations.
On the transaction front, we closed our remaining $150 million of rental senior housing sales, bringing total sales since July of 2020 to $4 billion. And we redeployed the entirety of the sales proceeds into our core life science and MOB acquisitions and debt reduction.  
In life science, we announced a $625 million largely contiguous assemblage of operating and covered land investments in West Cambridge. With the strategic play, we have now captured the majority of the high-quality developable land in this important submarket and plan to develop multiple Class A life science properties over the next decade plus. 
In MOBs, we added 3 new acquisitions, bringing our year-to-date MOB acquisitions to approximately $780 million, which are primarily on-campus. We were also awarded 3 new developments from HCA, 2 traditional medical office buildings, along with a standalone nursing school that will be fully leased by HCA.  
As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to continue to focus our MOB growth on flow business to leverage our platform, scale and relationships, hitting accretive singles and doubles.  
Moving to development. Our life science development program continues to see positive momentum as fundamentals remain strong across our 3 core markets of San Francisco, Boston and San Diego. A $1.2 billion active development pipeline is 87% pre-leased with the remaining unleased space and active discussions. Given this, yesterday, we announced the commencement of our $393 million Vantage Phase 1 development in South San Francisco.
With the scheduled closings of the remaining West Cambridge acquisitions, we will have aggregated 7 million square feet or $10 billion plus of embedded development and densification opportunities across our 3 businesses and all fully under our ownership and control.  
One final comment. This quarter, we added to our ESG recognition with the GRESB Green Star designation and inclusion in the FTSE4Good Sustainability Index, both for the tenth consecutive year. We're proud that ESG has and will continue to be woven into the fabric of our corporate culture.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

I'll cover operating results then discuss acquisitions and development. Starting with life science results. Virtually, our entire footprint is in the 3 hot beds of biotech innovation, Boston, San Francisco and San Diego. Over the pas",1172,"Okay. Thank you, Tom. I'll cover operating results then discuss acquisitions and development. Starting with life science results. Virtually, our entire footprint is in the 3 hot beds of biotech innovation, Boston, San Francisco and San Diego. Over the past 4 decades, these markets have developed an unmatched ecosystem of academics, capital and scientific talent, placing them at the heart of the biotech revolution that's just getting started.  
We've purposely chosen to concentrate our resources and build a strong position in these markets, which is driving strong performance. Year-to-date, we signed 2.2 million square feet of leases, which is 2x our full year budget from the beginning of the year. The leasing success was broad-based across all 3 markets and included new developments, renewals and expansions.  
In the third quarter, we signed 406,000 square feet of renewals at a 20% cash mark-to-market, that's in line with the current upside across our entire life science rent roll. And of course, the mark-to-market will vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.  
Same-store cash NOI growth for the quarter was 6.8%, bringing year-to-date growth to 7.7%. The results were driven by contractual escalators, leasing activity and mark-to-market on renewals. Looking forward, we have a leasing pipeline of nearly 600,000 square feet under signed letters of intent, including new developments, renewals and expansions with existing tenants.  
Our run rate, annual cash NOI for life science now exceeds $500 million. and is in the $600 million range, including development leases that have been signed but not yet commenced.  
Moving to medical office. Leasing activity continues to outperform our expectations. We had 700,000 square feet of commencements in the quarter. Mark-to-market on renewals was 2.3% and retention was strong at 80% for the trailing 12 months, both in line with historical averages. 
We're seeing strong demand in Nashville, Seattle, Dallas and Denver, all markets where you've seen us grow in recent quarters. Thanks to our cash NOI growth this quarter was 2.9%, toward the high end of our historical range, driven by leasing activity, strong collections and part of the income. We're also benefiting from our green investments to reduce carbon footprint and operating cost.  
Hospital inpatient and outpatient volumes are strong and hospitals continue to invest in our affiliated properties, benefiting our unique on-campus portfolio. Finishing with CCRCs. Our concentration in Florida is a long-term positive, but made for a more challenging third quarter as the state was hit hard by the Delta variant. This had a temporary impact on occupancy, especially in assisted living and skilled. Consistent with the national headlines, labor is a headwind. As a result, same-store cash NOI growth was negative 1.7% for the quarter, excluding CARES Act funding.
Independent living represents 2/3 of the total unit count at our campuses and demand for those units is strong. The number of entry fee sales in 3Q was nearly back to 2019 levels, and entry free cash receipts in the quarter exceeded historical levels. We have strong pricing power in most of our markets, supported by the housing market.  
Moving to medical office acquisitions. In September, we acquired 2 on-campus MOBs in Dallas, affiliated with the Baylor Scott & White system for $60 million. This was an off-market acquisition and expands our #1 medical office market share in Dallas.  
In October, we acquired an MOB in Seattle for $43 million. The building expands our footprint on the campus of Swedish Medical Center to 600,000 square feet. We see potential to significantly densify the site over time, taking advantage of the land locked location next to one of Seattle's leading hospitals.  
Also in October, we acquired a 55,000 square foot MOB on the campus of an HA Hospital in New Orleans at $34 million. Once again, this acquisition was done off market.  
Turning to life science development. Lease up is exceeding our underwriting on both the rate and timing. Our active development pipeline is now 87% pre-leased, excluding Vantage Phase 1, which commenced yesterday. The final phase of the shore is now 100% pre-leased and the rate on the final lease was 32% higher than the initial lease we signed at the shore just 3 years ago.  
Staying in South San Francisco with very strong leasing activity at our Nexus project nextdoor, we chose to commence development at Vantage. A picture can say a thousand words, so please take a look at the investment deck we published yesterday. On Page 7, you'll see that the Vantage campus sits in the heart of South San Francisco, adjacent to our Nexus and Pointe Grand campuses. Phase 1 will include 343,000 square feet and deliver in the second half of 2023. Upon completion of all phases, the Vantage campus will include at least 1 million square feet of Class A lab and potentially far more subject to entitlements which are ongoing.  
Moving to San Diego, where we fully pre-leased our 540,000 square feet of active development. In the third quarter, we secured the next phase of our growth with a covered land play acquisition. The site sits between our existing Sorrento Gateway and Sorrento Summit campuses, all of which have excellent visibility and accessibility from Interstate 805. Once the site is developed, we'll have 700,000 square feet across these 3 campuses. 
In Boston, our 101 Cambridge Park Drive project in Alewife delivered in 4Q '22 is now 88% pre-leased. The average lease rate is $99 per foot or 27% above our underwriting. This project brings our footprint in the Alewife submarket of West Cambridge to 1.1 million square feet across 18 acres. And that brings us to the series of acquisitions we announced yesterday.  
In 8 separate transactions totaling $625 million of initial investment, we assembled 36 acres of largely contiguous land in the AOA submarket West Cambridge. We now have a significant development opportunity on the East Coast to balance our enormous development pipeline in South San Francisco. The blended Year 1 FFO yield is 4.2% with the potential for huge earnings and NAV upside in the future. Roughly 1/4 of the $625 million investment represents stabilized cash flowing acquisitions, the remainder are covered land plays, primarily single-store industrial and flex office that we intend to eventually replace with Class A lab buildings in phases over the next decade plus. We'll be working with the City of Cambridge on the development plan and have more to share in coming quarters.  
If you turn to Page 4 of yesterday's investment deck, you'll see the assemblages within walking distance to our existing buildings in Alewife. Both sites have commuter access by train, car and bike. In particular, we're within walking distance to the Alewife train station and adjacent to Route 2 in the Minuteman bike path, all of which connect Cambridge, Downtown Boston and the Western suburbs. These campus settings are a competitive advantage for leasing because we can provide world-class amenities, infrastructure and flexibility for tenants to grow without relocating. This is very, very different than owning a single lab building in an isolated location.  
I'll turn it to Pete."

For the third quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.40 per share and blended same-store growth of 3.2%. Our strong results are driven by continued outperformance in both life science and medical office. And for the third quarter, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share.  
Turning to our balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5x. We expect to reach our mid-5x target leverage ratio by the end of the year with the majority of our announced acquisition activity closing in the fourth quarter.  
During the quarter, we closed on an upsized $3 billion revolving credit facility, an increase of $500 million. The upsized revolver provides us with significant benefits. It increases our liquidity position. It extends our debt maturity profile, and it reduces our overall borrowing costs. We had 100% of our banking group re-up their commitment, which is a testament to their confidence in our company and our future.  
Also, during the quarter, we raised net proceeds of approximately $320 million of equity under our ATM program at a blended gross stock price of approximately $35.60 per share. All of the equity was raised under 18-month forward contracts.  
Pro forma the settlement of our equity forwards, third quarter net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is reduced to 4.7x.  
Turning to our guidance. We are increasing our 2021 guidance as follows: FFO as adjusted, revised from $1.55 to $1.61 per share; two, $1.58 to $1.62 per share, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint; blended same-store NOI growth revised from 2.25% in to 3.75% to 3.5% to 4%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. The major components of our revised guidance are as follows: In life sciences, we had increased the midpoint of our same-store guidance by 75 basis points to 6.5%. The -- In medical office, we have increased the midpoint of our same-store guidance by 25 basis points to 2.75%. For our significant nonsame-store portfolios, we have tightened our guidance range to $85 million to $105 million, leaving the midpoint unchanged.  
Finishing with acquisition. Year-to-date, we have announced $1.6 billion of acquisitions that have either closed or are under contract. Accordingly, we have updated our acquisition guidance to reflect this activity. Please refer to Pages 41 and 42 of our supplemental for additional details on our guidance revision.

When you look at our land plays across the country, it does sum up to at this point for what we've acquired and we're in a contract to acquire 7-plus million square feet across our life science business, $10 billion-plus opportunity. So it is a massive opportunity over the next decade plus. I would think in terms of maybe 2.5 million square feet of that being in the East Coast now in the Greater Boston area, primarily West Cambridge and probably 4.5 million of it sitting in South San Francisco, Brisbane, and then some down in Sorrento Mesa.  
So we have an enormous opportunity without any need to purchase additional land for a long time. These are going to be in what we would think of as very substantial campuses that create strong clusters over time, which is, obviously, I think, as you all know, vital to success in life science. It takes advantage of the virtuous cycle of aging population and new biologics live organism-type drug discoveries, the FDA approval time, the heavy VC, NIH, IPO funding, which has quadrupled in the last decade, along with the ecosystem of research universities and scientific talent and like I said, all this venture capital being deeply engaged in these markets.  
So we think that that's going to create an enormous opportunity for us across -- on both coasts, and that probably lines us out for quite a while, some very accretive opportunities with land that could not be replicated today. The land sites that we picked up are in the heart of some of the best life science markets really in the world. And when we think about we just acquired this assemblage in West Cambridge that, that was about a 6-month effort, it -- we did not think we could put something together that substantial during that period of time. Unfortunately, we were able to. So the vast majority of the strong developable land in that submarket is going to pay great dividends to us, we believe.  
So Brinker, anything you would add on that and how you're thinking about it?"

Maybe I'll try to also address that question about the location and what we found attractive about it, and it's a couple of things we'd point to. One is to -- it does have the Cambridge address, which is obviously an important factor for the tenants and yet it's $20 to $30 per foot cheaper than East Cambridge, which realistically is sold out. Anyway, but economically more attractive. It does have the strong accessibility, which is obviously important in a big market like Boston with Route 2, the Red Line, Bike Path. So really, no matter how you're commuting, you've got pretty good access to this location. And then it does have an established reputation. It's not like we're breaking new ground here. There's a strong life science history in West Cambridge around 2 million square feet today, of which we're by far the biggest player. And then the fact that we're able to develop something in scale was ultimately what was the deciding factor here. It was just a single parcel with 1 building that's not nearly as interesting. There's a lot of new entrants doing that. There's a lot of conversions that can do that. But the ability to put together 36 acres with the Cambridge address is pretty much unheard of, and that was ultimately the deciding factor and deciding to proceed.  
We put together 8 separate transactions, but it was really 2 fairly big parcels that were the linchpin, the Mooney Street campus and then the Concord Avenue campus. And then once we got clarity that we could get those, we want to work and put together the surrounding parcels as well. And who knows, there might be more to do in that submarket."

Now some of those buildings have mark-to-market built into them. But oftentimes, that's pretty far into the future. So it's probably still a pretty realistic. Cap rate, that's probably down 50 basis points at least over the past 12 months given the strength in the marketplace and just the number of capital sources looking to invest and build their presence in life science. 
And then in medical office, I mean, similar forces given the interest in the sector, but the cap rates there for the quality product, they're probably in the mid-4s to mid-5s. So a broader range because there's just more variability in the building by building in terms of who the tenants are on-campus versus off-campus, but it's hard to find really high-quality buildings that fit our criteria for anything more than a 5 cap in today's market.

We recognize it's a bit unique to disclose an FFO yield as opposed to a cap rate. But given the unique nature of this portfolio, which is a combination of stabilized properties and covered land, we thought an FFO yield was most appropriate. So investors and yourselves on the research side to better understand the Year 1 impact.  
If you refer to Page 5 of our investor deck, it provides details on each transaction. So of the 8 assets and $625 million purchase price, 3 of the assets we categorized and stabilized with a total purchase price of $187 million. That's 10 Fawcett, 725 Concord and 25 Spinelli plus the Concord Avenue campus, which we do categorize as covered land and which we acquired for $180 million, that asset is currently 100% leased to Raytheon for 6 more years.  
So the stabilized asset plus the Concord Avenue campus, which together totals around $370 million. The blended year 1 GAAP cap rate, so from an NOI -- GAAP NOI perspective is approximately a 5% yield across all of those. So the balance of the portfolio, which we call covered land which is around $255 million, we will capitalize interest on those assets at approximately 3%. That's our current weighted average debt interest rate. And since we started this effort about 6 months ago to assemble all of these assets, we already -- we're well underway on our internal and external design team and we're working towards entitlement planning and ultimate design of this campus over time. So we're capitalizing interest on those already.  
So if you add all that up, I know that's a lot, but I want to make sure you have all the pieces, that's around $370 million out of 5 cap and then it's around $255 million at a 3% capitalized interest which blends to               ].

We're having really solid leasing momentum. We announced that project earlier this year we were projecting more of a mid- to high 6s return. It looks like we'll do quite a bit better than that.  
And then in West Cambridge, it is a bit more expensive to build there, not dramatically so, but the all-in cost for our underwriting. It's somewhere in the $1,300 per foot range. And I say range because it's still a little unclear exactly how much we'll be able to build, and that will obviously impact our land prices, but a decent estimate would be $1,300 per foot in West Cambridge, if you were building today, given our land cost. And then obviously, we just announced last night that we signed leases at $99 per foot on average within walking distance of that site.

Those are obviously returns that are higher than what somebody would achieve in the market today if they bought land at market, which we've seen a solid 30% to 50% increase in high-quality land as far as pricing, bringing those spreads down if one was to do a market transaction today, if you could find the high-quality land probably more back to that 150, 200 basis point spread in the mid-7s against our cost of capital, if that held, that's a solid 300-plus basis point spread in 4.25 cap type assets, do the math on that on the NAV accretion and on the earnings accretion, it's quite substantial.  
And I'm not trying to speak to returns that will be years down the road. But when you think in terms of the value of having locked up some of the best land and some of the best submarkets in the world, it really is going to allow us to be in a position where we're aware of new supply like everybody is. But if you've got -- if our land locations are in some of the hottest markets and the ecosystems with the greatest energy, we do think we'll get far more than our fair share of that leasing and that, that's going to be a profitable outcome for us for years to come. I think if we were starting from scratch, we would have an absolute possible time replicating that potential outcome. So I think it's a very strategic point that you've raised."

And it sounds like demand is great today. Everybody is getting in the life science. But just what are your thoughts on kind of broad dollars per year over the next, say, 5 years?"

Steve, if we roll back a half a dozen years, we were spending just on pure development, I'm not talking [ redev ] about $100 million a year in development, that's ramped up. That's easily in the 400-plus range at this point. We would see that ramping up further to probably $600 million a year and maybe over time higher. But one of the things that we do pay a lot of attention to is the demand/supply work that we're doing so that we can time it appropriately. We look at pre-leasing. We look at funding risk, being very clear on where our funding is going to come from and Pete Scott has done a lot of work on that, that we've got internal work that we're glad to share it Nareit as to how we think about that. But I would see that ramping up.  
I think it's realistic, Steve, that we're not going to be sitting at 99% occupancy at South San Francisco forever. That just won't happen. So you're going to have some diminution of occupancy over time, and that would be natural. So then it comes down to is the land locations that we have that we'll be providing our new product, Class A product, is that going to be highly sought after, which we think it will be. And if some of it -- if you have -- if you return to a little bit more toward a normal vacancy, is it still profitable? And we've got so much cushion in our numbers that the answer is yes, it would still be profitable, very profitable. So those are things we're paying a lot of attention to. We spent a lot of time with our Board over the last couple of board meetings, going to the risks, how we mitigate those risks and why we're comfortable that this is a very sound play.  
The other thing I'd point out is even though we're talking about $600 million year of development, it could be $700 million or $800 million at some point or $900 million or it could drop back down to $300 million or $400 million. It's not like we've got a gun to our head as far as timing on putting that product out. So pre-leasing demand and supply are something that we're working on, on a monthly basis to have our thumb on the pulse of what's going on in the market."

We have the big concentration in Florida, which we think is a good thing. It's primarily an independent living business. So most of the economics in CCRCs are driven through the entry fee. And fortunately, the contracts there are really strong. So the fundamental demand for that business is good and the underlying profit center, which is the independent living is strong as well. But definitely, we had headwinds on labor in the third quarter, in particular. So we had a pretty significant increase in expenses. If you just look sequentially, we were up almost $5 million. That's about 5% just sequentially. And most of that was driven by labor. Now there's a labor shortage nationwide, but in Florida, it's particularly acute. And then on the health care side, it's been particularly meaningful. So we don't see that changing overnight. At the same time, it's unlikely to last indefinitely. So for sure, had a short-term impact on margin. We even had to reduce admissions in some cases. So it impacted revenue as well. But we do see that improving, but it's going to take some time. That's a year-plus process, where I think it will slowly decline to more normalized levels."

One of the things that you have to keep in mind is that when you have interest expense that you're paying while something is under development, it is deemed to be a direct cost of development.

The other thing I'd point out is if you were to go to the other math that we've shown in the deck that we provided on Page 7, you'll see that -- on that page, you'll see the shore, you'll see the Peak Oyster Point, Nexus, Vantage, Pointe Grand. On the shore, we have very significant development opportunity in that vacant land space that we're able to pick up with Sierra Point towers and that substantial. In Vantage, that's an enormous piece of land that we're going to be developing out. Nexus, we've got very, very strong traction, not quite enough to have announced it on this call, but as far as lease-up of that space, which inspired us to kick off the Vantage project. And Pointe Grand, we're going to be having a few of those buildings that are coming due at the end of 2022 on their leases, thank goodness, so we can start taking advantage of that huge densification opportunity asset by asset. I mean that thing was built at a 0.5 FAR a way back in the day, and that likely goes to -- I won't fill the number out, but something much, much higher.  
So when you start looking at -- and we have opportunities in San Diego as well or Sorrento Mesa. So when you start looking at what we have in West Cambridge, we have in South San Francisco, we have in Sorrento Mesa. We have to look at pre-leasing. We have to look at demand and supply. We have to look at where we have tenants that are seeking to grow that need space sooner to be able to the sequence as we take -- as we move each of these projects forward and how quickly, I do think, Michael, to your point, we're going to get the entitlement work done as quickly as we can. A lot of the soft work done and move forward with West Cambridge, that's not something that's going to sit out there for a long period of time, but we may have some other projects that have more immediacy in their ability to meet the demands of our tenants and the demands of our non-tenants in those particular markets. So I don't know the answer to that yet, but you can be sure, over the next few years that we'll have clearer and clearer answers as the markets play out."

We spend a lot of time on that exact question, Jordan. Today, MOBs high-quality probably come in at 50 to 100 basis points higher cap rate, so the initial yield. There is a little bit more CapEx drag on MOB, in general, probably in the 20% range just",422,"Yes. We spend a lot of time on that exact question, Jordan. Today, MOBs high-quality probably come in at 50 to 100 basis points higher cap rate, so the initial yield. There is a little bit more CapEx drag on MOB, in general, probably in the 20% range just on average CapEx -- total CapEx as a percentage of NOI. Obviously,                 will be higher or lower, but that's a decent average across the portfolio, and we've had 2.5 type percent growth for a decade or more. So the economics of that business are pretty straightforward. And when we compare that to life science, if you're starting at a 4 cap, just as an example, in today's market, high-quality building that would fit within our strategy and portfolio. The contractual escalators in that business tend to be in the 3% to 3.5% range, depending on which market you're in, South San Francisco being at the high end, Boston and San Diego be more in the 3% range. So the escalator is higher, just the contractual growth with lower CapEx. So just in theory, obviously, that would lead to a lower initial cap rate, which is exactly what you see, what has really turbocharged the life science returns over the past decade, of course, is the dramatic escalation in rents. They're up at least 10%, arguably closer to 20% over the past 12 months in our 3 core markets, which has obviously helped our mark-to-market across the portfolio that today is in the 20% range. That's on a $500-plus million base. So that's a lot of upside to capture as leases roll over the next decade or so.  
So you combine all of that, you start with the lower yield in life science, but obviously, a much higher growth rate that today, you probably come out to a higher IRR realistically in life science. But we're not assuming that rents are going to grow at 10% to 20% forever in life science. We think it's a great business. We think we have great locations, great team, in a really strong market position, but it's probably not realistic to think that rents grow at 10-plus percent forever. So we do still like the stability of that MOB business, but we don't think all of holes are created equal. So we're pretty careful about exactly what we put into the portfolio. And I think that is something that when you compare the different companies, you'll increasingly see that play out in the returns from that business."

And on an annualized basis, it looks like 2021 is going to be 50% higher than 2020. And all of that capital leads to more real estate demand, obviously. It varies by company, but our math is that on average, every $1 million of VC and IPO that get raised translates to about 400 square feet of additional space. So $100 million raise is another 40,000 feet of space. Obviously, some tenants will need more, some less, but on average, that's a pretty significant amount of real estate that's needed to meet the growing demand. And given the success that these VCs have had, they're obviously having an equally enormous success raising their next funds, which will fund the next round of growth on top of the NIH funding, which just continues to grow. And that's really the first wave of capital in the pipeline that over the next 5 to 10 years, all that NIH funding, it's really basic science will start turning into the next clinical candidate. That is really the sweet spot for our business. Tom, anything to add?"

When you look at the last 3 years, we've been following very closely the NIH, VC, SEO partnership funding, which helps drive life science, it's quadrupled in the last decade. But in the last 3 years, it's up 50% and obviously driving a lot of funding to do lab work. We've seen 20% growth in supply during this time as far as space. Vacancy has obviously fallen to practically 0 in most of these -- of the big 3 markets in the better locations. So no surprise that you've seen rent growth that has been in the 5% to 7% CAGR range.  
You've seen land rise rapidly in price, along with labor and construction costs, which will put some pressure on the spreads that these are developed at unless you already own the land and you own it right. So we do think that, that is probably our great opportunity within this is this massive land holding. So I think that's just an add-on to the comments that Brinker made that are probably important."

But it's a very fair point. If we continue seeing this kind of demand and then just look at what took place with the pandemic and vaccines and CRISPR technologies and all these cancer treatments and large molecule, live organism drugs that are curing diseases that we simply used to die from, that kind of demand is going to continue fueling, we believe, this continued growth in the biotech companies. And with that, there's going to be a lot of demand for space. And to be able to have these new start-ups, especially and then grow within these, the hottest biotech markets where all the energy, all the scientific talent, VC, et cetera, are located, there's just -- there's a big opportunity. It's almost hard to measure.

In our CCRC business, it affects more so the SNF beds probably, as you know. CCRCs have a certain number of SNF beds to have the full continuum of care and provide those types of guarantees to the residents. We have had more contract labor than average by a long shot and that created higher expense load, which weighed a little bit on our same-store growth, which was to be expected, and that's a short-term item for us. It did cause us to pull back in a few assets on the admissions in SNF beds because, obviously, as you're no longer making money on filling a bed, you get to go back and revisit whether you leave a few beds empty for a period of time, but we consider that to be a short-term issue and one that will resolve. But those are the types of things that we're looking at on the labor front. But it's a real problem.  
Labor costs in senior housing in general, have been rising pretty dramatically. So you've got occupancy, the one has to keep an eye on, but also you can't spend revenue, you can spend NOI at the end of the day.

Our Q3 operating and earnings results were favorable. Meanwhile, we have been very active and productive in our transaction, development and leasing activities. Let me hit the high points.
Starting with operations. Our life science and MOB businesses, which represent close to 90% of our Q3 NOI continued to perform above expectations. While our combined CCRC and sovereign wealth fund JV performance was roughly in line with expectations.
On the transaction front, we closed our remaining $150 million of rental senior housing sales, bringing total sales since July of 2020 to $4 billion. And we redeployed the entirety of the sales proceeds into our core life science and MOB acquisitions and debt reduction.  
In life science, we announced a $625 million largely contiguous assemblage of operating and covered land investments in West Cambridge. With the strategic play, we have now captured the majority of the high-quality developable land in this important submarket and plan to develop multiple Class A life science properties over the next decade plus. 
In MOBs, we added 3 new acquisitions, bringing our year-to-date MOB acquisitions to approximately $780 million, which are primarily on-campus. We were also awarded 3 new developments from HCA, 2 traditional medical office buildings, along with a standalone nursing school that will be fully leased by HCA.  
As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to continue to focus our MOB growth on flow business to leverage our platform, scale and relationships, hitting accretive singles and doubles.  
Moving to development. Our life science development program continues to see positive momentum as fundamentals remain strong across our 3 core markets of San Francisco, Boston and San Diego. A $1.2 billion active development pipeline is 87% pre-leased with the remaining unleased space and active discussions. Given this, yesterday, we announced the commencement of our $393 million Vantage Phase 1 development in South San Francisco.
With the scheduled closings of the remaining West Cambridge acquisitions, we will have aggregated 7 million square feet or $10 billion plus of embedded development and densification opportunities across our 3 businesses and all fully under our ownership and control.  
One final comment. This quarter, we added to our ESG recognition with the GRESB Green Star designation and inclusion in the FTSE4Good Sustainability Index, both for the tenth consecutive year. We're proud that ESG has and will continue to be woven into the fabric of our corporate culture.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott."

I'll cover operating results then discuss acquisitions and development. Starting with life science results. Virtually, our entire footprint is in the 3 hot beds of biotech innovation, Boston, San Francisco and San Diego. Over the pas",1172,"Okay. Thank you, Tom. I'll cover operating results then discuss acquisitions and development. Starting with life science results. Virtually, our entire footprint is in the 3 hot beds of biotech innovation, Boston, San Francisco and San Diego. Over the past 4 decades, these markets have developed an unmatched ecosystem of academics, capital and scientific talent, placing them at the heart of the biotech revolution that's just getting started.  
We've purposely chosen to concentrate our resources and build a strong position in these markets, which is driving strong performance. Year-to-date, we signed 2.2 million square feet of leases, which is 2x our full year budget from the beginning of the year. The leasing success was broad-based across all 3 markets and included new developments, renewals and expansions.  
In the third quarter, we signed 406,000 square feet of renewals at a 20% cash mark-to-market, that's in line with the current upside across our entire life science rent roll. And of course, the mark-to-market will vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.  
Same-store cash NOI growth for the quarter was 6.8%, bringing year-to-date growth to 7.7%. The results were driven by contractual escalators, leasing activity and mark-to-market on renewals. Looking forward, we have a leasing pipeline of nearly 600,000 square feet under signed letters of intent, including new developments, renewals and expansions with existing tenants.  
Our run rate, annual cash NOI for life science now exceeds $500 million. and is in the $600 million range, including development leases that have been signed but not yet commenced.  
Moving to medical office. Leasing activity continues to outperform our expectations. We had 700,000 square feet of commencements in the quarter. Mark-to-market on renewals was 2.3% and retention was strong at 80% for the trailing 12 months, both in line with historical averages. 
We're seeing strong demand in Nashville, Seattle, Dallas and Denver, all markets where you've seen us grow in recent quarters. Thanks to our cash NOI growth this quarter was 2.9%, toward the high end of our historical range, driven by leasing activity, strong collections and part of the income. We're also benefiting from our green investments to reduce carbon footprint and operating cost.  
Hospital inpatient and outpatient volumes are strong and hospitals continue to invest in our affiliated properties, benefiting our unique on-campus portfolio. Finishing with CCRCs. Our concentration in Florida is a long-term positive, but made for a more challenging third quarter as the state was hit hard by the Delta variant. This had a temporary impact on occupancy, especially in assisted living and skilled. Consistent with the national headlines, labor is a headwind. As a result, same-store cash NOI growth was negative 1.7% for the quarter, excluding CARES Act funding.
Independent living represents 2/3 of the total unit count at our campuses and demand for those units is strong. The number of entry fee sales in 3Q was nearly back to 2019 levels, and entry free cash receipts in the quarter exceeded historical levels. We have strong pricing power in most of our markets, supported by the housing market.  
Moving to medical office acquisitions. In September, we acquired 2 on-campus MOBs in Dallas, affiliated with the Baylor Scott & White system for $60 million. This was an off-market acquisition and expands our #1 medical office market share in Dallas.  
In October, we acquired an MOB in Seattle for $43 million. The building expands our footprint on the campus of Swedish Medical Center to 600,000 square feet. We see potential to significantly densify the site over time, taking advantage of the land locked location next to one of Seattle's leading hospitals.  
Also in October, we acquired a 55,000 square foot MOB on the campus of an HA Hospital in New Orleans at $34 million. Once again, this acquisition was done off market.  
Turning to life science development. Lease up is exceeding our underwriting on both the rate and timing. Our active development pipeline is now 87% pre-leased, excluding Vantage Phase 1, which commenced yesterday. The final phase of the shore is now 100% pre-leased and the rate on the final lease was 32% higher than the initial lease we signed at the shore just 3 years ago.  
Staying in South San Francisco with very strong leasing activity at our Nexus project nextdoor, we chose to commence development at Vantage. A picture can say a thousand words, so please take a look at the investment deck we published yesterday. On Page 7, you'll see that the Vantage campus sits in the heart of South San Francisco, adjacent to our Nexus and Pointe Grand campuses. Phase 1 will include 343,000 square feet and deliver in the second half of 2023. Upon completion of all phases, the Vantage campus will include at least 1 million square feet of Class A lab and potentially far more subject to entitlements which are ongoing.  
Moving to San Diego, where we fully pre-leased our 540,000 square feet of active development. In the third quarter, we secured the next phase of our growth with a covered land play acquisition. The site sits between our existing Sorrento Gateway and Sorrento Summit campuses, all of which have excellent visibility and accessibility from Interstate 805. Once the site is developed, we'll have 700,000 square feet across these 3 campuses. 
In Boston, our 101 Cambridge Park Drive project in Alewife delivered in 4Q '22 is now 88% pre-leased. The average lease rate is $99 per foot or 27% above our underwriting. This project brings our footprint in the Alewife submarket of West Cambridge to 1.1 million square feet across 18 acres. And that brings us to the series of acquisitions we announced yesterday.  
In 8 separate transactions totaling $625 million of initial investment, we assembled 36 acres of largely contiguous land in the AOA submarket West Cambridge. We now have a significant development opportunity on the East Coast to balance our enormous development pipeline in South San Francisco. The blended Year 1 FFO yield is 4.2% with the potential for huge earnings and NAV upside in the future. Roughly 1/4 of the $625 million investment represents stabilized cash flowing acquisitions, the remainder are covered land plays, primarily single-store industrial and flex office that we intend to eventually replace with Class A lab buildings in phases over the next decade plus. We'll be working with the City of Cambridge on the development plan and have more to share in coming quarters.  
If you turn to Page 4 of yesterday's investment deck, you'll see the assemblages within walking distance to our existing buildings in Alewife. Both sites have commuter access by train, car and bike. In particular, we're within walking distance to the Alewife train station and adjacent to Route 2 in the Minuteman bike path, all of which connect Cambridge, Downtown Boston and the Western suburbs. These campus settings are a competitive advantage for leasing because we can provide world-class amenities, infrastructure and flexibility for tenants to grow without relocating. This is very, very different than owning a single lab building in an isolated location.  
I'll turn it to Pete."

For the third quarter, we reported FFO as adjusted of $0.40 per share and blended same-store growth of 3.2%. Our strong results are driven by continued outperformance in both life science and medical office. And for the third quarter, our Board declared a dividend of $0.30 per share.  
Turning to our balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5x. We expect to reach our mid-5x target leverage ratio by the end of the year with the majority of our announced acquisition activity closing in the fourth quarter.  
During the quarter, we closed on an upsized $3 billion revolving credit facility, an increase of $500 million. The upsized revolver provides us with significant benefits. It increases our liquidity position. It extends our debt maturity profile, and it reduces our overall borrowing costs. We had 100% of our banking group re-up their commitment, which is a testament to their confidence in our company and our future.  
Also, during the quarter, we raised net proceeds of approximately $320 million of equity under our ATM program at a blended gross stock price of approximately $35.60 per share. All of the equity was raised under 18-month forward contracts.  
Pro forma the settlement of our equity forwards, third quarter net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is reduced to 4.7x.  
Turning to our guidance. We are increasing our 2021 guidance as follows: FFO as adjusted, revised from $1.55 to $1.61 per share; two, $1.58 to $1.62 per share, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint; blended same-store NOI growth revised from 2.25% in to 3.75% to 3.5% to 4%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. The major components of our revised guidance are as follows: In life sciences, we had increased the midpoint of our same-store guidance by 75 basis points to 6.5%. The -- In medical office, we have increased the midpoint of our same-store guidance by 25 basis points to 2.75%. For our significant nonsame-store portfolios, we have tightened our guidance range to $85 million to $105 million, leaving the midpoint unchanged.  
Finishing with acquisition. Year-to-date, we have announced $1.6 billion of acquisitions that have either closed or are under contract. Accordingly, we have updated our acquisition guidance to reflect this activity. Please refer to Pages 41 and 42 of our supplemental for additional details on our guidance revision.

When you look at our land plays across the country, it does sum up to at this point for what we've acquired and we're in a contract to acquire 7-plus million square feet across our life science business, $10 billion-plus opportunity",355,"Rich, it's Tom Herzog. When you look at our land plays across the country, it does sum up to at this point for what we've acquired and we're in a contract to acquire 7-plus million square feet across our life science business, $10 billion-plus opportunity. So it is a massive opportunity over the next decade plus. I would think in terms of maybe 2.5 million square feet of that being in the East Coast now in the Greater Boston area, primarily West Cambridge and probably 4.5 million of it sitting in South San Francisco, Brisbane, and then some down in Sorrento Mesa.  
So we have an enormous opportunity without any need to purchase additional land for a long time. These are going to be in what we would think of as very substantial campuses that create strong clusters over time, which is, obviously, I think, as you all know, vital to success in life science. It takes advantage of the virtuous cycle of aging population and new biologics live organism-type drug discoveries, the FDA approval time, the heavy VC, NIH, IPO funding, which has quadrupled in the last decade, along with the ecosystem of research universities and scientific talent and like I said, all this venture capital being deeply engaged in these markets.  
So we think that that's going to create an enormous opportunity for us across -- on both coasts, and that probably lines us out for quite a while, some very accretive opportunities with land that could not be replicated today. The land sites that we picked up are in the heart of some of the best life science markets really in the world. And when we think about we just acquired this assemblage in West Cambridge that, that was about a 6-month effort, it -- we did not think we could put something together that substantial during that period of time. Unfortunately, we were able to. So the vast majority of the strong developable land in that submarket is going to pay great dividends to us, we believe.  
So Brinker, anything you would add on that and how you're thinking about it?"

Maybe I'll try to also address that question about the location and what we found attractive about it, and it's a couple of things we'd point to. One is to -- it does have the Cambridge address, which is obviously an important factor for the tenants and yet it's $20 to $30 per foot cheaper than East Cambridge, which realistically is sold out. Anyway, but economically more attractive. It does have the strong accessibility, which is obviously important in a big market like Boston with Route 2, the Red Line, Bike Path. So really, no matter how you're commuting, you've got pretty good access to this location. And then it does have an established reputation. It's not like we're breaking new ground here. There's a strong life science history in West Cambridge around 2 million square feet today, of which we're by far the biggest player. And then the fact that we're able to develop something in scale was ultimately what was the deciding factor here. It was just a single parcel with 1 building that's not nearly as interesting. There's a lot of new entrants doing that. There's a lot of conversions that can do that. But the ability to put together 36 acres with the Cambridge address is pretty much unheard of, and that was ultimately the deciding factor and deciding to proceed.  
We put together 8 separate transactions, but it was really 2 fairly big parcels that were the linchpin, the Mooney Street campus and then the Concord Avenue campus. And then once we got clarity that we could get those, we want to work and put together the surrounding parcels as well. And who knows, there might be more to do in that submarket."

It's obviously not our business to lease to industrial or office tenants, but the intent is that as leases mature at these various campuses, we would not even seek to renew leases. So we don't have an expectation that we're going to operate these industrial or flex office buildings over the long term."

Now some of those buildings have mark-to-market built into them. But oftentimes, that's pretty far into the future. So it's probably still a pretty realistic. Cap rate, that's probably down 50 basis points at least over the past 12 months given the strength in the marketplace and just the number of capital sources looking to invest and build their presence in life science. 
And then in medical office, I mean, similar forces given the interest in the sector, but the cap rates there for the quality product, they're probably in the mid-4s to mid-5s. So a broader range because there's just more variability in the building by building in terms of who the tenants are on-campus versus off-campus, but it's hard to find really high-quality buildings that fit our criteria for anything more than a 5 cap in today's market.

We recognize it's a bit unique to disclose an FFO yield as opposed to a cap rate. But given the unique nature of this portfolio, which is a combination of stabilized properties and covered land, we thought an FFO yield was most appropriate. So investors and yourselves on the research side to better understand the Year 1 impact.  
If you refer to Page 5 of our investor deck, it provides details on each transaction. So of the 8 assets and $625 million purchase price, 3 of the assets we categorized and stabilized with a total purchase price of $187 million. That's 10 Fawcett, 725 Concord and 25 Spinelli plus the Concord Avenue campus, which we do categorize as covered land and which we acquired for $180 million, that asset is currently 100% leased to Raytheon for 6 more years.  
So the stabilized asset plus the Concord Avenue campus, which together totals around $370 million. The blended year 1 GAAP cap rate, so from an NOI -- GAAP NOI perspective is approximately a 5% yield across all of those. So the balance of the portfolio, which we call covered land which is around $255 million, we will capitalize interest on those assets at approximately 3%. That's our current weighted average debt interest rate. And since we started this effort about 6 months ago to assemble all of these assets, we already -- we're well underway on our internal and external design team and we're working towards entitlement planning and ultimate design of this campus over time. So we're capitalizing interest on those already.  
So if you add all that up, I know that's a lot, but I want to make sure you have all the pieces, that's around $370 million out of 5 cap and then it's around $255 million at a 3% capitalized interest with blends to a 4.2%. Maybe I'll turn it over to Tom, if you want to add anything to that?"

I think your note was correct for South San Francisco for Class A rents today, particularly for that location, you're probably in the low to mid-80s.

But the all-in cost, given our land base is today for Vantage Phase 1 is in the $1,100 to $1,150 per foot range and the simple math on that is that it's a mid-7s return on cost, we'll end up getting a similar return on Nexus, it looks like. We're having really solid leasing momentum. We announced that project earlier this year we were projecting more of a mid- to high 6s return. It looks like we'll do quite a bit better than that.  
And then in West Cambridge, it is a bit more expensive to build there, not dramatically so, but the all-in cost for our underwriting. It's somewhere in the $1,300 per foot range. And I say range because it's still a little unclear exactly how much we'll be able to build, and that will obviously impact our land prices, but a decent estimate would be $1,300 per foot in West Cambridge, if you were building today, given our land cost. And then obviously, we just announced last night that we signed leases at $99 per foot on average within walking distance of that site.

Those are obviously returns that are higher than what somebody would achieve in the market today if they bought land at market, which we've seen a solid 30% to 50% increase in high-quality land as far as pricing, bringing those spreads down if one was to do a market transaction today, if you could find the high-quality land probably more back to that 150, 200 basis point spread in the mid-7s against our cost of capital, if that held, that's a solid 300-plus basis point spread in 4.25 cap type assets, do the math on that on the NAV accretion and on the earnings accretion, it's quite substantial.  
And I'm not trying to speak to returns that will be years down the road. But when you think in terms of the value of having locked up some of the best land and some of the best submarkets in the world, it really is going to allow us to be in a position where we're aware of new supply like everybody is. But if you've got -- if our land locations are in some of the hottest markets and the ecosystems with the greatest energy, we do think we'll get far more than our fair share of that leasing and that, that's going to be a profitable outcome for us for years to come. I think if we were starting from scratch, we would have an absolute possible time replicating that potential outcome. So I think it's a very strategic point that you've raised."

Steve, if we roll back a half a dozen years, we were spending just on pure development, I'm not talking redev about $100 million a year in development, that's ramped up. That's easily in the 400-plus range at this point. We would see that ramping up further to probably $600 million a year and maybe over time higher. But one of the things that we do pay a lot of attention to is the demand/supply work that we're doing so that we can time it appropriately. We look at pre-leasing. We look at funding risk, being very clear on where our funding is going to come from and Pete Scott has done a lot of work on that, that we've got internal work that we're glad to share it Nareit as to how we think about that. But I would see that ramping up.  
I think it's realistic, Steve, that we're not going to be sitting at 99% occupancy at South San Francisco forever. That just won't happen. So you're going to have some diminution of occupancy over time, and that would be natural. So then it comes down to is the land locations that we have that we'll be providing our new product, Class A product, is that going to be highly sought after, which we think it will be. And if some of it -- if you have -- if you return to a little bit more toward a normal vacancy, is it still profitable? And we've got so much cushion in our numbers that the answer is yes, it would still be profitable, very profitable. So those are things we're paying a lot of attention to. We spent a lot of time with our Board over the last couple of board meetings, going to the risks, how we mitigate those risks and why we're comfortable that this is a very sound play.  
The other thing I'd point out is even though we're talking about $600 million year of development, it could be $700 million or $800 million at some point or $900 million or it could drop back down to $300 million or $400 million. It's not like we've got a gun to our head as far as timing on putting that product out. So pre-leasing demand and supply are something that we're working on, on a monthly basis to have our thumb on the pulse of what's going on in the market."

We have the big concentration in Florida, which we think is a good thing. It's primarily an independent living business. So most of the economics in CCRCs are driven through the entry fee. And fortunately, the contracts there are really strong. So the fundamental demand for that business is good and the underlying profit center, which is the independent living is strong as well. But definitely, we had headwinds on labor in the third quarter, in particular. So we had a pretty significant increase in expenses. If you just look sequentially, we were up almost $5 million. That's about 5% just sequentially. And most of that was driven by labor. Now there's a labor shortage nationwide, but in Florida, it's particularly acute. And then on the health care side, it's been particularly meaningful. So we don't see that changing overnight. At the same time, it's unlikely to last indefinitely. So for sure, had a short-term impact on margin. We even had to reduce admissions in some cases. So it impacted revenue as well. But we do see that improving, but it's going to take some time.

The other thing I'd point out is if you were to go to the other math that we've shown in the deck that we provided on Page 7, you'll see that -- on that page, you'll see the shore, you'll see the Peak Oyster Point, Nexus, Vantage, Pointe Grand. On the shore, we have very significant development opportunity in that vacant land space that we're able to pick up with Sierra Point towers and that substantial. In Vantage, that's an enormous piece of land that we're going to be developing out. Nexus, we've got very, very strong traction, not quite enough to have announced it on this call, but as far as lease-up of that space, which inspired us to kick off the Vantage project. And Pointe Grand, we're going to be having a few of those buildings that are coming due at the end of 2022 on their leases, thank goodness, so we can start taking advantage of that huge densification opportunity asset by asset. I mean that thing was built at a 0.5 FAR a way back in the day, and that likely goes to -- I won't fill the number out, but something much, much higher.  
So when you start looking at -- and we have opportunities in San Diego as well or Sorrento Mesa. So when you start looking at what we have in West Cambridge, we have in South San Francisco, we have in Sorrento Mesa. We have to look at pre-leasing. We have to look at demand and supply. We have to look at where we have tenants that are seeking to grow that need space sooner to be able to the sequence as we take -- as we move each of these projects forward and how quickly, I do think, Michael, to your point, we're going to get the entitlement work done as quickly as we can. A lot of the soft work done and move forward with West Cambridge, that's not something that's going to sit out there for a long period of time, but we may have some other projects that have more immediacy in their ability to meet the demands of our tenants and the demands of our non-tenants in those particular markets. So I don't know the answer to that yet, but you can be sure, over the next few years that we'll have clearer and clearer answers as the markets play out."

We spend a lot of time on that exact question, Jordan. Today, MOBs high-quality probably come in at 50 to 100 basis points higher cap rate, so the initial yield.

Today, MOBs high-quality probably come in at 50 to 100 basis points higher cap rate, so the initial yield. There is a little bit more CapEx drag on MOB, in general, probably in the 20% range just on average CapEx -- total CapEx as a percentage of NOI. Obviously,                 will be higher or lower, but that's a decent average across the portfolio, and we've had 2.5 type percent growth for a decade or more. So the economics of that business are pretty straightforward. And when we compare that to life science, if you're starting at a 4 cap, just as an example, in today's market, high-quality building that would fit within our strategy and portfolio. The contractual escalators in that business tend to be in the 3% to 3.5% range, depending on which market you're in, South San Francisco being at the high end, Boston and San Diego be more in the 3% range. So the escalator is higher, just the contractual growth with lower CapEx. So just in theory, obviously, that would lead to a lower initial cap rate, which is exactly what you see, what has really turbocharged the life science returns over the past decade, of course, is the dramatic escalation in rents. They're up at least 10%, arguably closer to 20% over the past 12 months in our 3 core markets, which has obviously helped our mark-to-market across the portfolio that today is in the 20% range. That's on a $500-plus million base. So that's a lot of upside to capture as leases roll over the next decade or so.  
So you combine all of that, you start with the lower yield in life science, but obviously, a much higher growth rate that today, you probably come out to a higher IRR realistically in life science. But we're not assuming that rents are going to grow at 10% to 20% forever in life science. We think it's a great business. We think we have great locations, great team, in a really strong market position, but it's probably not realistic to think that rents grow at 10-plus percent forever. So we do still like the stability of that MOB business, but we don't think all of holes are created equal. So we're pretty careful about exactly what we put into the portfolio. And I think that is something that when you compare the different companies, you'll increasingly see that play out in the returns from that business."

So that's the 10-year history. Obviously, it's been even stronger. Over the past couple of years, there is a fair amount of new supply coming into the marketplace. So that could potentially weigh on rent growth at the same time, the escalation in demand is equally off the charts. We thought 2020 was a strong year for venture capital and IPOs. And on an annualized basis, it looks like 2021 is going to be 50% higher than 2020. And all of that capital leads to more real estate demand, obviously. It varies by company, but our math is that on average, every $1 million of VC and IPO that get raised translates to about 400 square feet of additional space. So $100 million raise is another 40,000 feet of space. Obviously, some tenants will need more, some less, but on average, that's a pretty significant amount of real estate that's needed to meet the growing demand. And given the success that these VCs have had, they're obviously having an equally enormous success raising their next funds, which will fund the next round of growth on top of the NIH funding, which just continues to grow. And that's really the first wave of capital in the pipeline that over the next 5 to 10 years, all that NIH funding, it's really basic science will start turning into the next clinical candidate.

Vacancy has obviously fallen to practically 0 in most of these -- of the big 3 markets in the better locations. So no surprise that you've seen rent growth that has been in the 5% to 7% CAGR range.  
You've seen land rise rapidly in price, along with labor and construction costs, which will put some pressure on the spreads that these are developed at unless you already own the land and you own it right.

In our CCRC business, it affects more so the SNF beds probably, as you know. CCRCs have a certain number of SNF beds to have the full continuum of care and provide those types of guarantees to the residents. We have had more contract labor than average by a long shot and that created higher expense load, which weighed a little bit on our same-store growth, which was to be expected, and that's a short-term item for us. It did cause us to pull back in a few assets on the admissions in SNF beds because, obviously, as you're no longer making money on filling a bed, you get to go back and revisit whether you leave a few beds empty for a period of time, but we consider that to be a short-term issue and one that will resolve. But those are the types of things that we're looking at on the labor front. But it's a real problem.  
Labor costs in senior housing in general, have been rising pretty dramatically. So you've got occupancy, the one has to keep an eye on, but also you can't spend revenue, you can spend NOI at the end of the day.
