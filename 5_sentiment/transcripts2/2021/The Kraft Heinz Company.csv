Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. 
We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today during the call, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release. 
Before we begin, I do want to highlight that we will provide greater details on our 2021 initiatives during our presentation at the CAGNY conference this coming Tuesday. So today's session will be most productive if you limit yourself to one question and focus your questions on our results and the announcements that we have made today. 
With that, I'll hand it back to the operator, and we can start the Q&A."

Now we're balancing that, too, with making sure that we have the right revenue management initiatives. And when I say that, I say using the full availability of our tools in our toolbox to be able to kind of handle the different pressures that may be coming at us because of inflation. 
So the way I think about it is our focus is driving that better value to consumers by making sure we are improving our portfolio, making sure we continue to invest behind the marketing and improving the quality of our media and making sure that we are seeing how that actually translated in us driving our improvement in shares throughout, like we did in 2020.

We are improving our creative and content and really sweating the assets and leveraging a better ROI. So I think that things are in accordance to plan in marketing.

And then strategically, I guess just to press a bit on Jonathan's question from a moment ago. Back in September, Real Food Snacking was something that you highlighted as a growth platform, and I'm assuming it still is. Planters was part of that. And so I appreciate and understand the rationale that you're articulating today around why Planters might not fit as well going forward, especially at the deal price that you've announced today.

I think today, you saw in the press release that we highlighted, there's still 2 specific areas within Real Food Snacking that we believe we have huge amount of advantages, and we're going to continue to drive those as we go forward. 
Specifically, we think about real fuel for kids, where lunch both is a cornerstone of that particular area and segment as well as real meal alternative where we think about adult opportunities to substitute meals, things like what we see in areas like P3, for example.

Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for a few quick opening remarks. Miguel?"

I just wanted to start our discussion today with a few overall thoughts.

I just wanted to start our discussion today with a few overall thoughts. First, that we have had a very, very encouraging start of the year, both top line and bottom line, with our strongest growth in priority platforms and markets, especially in underdeveloped countries with a very strong result. We had -- we were able to hold household penetration gains even as markets begin to open and effectively managing inflation and supply constraints. We are also very encouraged by our progress with initiatives to accelerate our advantage in different areas, like in marketing; being more agile and more creative in retail and foodservice joint business plans; in unlocking capacity in Grow and Energize platforms; and also on bringing efficiencies, gross efficiency gains, that we continue tracking to be about $400 million in the year. 
That said, we feel that it's still too early to change our outlook for the full year. We still expect 2021 financials to be ahead of our strategic plan. And we are expecting mid-single-digit growth in Q2 2021 versus the same period in '19. At the same time, we should see stronger but manageable inflation beginning in Q2. Finally, we are pleased with additional financial flexibility that we are building. We will continue to aggressively reduce debt, and our divestitures are on track to further increase flexibility. 
I will now hand it back to the operator, and we can start the Q&A."

We are going to have our heaviest comp in Q2 that we're going to be lapping a very low pricing cheese last year and a high price of pork bellies this year. But overall, in terms of the big 4, we are seeing a slight inflation. 
In terms of how we manage and hedge it, it varies by type of areas. So there are some commodities that we go longer beyond 6 months, 9 months; the other that are shorter, but this varies a lot. But what I can tell is overall, when we see the scenarios, of course, there is a lot of volatility in this market. 
But overall, when we see where the commodities are today, the range of mid-single digit is what we're seeing. And again, as I said, we are seeing us overall as a percent of COGS in the low end of this range."

First, that we have had a very, very encouraging start of the year, both top line and bottom line, with our strongest growth in priority platforms and markets, especially in underdeveloped countries with a very strong result. We had -- we were able to hold household penetration gains even as markets begin to open and effectively managing inflation and supply constraints. We are also very encouraged by our progress with initiatives to accelerate our advantage in different areas, like in marketing, being more agile and more creative in retail and foodservice joint business plans, in unlocking capacity in Grow and Energize platforms; and also on bringing efficiencies, gross efficiency gains, that we continue tracking to be about $400 million in the year.
That said, we feel that it's still too early to change our outlook for the full year. We still expect 2021 financials to be ahead of our strategic plan. And we are expecting mid-single-digit growth in Q2 2021 versus the same period in '19. At the same time, we should see stronger but manageable inflation beginning in Q2.

As it turns out, we are showing even stronger momentum than anticipated. Our team delivered solid first quarter growth at both top and bottom line, on top of extraordinary growth that we had in the first quarter last year. 
Even though we expect to be operating in a very unpredictable environment for some time, we have had a number of early wins. In our consumer platforms, in operations, in bolstering our talent and with our partners. And this should enable us to accelerate our advantage in the future quarters. 
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio while building additional financial flexibility, and this will position us to come out of this period much stronger, operationally and financially. 
From a financial perspective, our first quarter results were strong and better than expected. Q1 organic net sales grew 2.5% versus 2020. And that is on top of the 6.2% organic net sales growth we posted in the first quarter of 2020.  We also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth versus last year. If you recall, last year, we estimated that our additional COVID related demand resulted in approximately 9 to 10 percentage points of adjusted EBITDA growth versus Q1 2019. So building on that is very encouraging. 
In a nutshell, our first quarter results were characterized by retail consumption in developed markets remaining elevated, emerging market growth accelerating, while the broader benefits of our strategy continue to take hold. 
Slide 6 is a view of our platform based consumer-led model. As you can see, our growth platforms and emerging markets continue to be the major growth engines for the company. 
Our growth platforms, excluding Foodservice, continue to be our strongest contributor to top line growth, up 8% versus q1 2020. The growth is led by taste elevation, which, excluding Foodservice, was up 15% for Q1 2020 and 23% versus Q1 2019. In fact, across all our business segments, we continue to leverage our competitive advantages and scale in Taste Elevation. 
In emerging markets, specifically, we are now seeing the results of our localized go-to-market model has been to capture the tremendous white space opportunities in front of us. In both growth platforms and emerging markets, our strategy is clear. Our people are motivated, and we are excited about the growth ahead. 
Earlier this year, we outlined our renovation, innovation and marketing agenda. And Carlos and Rafa will outline the very solid start we have had in our 2 biggest business segments. A key ingredient to driving this agenda and a personal passion of mine since day 1 is building a culture of creativity at Kraft Heinz. 
Last year, we launched the ACE program to accelerate creative excellence. We are still early in this journey, but we are seeing very good results. In March, we took another step in that journey. Scheduling to celebrate best-in-class creative marketing from all around the world of Kraft Heinz with our first ever ACE awards. Here, we recognized and share the 2020 achievements of our incredibly talent Kraft Heinz marketers and agency partners. We brought in external advisers, world-class marketers who have won or served as charges at Cannes. The event celebrated our best creative work in 2020, but also served as an inspiration for our future. 
Our Canada team, in particular, had a very strong show in this year. They worked hard to enhance their portfolio with inventive campaigns like Heinz Pour Perfectly. The Hazelnut Spread U-bear campaign, and the Draw Ketchup campaign. They are also creatively backing innovations like our Lactose-free Philadelphia Cream Cheese. In fact, their creativity is a key reason that our Canada business is now gaining share in roughly 60% of its categories. 
Our U.K. Heinz Beans team recently had a lot of fun on Twitter with Weetabix, creating a national conversation, it quickly became the #1 trending story on Twitter in the U.K. with more than 2 billion media impressions, and driving our brand equity scores 6 points higher. 
Our goal is to become global leaders in marketing and brand management and that begin shifting our culture to be boler and more creative. And this creativity should allow us to accelerate our advantage in future quarters. 
In addition to the agility our brands and marketing teams are building, we are seeing our Ops Center act with agility, making progress in a very challenging environment. Similar to industry peers, our cost pressures have accelerated since the start of the year. For us, the greatest uptick has been in select ingredients like soybean and edible oils as well as packaging and logistics. And this is likely to result in higher year-on-year supply chain costs for our business versus what we originally anticipated. That being said, we continue to think our cost benefit equation as manageable. 
All things considered, our 2021 gross cost inflation should be in the middle single-digit range across our full cost basket. We continue to expect to deliver $400 million of gross efficiencies in 2021. And we have a robust revenue management initiatives around our iconic brands that is supported by a strong agenda of equity building investments. 
With that, I will now ask Carlos and Rafa to provide the highlights of our U.S. and International segment performance."

On Slide 10, you can see that the strong momentum we ended with last year in the U.S., and we have continued the growth in Q1. In fact, we still drove strong top line and bottom line results despite lapping the panic buying in Q1 last year as well as facing rising inflation this year. Our strategy is taking hold. We're getting much closer to our consumers, we are strengthening our brands. We are improving execution, and our people are motivated. 
If you recall, our U.S. 2021 plan begins with modernizing our portfolio and our approach to marketing. And while we expect our activity to ramp up as the year progresses, we have already had some good early signs of progress and impact. Our innovation agenda is beginning to take hold as we uncover and act on new consumer insights. 
In Taste Elevation, we leverage our insights into trending restaurant flavors, launching Heinz Ket-chilli and Buffa-Ranch to help consumers further embrace the fun of cooking at home. 
In our Easy Indulgent Dessert platform, we leverage the trends of our Philadelphia brands and consumers' love for cheesecake, launching Cheesecake Crumbles. This launch is helping us gain new space in the refrigerated section with a unique and differentiated innovation. 
To launch such a unique product, we partnered with Jimmy Kimmel Live to create TV skits that directly reflect a consumer insight. No one wants to share the last bite of food, especially when it's a cheesecake. As a result, we are driving incremental consumers to the category, with millennials and families engaging most strongly. And in March, we gained 3.5 points of market share. 
Finally,  is Omelet Rounds, part of our fast fresh meals platform that expands our leadership in breakfast. We believe that the breakfast at home trend will continue even as markets reopen. And we believe we have a big opportunity to lead in this space. 
As Miguel described earlier, we are also driving greater creativity in marketing as we ramp up overall investment levels and the quality of those investments, especially in our grow and energized platforms. 
Our V by Velveeta April Fool's skincare launch when viral, was a continuation of a breakthrough brand work starting in 2020, focused on capturing more share as demand for Mac and Cheese surges. By pulling forward media spend, updating creative and increasing personalized communication, Velveeta mac-and-cheese sales increased 30% in Q1, largely taking share of store brands. 
With Heinz, we're leading into the brand's purpose, demonstrating his can help unlock moments of magic for modern day families in the midst of chaos. We think this insight is behind the tremendous new household growth that Heinz brand has seen in the past year. 
We've also been able to achieve strong sales and share growth for Lunchables. Following decline from the pandemic related school closures, really thanks to focused programs like our Leave it to Lunchables rewards and a new $1 pack. 
Finally, for our $3 billion iconic Oscar Meyer brand. This week, we launched a fresh vibrant digital first campaign aiming to cement our leadership in quality, fun and taste. The campaign distances Oscar Mayer from competition. It came from listening to our most passionate consumers and imagining a new voice for Oscar Mayer that will be consistent, package design to communications. 
I am incredibly proud of our team's accomplishments to date, and it's just the beginning of what you can expect to see from Kraft Heinz as we discovered new occasion based insights and bring creative culturally relevant ways to drive stronger engagement with our consumers and customers. And because of our actions to date, our momentum with consumer has remained strong. 
In Q1, we held a household penetration versus last year when we saw unprecedented panic buying. And we're still 5% ahead of 2019 levels. 
I would also note that we chose to shift our promotional calendar in the U.S. this year. We significantly reduced promotional activity in January and February versus last year as a critical part of us moving to higher return investments and driving a virtuous cycle of growth. 
The good news is that despite the Q1 promotion reductions, we continue to make steady progress transforming our business with 50% of our U.S. business gaining share in March. 
Our partner program is key to unlocking the step-up in net sales versus pre pandemic level that we believe is possible. In Q1, we executed joint business plans or JBPs with more than 90% of our top retail targets. As a result, we expect to increase distribution for mandatory SKUs and our innovation programs, and it's driving much stronger merchandising execution. The discipline of execution is something I learn for many years in the DSD environment, and we are now bringing that level of accountability to our business. 
For instance, our Super Bowl activations were up about 20% versus 2019, leading to strong share gains. And our breakfast activations are driving strong increases for Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Oscar Mayer Bacon. Perhaps the best complement that we can get is direct feedback from our customers. We are working hard every day to show up differently, to partner in new ways and to execute flawlessly across channel, a very positive change from a year ago. 
I am particularly proud to see recent data showing that our e-commerce household penetration has increased more than our packaged food competitors, and that we now have the highest penetration amongst our peers. We continue to see very strong net sales growth and sustainable fundamental improvements in our e-commerce business, and we're not done. By piloting more agile route-to-markets and operating seamlessly across channels, we are bringing full consumer solutions online and making progress against our goal to be accessible and available to all families everywhere. 
Finally, there is no question that our Q1 performance will not have been as strong if our entire supply chain team didn't step up yet again. In what's turning out to be more difficult environment than we originally anticipated. We achieved our Q1 results despite weather disruptions, ongoing capacity constraints and escalating inflation. Our ops and procurement teams did a phenomenal job managing through the U.S. winter storms that hit Texas and other southern states. We focus our team on safety, setting up a war room to fix the situation, and quickly sourced alternative routes-to-market to keep shelves stocked. Yes, volumes were impacted. And higher costs were taking on by prioritizing customer service will limit the overall disruption to our business. It is a sign of the strong collaboration from sales to procurement to operations that results in transparency with our partners and improve availability for our consumers. At the same time, we have more work ahead. Our upstream continues to expand capacity in critical categories since Q3 of last year, we have released capacity constrained in 20% of our sales base with more projects underway. We are installing more capacity in critical growth platforms, including Taste Elevation and Easy Meals Made Better to unlock greater volume for Heinz Ketchup, Kraft Mac and Cheese single-serve dough,  Kraft Mayo, and others. So we are investing in people, brands and capacity for long-term growth and seeing early wins in growing our consumer platforms with better marketing innovation, strengthening the partnership with customers and accelerating e-commerce. Altogether, this gives me confidence in our path forward. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Rafa to discuss our international segment."

Similar to the U.S., our International segment is off to a strong start through Q1.  We are taking advantage of our global scale with local agility to drive top-line growth while delivering very strong adjusted EBITDA growth returns.
On slides 17 and 18, you can see the strong momentum we have out of the gate in 2021 in both our priority platforms and priority markets, respectively.
Retail net sales of Taste Elevation in our International segment were up 19% in Q1
versus 2020, driven by stepped-up marketing, distribution expansion, and a promising start of our 2021 innovation agenda.
We gained more than a point of share for the third consecutive quarter, with 92% of countries holding or gaining share in Taste Elevation.
Our results are beginning to prove out what to us was already clear that a laser focus on being the global leader in Taste Elevation has the potential to be a powerful and sustainable growth driver for Kraft Heinz.
Nowhere is this truer than in emerging markets, the other pillar of our International growth strategy.
Q1 Organic Net Sales in emerging markets were up 16% versus last year, with outsized growth in Latin America, China, the Middle East, and Russia. 
We delivered this growth as we have begun to ramp up marketing investments while rolling out our go-to-market model.
Market share growth continued as we picked up a half point of share in Q1, with 75% of emerging market countries holding or gaining share in the period.
Outside of retail, we are also seeing a strong rebound in Foodservice growth, with many emerging market countries now fully open.
This is especially encouraging to our overall growth strategy, as we believe there Is a positive halo effect on future retail sales associated with Foodservice channel growth today. 
As we see it, having more Heinz Ketchup or more Master Soy Sauce In restaurants will have positive spillover benefits to our brand equities and our
retail channel growth.
We are excited and encouraged by our early wins and we are looking forward to Capturing more of the enormous growth opportunities we have in our
International business.
With that, let me pass it on to Paulo for more of our financial performance and
our outlook."
278212,713127903,2265827,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q1 2021 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Rafa I will start on slide 20 with a more detailed look at our U.S. financial performance.As Carlos said, we had a strong start to 2021 in the U.S. versus both 2020 and 2019, a perspective we think will be more relevant as we begin to lap the",986,"Thank you, Rafa I will start on slide 20 with a more detailed look at our U.S. financial performance.
As Carlos said, we had a strong start to 2021 in the U.S. versus both 2020 and 2019, a perspective we think will be more relevant as we begin to lap the
exceptionally strong COVID-19-related consumer demand in 2020.
We had balanced contributions from volume/mix and pricing that helped drive organic net sales growth of 2.5% versus 2020, which included a negative 1.5
Percentage point impact from the McCafé exit.   And at adjusted EBITDA, pricing net of key commodity costs, favorable product mix, and volume growth more than offset the inflation as well as significant
Investments in marketing and people. This led to 5.8% adjusted EBITDA growth in Q1 2021 versus 2020, and 12.4% adjusted EBITDA growth versus 2019, including a negative 1.5 percentage point impact from the McCafé exit both years.
In Canada, we also had a strong quarter, with Organic Net Sales up 2.5% versus Q1 2020, driven by favorable trade expense timing versus the prior year and revenue management gains, as well as favorable changes in retail inventory Levels. These gains more than offset Foodservice declines and comparisons against pandemic-driven pantry loading last year.
Constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was also strong as compared to 2020 driven by pricing gains and favorable operating costs compared to high, prior year levels.  I will also note that the fluctuation in Canada profitability that you see on the slide Is largely due to the impact of the Canadian cheese divestiture, trade expense
Timing, and higher transitory costs that negatively impacted the Q1 2020 period.  However, we do expect more normalized comparisons as we move through the year.
Similar to the U.S. and Canada, our International segment has also performed Very well this quarter. First-quarter Organic Net Sales growth was 2.7% versus Q1 2020, driven by two factors.
One was a combination of inflation-driven pricing in emerging markets and revenue management gains in developed markets, which drove overall pricing
Gains in the quarter. 
The second factor was strong emerging market growth and some favorable retail inventory changes primary in developed markets that more than offset lower Foodservice sales.
In terms of profitability, pricing gains and favorable product mix drove constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 10.2% versus Q1 2020, even as we step up Our investment levels to support our strategic growth agenda.
As for our overall company, as Miguel mentioned, we had a solid start to the year with retail consumption remaining elevated in developed markets, accelerating growth in emerging markets, and the broader benefits of our strategy taking hold.
Organic Net Sales grew 2.5% in Q1 2021, reflecting the drivers I just outlined and came despite a 1.1 percentage point drag from exiting the McCafé licensing agreement. Organic Net Sales were also up 8.7% versus 2019.
Constant currency adjusted EBITDA, growth across all segments and lower year-on-year general corporate expenses contributed to growth of 10.4% versus 2020.  Adjusted EPS was up 24.1%, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth and a lower effective tax rate due to favorable, non-cash discrete items in the current year period. Below adjusted EBITDA factors in Q1 were, therefore, net favorable by roughly $0.03.
And for the full year, excluding any potential changes in the U.S. tax code, we now expect that below adjusted EBITDA items will be neutral on a net basis versus 2020. This view reflects a full-year effective tax rate between 20 and 22%, and lower interest expenses versus 2020 levels roughly offset by unfavorable impacts from non-cash other income and expense, and stock-based compensation costs. 
Finally, our first-quarter Free Cash Flow generation was up more than $500 million versus Q1 2020, driven by favorable working capital and adjusted EBITDA growth that more than offset higher capex investments.
To echo Miguel, Carlos, and Rafa, we are having a solid start to the year, and we are seeing som early wins across our consumer platforms, ops center, and partner programs that can accelerate our advantages as the year progresses.
As you can see on slide 24, we are continuing to fuel our growth by investing to strengthen our portfolio and building financial flexibility.
Q1 CapEx increased to $227 million as we dedicated a majority of our spend to our priorities – namely capacity, replacement, and technology projects – designed to relieve current supply chain stress and support future growth.  From a leverage perspective, we reduced our debt load by tendering roughly $1 billion in obligations in the first quarter.  And finally, we are making good progress against our 2 previously announced divestitures.
We remain on track to close the Nuts divestiture during the second quarter.  And we currently expect the Cheese divestiture to close in the second half of 2021, providing a bit more time to complete all closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
Regarding the path forward, for the second quarter, we expect solid gains versus pre-pandemic levels.
However, relative to what we saw in Q1, we are anticipating more cost inflation relative to price and a change in channel mix as developed economies progress towards reopening.
As a result, we currently expect Q2 organic net sales and constant currency adjusted EBITDA to be up mid-single digits versus Q2 2019. And this includes the impact of the Canada Cheese divestiture, the McCafé business exit, and normalizing incentive compensation versus the 2019 period.
Versus elevated 2020 levels, our outlook represents an organic net sales decline in the low-single-digit range and a mid-single-digit decline in constant currency adjusted EBITDA.
For full year 2021, given the environment that we are operating in, we think it is too early to change our full-year outlook.   That said, we are very.
Pleased with the strong start we are having to the year and we continue to expect financial results ahead of our strategic plan.
With that, let me hand it back to Miguel for some closing comments."

As recently as February, I said we would begin 2021 with momentum across our brands and business. As it turns out, we are showing even stronger momentum than anticipated. Our team delivered solid first quarter growth at both top and bottom line on top of extraordinary growth that we had in the first quarter last year.  
Even though we expect to be operating in a very unpredictable environment for some time, we have had a number of early wins, in our consumer platforms, in operations, in bolstering our talent and with our partners. And this should enable us to accelerate our advantage in the future quarters. We also continue to strengthen our portfolio while building additional financial flexibility, and this will position us to come out of this period much stronger operationally and financially. 
From a financial perspective, our first quarter results were strong and better than expected. Q1 organic net sales grew 2.5% versus 2020. And that is on top of the 6.2% organic net sales growth we posted in the first quarter of 2020.  We also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth versus last year. If you recall, last year, we estimated that our additional COVID-related demand resulted in approximately 9 to 10 percentage points of adjusted EBITDA growth versus Q1 2019. So building on that is very encouraging. 
In a nutshell, our first quarter results were characterized by retail consumption in developed markets remaining elevated, emerging market growth accelerating while the broader benefits of our strategy continue to take hold. 
Slide 6 is a view of our platform-based, consumer-led model. As you can see, our Grow platforms and Emerging Markets continue to be the major growth engines for the company.

The discipline of execution is something I learn from many years in the DSD environment, and we are now bringing that level of accountability to our business.  For instance, our Super Bowl activations were up about 20% versus 2019, leading to strong share gains. And our breakfast activations are driving strong increases for Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Oscar Mayer bacon. 
Perhaps the best compliment that we can get is direct feedback from our customers. We are working hard every day to show up differently, to partner in new ways and to execute flawlessly across channel, a very positive change from a year ago. 
I am particularly proud to see recent data showing that our e-commerce household penetration has increased more than our packaged food competitors, and that we now have the highest penetration amongst our peers. We continue to see very strong net sales growth and sustainable, fundamental improvements in our e-commerce business. And we are not done. By piloting more agile route-to-markets and operating seamlessly across channels, we are bringing full consumer solutions online and making progress against our goal to be accessible and available to all families everywhere. 
Finally, there is no question that our Q1 performance would not have been as strong if our entire supply chain team didn't step up yet again in what's turning out to be a more difficult environment than we originally anticipated. We achieved our Q1 results despite weather disruptions, ongoing capacity constraints and escalating inflation. 
Our ops and procurement teams did a phenomenal job managing through the U.S. winter storms that hit Texas and other southern states. We focused our team on safety, setting up a war room to fix the situation and quickly sourced alternative routes-to-market to keep shelves stocked.  Yes, volumes were impacted and higher costs were taken on. But by prioritizing customer service, we limited the overall disruption to our business. It is a sign of the strong collaboration from sales to procurement to operations that results in transparency with our partners and improved availability for our consumers. 
At the same time, we have more work ahead. Our ops team continues to expand capacity in critical categories. Since Q3 of last year, we have relieved capacity constrains in 20% of our sales base with more projects underway. We are installing more capacity in critical Grow platforms, including Taste Elevation and Easy Meals Made Better, to unlock greater volume for Heinz Ketchup, Kraft Mac & Cheese single-serve cups,  Kraft Mayo and others. 
So we are investing in people, brands and capacity for long-term growth and seeing early wins in growing our consumer platforms with better marketing innovation, strengthening the partnership with customers and accelerating e-commerce. Altogether, this gives me confidence in our path forward. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Rafa to discuss our International segment."

Similar to the U.S., our International segment is off to a strong start through Q1.  We are taking advantage of our global scale with local agility to drive top line growth while delivering very strong adjusted EBITDA growth returns.
On Slides 17 and 18, you can see the strong momentum we have out of the gate in 2021 in both our priority platforms and priority markets, respectively.
Retail net sales of Taste Elevation in our International segment were up 19% in Q1 versus 2020 driven by stepped-up marketing, distribution expansion and a promising start of our 2021 innovation agenda.  We gained more than a point of share for the third consecutive quarter with 92% of countries holding or gaining share in Taste Elevation.  Our results are beginning to prove out what to us was already clear that a laser focus on being the global leader in Taste Elevation has the potential to be a powerful and sustainable growth driver for Kraft Heinz.  
Nowhere is this truer than in Emerging Markets, the other pillar of our International growth strategy. Q1 organic net sales in Emerging Markets were up 16% versus last year with outsized growth in Latin America, China, the Middle East and Russia.  We delivered this growth as we have begun to ramp up marketing investments while rolling out our go-to-market model.  Market share growth continued as we picked up a half point of share in Q1 with 75% of emerging market countries holding or gaining share in the period.
Outside of retail, we are also seeing a strong rebound in foodservice growth with many emerging market countries now fully open.  This is especially encouraging to our overall growth strategy as we believe there is a positive halo effect on future retail sales associated with foodservice channel growth today.  As we see it, having more Heinz Ketchup or more Master Soy Sauce in restaurants will have positive spillover benefits to our brand equities and our retail channel growth.
We are excited and encouraged by our early wins and we are looking forward to capturing more of the enormous growth opportunities we have in our International business.
With that, let me pass it on to Paulo for more of our financial performance and our outlook."

I will start on Slide 20 with a more detailed look at our U.S. financial performance.  As Carlos said, we had a strong start to 2021 in the U.S. versus both 2020 and 2019, a perspective we think will be more relevant as we begin to lap",988,"Thank you, Rafa. 
I will start on Slide 20 with a more detailed look at our U.S. financial performance.  As Carlos said, we had a strong start to 2021 in the U.S. versus both 2020 and 2019, a perspective we think will be more relevant as we begin to lap the exceptionally strong COVID-19-related consumer demand in 2020.  
We had balanced contributions from volume/mix and pricing that helped drive organic net sales growth of 2.5% versus 2020, which included a negative 1.5 percentage point impact from the McCafé exit.   And at adjusted EBITDA, pricing net of key commodity costs, favorable product mix and volume growth more than offset the inflation as well as significant investments in marketing and people. This led to 5.8% adjusted EBITDA growth in Q1 2021 versus 2020 and 12.4% adjusted EBITDA growth versus 2019, including a negative 1.5 percentage point impact from the McCafé exit both years.
In Canada, we also had a strong quarter with organic net sales up 2.5% versus Q1 2020 driven by favorable trade expense timing versus the prior year and revenue management gains as well as favorable changes in retail inventory levels. These gains more than offset foodservice declines and comparisons against pandemic-driven pantry loading last year.
Constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was also strong as compared to 2020 driven by pricing gains and favorable operating costs compared to high prior year levels.  
I will also note that the fluctuation in Canada profitability that you see on the slide is largely due to the impact of the Canadian cheese divestiture, trade expense timing and higher transitory costs that negatively impacted the Q1 2020 period.  However, we do expect more normalized comparisons as we move through the year.
Similar to the U.S. and Canada, our International segment has also performed very well this quarter. First quarter organic net sales growth was 2.7% versus Q1 2020 driven by 2 factors.  One was a combination of inflation-driven pricing in emerging markets and revenue management gains in developed markets, which drove overall pricing gains in the quarter.  The second factor was strong emerging market growth and some favorable retail inventory changes primary in developed markets that more than offset lower foodservice sales.
In terms of profitability, pricing gains and favorable product mix drove constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 10.2% versus Q1 2020, even as we step up our investment levels to support our strategic growth agenda.
As for our overall company, as Miguel mentioned, we had a solid start to the year with retail consumption remaining elevated in developed markets, accelerating growth in emerging markets and the broader benefits of our strategy taking hold.
Organic net sales grew 2.5% in Q1 2021, reflecting the drivers I just outlined and came despite a 1.1 percentage point drag from exiting the McCafé licensing agreement. Organic net sales were also up 8.7% versus 2019. At constant currency adjusted EBITDA, growth across all segments and lower year-on-year general corporate expenses contributed to growth of 10.4% versus 2020.  
Adjusted EPS was up 24.1% driven by adjusted EBITDA growth and a lower effective tax rate due to favorable noncash discrete items in the current year period.  Below adjusted EBITDA factors in Q1 were, therefore, net favorable by roughly $0.03.  And for the full year, excluding any potential changes in the U.S. tax code, we now expect that below adjusted EBITDA items will be neutral on a net basis versus 2020. This view reflects a full year effective tax rate between 20% and 22% and lower interest expenses versus 2020 levels roughly offset by unfavorable impacts from noncash other income and expense and stock-based compensation costs. 
Finally, our first quarter free cash flow generation was up more than $500 million versus Q1 2020 driven by favorable working capital and adjusted EBITDA growth that more than offset higher CapEx investments.  
To echo Miguel, Carlos and Rafa, we are having a solid start to the year, and we are seeing some early wins across our consumer platforms, Ops Center and partner programs that can accelerate our advantages as the year progresses.
As you can see on Slide 24, we are continuing to fuel our growth by investing to strengthen our portfolio and building financial flexibility.  Q1 CapEx increased to $227 million as we dedicated a majority of our spend to our priorities, namely capacity, replacement and technology projects  designed to relieve current supply chain stress and support future growth.  
From a leverage perspective, we reduced our debt load by tendering roughly $1 billion in obligations in the first quarter.  
And finally, we are making good progress against our 2 previously announced divestitures.  We remain on track to close the Nuts divestiture during the second quarter, and we currently expect the Cheese divestiture to close in the second half of 2021, providing a bit more time to complete all closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
Regarding the path forward, for the second quarter, we expect solid gains versus prepandemic levels. However, relative to what we saw in Q1, we are anticipating more cost inflation relative to price and a change in channel mix as developed economies progress towards reopening.  As a result, we currently expect Q2 organic net sales and constant currency adjusted EBITDA to be up mid-single digits versus Q2 2019. And this includes the impact of the Canada Cheese divestiture, the McCafé business exit and normalizing incentive compensation versus the 2019 period.  
Versus elevated 2020 levels, our outlook represents an organic net sales decline in the low-single-digit range and a mid-single-digit decline in constant currency adjusted EBITDA.  For full year 2021, given the environment that we are operating in, we think it's too early to change our full year outlook. That said, we are very pleased with the strong start we are having to the year, and we continue to expect financial results ahead of our strategic plan.
With that, let me hand it back to Miguel for some closing comments."

I'd just like to add or summarize and tell you that we are very optimistic about how we are progressing in our transformation at Kraft Heinz. We've been taking advantage of the scale that we have, and we've been building the agility that we need to build a better business for the future. 
We posted sustainable top line and bottom line gains versus '19, and we are encouraged because the strongest growth comes from priority platforms and markets, what we call the growth platforms, Taste Elevation and in emerging markets. And we continue seeing retail very strong, and we are coming back with foodservice. It's recovering and recovering fast. 
Transforming Kraft Heinz is what we all have in mind, and we want to do that, maintaining the industry-leading profitability. We are investing more in our brands and better as well, building a much more creative company. 
We are also on track to deliver the $400 million of gross efficiencies in 2021 and effectively managing inflation. At the same time, we continue strengthening our portfolio and improving financial flexibility. We are adding capacity to our products to drive growth and energize platforms, and in the emerging markets. 
We, as you know, closed the Nets divestiture, and we expect to close the cheese divestiture in the second half of this year. 
Recently, we acquired Assan Foods in Turkey. It's a very small operation, but it's a very important step into our strategy because it accelerates Taste Elevation and is in the emerging markets. And we continue to pay down debt and improve our net leverage. 
We continue to expect to have a very good 2021 actually to deliver a stronger 2021 than we projected when we provided our initial outlook in February, and that speaks to the strength and potential of our ongoing business. Thank you. We are all now ready for your questions."

First, I think I will say is in the U.S., what we have said in the past is that we are proactively managing against the incremental inflation we see. And actually, we feel good about our ability to implement those actions when and where we see the need. 
So if you look at the inflation we saw in Q2, it's mainly coming from ingredients, things like soybeans, edible oils, packaging and some transportation as well, and it's very similar to what we saw in the first quarter. And most recently, we also saw some increases, too, but driven by resin cost and some higher transportation rates. 
Now from a pricing perspective, as I mentioned on the call, we are restoring key promotional activations to drive the business versus the pandemic-induced pullbacks that we had in 2020. Now as we have mentioned earlier in the year, our goal continues to be to connect with consumers that now have discovered or rediscovered our brands and drive the repeat rate among those households. 
So in that context, and versus inflation, again, we feel good about our ability to achieve the net pricing we need to offset inflation and maintain strong household and repeat rate given that we are renovating our portfolio to drive better value for consumers, improving the creative content of our marketing and strengthening and diversifying our media impressions. 
What I will also add is that we're doing this primarily through 4 key revenue management initiatives. First, we're optimizing the frequency and depths of our promotion, while we restore retail activation levels that I discussed in the call. 
Second, we are doing broad-based pricing actions, which we have announced across our portfolio. 
Third, we're continuing to manage key commodity pricing. 
And lastly, we're using other revenue management levers, including price pack architecture and managing our category price ladders. 
So if you look at our revenue management initiatives, they are guiding our smart trade investments, so we can optimize returns on those investments and manage through the current inflationary environment. 
Now in the near term, the timing of cost inflation versus price realization may lead to some degree of margin pressure, but this is reflected in an outlook. And we see net pricing and cost coming into balance as we exit the year. 
And with that, let me pass it over to Paulo. Any other comments, if you want to add, Paulo."

I think if you want to like frame inflation and pricing from a total company perspective, to break it down first on inflation, you're going to recall that in April, we said that we're expecting inflation in the mid-single-digit range as a percent of COGS, but at the lower end of that range. 
Since April, our costs have continued to move higher. Now we are expecting inflation still in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, but now it's slightly above the midpoint of the mid-single-digit range. 
Regarding pricing, as we are mentioning, and Carlos has just said, we are using multiple revenue management levers, including lease price actions to manage the inflation. But I think it's important for us to keep in mind that we're going to be facing an unusually difficult pricing comparison in the second half last year. 
Just to remind, just for context, last year, second half, our price was more than 4% higher than the prior year, but as we pulled back on promotion to better protect customer service. 
In terms of the timing and the pricing realization, why we expect the timing of the cost inflation versus price realization to soften our margin percentage, to lower than the run rate levels in the short term, I think it's important to note that all of those impacts are already considered in the outlook that we have for the year, okay? 
And again, as we mentioned at the beginning, we are still expecting -- or now expecting a even stronger EBITDA dollars than we anticipated before."

I think those initiatives, together with our savings program of a $2 billion savings program and -- will be sufficient together with the investments that we are making to improve the relevance of our brands. 
So again, we are very confident around our ability to manage the inflation and support the investments behind our turnaround as we are exiting '21 and entering '22."

In the quarter or even year-to-date, that, currently, we're seeing basically all channels are up, right? I think it was -- I think that's been sort of one of the surprises as we move through '21 is that as away from home and foodservice channels have improved, the at-home consumption has also stayed relatively elevated. 
So I guess, my question for both of you is just simply how long do you expect this to continue. And I guess, as things normalize, would you expect the foodservice piece of it to really begin to accelerate more and somewhat offset the at-home consumption? So just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about those 2 channels, especially since, right now, they're both up."

I think it's very fair. Let me start, and then I'll have Rafa kind of give a perspective on international. I think from -- in the U.S. from an industry perspective, you're right. Channel trends are still no",655,"Listen, first of all, thanks for the question. I think it's very fair. Let me start, and then I'll have Rafa kind of give a perspective on international. 
I think from -- in the U.S. from an industry perspective, you're right. Channel trends are still normalizing, but I have to also say it's too early to tell how the share of stomach between away from home and at-home, ultimately, it's going to kind of all net out. 
Now recently, it does seem like all channels are growing, but that's probably not likely to remain the case, and that's not buildings necessarily into our expectations. Now in terms of our business, what we see is we're optimistic about our plans that we can actually drive sustainable growth in both the retail and the foodservice. 
And I think it's fair to say that we also have a big ambition from away-from-home business. We believe foodservice is actually both a generation of insights and innovation that can actually help in the retail side of the business. And it's also capable of driving outsized growth because we have actually put a renewed focus on culinary distribution and channel expansion. 
And some of those channel trends, while still normalizing, it's still a little bit early to say, predicting exactly where it's all going to happen. Now what I do say is that I do believe we're going to be stronger versus what we saw pre-pandemic and essentially for 2 key reasons. 
First, because our foodservice mix favor the QSR. And actually, that stands to recover, and we are seeing that already faster than the rest of the foodservice channel. And we also see that be more resilient post pandemic. 
And frankly, early in the pandemic, we also made a strategic bet to support that growth in QSR, and that bet is paying up. We now have 30% more capacity in our small packet of ketchup and sauces. So that actually has been seem to be working. 
And secondly, we see a more durable step-up in at-home consumption that comes at the expense of other categories and brands without necessarily sacrificing foodservice recovery and growth. 
And then lastly, let me just give you a little more color on the away-from-home. I mentioned that we gained a point of market share, foodservice recovery begins, and much of that actually was fueled by the actions we took in 3 areas that I mentioned: culinary, distribution and new channels. 
So in Q2, we actually executed 9 co-branded culinary limited time offers with QSR partners. Just one of those was actually so successful because when it became part of a permanent menu item, and that was going to be in '22, and if you think about that context of the fact that we've been able to drive those kind of limited time offers with QSR, in 2019, we had none of those. So we are certainly driving a different level of execution with QSR. 
Now the second part of that, which is distribution, we actually grew key accounts by 20% over the said quarter. 
And then finally, as consumers continue to evolve, how they cook and they eat and including the use of meal delivery kits, we're actually inserting our Kraft Heinz brands into that equation. So we are working with one popular direct-to-consumer company to develop things like a recipe specifically for our Philadelphia Cream Cheese as a main ingredient of their products, and that actual one product was ordered over 200,000 times, with -- by consumers, really an all-time record for that sales partner. 
So when you look at it holistically, again, I feel very optimistic about our Away-From-Home business, and that it actually is going to be a springboard for us to continue to drive retail growth. Now that's a perspective in the U.S. 
And Rafa, if you want to add something in terms of the international business, how you see it."

Bryan, look, on balance, our developed markets are experiencing very similar trends to retail and foodservice in U.S. and Canada.  
Emerging markets, on the other hand, foodservice has actually rebounded stronger than in developed markets, right? And most countries either had shorter or even stricter lockdowns, but kept their economies open during the pandemic overall. 
So I mean, the consumption obviously differs country by country in home and out-of-home. The path of the pandemic lockdown approach, vaccine availability changes a lot. And given the Delta variant now, it's a bit early to tell how the channels, where the channels will stabilize, right, in the second half. 
But all that said, I mean, we are seeing a lot of improvements on the retail channels, especially in Taste Elevation and giving us like a lot of confidence that we will come out of the pandemic well positioned, right, after the pandemic. 
On the foodservice side, our mix is even more weighted towards QSR than U.S. -- than the U.S. is. So the format -- and this format is recovering very quickly. So with distribution gains in emerging markets and the potential of the foodservice that we still have across our overall international, I'm still quite optimistic that after the pandemic ends, the net will be quite positive."

Let me say that, first, we are excited about the changes that we have been making in our marketing programs and capabilities. We've been investing not only in our brands, but also in our people. This is an area that I'm very passionate about and -- given the importance that it has to drive our growth. 
We are driving improvements actually a couple of ways. The first one is more marketing dollars, right, that we put -- we have $100 million more in marketing than we had in 2019. And we said that we want to increase marketing moving forward. So it's our intention. 
However, I think it's not only about increasing marketing. It's really about efficiencies. We are today achieving 30% more of our consumers with the same spend by doing better marketing, not only better marketing, but also better media. 
And third, I think I'm very excited about stepping up on creativity in our company today. We started an internal agency in digital media in Canada and -- in May last year. And today, we have 12 of these internal hubs in different places covering more than 30 markets around the world. And that is critical for marketing efficiency because it's faster, better and much more creative. 
And we can really have marketing linked to the culture and we need to be very fast on that. So overall, that would be my answer for marketing. 
Carlos, you may answer the second one."

And I think that when you take a step back and you look at our overall performance, I think what we are proving is that our consumer platform approach, our focus on renovation, innovation and marketing and our resale activations, they're all working. 
Now going forward, we will continue this agenda. We're going to increase support around key holidays, while using price, promotional optimization and, as I mentioned earlier, all the revenue management tools to manage the inflation. 
Now for our total business, and I think to your point about asking about the future, there are several factors impacting the category performance.

We've also now seen the Delta variant and the rising case counts across the U.S., and those are factors that we're also closely monitoring and, in particular, because they are important in terms of thinking about how families are preparing for the upcoming school year. 
So I think that all things that are -- that make it very difficult for us to say at this point is exactly how this is all going to shape out. What I can tell you is that we are focused on those things we can control.

Transforming Kraft Heinz is what we all have in mind, and we want to do that, maintaining the industry-leading profitability. We are investing more in our brands and better as well, building a much more creative company. 
We are also on track to deliver the $400 million of gross efficiencies in 2021 and effectively managing inflation. At the same time, we continue strengthening our portfolio and improving financial flexibility. We are adding capacity to our products to drive growth and energize platforms, and in the emerging markets. 
We, as you know, closed the Nets divestiture, and we expect to close the cheese divestiture in the second half of this year. 
Recently, we acquired Assan Foods in Turkey. It's a very small operation, but it's a very important step into our strategy because it accelerates Taste Elevation and is in the emerging markets. And we continue to pay down debt and improve our net leverage. 
We continue to expect to have a very good 2021 actually to deliver a stronger 2021 than we projected when we provided our initial outlook in February, and that speaks to the strength and potential of our ongoing business. Thank you. We are all now ready for your questions."

First, I think I will say is in the U.S., what we have said in the past is that we are proactively managing against the incremental inflation we see. And actually, we feel good about our ability to implement those actions when and where we see the need. 
So if you look at the inflation we saw in Q2, it's mainly coming from ingredients, things like soybeans, edible oils, packaging and some transportation as well, and it's very similar to what we saw in the first quarter. And most recently, we also saw some increases, too, but driven by resin cost and some higher transportation rates. 
Now from a pricing perspective, as I mentioned on the call, we are restoring key promotional activations to drive the business versus the pandemic-induced pullbacks that we had in 2020. Now as we have mentioned earlier in the year, our goal continues to be to connect with consumers that now have discovered or rediscovered our brands and drive the repeat rate among those households. 
So in that context, and versus inflation, again, we feel good about our ability to achieve the net pricing we need to offset inflation and maintain strong household and repeat rate given that we are renovating our portfolio to drive better value for consumers, improving the creative content of our marketing and strengthening and diversifying our media impressions. 
What I will also add is that we're doing this primarily through 4 key revenue management initiatives. First, we're optimizing the frequency and depths of our promotion, while we restore retail activation levels that I discussed in the call. 
Second, we are doing broad-based pricing actions, which we have announced across our portfolio. 
Third, we're continuing to manage key commodity pricing. 
And lastly, we're using other revenue management levers, including price pack architecture and managing our category price ladders. 
So if you look at our revenue management initiatives, they are guiding our smart trade investments, so we can optimize returns on those investments and manage through the current inflationary environment. 
Now in the near term, the timing of cost inflation versus price realization may lead to some degree of margin pressure, but this is reflected in an outlook. And we see net pricing and cost coming into balance as we exit the year. 
And with that, let me pass it over to Paulo. Any other comments, if you want to add, Paulo."

I think if you want to like frame inflation and pricing from a total company perspective, to break it down first on inflation, you're going to recall that in April, we said that we're expecting inflation in the mid-single-digit range as a percent of COGS, but at the lower end of that range. 
Since April, our costs have continued to move higher. Now we are expecting inflation still in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, but now it's slightly above the midpoint of the mid-single-digit range. 
Regarding pricing, as we are mentioning, and Carlos has just said, we are using multiple revenue management levers, including lease price actions to manage the inflation. But I think it's important for us to keep in mind that we're going to be facing an unusually difficult pricing comparison in the second half last year. 
Just to remind, just for context, last year, second half, our price was more than 4% higher than the prior year, but as we pulled back on promotion to better protect customer service. 
In terms of the timing and the pricing realization, why we expect the timing of the cost inflation versus price realization to soften our margin percentage, to lower than the run rate levels in the short term, I think it's important to note that all of those impacts are already considered in the outlook that we have for the year, okay? 
And again, as we mentioned at the beginning, we are still expecting -- or now expecting a even stronger EBITDA dollars than we anticipated before."

I think those initiatives, together with our savings program of a $2 billion savings program and -- will be sufficient together with the investments that we are making to improve the relevance of our brands.

In the quarter or even year-to-date, that, currently, we're seeing basically all channels are up, right? I think it was -- I think that's been sort of one of the surprises as we move through '21 is that as away from home and foodservice channels have improved, the at-home consumption has also stayed relatively elevated. 
So I guess, my question for both of you is just simply how long do you expect this to continue. And I guess, as things normalize, would you expect the foodservice piece of it to really begin to accelerate more and somewhat offset the at-home consumption?

Channel trends are still no",655,"Listen, first of all, thanks for the question. I think it's very fair. Let me start, and then I'll have Rafa kind of give a perspective on international. 
I think from -- in the U.S. from an industry perspective, you're right. Channel trends are still normalizing, but I have to also say it's too early to tell how the share of stomach between away from home and at-home, ultimately, it's going to kind of all net out. 
Now recently, it does seem like all channels are growing, but that's probably not likely to remain the case, and that's not buildings necessarily into our expectations. Now in terms of our business, what we see is we're optimistic about our plans that we can actually drive sustainable growth in both the retail and the foodservice. 
And I think it's fair to say that we also have a big ambition from away-from-home business. We believe foodservice is actually both a generation of insights and innovation that can actually help in the retail side of the business. And it's also capable of driving outsized growth because we have actually put a renewed focus on culinary distribution and channel expansion. 
And some of those channel trends, while still normalizing, it's still a little bit early to say, predicting exactly where it's all going to happen. Now what I do say is that I do believe we're going to be stronger versus what we saw pre-pandemic and essentially for 2 key reasons. 
First, because our foodservice mix favor the QSR. And actually, that stands to recover, and we are seeing that already faster than the rest of the foodservice channel. And we also see that be more resilient post pandemic. 
And frankly, early in the pandemic, we also made a strategic bet to support that growth in QSR, and that bet is paying up. We now have 30% more capacity in our small packet of ketchup and sauces. So that actually has been seem to be working. 
And secondly, we see a more durable step-up in at-home consumption that comes at the expense of other categories and brands without necessarily sacrificing foodservice recovery and growth. 
And then lastly, let me just give you a little more color on the away-from-home. I mentioned that we gained a point of market share, foodservice recovery begins, and much of that actually was fueled by the actions we took in 3 areas that I mentioned: culinary, distribution and new channels. 
So in Q2, we actually executed 9 co-branded culinary limited time offers with QSR partners. Just one of those was actually so successful because when it became part of a permanent menu item, and that was going to be in '22, and if you think about that context of the fact that we've been able to drive those kind of limited time offers with QSR, in 2019, we had none of those. So we are certainly driving a different level of execution with QSR. 
Now the second part of that, which is distribution, we actually grew key accounts by 20% over the said quarter. 
And then finally, as consumers continue to evolve, how they cook and they eat and including the use of meal delivery kits, we're actually inserting our Kraft Heinz brands into that equation. So we are working with one popular direct-to-consumer company to develop things like a recipe specifically for our Philadelphia Cream Cheese as a main ingredient of their products, and that actual one product was ordered over 200,000 times, with -- by consumers, really an all-time record for that sales partner. 
So when you look at it holistically, again, I feel very optimistic about our Away-From-Home business, and that it actually is going to be a springboard for us to continue to drive retail growth. Now that's a perspective in the U.S. 
And Rafa, if you want to add something in terms of the international business, how you see it."

Bryan, look, on balance, our developed markets are experiencing very similar trends to retail and foodservice in U.S. and Canada.  
Emerging markets, on the other hand, foodservice has actually rebounded stronger than in developed markets, right? And most countries either had shorter or even stricter lockdowns, but kept their economies open during the pandemic overall. 
So I mean, the consumption obviously differs country by country in home and out-of-home. The path of the pandemic lockdown approach, vaccine availability changes a lot. And given the Delta variant now, it's a bit early to tell how the channels, where the channels will stabilize, right, in the second half. 
But all that said, I mean, we are seeing a lot of improvements on the retail channels, especially in Taste Elevation and giving us like a lot of confidence that we will come out of the pandemic well positioned, right, after the pandemic. 
On the foodservice side, our mix is even more weighted towards QSR than U.S. -- than the U.S. is. So the format -- and this format is recovering very quickly. So with distribution gains in emerging markets and the potential of the foodservice that we still have across our overall international, I'm still quite optimistic that after the pandemic ends, the net will be quite positive."

Let me say that, first, we are excited about the changes that we have been making in our marketing programs and capabilities. We've been investing not only in our brands, but also in our people. This is an area that I'm very passionate about and -- given the importance that it has to drive our growth. 
We are driving improvements actually a couple of ways. The first one is more marketing dollars, right, that we put -- we have $100 million more in marketing than we had in 2019. And we said that we want to increase marketing moving forward. So it's our intention. 
However, I think it's not only about increasing marketing. It's really about efficiencies. We are today achieving 30% more of our consumers with the same spend by doing better marketing, not only better marketing, but also better media. 
And third, I think I'm very excited about stepping up on creativity in our company today. We started an internal agency in digital media in Canada and -- in May last year. And today, we have 12 of these internal hubs in different places covering more than 30 markets around the world. And that is critical for marketing efficiency because it's faster, better and much more creative. 
And we can really have marketing linked to the culture and we need to be very fast on that. So overall, that would be my answer for marketing. 
Carlos, you may answer the second one."

Specific to market share and our performance, I would say we're off to a very solid start to the year. And you saw in the presentation, we are seeing household penetration and repeat rate growth rates much higher than pre-pandemic levels. And we are gaining share in actually 58% of the business, and  it's an improvement from last quarter where -- and certainly from what we saw in 2019 pre-pandemic. 
And I think that when you take a step back and you look at our overall performance, I think what we are proving is that our consumer platform approach, our focus on renovation, innovation and marketing and our resale activations, they're all working. 
Now going forward, we will continue this agenda. We're going to increase support around key holidays, while using price, promotional optimization and, as I mentioned earlier, all the revenue management tools to manage the inflation. 
Now for our total business, and I think to your point about asking about the future, there are several factors impacting the category performance. But I would say the most important is that we believe we're in a strong position to balance share with profitability to continue to deliver strong returns. So thanks for the question."

I mentioned that there were several factors that is kind of taken into consideration how the categories are behaving. And I think that there are 3 things in particular that we are looking at, that there are certain things around the fact that there are hybrid working schedules. 
We see in the home purchases and the renovations and the new consumer preference that are actually likely to keep people at home, the higher level of home consumptions that we have seen in the past. We've also now seen the Delta variant and the rising case counts across the U.S., and those are factors that we're also closely monitoring and, in particular, because they are important in terms of thinking about how families are preparing for the upcoming school year. 
So I think that all things that are -- that make it very difficult for us to say at this point is exactly how this is all going to shape out. What I can tell you is that we are focused on those things we can control. So we are focused on making sure we improve agility and execution, as Miguel said, that we continue to invest behind our brands to build relevance and compete for those occasions through our consumer platform-based approach, regardless of how we see this happening and unfolding. 
And so far, we are pleased with how we are showing up. So we believe we can continue to see  the fact that we are able to drive the household penetration repeat rates. And I as mentioned earlier in the call, right now, you see all channels growing. But realistically, that is not right now our expectations as we go through the second half."

I'd just like to add or summarize and tell you that we are very optimistic about how we are progressing in our transformation at Kraft Heinz. We've been taking advantage of the scale that we have, and we've been building the agility that we need to build a better business for the future.  
We posted sustainable top line and bottom line gains versus '19, and we are encouraged because the strongest growth comes from priority platforms and markets, what we call the growth platforms, Taste Elevation and in emerging markets. And we continue seeing retail very strong, and we are coming back with foodservice. It's recovering and recovering fast.  
Transforming Kraft Heinz is what we all have in mind, and we want to do that, maintaining the industry-leading profitability. We are investing more in our brands and better as well, building a much more creative company.  
We are also on track to deliver the $400 million of gross efficiencies in 2021 and effectively managing inflation. At the same time, we continue strengthening our portfolio and improving financial flexibility. We are adding capacity to our products to drive growth and energize platforms and in the emerging markets.  
We, as you know, closed the Nuts divesture, and we expect to close the cheese divesture in the second half of this year.  
Recently, we acquired Assan Foods in Turkey. It's a very small operation, but it's a very important step into our strategy because it accelerates the elevation and is in the emerging markets. And we continue to pay down debt and improve our net leverage.  
We continue to expect to have a very good 2021, actually, to deliver a stronger 2021 than we projected when we provided our initial outlook in February. And that speaks to the strength and potential of our ongoing business.

First, I think I will say is in the U.S., what we have said in the past is that we are proactively managing against the incremental inflation we see. And actually, we feel good about our ability to implement those actions when and where we see the need. 
So if you look at the inflation we saw in Q2, it's mainly coming from ingredients, things like soybeans, edible oils, packaging and some transportation as well. And it's very similar to what we saw in the first quarter. And most recently, we also saw some increases too but driven by resin cost and some higher transportation rates. 
Now from a pricing perspective, as I mentioned on the call, we are restoring key promotional activations to drive the business versus the pandemic-induced pullbacks that we had in 2020. Now as we have mentioned earlier in the year, our goal continues to be to connect with consumers that now have discovered or rediscovered our brands and drive the repeat rate among those households. 
So in that context, and versus inflation, again, we feel good about our ability to achieve the net pricing we need to offset inflation and maintain strong household and repeat rate given that we are renovating our portfolio to drive better value for consumers, improving the creative content of our marketing and strengthening and diversifying our media impressions. 
What I will also add is that we're doing this primarily through 4 key revenue management initiatives. First, we're optimizing the frequency and depths of our promotion, while we restore retail activation levels that I discussed in the call. 
Second, we are doing broad-based pricing actions, which we have announced across our portfolio. 
Third, we're continuing to manage key commodity pricing. 
And lastly, we're using other revenue management levers, including price pack architecture and managing our category price ladders. 
So if you look at our revenue management initiatives, they are guiding our smart trade investments so we can optimize returns on those investments and manage through the current inflationary environment. 
Now in the near term, the timing of cost inflation versus price realization may lead to some degree of margin pressure, but this is reflected in an outlook. And we see net pricing and cost coming into balance as we exit the year. 
And with that, let me pass it over to Paulo. Any other comments, if you want to add, Paulo."

I think if you want to like frame inflation and pricing from a total company perspective, to break it down first on inflation, you're going to recall that in April, we said that we're expecting inflation in the mid-single-digit range as a percent of COGS but at the lower end of that range. 
Since April, our costs have continued to move higher. Now we are expecting inflation still in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, but now it's slightly above the midpoint of the mid-single-digit range. 
Regarding pricing, as we are mentioning, and Carlos has just said, we are using multiple revenue management levers, including lease price actions to manage the inflation. But I think it's important for us to keep in mind that we're going to be facing an unusually difficult pricing comparison in the second half last year. 
Just to remind, just for context, last year, second half, our price was more than 4% higher than the prior year, whilst we pulled back on promotion to better protect customer service. 
In terms of the timing and the pricing realization, why we expect the timing of the cost inflation versus price realization to soften our margin percentage, to lower than the run rate levels in the short term, I think it's important to note that all of those impacts are already considered in the outlook that we have for the year, okay? 
And again, as we mentioned at the beginning, we are still expecting -- or now expecting a even stronger EBITDA dollars than we anticipated before."

I think as the year progresses, as Miguel mentioned, one day later in the year, we will be providing more clarity about how we're seeing the 2022. 
We are not discussing this today, but we can say that we see inflation as a consistent theme for us and for the industry ahead of '22. And all those initiatives and actions that we are doing in terms of revenue management initiatives to manage the inflation, we are seeing, based on expectation, that the inflation will continue into the next year. 
I think those initiatives, together with our savings program of a $2 billion savings program of -- and that will be sufficient together with the investments that we are making to improve the relevance of our brands. 
So again, we are very confident around our ability to manage the inflation and support the investments behind our turnaround as we are exiting '21 and entering '22."

In the quarter or even year-to-date, that, currently, we're seeing basically all channels are up, right? I think it was -- I think that's been sort of one of the surprises as we move through '21 is that as away from home and foodservice channels have improved, the at-home consumption has also stayed relatively elevated. 
So I guess my question for both of you is just simply how long do you expect this to continue? And I guess, as things normalize, would you expect the foodservice piece of it to really begin to accelerate more and somewhat offset the at-home consumption? So just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about those 2 channels, especially since, right now, they're both up."

I think it's very fair. Let me start, and then I'll have Rafa kind of give a perspective on international. I think from -- in the U.S. from an industry perspective, you're right. Channel trends are still no",655,"Listen, first of all, thanks for the question. I think it's very fair. Let me start, and then I'll have Rafa kind of give a perspective on international. 
I think from -- in the U.S. from an industry perspective, you're right. Channel trends are still normalizing. But I have to also say, it's too early to tell how the share of stomach between away from home and at-home, ultimately, is going to kind of all net out. 
Now recently, it does seem like all channels are growing, but that's probably not likely to remain the case, and that's not buildings necessarily into our expectations. Now in terms of our business, what we see is we're optimistic about our plans that we can actually drive sustainable growth in both the retail and the foodservice. 
And I think it's fair to say that we also have a big ambition from away-from-home business. We believe foodservice is actually both a generation of insights and innovation that can actually help in the retail side of the business. And it's also capable of driving outsized growth because we have actually put a renewed focus on culinary distribution and channel expansion. 
And some of those channel trends, while still normalizing, it's still a little bit early to say, predicting exactly where it's all going to happen. Now what I do say is that I do believe we're going to be stronger versus what we saw pre-pandemic and essentially for 2 key reasons. 
First, because our foodservice mix favor the QSR. And actually, that stands to recover, and we are seeing that already faster than the rest of the foodservice channel. And we also see that be more resilient post pandemic. 
And frankly, early in the pandemic, we also made a strategic bet to support that growth in QSR, and that bet is paying up. We now have 30% more capacity in our small packets of ketchup and sauces. So that actually has been seem to be working. 
And secondly, we see a more durable step-up in at-home consumption that comes at the expense of other categories and brands without necessarily sacrificing foodservice recovery and growth. 
And then lastly, let me just give you a little more color on the away-from-home. I mentioned that we gained a point of market share, foodservice recovery begins, and much of that actually was fueled by the actions we took in 3 areas that I mentioned: culinary, distribution and new channels. 
So in Q2, we actually executed 9 co-branded culinary limited time offers with QSR partners. Just one of those was actually so successful because when it became part of a permanent menu item, and that was going to be in '22, and if you think about that context of the fact that we've been able to drive those kind of limited time offers with QSR, in 2019, we had none of those. So we are certainly driving a different level of execution with QSR. 
Now the second part of that, which is distribution, we actually grew key accounts by 20% over the said quarter. 
And then finally, as consumers continue to evolve, how they cook and they eat and including the use of meal delivery kits, we're actually inserting our Kraft Heinz brands into that equation. So we are working with one popular direct-to-consumer company to develop things like a recipe specifically for our Philadelphia Cream Cheese as a main ingredient of their products. And that actual one product was ordered over 200,000 times, with -- by consumers, really an all-time record for that sales partner. 
So when you look at it holistically, again, I feel very optimistic about our Away-From-Home business, and that it actually is going to be a springboard for us to continue to drive retail growth. Now that's a perspective in the U.S. 
And Rafa, if you want to add something in terms of the international business, how you see it."

Bryan, look, on balance, our developed markets are experiencing very similar trends to retail and foodservice in U.S. and Canada.  
Emerging markets, on the other hand, foodservice has actually rebounded stronger than in developed markets, right? And most countries either had shorter or even stricter lockdowns, but kept their economies open during the pandemic overall. 
So I mean, the consumption obviously differs country by country in home and out-of-home. The path of the pandemic lockdown approach, vaccine availability changes a lot. And given the Delta variant now, it's a bit early to tell how the channels, where the channels will stabilize, right, in the second half. 
But all that said, I mean, we are seeing a lot of improvements on the retail channels, especially in Taste Elevation and giving us like a lot of confidence that we will come out of the pandemic well positioned right after the pandemic. 
On the foodservice side, our mix is even more weighted towards QSR than U.S. -- than the U.S. is. So the format -- and this format is recovering very quickly. So with distribution gains in emerging markets and the potential of the foodservice that we still have across our overall international, I'm still quite optimistic that after the pandemic ends, the net will be quite positive."

And let -- I will pass the second one to Carlos to talk more specifically about the categories in U.S. 
Let me say that, first, we are excited about the changes that we have been making in our marketing programs and capabilities. We've been investing not only in our brands but also in our people. This is an area that I'm very passionate about and -- given the importance that it has to drive our growth. 
We are driving improvements actually a couple of ways. The first one is more marketing dollars, right, that we put. We have $100 million more in marketing than we had in 2019. And we said that we want to increase marketing moving forward. So it's our intention. 
However, I think it's not only about increasing marketing. It's really about efficiencies. We are, today, achieving 30% more of our consumers a bit of the same spend by doing better marketing. And not only better marketing but also better media. 
And third, I think I'm very excited about stepping up on creativity in our company today. We started an internal agency in digital media in Canada and -- in May last year. And today, we have 12 of these internal hubs in different places covering more than 30 markets around the world. And that is critical for marketing efficiency because it's faster, better and much more creative. 
And we can really have marketing linked to the culture and we need to be very fast on that. So overall, that would be my question for -- answer for marketing.

Now going forward, we will continue this agenda. We're going to increase support around key holidays, while using price, promotional optimization and, as I mentioned earlier, all the revenue management tools to manage the inflation.

And I think that there are 3 things in particular that we are looking at, that there are certain things around the fact that there are hybrid working schedules. 
We see in the home purchases and the renovations and the new consumer preference that are actually likely to keep people at home, the higher level of home consumptions that we have seen in the past. We've also now seen the Delta variant and the rising case counts across the U.S., and those are factors that we're also closely monitoring and, in particular, because they are important in terms of thinking about how families are preparing for the upcoming school year. 
So I think that all things that are -- that make it very difficult for us to say at this point is exactly how this is all going to shape out.

278212,1676169508,2385249,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q2 2021 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Chris. With the first half of 2021 now behind us, not only we are gaining more visibility into our post-pandemic world, we are in a better position to assess our fundamental progress as a company since the pandemic took hold. So I would like to",1229,"Thank you, Chris. With the first half of 2021 now behind us, not only we are gaining more visibility into our post-pandemic world, we are in a better position to assess our fundamental progress as a company since the pandemic took hold. So I would like to start our review with some higher-level observations on where I believe we are as a company and how we are preparing ourselves for the future. 
First and foremost, I'm very happy and very proud that our Kraft Heinz team is displaying and building the power of scale with agility. The starts and pauses to the reopening of economies around the world and challenges such as inflation and supply chain disruptions that are coming with it are a difficult aspect of our current reality. 
Despite this, we believe our Q2 results serve as a good indication that we are, in fact, driving sustainable gains with our consumers and in our P&L versus pre-pandemic levels. We are driving our transformation agenda forward, fueled by investments in our people, brands and capabilities, all while driving efficiencies and maintaining industry-leading profitability. And we continue to strengthen our portfolio, improve our financial flexibility and position ourselves to take accretive actions to accelerate our transformation. 
From a financial perspective, we have talked about 2019 being an important measuring stick for our progress. Progress against our strategy and transformation, but also from a pre- versus post-pandemic world. In that context, we see resilient growth on both our top and bottom lines. 
In the second quarter, we've maintained the lion's share of extraordinary gains we had in 2020. As a result, organic net sales grew 5% versus the same period in 2019. Our bottom line also remained strong with constant currency adjusted EBITDA, up 5.5% versus Q2 2019, despite a number of headwinds. And based on our performance to date, we expect to deliver a stronger 2021 than we projected when we provided our initial outlook in February. 
Even more encouraging, our growth is coming from areas where we have made investments, consistent with the new strategy we launched last year. We are realizing a strong mix improvement in our higher-margin Grow platforms, especially in our global Taste Elevation platform. We are capturing new business in emerging markets where we have significant white space opportunities. Our progress in these markets is accelerating and their contributions to the total company continues to grow. 
By channel, I would also note that our retail business has remained well above pre-pandemic levels. And our Foodservice business is showing a relatively quick rebound as we outperformed the broader channel in the United States and many other markets where we operate. 
And while our strategic investments are beginning to drive our results, it's still early in our transformation, which makes us optimistic about how our priorities and initiatives can fuel our momentum going forward. 
In the past, we have talked about our need and my passion for modernizing our connections with the consumers through stronger and more creative marketing. This is happening, and we have more on the way. Through the first half of the year, we have strongly increased our marketing spend versus the first half of 2019, and we remain on track with our planned increases for the rest of the year. Within this spend, we will put more dollars behind working media, digital channels and a high-performing priority brands and platforms. 
We are also starting to see the culture of creativity we want to build showing through with more consumer-led, more cultural relevant campaigns, and this includes external industry recognition with our teams winning 6 Cannes Lion awards this year while being shortlisted for 17 other awards. 
And our most recent initiatives are showing great agility to tap in today's culture and conversation. From the Kraft Mac & Cheese-flavored ice cream you may have seen to our Olympics partnership in Canada, our teams around the world are showing their consumer obsession and delivering breakthrough creativity to modernize our iconic brands. 
On the other side of the ledger, we continue to be well positioned to fund our strategic investments through efficiency gains. We will talk more in the coming months about the new ways we are building agility to unlock both further efficiencies and incremental growth. We have strong end-to-end visibilities to supply chain opportunities. We remain on track to deliver the $400 million of gross efficiencies we have planned for this year and capture our 5-year target of $2 billion in savings that we have talked before. 
And to address the 3 topics we are most often asked about these days: inflation, inflation and inflation. We do not see recent inflationary pressures getting in the way of our strategic progress. Similar to industry peers, our cost pressures are somewhat greater than they were 3 months ago. For us, the latest uptick has mainly been driven by additional costs in resins. That said, we continue to see our 2021 gross cost inflation remaining in the mid-single digit range across our full cost basket. 
We have already offset the cost inflation we've seen to date, and we continue to believe the level of inflation we are seeing is manageable going forward. Why is that? First, we have been actively managing our promotional depth and frequency versus our initial plans since we began to see inflation tick up earlier this year. 
Second, we are protecting our dollar profitability from incremental inflation through additional revenue management initiatives, especially in the United States, as Carlos will discuss. 
And third, in all markets we serve around the world, we will continue to monitor things and take further action if necessary. 
Taking in what I have highlighted so far from a P&L perspective, our results show our transformation is progressing. Our brand-building investments and efficiency plans will sustain our momentum. And we remain confident in our ability to maintain industry-leading profitability as we move forward. 
The final observation I would like to make relates to capital side of the equation. From an organic perspective, despite the delays and disruptions related to the pandemic, we are aggressively deploying capital to fuel our future growth. We are leveraging our strong cash generation and improved financial flexibility to expand capacity behind our growth platforms and in priority emerging markets. We are targeting a 30% step-up in CapEx this year versus 2019, driven by growth-oriented CapEx as well as investments to drive further efficiency gains as we move forward. 
We also continue to move strongly forward on an inorganic basis. Paulo will provide more details on the nut and natural cheese divestures, how they will strengthen our portfolio and improve our financial flexibility. But I would like to highlight the other way agile portfolio management can accelerate our transformation by adding great businesses that can be quickly accretive. 
In June, we announced the acquisition of Assan Foods in Turkey, a business focused on Taste Elevation in emerging markets. While this is a relatively small acquisition, it serves as a stepping stone to accelerate our retail and foodservice growth across Europe, Middle East and Africa. The point here is that we remain excited about the potential to take agile portfolio management actions, not just improve our financial flexibility, but to accelerate our long-term growth potential. 
With that, I will now ask Carlos and Rafa to provide the highlights of our U.S. and international segment performance."

We are making great pr",993,"Thank you, Miguel. Through the first half of the year, our team has delivered strong gains versus 2019, and we're off to a relatively strong start against the extraordinary 2020, despite the ups and downs of the pandemic recovery. 
We are making great progress unlocking areas of profitable growth, getting closer to our consumers, strengthening our brands, reigniting relevancy and winning in the marketplace through sharper, more proactive execution. 
That relentless focus is what gives us confidence that we can continue transforming our business while managing the headwinds that arise. But better that we show what we have at work than just talk about it. 
Earlier this year, I highlighted our plans to restore our retail activity levels versus 2020 behind key holiday windows and consumer occasions. As we do this, we are focusing our efforts and our dollars on need states where we can leverage our scale and insights for differentiated consumer solutions and realize the power of our platform approach. 
A great example of this is our Art of the Burger program, where we are partnering with customers to create more valuable joint execution for grilling season. We brought together everything a consumer needs to make a mouthwatering, artisanal burger. Customized out-of-aisle sets brought Heinz sauces, burger buns and patties, cheese, and even fresh produce into one easy-to-shop destination. And online, we added Ore-Ida potatoes and other grilling favorites to help drive even greater lift for our partners and sold more than 5 million incremental bottles of Heinz ketchup. The Art of the Burger program illustrates how we are thinking less about our categories and more about our platforms that address how consumers eat. 
We're also working across platforms to create an omni-channel breakfast experience that combines the power of 6 brands from Oscar Mayer bacon to Kraft Singles to give consumers everything they need for a delicious, fast, fresh, at-home breakfast that rivals any drive-through. We activated this with 30 retailers and across e-commerce. And in 1 month, the program generated $8 million of incremental net sales and several learning for future programs. 
In the months ahead, our calendar will become even more active with additional platform-based, omni-channel programs. I should also note that as we restore our activity in the back half of the year, it will limit the contribution from pricing we report versus 2020. 
At the same time, we are confident in our ability to manage through and mitigate the incremental inflation we experienced, just like we stated in the past. In the first half of this year, we delivered positive pricing on top of meaningful 2020 gains by optimizing frequency and depth of promotion while we simultaneously restore the key retail activations I just mentioned. 
We recently announced to our trade partners, a combination of list price increases and promotional adjustments across a broad base of our portfolio. We have been and we'll continue to execute inflation-justified key commodity pricing. And we're activating many other revenue management levers, such as price pack architecture when and where appropriate. 
In addition to this, we continue to ramp up our equity-driven investment agenda across all 3 phases. First, the renovation of many of our iconic brands through product, packaging and brand repositioning is well underway. A great example is Lunchables' new campaign, which leverages the inherent buildability of the brand and speak directly to the empowerment today's kids and parents are seeking. The repositioning work is the first step in a multiyear brand renovation and is expected to help continue Lunchables' current momentum, which today is seeing double-digit net sales growth for the first time in 5 years. 
Second is how we are innovating to better meet consumer needs and behaviors. Primal Kitchen is a stand-out example where consumption has tripled in the last year, thanks to several better-for-you product launches like cashew butter Buffalo Sauce. These efforts are being noticed as we earn a coveted Whole Foods' Supplier Award as global winner for outstanding innovation. 
Third is the increased quantity and quality of marketing we're deploying. Total Q2 marketing was up double digits versus 2019, and we are ramping up our digital efforts, which is now roughly 70% of the total spend. 
In trust, we are still at the early stages of our journey to fully leverage occasion-based insights and create new culturally relevant ways to drive stronger engagement with consumer. But our momentum is moving in a positive direction, as you can see on Slide 17. 
We are seeing signs of several pandemic-inspired cooking and eating behaviors are sticking, even as mobility increases and restrictions lift. Today, many of our brands continue to grow household penetration as consumers gravitate towards pantry staples and ingredients, and make more home meals, while ongoing interest in convenient options like Kraft Mac & Cheese continue to attract new buyers and drive repeat rates. 
Compared to 2019, nearly 2 million more households bought Kraft Heinz brand in the second quarter, boosting an already high household penetration rate, while repeat rates were up 8 percentage points. Additionally, spending per buyer and per trip, both increased by roughly 10% and 3%, respectively. And this is resulting in better performance against the competition with 58% of our U.S. retail business gaining share in Q2 versus 41% in Q1. 
Now not on this slide is the fact that we're also gaining share outside measured channel as our foodservice sales growth in Q2 outpaced the industry, thanks to our renewed focus on insights, culinary trends and distribution. 
So through the first half of the year, our U.S. team is doing 3 things: first, delivering strong performance versus 2019 on the top and bottom lines; second, driving the key strategic initiatives that we believe will transform our business; and third, effectively managing through the challenges the current environment brings. Altogether, I am confident that we will continue to build on our scale advantage going forward. 
With that, I hand it over to Rafa to discuss our international segment."
278212,1676169508,2385249,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q2 2021 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Carlos.

In short, our international team continues to perform well and advance our growth strategy. We are driving top line growth on top of extraordinary 2020. And our very strong constant currency adjusted EBITDA performance compared to the '19 period is giving us great head start in front of a second half that we'll see our investment levels ramping up. 
On Slide 19, you can see our results continue to prove out our strategy through our intense focus on being the undisputed global leader in Taste Elevation and aggressively pursuing emerging markets white space. 
Net sales in our international Taste Elevation platform were up 16% in Q2 versus '19, driven by distribution expansion, stepped-up marketing investments and a promising start to our 2021 innovations. We gained 2 share points on top of a very strong share gains in the previous 3 quarters, with 88% of countries in our international segment, holding or gaining share in Taste Elevation. 
Our emerging markets also continued strong growth. Q2 organic net sales were up 16% above the same period in 2019, driven primarily by distribution gains in both retail and foodservice, as we are stepping up investments to capture white space. 
We have talked before about the go-to-market capabilities we developed in Brazil to drive distribution gains across both retail and foodservice channels. Now we are investing aggressively to systematically capture the opportunity in Russia through a combination of: optimizing our merchandising network, working directly with chefs and tastemakers for front-of-the-house menu replacements, and introducing new innovations and capacity additions to support our future growth. 
These efforts have helped increase retail distribution by 25% and foodservice distribution by almost 50%. And this has led to strong performance in our business, growing net sales nearly 20% and increasing share 2.6 points versus 2019. We're excited and encouraged by our early wins. But we know as we ramp up investments, we can capture more of the enormous growth opportunities we have in our international business. 
With that, let me pass it off to Paulo to talk more about our global financial performance and our outlook."
278212,1676169508,2385249,"The Kraft Heinz Company, Q2 2021 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Kraft Heinz Company","Executives","Thank you, Rafa.

I will start by saying that our performance to date reinforces our confidence that our gains relative to pre-pandemic levels are, in fact, durable, and despite recent inflationary pressures, our profitability can remain at industry-leading levels. 
Slide 22 provides a more detailed look at our U.S. financial performance, where it is evident that we are retaining sustainable gains versus 2019. Q2 organic net sales versus 2019 were up 5.4% and constant currency adjusted EBITDA increased 9.3% versus Q2 2019. 
As expected, volume/mix versus 2020 was negatively impacted by difficult comparisons in the McCafé exit. That said, our foodservice business recovery is well underway and retail consumption remained solidly ahead of 2019 levels. Price in Q2 was positive for the eighth consecutive quarter, driven by several factors, including favorable timing, inflation-justified pricing and increased in in-store activity versus a light, pandemic-induced merchandising calendar in the prior year period. 
And while pricing and cost efficiencies were enough to offset non-key commodity inflation, lower shipments, unfavorable mix and higher year-on-year bacon costs led to a decline in constant currency adjusted EBITDA versus an extraordinary 2020. 
In Canada, Q2 top line performance came in largely as expected, with many of the same year-on-year drivers as United States. On the top line, we saw higher pricing across foodservice and retail to help offset inflation, lower retail demand versus panic buying in the prior year period, as well as a partial rebound in foodservice demand. 
And despite leading on price, through the second quarter, our Canada business held or gained share in the majority of its categories versus 2019 levels. At the bottom line, lower constant currency adjusted EBITDA was due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix as positive pricing and gross cost efficiencies more than offset inflationary headwinds in the quarter. 
Turning to our international segment on Slide 24. Organic net sales built on extraordinary 2020 growth due to pricing gains and strong emerging market growth. And relative to 2019, consumer demand remains elevated and especially strong in emerging markets. In terms of profitability, while constant currency adjusted EBITDA remains strongly ahead of 2019 levels, we saw a decline of 3.4% versus lofty 2020 levels. Here, pricing in favorable overheads were sufficient to offset inflation, but lower volume and unfavorable mix drove the decline. 
As for the total company in Q2, organic net sales and constant currency adjusted EBITDA were consistent with the outlook we provided in April and reflect the drivers we've discussed. And as Miguel, Carlos and Rafa highlighted, our results are keeping us optimistic about our ability to hold onto gains versus pre-pandemic levels, driven by a combination of: retail consumption remaining stronger, longer; a long runway for our emerging markets business to grow; and the broader benefits of our strategy taking hold. 
Wrapping up our financials on Slide 26. Our earnings and cash flow performance continues to be strong. Q2 adjusted EPS has remained relatively stable versus a very strong Q2 2020, reflecting favorable interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate. More specifically, items below adjusted EBITDA have been favorable by roughly $0.06 year-to-date. For the full year, we now expect these factors to be approximately $0.12 favorable. This reflects our successful debt paydowns and our updated view for the full year adjusted effective tax rate between 19% and 21%. 
Finally, our year-to-date free cash flow generation remains strong, up versus 2019 levels and only somewhat below extraordinary 2020. As for our outlook and path ahead -- with the closure of the nuts divestiture, we expect to begin to see the impact of sharpening our focus and improving our mix through agile portfolio management show up in our numbers. 
We expect that the annualized net sales impact from nuts to be approximately $1.1 billion, and an all-in adjusted EBITDA impact, including stranded overhead costs of approximately $240 million. We expect 51% of this will fall in 2021 and 49% in the first half of 2022. And annualized adjusted EPS dilution is expected to be roughly $0.06. 
Regarding our natural cheese divestiture, we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2021, and the impacts we expect from that divestiture remain consistent with what we have previously outlined. 
Taken together, these divestitures serve to accelerate our strategy of sustainable and profitable growth by enhancing our growth and margin profile of the resulting portfolio, reducing our exposure to commodity volatility, further distancing our brands from private label competition and importantly, improving our financial flexibility and firepower, including the ability to invest aggressively with confidence in our highest returning growth businesses. 
As we have said many times before, our intent has always been to reduce our leverage without sacrificing the speed of our turnaround or potential long-term value creation. As reported in Q2, we reduced our net leverage to a post-merger low of 3.1x, well below our 4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA target. I would note, however, that cycling past the extraordinary adjusted EBITDA benefits in 2020 as well as the upcoming impact of the divestitures will create some upward pressure on leverage. 
That said, we will continue to retire debt opportunistically, depending on market conditions and expect to manage our leverage consistent with an investment grade profile going forward, which gives us significant financial and strategic flexibility. 
Turning to our expectations for the P&L for Q3. We expect another strong quarter on the top and bottom lines, considering the various headwinds we are up against. Specifically, we expect to see another quarter of mid-single-digit organic net sales growth versus 2019, driven by continued, elevated retail consumption, strong emerging markets growth, and ongoing improvement in foodservice. And this includes more than 1 point unfavorable impact from McCafé Exit. 
At constant currency adjusted EBITDA, we expect a low single-digit percent decline versus 2019. Although this includes more than 8 points of combined headwinds from the net divestiture McCafé exit as well as more normalized incentive compensation. 
Versus 2020, the outlook includes roughly 3 point unfavorable impact from the nuts divestiture and reflects a combination of: mix headwinds as consumption between at-home and away-from-home channels finds a new equilibrium; greater inflationary pressure against more difficult pricing comparisons, considering the restoration of retail activation that Carlos highlighted; and stepped up spending levels to support our transformation. 
For the full year 2021, while we continue to expect results to be ahead of our original strategic plan, we now expect that adjusted EBITDA we report for 2021 to be ahead of the $6.1 billion we reported in 2019. And we expect this despite the negative impact from the nuts and Canada cheese divestitures, business exits and normalization of incentive compensation that have happened between then and now. That's better than we expected at the start of the year, and it reflects the fact that our underlying ongoing business is bigger, stronger and more profitable than it was in 2019. 
Let me now hand it back to Miguel for some closing comments."

We've been taking a look at some Nielsen trends in some key food categories in the U.S. and Western Europe.

So I'm curious if KHC has seen this dynamic play out at all for the company? And if you see maybe certain trends in Europe as a fair leading indicator of what's to come in the U.S. around stickiness of demand, or if maybe there are some differences suggesting that's not a great set of data points to necessarily use to compare."

I mean from an overall market perspective in Western Europe, we have seen indeed more of a return to pre-pandemic consumption patterns than in other developed markets. 
That said, I mean it varies quite a bit per category, and we are seeing much greater stickiness in our taste elevation platforms as the consumers kind of continue to look to us to elevate their use, right? And this is quite positive, to be honest, to us, because if you recall, I mean, we have 3 key pillars on our international growth strategy: our taste elevation platform; emerging markets; and foodservice channel, right? 
So this demand stickiness in Taste Elevation, we continue to see favorable levels of consumption, growth and absolute terms on the platform and which is a platform we are focusing at, right? So we continue to see Taste Elevation demand sustaining. And in foodservice, in particular, Western Europe is rebounding very fast. I mean it's approaching 2019 levels. 
So -- and on top of this, we have been gaining our share in almost every market we operate in foodservice, right? So it's another strength.

And then looking at Slide 8,  is it fair to look at that as sort of a price index? So to say you came into the year with an index around 103 and you plan to exit a bit north of 106, you'll be carrying around 3 points of price into next year? Or is that 106 a bit of an average and the real exit rates closer to 107 or 108?"

I think there were 3 counts, but they were related to the U.S., so I'll take it. 
I guess for me, I would say, yes, first of all, the way I think about the business is we want to make sure we continue to drive household penetration and repeat rates, which we are doing. And -- well, there were some short-term share pressures in during the back-to-school is really the demand, really outgrew our capacity in a few categories. 
Over the long term, the fact that we are driving household penetration and repeat rates shows the strength of our portfolio and interest of our business and how we are actually managed through all that. But I would say yes to that I'm very much focused on making sure that we win by maximizing the controllables. And our recipe for winning is to essentially consistently focus on satisfying the consumer needs better than anyone else, and it doesn't matter exactly what's happening at this particular moment. 
As we go forward, I'll tell you, I see 3 specific advantage that for us, it's going to be our play in which we're going to win. We have continued to renovate our portfolio. We have controlled the cost in our brands so that we can optimize the value with our -- for our consumers. And really, that is the best recipe for us to kind of withstand against anyone else coming, any competition that comes in. 
And essentially, what we're doing, we are increasing the equation of what it's worth buying for on the shelf. The second advantage we have also is we're making sure that we are differentiated at each rung of a price ladder, whether it's entry to mainstream to premium so that consumers can stay within our franchise even as their circumstances might change. And if you think about Mac & Cheese, we go everywhere from an Easy Mac to the original version for consumers. 
And then the third piece I would say is we are transforming our portfolio through all these divestitures that actually have significantly reduced our private label exposure. So we have continued to renovate and manage our cost. We have continued to bring making sure that we have differentiated products within our categories, no matter what the circumstances of the consumers are. And we have a portfolio that is much going to reduce versus private label. 
And currently, we continue to see opportunities to capture profitable growth, focusing on our consumer platforms. So we are executing with excellence and leveraging this broad renovation, innovation and the rest of creating that our teams are doing. 
I think, Pamela, you also spoke a part of your question and then the supply chain to the constraints that we're seeing. I think the way I would look at it is across the industry, we are seeing a supply chain that is being tested on a daily basis. But what I will say is our supply and chain team has been very agile, taking advantage of our global scale.  We're showing agility in labor, in manufacturing, in logistics. And I'll give you some examples of what I mean.  
We are reducing the amount of time to hire and significantly increase the applicant pool by leveraging new digital tools at Kraft Heinz. We are improving the flexibility in terms of the materials that are available with a, really, an ownership mindset across sales, procurement and manufacturing. And those things will change in our plans, 39 of them across the U.S., sometimes on a weekly basis. 
And then in logistics, we've actually increased the throughput on warehouses by shifting more of how we operate 24/7 and increasing the automation since the pre-pandemic time. So having said that, I will tell you that we do have a good line of sight of continuing to improve our customer service levels as we move forward. And because, frankly, restoring the top-tier customer service to the pre-pandemic level is a continued focus for us and entire team. And thanks for your question, Pamela."

And maybe if we could just step back pre -- all of this inflation and pre-COVID, right? There was a transformation in your supply chain, which that work has started. And as we kind of look at gross margins or profitability at the gross profit line, you've held up pretty well, right, relative to your peers, if anything, probably a little bit better. 
So I guess, as we're kind of thinking about profitability going forward, knowing that there's some pricing that's coming through to cover inflation. But how much are you also still benefiting incrementally from some of the supply chain work you've done? And how much of that is going to be also a contributor to helping to offset all of the inflation and supply chain disruptions?"

And in order to do that, we developed many programs in terms of efficiencies in supply chain, in terms of focusing on leads. 
Also pricing -- new pricing strategy and revenue management strategy, and this is taking place. You can see that today, with all the inflationary pressure that we're seeing in the gap that we have in between the pricing realization and the cost inflation, we are keeping the gross profit margin the same level that we have at pre-pandemic. And this gives us a lot of confidence in our plan going forward. So I would say that our strategy to improve profitability to gross profit margin is working."

What I would add, too, and you think about our overall progress in our transformation, it's both in terms of some of the things that you heard from Miguel earlier. We are, in fact, making a significant push on fast track and critical projects in our capacity. So I think Miguel gave you some examples, I'll give you a couple more. 
Which is if you think about catch-up, the fact that in Heinz, deep and squeeze kind of such a small package, we have nearly doubled our capacity in by the end of next year. If you think about Mac & Cheese, by the second half of next year, we've actually increased but 20% of our cups capacity. And even in frozen snacks, by -- also by second half of next year, we will have increased about 1/3 of our capacity in areas like Delimex. And so -- both across -- these are some of the examples of things that we saw earlier in the pandemic. We may fast track in our projects, and we continue to do that. More work to do ahead. 
The other way I look at it is in terms of our -- how do we make sure we get more of our utilization of our assets. And for me, things like improving our OEE, which we have now done '20 versus '21 -- I'm sorry, '20 versus '19, '21 versus '20, it is also the way that we're going to continue to make sure that as we go forward, we attack it in both ways, making sure that we are being smart about investing in our capacity, and we are getting more of our assets through improvements in our OEE.

So -- which essentially is why our plan is to invest behind our consumer platforms during those event windows where actually consumers are looking to us for solutions. 
So if we think about the gains that we have made so far, the fact that we have continued to drive brand household penetration and repeat rate, it is exactly because we have done that. We have been able to make sure that in moments during the year that consumers are looking for those specific solutions, that we can offer essentially the scale of what we -- of our products in a way that satisfies the needs better than anyone else. 
And we have been and expect to be, as we look into 2022, more active with better execution than 2020 during this critical windows, but clearly not as deep as we were in 2019.

I would just like to start by sharing how encouraging it is for us to see our company leaning into a scale and agility that we have been talking about for some time, addressing short-term challenges at the same time that we are building the long-term advantage. 
We are today a much stronger company, and we are better positioned to address inflation that we are seeing. We are taking actions now to protect profitability through 2022, and our actions are not just pricing. We are also implementing price-pack architecture, value engineering and leveraging our scale in procurement.  
At the same time, our team has continued transforming our business for long-term growth and advantage. Our momentum with the consumer is strong and our consumer-focused, platform-based approach is taking us to new occasions. We continue to invest to improve relevance of our brands. We are making greater, more creative market investments. And at the same time, we are building agility that will deliver the $2 billion of gross efficiencies and looking to unlock more. We are continuing to pay down debt and improve our net leverage and we continue to invest in our most important assets, our people.  
And as we mentioned in our remarks, we have done all of this while delivering better 2021 results than previously expected, which speaks to the strength of our business. 
Well, with that, let's take your questions."

We've been taking a look at some Nielsen trends in some key food categories in the U.S. and Western Europe. And while consumption obviously in the U.S. has certainly remained elevated, trends, at least in some categories in Europe, seem to be decelerating meaningfully, or I guess, normalizing is a better word for it, as those markets reopen at a faster pace than what we've seen here in the U.S.  
So I'm curious if KHC has seen this dynamic play out at all for the company. And if you see maybe certain trends in Europe as a fair leading indicator of what's to come in the U.S. around stickiness of demand, or if maybe there are some differences suggesting that's not a great set of data points to necessarily use to compare."

I mean from an overall market perspective in Western Europe, we have seen indeed more of a return to pre-pandemic consumption patterns than in other developed markets. That said, I mean it varies quite a bit per category, and we are seeing much greater stickiness in our Taste Elevation platforms as the consumers kind of continue to look to us to elevate their meals, right? And this is quite positive, to be honest, to us, because if you recall, I mean, we have 3 key pillars on our international growth strategy: our Taste Elevation platform; emerging markets; and foodservice channel, right?  
So this demand stickiness in Taste Elevation, I mean, we continue to see favorable levels of consumption, growth and absolute terms on the platform and which is a platform we are focusing at, right? So we continue to see Taste Elevation demand sustaining. And in foodservice, in particular, Western Europe is rebounding very fast. I mean it's approaching 2019 levels. So -- and on top of this, we have been gaining our share in almost every market we operate in foodservice, right? So it's another strength. 
So as I said, overall, it's true as most of the market is coming back to pre-pandemic. In some platforms, they continue to be very strong and that has played out favorably for us, Taste Elevation."

I think there were 3 accounted, but they were related to the U.S., so I'll take it.  
I guess for me, I would say, yes, first of all, the way I think about the business is we want to make sure we continue to drive household penetration and repeat rates, which we are doing. And -- well, there were some short-term share pressures in during the back-to-school as really the demand really outgrew our capacity in a few categories. 
Over the long term, the fact that we are driving household penetration and repeat rates shows the strength of our portfolio and interest of our business and how we are actually managed through all that. But I would say, yes, to that. I'm very much focused on making sure that we win by maximizing the controllables. And our recipe for winning is to essentially consistently focus on satisfying the consumer needs better than anyone else, and it doesn't matter exactly what's happening at this particular moment.  
As we go forward, I'll tell you, I see 3 specific advantage that for us, it's going to be our play in which we're going to win. We have continued to renovate our portfolio. We have controlled the cost in our brands so that we can optimize the value with our -- for our consumers. And really, that is the best recipe for us to kind of withstand against anyone else coming, any competition that comes in. And essentially, what we're doing, we are increasing the equation of what it's worth buying for at the shelf. 
The second advantage we have also is we're making sure that we are differentiated at each rung of a price ladder, whether it's entry to mainstream, to premium, so that consumers can stay within our franchise even as their circumstances might change. And if you think about Mac & Cheese, we've got everywhere from an Easy Mac to the original version for consumers.  
And then the third piece I would say is, we are transforming our portfolio through all these divestitures that actually have significantly reduced our private label exposure. So we have continued to renovate and manage our cost. We have continued to bring -- making sure that we have differentiated products within our categories, no matter what the circumstances of the consumers are. And we have a portfolio that is much reduced versus private label.  
And frankly, we continue to see opportunities to capture profitable growth, focusing on our consumer platforms. So we are executing with excellence and leveraging this broad renovation, innovation and the rest of creating that our teams are doing.
I think, Pamela, you also spoke -- a part of your question dealt about the supply chain constraints that we're seeing. I think the way I would look at it is across the industry, we are seeing a supply chain that is being tested on a daily basis. But what I will say is our supply chain team has been very agile, taking advantage of our global scale. We're showing agility in labor, in manufacturing, in logistics. And I'll give you some examples of what I mean.   
We are reducing the amount of time to hire and significantly increase the applicant pool by leveraging new digital tools at Kraft Heinz. We are improving the flexibility in terms of the materials that are available with really an ownership mindset across sales, procurement and manufacturing. And those things will change in our plans, 39 of them across the U.S., sometimes on a weekly basis. And then in logistics, we've actually increased the throughput on warehouses by shifting more of how we operate 24/7 and increasing the automation since the pre-pandemic time. 
So having said that, I will tell you that we do have a good line of sight of continuing to improve our customer service levels as we move forward. And because, frankly, restoring the top-tier customer service to the pre-pandemic level is a continued focus for us and entire team. And thanks for your question, Pamela."

And maybe if we could just step back pre -- all of this inflation and pre-COVID, right, there was a transformation in your supply chain, which -- that work has started. And as we kind of look at gross margins or profitability at the gross profit line, you've held up pretty well, right, relative to your peers, if anything, probably a little bit better.  
So I guess, as we're kind of thinking about profitability going forward, knowing that there's some pricing that's coming through to cover inflation. But how much are you also still benefiting incrementally from some of the supply chain work you've done? And how much of that is going to be also a contributor to helping to offset all of the inflation and supply chain disruptions?"

What you said is true, like when we come back to when the time that in 2019, when we disclosed our strategy, beginning of 2020, the -- we were very focused on improving our gross profit over time. And in order to do that, we developed many programs in terms of efficiencies in supply chain, in terms of focusing on leads. Also pricing -- new pricing strategy and revenue management strategy, and this is taking place. You can see that today, with all the inflationary pressure that we're seeing and the gap that we have in between the pricing realization and the cost inflation, we are keeping the gross profit margin the same level that we have at pre-pandemic. And this gives us a lot of confidence in our plan going forward. So I would say that our strategy to improve profitability to gross profit margin is working."

What I would add, too, and you think about our overall progress in our transformation, it's both in terms of some of the things that you heard from Miguel earlier. We are, in fact, making a significant push on fast track and critical projects in our capacity. 
So I think Miguel gave you some examples, I'll give you a couple more, which is if you think about ketchup, the fact that in Heinz, Dip & Squeeze kind of such a small package, we have nearly doubled our capacity by the end of next year. If you think about Mac & Cheese, by the second half of next year, we've actually increased about 20% of our cups capacity. And even in frozen snacks, by -- also by second half of next year, we will have increased about 1/3 of our capacity in areas like Delimex. And -- so both across -- these are some of the examples of things that we saw earlier in the pandemic, we may fast track in our projects, and we continue to do that. More work to do ahead.  
The other way I look at it is in terms of our -- how do we make sure we get more of our utilization of our assets. And for me, things like improving our OEE, which we have now done '20 versus '21 -- I'm sorry, '20 versus '19, '21 versus '20, it is also the way that we're going to continue to make sure that as we go forward, we attack it in both ways, making sure that we are being smart about investing in our capacity, and that we are getting more of our assets through improvements in our OEE.

So if we think about the gains that we have made so far, the fact that we have continued to drive brand household penetration and repeat rate, it is exactly because we have done that. We have been able to make sure that in moments during the year that consumers are looking for those specific solutions that we can offer, essentially the scale of what we -- of our products in a way that satisfies the needs better than anyone else. And we have been and expect to be, as we look into 2022, more active with better execution than 2020 during this critical windows, but clearly not as deep as we were in 2019. 
And frankly, we continue to see opportunities to capture that growth. So as we are going to move forward, we are going to remain diligent on making sure it satisfies our consumer needs better than everyone else, guided by our platform and our renewed focus on making sure that, again, everything we do as part of our transformation with that consumer-first approach. Thank you."

Maybe I can comment and then give the word to Rafael since he is responsible for emerging markets, among other things.  
We have, of course, today a portfolio that is better than we had 2 years ago, and a much stronger balance sheet. And with that comes more flexibility, right? And you are right, I think that if we have opportunities for acquisitions, we'll look at them, and always with price discipline.  
We like a lot to follow our strategy. And as a consequence, Taste Elevation, which is really one of the critical strategic pillars of the strategy of the international zone, is in the place where we are looking for opportunities. And that helps also Foodservice business. So like the Assan business in Turkey that we acquired is a leading company in foodservice, and we expect to grow to the retailers with that base in Turkey as well.  
And I'll give the microphone, the word to Rafael, so he can give you more color about areas that we are looking at."

I mean, each of those 2 businesses, I mentioned Assan and Hemmer, they are just short of $100 million each. But with Assan, I mean, we will not only be able build Heinz as a bigger brand in Turkey, but we'll have capacity to grow much faster across the Middle East. 
And with Hemmer, I mean, Hemmer, we have announced, but we are now waiting for regulatory approval, we will not only strengthen our distribution, especially in the south of Brazil, we'll be able to participate in much more the value ladders of the chain within Taste Elevation. And we can really leverage their portfolio to build our scale faster, I mean, in retail and the foodservice channel. So they are definitely like, again, as I said, on strategy, and that's what makes us the most exciting is Taste Elevation and within the core emerging markets that we want to grow at and we see a lot of opportunities."

I would just like to start by sharing how encouraging it is for us to see our company leaning into a scale and agility that we have been talking about for some time, addressing short-term challenges at the same time that we are building the long-term advantage. 
We are today a much stronger company, and we are better positioned to address inflation that we are seeing. We are taking actions now to protect profitability through 2022, and our actions are not just pricing. We are also implementing price-pack architecture, value engineering and leveraging our scale in procurement.  
At the same time, our team has continued transforming our business for long-term growth and advantage. Our momentum with the consumer is strong and our consumer-focused, platform-based approach is taking us to new occasions. We continue to invest to improve relevance of our brands. We are making greater, more creative market investments. And at the same time, we are building agility that will deliver the $2 billion of gross efficiencies and looking to unlock more. We are continuing to pay down debt and improve our net leverage and we continue to invest in our most important assets, our people.  
And as we mentioned in our remarks, we have done all of this while delivering better 2021 results than previously expected, which speaks to the strength of our business.

We've been taking a look at some Nielsen trends in some key food categories in the U.S. and Western Europe. And while consumption obviously in the U.S. has certainly remained elevated, trends, at least in some categories in Europe, seem to be decelerating meaningfully, or I guess, normalizing is a better word for it, as those markets reopen at a faster pace than what we've seen here in the U.S.  
So I'm curious if KHC has seen this dynamic play out at all for the company. And if you see maybe certain trends in Europe as a fair leading indicator of what's to come in the U.S. around stickiness of demand, or if maybe there are some differences suggesting that's not a great set of data points to necessarily use to compare."

I mean from an overall market perspective in Western Europe, we have seen indeed more of a return to pre-pandemic consumption patterns than in other developed markets. That said, I mean it varies quite a bit per category, and we are seeing much greater stickiness in our Taste Elevation platforms as the consumers kind of continue to look to us to elevate their meals, right? And this is quite positive, to be honest, to us, because if you recall, I mean, we have 3 key pillars on our international growth strategy: our Taste Elevation platform; emerging markets; and foodservice channel, right?  
So this demand stickiness in Taste Elevation, I mean, we continue to see favorable levels of consumption, growth and absolute terms on the platform and which is a platform we are focusing at, right? So we continue to see Taste Elevation demand sustaining. And in foodservice, in particular, Western Europe is rebounding very fast. I mean it's approaching 2019 levels. So -- and on top of this, we have been gaining our share in almost every market we operate in foodservice, right? So it's another strength. 
So as I said, overall, it's true as most of the market is coming back to pre-pandemic. In some platforms, they continue to be very strong and that has played out favorably for us, Taste Elevation."

I think there were 3 accounted, but they were related to the U.S., so I'll take it.  
I guess for me, I would say, yes, first of all, the way I think about the business is we want to make sure we continue to drive household penetration and repeat rates, which we are doing. And -- well, there were some short-term share pressures in during the back-to-school as really the demand really outgrew our capacity in a few categories. 
Over the long term, the fact that we are driving household penetration and repeat rates shows the strength of our portfolio and interest of our business and how we are actually managed through all that. But I would say, yes, to that. I'm very much focused on making sure that we win by maximizing the controllables. And our recipe for winning is to essentially consistently focus on satisfying the consumer needs better than anyone else, and it doesn't matter exactly what's happening at this particular moment.  
As we go forward, I'll tell you, I see 3 specific advantage that for us, it's going to be our play in which we're going to win. We have continued to renovate our portfolio. We have controlled the cost in our brands so that we can optimize the value with our -- for our consumers. And really, that is the best recipe for us to kind of withstand against anyone else coming, any competition that comes in. And essentially, what we're doing, we are increasing the equation of what it's worth buying for at the shelf. 
The second advantage we have also is we're making sure that we are differentiated at each rung of a price ladder, whether it's entry to mainstream, to premium, so that consumers can stay within our franchise even as their circumstances might change. And if you think about Mac & Cheese, we've got everywhere from an Easy Mac to the original version for consumers.  
And then the third piece I would say is, we are transforming our portfolio through all these divestitures that actually have significantly reduced our private label exposure. So we have continued to renovate and manage our cost. We have continued to bring -- making sure that we have differentiated products within our categories, no matter what the circumstances of the consumers are. And we have a portfolio that is much reduced versus private label.  
And frankly, we continue to see opportunities to capture profitable growth, focusing on our consumer platforms. So we are executing with excellence and leveraging this broad renovation, innovation and the rest of creating that our teams are doing.
I think, Pamela, you also spoke -- a part of your question dealt about the supply chain constraints that we're seeing. I think the way I would look at it is across the industry, we are seeing a supply chain that is being tested on a daily basis. But what I will say is our supply chain team has been very agile, taking advantage of our global scale. We're showing agility in labor, in manufacturing, in logistics. And I'll give you some examples of what I mean.   
We are reducing the amount of time to hire and significantly increase the applicant pool by leveraging new digital tools at Kraft Heinz. We are improving the flexibility in terms of the materials that are available with really an ownership mindset across sales, procurement and manufacturing. And those things will change in our plans, 39 of them across the U.S., sometimes on a weekly basis. And then in logistics, we've actually increased the throughput on warehouses by shifting more of how we operate 24/7 and increasing the automation since the pre-pandemic time. 
So having said that, I will tell you that we do have a good line of sight of continuing to improve our customer service levels as we move forward. And because, frankly, restoring the top-tier customer service to the pre-pandemic level is a continued focus for us and entire team. And thanks for your question, Pamela."

And maybe if we could just step back pre -- all of this inflation and pre-COVID, right, there was a transformation in your supply chain, which -- that work has started. And as we kind of look at gross margins or profitability at the gross profit line, you've held up pretty well, right, relative to your peers, if anything, probably a little bit better.  
So I guess, as we're kind of thinking about profitability going forward, knowing that there's some pricing that's coming through to cover inflation. But how much are you also still benefiting incrementally from some of the supply chain work you've done? And how much of that is going to be also a contributor to helping to offset all of the inflation and supply chain disruptions?"

And in order to do that, we developed many programs in terms of efficiencies in supply chain, in terms of focusing on leads. Also pricing -- new pricing strategy and revenue management strategy, and this is taking place. You can see that today, with all the inflationary pressure that we're seeing and the gap that we have in between the pricing realization and the cost inflation, we are keeping the gross profit margin the same level that we have at pre-pandemic. And this gives us a lot of confidence in our plan going forward. So I would say that our strategy to improve profitability to gross profit margin is working."

What I would add, too, and you think about our overall progress in our transformation, it's both in terms of some of the things that you heard from Miguel earlier. We are, in fact, making a significant push on fast track and critical projects in our capacity. 
So I think Miguel gave you some examples, I'll give you a couple more, which is if you think about ketchup, the fact that in Heinz, Dip & Squeeze kind of such a small package, we have nearly doubled our capacity by the end of next year. If you think about Mac & Cheese, by the second half of next year, we've actually increased about 20% of our cups capacity. And even in frozen snacks, by -- also by second half of next year, we will have increased about 1/3 of our capacity in areas like Delimex. And -- so both across -- these are some of the examples of things that we saw earlier in the pandemic, we may fast track in our projects, and we continue to do that. More work to do ahead.  
The other way I look at it is in terms of our -- how do we make sure we get more of our utilization of our assets. And for me, things like improving our OEE, which we have now done '20 versus '21 -- I'm sorry, '20 versus '19, '21 versus '20, it is also the way that we're going to continue to make sure that as we go forward, we attack it in both ways, making sure that we are being smart about investing in our capacity, and that we are getting more of our assets through improvements in our OEE.

First, let me just put in the context of the transformation that we've been having here in Kraft Heinz. I mean, if you think back, a critical aspect of our transformation is a consumer-first approach to all that we do, so -- which essentially is why our plan is to invest behind our consumer platforms during those event windows where actually consumers are looking to us for solutions.  
So if we think about the gains that we have made so far, the fact that we have continued to drive brand household penetration and repeat rate, it is exactly because we have done that. We have been able to make sure that in moments during the year that consumers are looking for those specific solutions that we can offer, essentially the scale of what we -- of our products in a way that satisfies the needs better than anyone else. And we have been and expect to be, as we look into 2022, more active with better execution than 2020 during this critical windows, but clearly not as deep as we were in 2019. 
And frankly, we continue to see opportunities to capture that growth.

Let me start by saying that I'm very proud of Kraft Heinz team for delivering another quarter of results that exceeded our expectations. Not only is our team generating strong results on both the top and bottom lines. They are doing it by navigating an increasingly challenging environment. By leaning into our scale, agility and new operating model, we are advancing our transformation in a way that provides us both near-term benefits as well as long-term advantages, including strategic actions that strengthen our portfolio and financial flexibility. 
As we can see on Slide 5. This is evident in the organic net sales growth continuing to be resilient on both a 2-year basis and versus the significant gains last year. In fact, organic net sales growth strengthened sequentially from Q2 to Q3. Price realization is beginning to come through faster, and our focus on variable costs efficiencies is paying off. We can see this in our gross margins, where in Q3, we remained in line with 2019 levels despite escalated cost inflation. And as Paulo will discuss, we now expect to deliver more adjusted EBITDA dollars for the full year than our previous guidance issued in September. 
When we shared Q2 results in August, the world had felt some optimism around the pandemic as succeeds continue to roll out. But supply chain disruptions, labor issues and raw material inflation had begun to take root. 
Today, all of these issues remain and they have evolved to be more challenging, not only for us, but for every company in our industry. 
Importantly, we are also evolving as a company. We are a much stronger company than we were 2 years ago. And through our transformation, we are well positioned for the road ahead. 
What gives us confidence in our ability to capture sustainable growth and profitability is not just what we are delivering, but how we are delivering and why we can be even better. From the outset of our transformation, you have heard me say how critical it was to build a culture of continuous improvement in every aspect of our operating model. 
Internally, we talked a lot about daring to be better every day, continuing to raise the bar in everything we do. and leveraging our scale through our operating model to quickly adapt as the environment produces new challenges. 
And we look at how we are performing we can see that we are not only acting to remedy short-term challenges. We are also creating long-term advantage. 
Let me provide you with some examples. First, our supply chain team has been truly remarkable. Since the outset of the pandemic, they have been leveraging our scale to minimize shortages, mitigate inflation and generally improve our agility through a change in mindset. 
Second, our procurement team has continued to maintain good raw material availability and contain inflation through partnerships with our suppliers. 
Third, we have continued to build process and capabilities across our value chain that will give us a competitive advantage going forward. For instance, stepping up to design to value for our brands to increase the flexibility of our formulas with alternative ingredients and sizes while improving the quality of our consumers' experience. 
These actions are enabling us to mitigate gross inflation into 2022 and deliver efficiencies for us to reinvest in our brands. 
As far as gross inflation, for the full year 2021, we continue to expect inflation at the high end of the mid-single-digit range across our full cost basket with inflation accelerating in the second half to the high single-digit rents. 
And for 2022, we expect elevated inflation to persist at least during the first half of the year, mainly driven by the carryover impact of 2021. 
Regarding gross efficiencies, we remain on track to deliver the $400 million we have planned for this year as part of our multiyear plan. And in the coming months, we will talk about new ways we are building agility to unlock additional efficiencies faster. 
At the same time, we remain confident in the many levers we can pull to respond to inflationary pressures and protect our ability to invest in growth. As you can see on Slide 8, as we did in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect to continue delivering positive pricing even though we are lapping strong mid-single-digit price increases in the second half of 2020. And based on the actions we are implementing through the end of the year, we expect to see strong pricing in the first half of and enough to offset the inflation we've seen, including the carryover impact from 2021. And if input costs keep going up from today's levels, we will take more actions as appropriate. 
Importantly, to support our pricing power, we continue to build relevance for our brands through our platform-based approach. Our focus on consumer needs, instead of simple category definitions, is strengthening our insights, our R&D and our creativity. This is guiding us on a path to renovate the product packaging and a brand proposition of approximately 70% of our brands by the end of 2022. 
To support this, we have kept executing the investments we have in our plan. And through the first 9 months of the year, we have increased our advertising or working media spend by 9% versus last year and increased our R&D spending to 17%. And we are already seeing this come to life in some of our biggest brands in our biggest markets. 
For example. In the United States, Oscar Meyer gained roughly 0.5 point of share in Q3 versus last year, and we have been seeing sequential share improvement since May driven by the renovation and relaunch of the brand that we talked about in February. And Ore-Ida has continued to grow share up more than 2 share points versus Q3 2020. 
With Ore-Ida, we have invested in production, marketing and insights, and we are now gaining distribution through growth-oriented category plans developed with our retail partners. 
In our Taste Elevation platform, we are gaining share across 80% of the countries in our international zone, including 90 basis points of share in Latin America in Q3, more than 1 point of share in Australia. And in the U.K., Q3 share was up more than 1 point aided by the Heinz vegan sauces that we launched earlier this year. 
We are also building on that momentum and leveraging the plant-based heritage of our global Heinz brand with innovation such Heinz Greens burgers, which will be announced in June; the new Heinz plant protein soups in Australia and New Zealand; and pure Grains, plant-based, easy mills in Canada. 
Overall, we have made good strides in the right direction, especially as it relates to near-term pricing power. 
At the same time, we are still at the beginning of our journey to fully leverage occasion-based insights and create new cultural relevant ways to engage our consumers. 
And from a longer-term perspective, we are moving in the right direction, getting closer to our consumers, strengthening our brands, reigniting relevancy and winning with the marketplace through sharper and more proactive execution. We can see this happening in our biggest market, the United States, on Slide #11. 
In the U.S., our growth in both household penetration and repeat rates versus 2019, remained strong in the third quarter. 
And within this performance, our priority growth platforms, we were even stronger, with Taste Elevation gaining 5 percentage points in household penetration and 12 percentage points in repeat. An Easy Meals Made Better, gaining 12 percentage points in household penetration and 20 percentage points in repeat. Not only is this fully remarkable for such well-known established brands, it also speaks to the inherent strength and potential they have when we apply the right focus. 
And as we make investments to add capacity, we believe we can capture even greater ongoing consumption and market share going forward. 
In fact, if we had this additional capacity in place now, our organic net sales growth and market share performance would have been stronger in the third quarter. Our overall market share softened in the third quarter and service levels were more challenging on a sequential basis. This happened mainly in back-to-school categories where demand is outstripping our current capacity to serve. 
Categories like powder beverages, which was up 7% versus Q3 2020. Kid meals combos, up 10% and kids single-serve beverages up 17% and each of this posting strong growth on top of growth in 2020. 
And while we are working to match the demand, we are likely to experience the same in the certain holiday-driven categories in the fourth quarter, even though household penetration and repeat rates should remain strong. 
The other tremendous opportunity we have on the growth front is our singular focus on driving our Taste Elevation platform in emerging markets. In the third quarter, emerging markets organic net sales remained 14% above 2019 as we continue to invest in to capture white space in both retail and foodservice. 
And heading into next year, our expectation will remain consistent for year double-digit organic net sales growth in emerging markets. 
Three factors give us confidence for that. One is the fact that where our go-to-market model is up and running, we are growing strongly with Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, up 28%. And in Latin America, up 35%. 
Two, we expect to begin turning around and capturing the long-term opportunity in China next year, having put in place a new team with extensive local experience in the market. 
And finally, we are beginning strengthening our footprint and growth potential even further through acquisitions and capacity additions. 
For emerging markets, in particular, our improved financial flexibility can help us accelerate our long-term growth potential. We are doing this in 2 ways. 
First, we are building critical capacity in priority markets like Russia and China to capture our full potential across channels. 
Second, in recent weeks, we closed the acquisition of Ascent Foods in Turkey and announced the acquisition of Hammer in Brazil, both business focused on Taste Elevation in emerging markets. 
While relatively small acquisitions, they serve as highly accretive stepping stones to accelerate profitable retail and foodservice growth across markets. And we will look for more. 
Taking all this together, we are seeing our efforts pay off where it counts, strong sales performance in the channels we serve. 
In the third quarter, on a global basis, across our retail channels, we maintained the vast majority of sale gains from exceptional growth we achieved in 2020, which translates to a roughly 10% bigger business versus 2019 levels. 
At the same time, our sales through food service channels were more than 20% greater than last year as the channel rebounds and our growth outpaces the industry, thanks to our renewed focus on insights, culinary trends and distribution. This profile reinforces our optimism about our potential going forward in the sense that it shows that several pandemic-inspired cooking and knitting behaviors are sticking, even as mobility increases and restrictions lift. And in the foodservice channel, we still see significant line space for us to play from converting larger players into new customers to new players like cost kitchens, to do flavors and innovations we can bring. 
The final area I would like to highlight in terms of how we are delivering is how our people are delivering with purpose. It's an area where, again, we are at the beginning of our journey. 
As you can see on Slide 13, and as you will find in the ESG report we recently released, we have made great progress in a short amount of time. And we have set our direction with strong goals for the future in each pillar, healthy living and community support, environmental stewardship and responsible sourcing. And knowing that the diversity in inclusion and belonging of our people are foundation of our company by 2025, we are targeting to have gender parity within management positions globally and demographic parity in the countries where we operate. 
So back to my initial observation in terms of how we are delivering. Our results show our transformation is helping us effectively manage through the challenges of the current environment. Our brand-building investments and efficiency plans can sustain our momentum. And we continue to drive the key strategic initiatives that we believe will transform our business. 
With that, let me pass it to Paulo to talk more about our financial performance and our outlook."

Last quarter, I started the review of our financials, stating that our performance to date reinforced our confidence that our gains relative to pre-pandemic levels were, in fact, durable and despite recent inflationary pressures, our pr",674,"Thank you, Miguel. Last quarter, I started the review of our financials, stating that our performance to date reinforced our confidence that our gains relative to pre-pandemic levels were, in fact, durable and despite recent inflationary pressures, our profitability would remain at industry-leading levels. 
The common theme across our businesses in the third quarter was resilience in both our top line and gross margins versus 2019 levels. 
From a total company perspective, our Q3 organic net sales and constant currency adjusted EBITDA exceeded our prior outlook. Our organic net sales growth is strengthened sequentially from Q2 to Q3 versus both 2020 and 2019. We achieved pricing gains on top of a strong prior year, led by the U.S. and international, with Canada holding strong prior year pricing levels. At constant currency adjusted EBITDA, as expected, the timing of cost versus price realization softened our margin percentage to lower than run rate levels. But we think this our gross margin was in line with 2019 levels despite cost inflation escalating ahead of pricing realization. This speaks to the progress we have made in the area of revenue management and variable cost efficiencies. It means that we are keeping to our path of improving our gross margin performance. 
Below adjusted EBITDA, as you can see on Slide 16, our adjusted EPS and free cash flow performance continues to be strong. Q3 adjusted EPS remained relatively stable versus a very strong Q3 2020 in spite of dilution from the impact of the net divestiture. It also reflects a lower effective tax rate versus the prior year driven by favorable discrete items in the quarter. 
Finally, our year-to-date free cash flow generation remains strong versus 2019 levels as we continue controlling working capital. And on a 2-year basis, combining 2020 and 2021, we continue to expect that our free cash flow conversion will exceed 100%. 
As for our path ahead, as reported, at the end of Q3, our net leverage stood at 3.3x and adjusted for the impact of the net divestiture, we would be sly higher. 
We also continue to expect the natural cheese divestiture to close before the end of this year. When it closes, we will remain focused on retiring our debt opportunistically depending on market conditions, managing our leverage consistent with an investment-grade profile and accelerating our growth agenda with a significant financial and strategic flexibility this brings, which brings me to our earnings outlook. 
As I said earlier, the resilience shown in our third quarter performance has served to reinforce our outlook. For the full year 2021, we now expect organic net sales to be flat relative to what we previously described as exceptional 2020 levels and adjusted EBITDA of more than $6.2 billion versus our previous expectation of at least $6.1 billion. 
This adjusted EBITDA reflects the impact of our sale of the nuts business in June, but does not include any impact from the natural cheese divestiture. 
I would also note here that for the full year, we expect interest expense, excluding the impact of debt extinguishment costs to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, roughly $125 million lower than 2020 levels as we continue to pay down debt and reduce leverage. And we now expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 19% versus between 19% and 21% previously. 
2022, we remain a very fluid environment. That said, we continue to believe that from a top line perspective, we will sustain stronger consumption versus pre-pandemic levels. As our growth strategy continues to take hold and as we retain consumers in trips that we gained during the pandemic in both developed and emerging markets. 
And on the bottom line, we expect to maintain industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margins. By the end of 2021, we will have priced for the current inflation, including the carryover into 2022. We keep implementing and building up our efficiency savings plan, and we continue to execute the investments we have in our strategic plan. 
Let me now hand it back to Miguel for some closing comments."

Let me start by saying that I'm very proud of Kraft Heinz team for delivering another quarter of results that exceeded our expectations. Not only is our team generating strong results on both the top and bottom lines. They are doing it by navigating an increasingly challenging environment. By leaning into our scale, agility and new operating model, we are advancing our transformation in a way that provides us both near-term benefits as well as long-term advantages, including strategic actions that strengthen our portfolio and financial flexibility. 
As we can see on Slide 5. This is evident in the organic net sales growth continuing to be resilient on both a 2-year basis and versus the significant gains last year. In fact, organic net sales growth strengthened sequentially from Q2 to Q3. Price realization is beginning to come through faster, and our focus on variable costs efficiencies is paying off. We can see this in our gross margins, where in Q3, we remained in line with 2019 levels despite escalated cost inflation. And as Paulo will discuss, we now expect to deliver more adjusted EBITDA dollars for the full year than our previous guidance issued in September. 
When we shared Q2 results in August, the world had felt some optimism around the pandemic as succeeds continue to roll out. But supply chain disruptions, labor issues and raw material inflation had begun to take root. 
Today, all of these issues remain and they have evolved to be more challenging, not only for us, but for every company in our industry.
Importantly, we are also evolving as a company. We are a much stronger company than we were 2 years ago. And through our transformation, we are well positioned for the road ahead.
What gives us confidence in our ability to capture sustainable growth and profitability is not just what we are delivering, but how we are delivering and why we can be even better. From the outset of our transformation, you have heard me say how critical it was to build a culture of continuous improvement in every aspect of our operating model.
Internally, we talked a lot about daring to be better every day, continuing to raise the bar in everything we do. and leveraging our scale through our operating model to quickly adapt as the environment produces new challenges.
And we look at how we are performing we can see that we are not only acting to remedy short-term challenges. We are also creating long-term advantage.
Let me provide you with some examples. First, our supply chain team has been truly remarkable. Since the outset of the pandemic, they have been leveraging our scale to minimize shortages, mitigate inflation and generally improve our agility through a change in mindset. 
Second, our procurement team has continued to maintain good raw material availability and contain inflation through partnerships with our suppliers.
Third, we have continued to build process and capabilities across our value chain that will give us a competitive advantage going forward. For instance, stepping up to design to value for our brands to increase the flexibility of our formulas with alternative ingredients and sizes while improving the quality of our consumers' experience. 
These actions are enabling us to mitigate gross inflation into 2022 and deliver efficiencies for us to reinvest in our brands.
As far as gross inflation, for the full year 2021, we continue to expect inflation at the high end of the mid-single-digit range across our full cost basket with inflation accelerating in the second half to the high single-digit rents.
And for 2022, we expect elevated inflation to persist at least during the first half of the year, mainly driven by the carry-over impact of 2021.
Regarding gross efficiencies, we remain on track to deliver the $400 million we have planned for this year as part of our multiyear plan. And in the coming months, we will talk about new ways we are building agility to unlock additional efficiencies faster.
At the same time, we remain confident in the many levers we can pull to respond to inflationary pressures and protect our ability to invest in growth. As you can see on Slide 8, as we did in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect to continue delivering positive pricing even though we are lapping strong mid-single-digit price increases in the second half of 2020. And based on the actions we are implementing through the end of the year, we expect to see strong pricing in the first half of and enough to offset the inflation we've seen, including the carry-over impact from 2021. And if input costs keep going up from today's levels, we will take more actions as appropriate. 
Importantly, to support our pricing power, we continue to build relevance for our brands through our platform-based approach. Our focus on consumer needs, instead of simple category definitions, is strengthening our insights, our R&D and our creativity. This is guiding us on a path to renovate the product packaging and a brand proposition of approximately 70% of our brands by the end of 2022.
To support this, we have kept executing the investments we have in our plan. And through the first 9 months of the year, we have increased our advertising or working media spend by 9% versus last year and increased our R&D spending to 17%. And we are already seeing this come to life in some of our biggest brands in our biggest markets.
For example. In the United States, Oscar Meyer gained roughly 0.5 point of share in Q3 versus last year, and we have been seeing sequential share improvement since May driven by the renovation and relaunch of the brand that we talked about in February. And Ore-Ida has continued to grow share up more than 2 share points versus Q3 2020.
With Ore-Ida, we have invested in production, marketing and insights, and we are now gaining distribution through growth-oriented category plans developed with our retail partners.
In our Taste Elevation platform, we are gaining share across 80% of the countries in our international zone, including 90 basis points of share in Latin America in Q3, more than 1 point of share in Australia. And in the U.K., Q3 share was up more than 1 point aided by the Heinz vegan sauces that we launched earlier this year.
We are also building on that momentum and leveraging the plant-based heritage of our global Heinz brand with innovation such Heinz Beanz Burgerz, which we launched in June; the new Heinz Plant Proteinz soups in Australia and New Zealand; and Purgrains, plant-based easy meals in Canada.
Overall, we have made good strides in the right direction, especially as it relates to near-term pricing power.
At the same time, we are still at the beginning of our journey to fully leverage occasion-based insights and create new culturally-relevant ways to engage our consumers.
And from a longer-term perspective, we are moving in the right direction, getting closer to our consumers, strengthening our brands, reigniting relevancy and winning with the marketplace through sharper and more proactive execution. We can see this happening in our biggest market, the United States, on Slide #11.
In the U.S., our growth in both household penetration and repeat rates versus 2019, remained strong in the third quarter. And within this performance, our priority growth platforms, we were even stronger, with Taste Elevation gaining 5 percentage points in household penetration and 12 percentage points in repeat. An Easy Meals Made Better, gaining 12 percentage points in household penetration and 20 percentage points in repeat. Not only is this fully remarkable for such well-known established brands, it also speaks to the inherent strength and potential they have when we apply the right focus.
And as we make investments to add capacity, we believe we can capture even greater ongoing consumption and market share going forward.
In fact, if we had this additional capacity in place now, our organic net sales growth and market share performance would have been stronger in the third quarter. Our overall market share softened in the third quarter and service levels were more challenging on a sequential basis. This happened mainly in back-to-school categories where demand is outstripping our current capacity to serve.
Categories like powder beverages, which was up 7% versus Q3 2020. Kid meals combos up 10% and kids single-serve beverages up 17% and each of this posting strong growth on top of growth in 2020.
And while we are working to match the demand, we are likely to experience the same in the certain holiday-driven categories in the fourth quarter, even though household penetration and repeat rates should remain strong.

In the third quarter, emerging markets organic net sales remained 14% above 2019 as we continue to invest in to capture white space in both retail and foodservice. And heading into next year, our expectation will remain consistent for year double-digit organic net sales growth in emerging markets.
Three factors give us confidence for that. One is the fact that where our go-to-market model is up and running, we are growing strongly with Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, up 28%. And in Latin America, up 35%. Two, we expect to begin turning around and capturing the long-term opportunity in China next year, having put in place a new team with extensive local experience in the market. And finally, we are beginning strengthening our footprint and growth potential even further through acquisitions and capacity additions.
For emerging markets, in particular, our improved financial flexibility can help us accelerate our long-term growth potential. We are doing this in 2 ways. First, we are building critical capacity in priority markets like Russia and China to capture our full potential across channels. Second, in recent weeks, we closed the acquisition of Assan Foods in Turkey and announced the acquisition of Hemmer in Brazil, both business focused on Taste Elevation in emerging markets.
While relatively small acquisitions, they serve as highly accretive stepping stones to accelerate profitable retail and foodservice growth across markets. And we will look for more. Taking all this together, we are seeing our efforts pay off where it counts, strong sales performance in the channels we serve. 
In the third quarter, on a global basis, across our retail channels, we maintained the vast majority of sale gains from exceptional growth we achieved in 2020, which translates to a roughly 10% bigger business versus 2019 levels. At the same time, our sales through food service channels were more than 20% greater than last year as the channel rebounds and our growth outpaces the industry, thanks to our renewed focus on insights, culinary trends and distribution.
This profile reinforces our optimism about our potential going forward in the sense that it shows that several pandemic-inspired cooking and eating behaviors are sticking, even as mobility increases and restrictions lift. And in the foodservice channel, we still see significant whitespace for us to play from converting larger players into new customers to new players like ghost kitchens, to new flavors and innovations we can bring.
The final area, I would like to highlight in terms of how we are delivering is how our people are delivering with purpose. It's an area where, again, we are at the beginning of our journey.
