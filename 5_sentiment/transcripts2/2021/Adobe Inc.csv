It is hard to believe that it has been over a year since the pandemic began, and the world changed forever. During this unprecedented time, we have gone from a world with digital to a digital-first world. Digital experiences have played a vital role in making every aspect of our lives possible, from keeping families and coworkers connected to enabling new ways of learning, to powering digital commerce and ensuring continuity of essential business operations. Overnight, we have transitioned to a global digital economy. 
Adobe's mission is to change the world through digital experiences. At Adobe, we're helping fuel the digital economy with our continuous innovation, a large and diverse set of global customers and partners and the unique expertise we have garnered from undergoing our own digital transformation. Our strategy of unleashing creativity, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses is mission-critical in driving our top and bottom line growth. 
Adobe had an outstanding first quarter with strong results across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We achieved $3.91 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 26% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.61, representing 33% year-over-year growth. And non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.14, representing 38% year-over-year growth. 
In our digital media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q1, achieving $2.86 billion in revenue, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Net new digital media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $435 million, and total digital media ARR exiting Q1 grew to $10.69 billion. 
This past year, we have seen the tremendous power creativity has to inspire, connect and entertain us. Whether it's a student uploading his video assignment, a social media influencer advocating for change or a small business owner designing her first website, everyone has a story to tell. Creative Cloud remains a market leader in core creative categories, including imaging, design, video, screen design and illustration. And we're expanding that leadership into emerging media types like 3D and AR. Creation and consumption across phones, tablets and desktops is exploding. We're building solutions for every surface and platform, enabling customers of every skill level to create whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. 
Our Behance community has grown to 25 million people, and programs like Adobe Live provide ongoing forums for creators to engage as a global community. In November, we turned Adobe MAX, our annual creativity conference, into a global digital event, culminating in 10 million live streams. Creative Cloud has truly become the world's creative engine, and our future opportunities are endless. 
Q1 Creative Cloud performance was strong with net new Creative Cloud ARR of $337 million and revenue of $2.38 billion. Q1 highlights include: strength in our student offering, enabling next-gen creators to tell their stories in the midst of an unprecedented remote learning environment; momentum in our Teams offering, demonstrating the increased demand for collaboration solutions globally; growth in our core creative categories, including imaging led by Photoshop and Lightroom; demand for Premier Pro, the leader in the exploding video category and the overwhelming favorite at the Sundance Film Festival for the third year in a row, with 68% of films using it; significant growth in our creative mobile applications, including Lightroom Mobile and Photoshop Express; an increase in demand for Creative Cloud services like Adobe Stock, which helped fill the void created when live photography and video shoots had to be postponed. And all of this results in record traffic to adobe.com, our world-class acquisition and growth engine and a hub for customer engagement across all surfaces. 
We continue to deliver groundbreaking product innovation, including Neural Filters and Super Resolution features in Photoshop that harness the power of AI and machine learning to simplify complex workflows and enhance images in seconds. Extending our applications to multiple surfaces with Illustrator on the iPad and Fresco on the iPhone, and building collaboration capabilities with Creative Cloud libraries. 
In support of our commitment to digital citizenship, we're leading the Content Authenticity Initiative now with over 150 members to set the standard for transparency and attribution across the content ecosystem. We recently founded the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity to advance broad adoption of content authenticity standards. 
This year has shown us the mission-critical role that digital documents increasingly play in powering a modern business of any size. In a world where work needs to be done from anywhere and with anyone, digital workflows have become the critical underpinning to drive productivity and efficiency across global teams. With Document Cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan and sign documents across desktops, web, mobile and through frictionless PDF services. Through our document services, we're unleashing the PDF ecosystem with APIs for third-party developers to customize the digital document experience. 
Q1 Document Cloud performance was stellar, with net new Document Cloud ARR of $98 million and record revenue of $480 million. Q1 highlights include outstanding Acrobat growth across all routes to market; significant traffic increases to our Acrobat Web experience, which delivers the ability to successfully complete PDF verb functionality in the browser driven by best-in-class search engine optimization; powerful new Acrobat capabilities to accomplish converting, protecting and merging PDFs in the browser, furthering our strategy to make the PDF experience frictionless across devices and platforms; demand for our Acrobat Mobile and Adobe Scan apps; strong momentum for Adobe Sign, which is enabling critical e-signature workflows in businesses and government institutions around the world; delivery of an enhanced PDF reading experience with Acrobat Liquid Mode, which leverages Adobe Sensei to automatically reformat PDFs and for quick and easy consumption; and key customer wins, including Amazon, Aon Services, Bank of America, Federal Aviation Administration, Merck and National Australia Bank. 
The pandemic accelerated the need for digital transformation among businesses of all sizes across both B2C and B2B. Small and midsized businesses had to quickly set up digital storefronts. Enterprises that had not yet made substantial digital investments took the leap, and those with significant digital footprints double down further. 
As the world begins to reopen, digital businesses will be the winners. Only companies that have a deep understanding of their customers' preferences and the ability to personalize experiences at every stage of the customer journey will survive and thrive. 
Adobe created the customer experience management category 10 years ago that we continue to lead. Experience Cloud built on the next-gen open platform is the most comprehensive solution for content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and, most recently, marketing workflow. Through our acquisition of Workfront, Adobe has a unique opportunity to create a unified marketing system of record, bringing workflow management, efficiency and productivity gains to marketing teams challenged with siloed applications. Over 1,000 shared customers are already benefiting from the integration and synergies between Experience Cloud and Workfront. 
Experience Cloud revenue was $934 million in Q1 with subscription revenue of $812 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Q1 highlights include momentum for Adobe Experience Platform, which continues to be the platform of choice for enterprise customers to deliver real-time personalization at scale; increasing demand for our commerce offerings. The Adobe digital index predicts that the pandemic has permanently boosted online spend by 20%, and 2022 will be the first trillion-dollar year in e-commerce; solid performance in the Workfront business, demonstrating the need for a unified marketing workflow solution to drive productivity across global teams; enhancements in customer journey analytics, delivering advanced anomaly detection, contribution analysis and intelligent alerts that identify hidden data patterns to more precisely understand customer behavior; powering the digital modernization of government agencies across state, county and city levels in all 50 U.S. states. Governments are revamping their online presence, making websites and apps easier to navigate, ensuring content is personalized and updated in real-time and creating intuitive forms that work on any device; key customer wins, including Abbott Labs, Deutsche Post, Coca-Cola, Fedex, Kaiser Permanente, Mondelez, State of Illinois and Sydney Water Corporation; and industry analyst recognition in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms and the Forrester Agile Content Management Systems wave report. This is the fourth year in a row that Adobe was placed as a leader in the DXP Magic Quadrant and the sixth consecutive time Forrester has recognized Adobe's industry leadership in their CMS-focused Wave reports. 
Adobe Summit, our annual digital experience conference, will be hosted virtually at the end of April across the globe. In addition to unveiling exciting new technology, innovation in Experience Cloud, we will have customers and inspirational leaders from companies that have been on the front lines, including Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer; and Rajesh Subramaniam, President and COO of Fedex. 
Adobe's fortitude is rooted in an unwavering focus on our employees, groundbreaking innovation and our purpose, which is to harness the best of Adobe to make a significant impact in the world. At Adobe, it's not only about what we do, but how we do it. I'm proud of our continued industry recognition, including being named to multiple lists celebrating Adobe as a great and equitable place to work for all and being recognized on Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies list, Fortune's Most Admired Companies list, and the CDP's Climate Change A list. I'm especially thankful to our 23,000 employees around the globe, whose dedication and talents delivered extraordinary results across every dimension of our business during these unprecedented times. 
Q1 was a record quarter for Adobe as a result of our outstanding performance, tremendous opportunity across our business and continued confidence in our global execution, we are raising our annual targets. John?"

Q1 was a fantastic start to the year for Adobe with strong financial results across all of our businesses. We accelerated revenue growth, expanded operating margins and continue to drive demand across our portfolio of products and services, which are clearly resonating with enterprises and individuals in a world where digital has become the default. 
Harnessing the power of data, we continue to utilize our data-driven operating model, or DDOM, to drive traffic to adobe.com, generate demand for our products, acquire new customers and increase engagement. We are investing in massive market opportunities, delivering innovations across our products, and Workfront had a great first quarter as part of the Adobe family. 
As a result, in Q1, Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.91 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Recall that Q1 was a 14-week quarter for us versus the typical 13-week quarter. 
Business and financial highlights included GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.61 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.14; digital media revenue of $2.86 billion, net new digital media ARR of $435 million; digital experience revenue of $934 million; cash flows from operations of $1.77 billion; remaining performance obligation of $11.61 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 1.9 million shares of our stock during the quarter. 
In Q1, we saw continued recovery in the business environment both in the U.S. and internationally, particularly with small and medium businesses, which contributed to our strong financial performance in the quarter. 
In our Digital media segment, we achieved 32% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1, and we exited the quarter with $10.69 billion of digital media ARR. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.38 billion, which represents 31% year-over-year growth, and we added $337 million of net new Creative ARR. 
Our Creative growth in Q1 was driven by strong consumer demand for our Creative solutions on adobe.com; driving improvements in usage, retention and engagement across our products; growth in our mobile business through app store subscriptions and top-of-funnel awareness; continued recovery in the SMB segment, which we target with our Creative Cloud for Teams offering; and investing in targeted campaigns and promotions to drive awareness and acquire new users, including in emerging markets. 
Adobe Document Cloud delivered another quarter of accelerated revenue growth. We achieved Document Cloud revenue of $480 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth, and we added $98 million of net new Document Cloud ARR. Documents of the currency f business and the imperative for digitization has never been greater. Our Document Cloud growth in Q1 was driven by increasing demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all geos, strong enterprise term licensing with institutions, utilizing DDOM insights to drive improved conversion on adobe.com, success in the reseller channel both for subscriptions and our perpetual offering, including seat growth in the SMB segment; and strength in Adobe sign, which grew revenue more than 50% year-over-year in the quarter. 
Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $934 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. Digital experience subscription revenue was $812 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Our Q1 results continue to validate the strength of our industry-leading customer experience management, or CXM solutions. Large enterprises across industries and geographies are standardizing on Adobe to manage customer interactions in actual insights and unified their customer data with Adobe Experience platform. 
In our commerce business, we continue to sign large deals with new customers and drive upsells at renewal points, enabling every business to transact online. Optimizing customer journeys across all channels in a digital-first world is critical to enterprises, and we see momentum with our larger customers adopting our complete Experience Cloud offering to drive omnichannel personalization at scale. 
We are driving the global CXM mandate across B2B and B2C from large enterprises to midsized companies across multiple verticals. Recent wins included expanding our reach in the public sector, where we are enabling critical constituent-facing services and adoption in the mid-market, our new AAM cloud service, Adobe Commerce and Marketo Engage. 
Lastly, we are off to a fast start in integrating workfront and driving the strategic value proposition of combining best-in-class workflow technology with Adobe's leading CXM and Creative Solutions. Workfront contributed $38 million of revenue in Q1 after purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue. 
We continue to drive savings from travel and entertainment and facilities operations as our employees work from home. We are expanding investment and hiring globally, particularly for R&D and sales and marketing roles in order to capitalize on our large addressable markets. 
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $37 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the sequential currency increase to revenue was $34 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $62 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the year-over-year currency increase to revenue was $44 million. 
Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 12% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. The tax rate came in lower than expected, primarily due to a favorable tax ruling in the quarter, which allowed us to reduce our withholding taxes and receive refunds for certain prior payments, and to a lesser extent, larger-than-expected tax benefits associated with share-based payments and favorable resolutions of other income tax matters. 
Our trade DSO was 38 days, which compares to 41 days in the year ago quarter and 37 days last quarter. Remaining performance obligation grew 17% year-over-year to $11.61 billion exiting Q1. Deferred revenue exiting the quarter was $4.29 billion, growing 19% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.96 billion, which is sequentially down quarter-over-quarter due to the acquisition of Workfront. Cash flows from operations in Q1 were $1.77 billion. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $888 million. We currently have $1.1 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which we expect to be exhausted by the end of this fiscal year. In December 2020, we announced that our Board authorized an additional $15 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal year 2024, which will be funded from future cash flow generation. 
For Q2, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $3.72 billion; Digital media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 21%; net new digital media ARR of approximately $450 million; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 18%; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 20%; tax rate of approximately 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 482 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.09; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.81. 
In light of Adobe's strong Q1 business performance and the momentum reflected in our second quarter targets, we are increasing our annual targets for fiscal 2021. We are now targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $15.45 billion; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 22%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.8 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 20%; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 23%; tax rate of approximately 17.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 481 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $9.13; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $11.85. 
In digital media ARR, we expect to return to normal pre-COVID summer seasonality, which can lead to sequentially lower net new ARR in Q3, followed by year-end strength in Q4. We expect operating margin to be relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 and then dip slightly in Q4 as we get back to spending on travel and reoccupying our facilities. 
In summary, Q1 was a great start, and we expect fiscal 2021 to be another record year. Combining our strength in customer acquisition and engagement, our leading technologies and talented employee base, Adobe is poised to continue our track record of impressive top and bottom line growth. 
Lastly, as reported in our press release earlier today, I have expressed my intent to retire this year. It's a very difficult decision for me because I love Adobe. And you may ask why now. I have been very fortunate in my career, and I still have the passion and energy to fully dedicate myself to my philanthropic interests as well as prioritize my family and friends. We have navigated our way extremely well during the pandemic and our Q1 results and raise targets are evidence that the company is on solid footing, so I feel comfortable that this is the right time for me. Our highly tenured finance and operations team is top-notch, and I plan on helping Shantanu through a transition period as the company launches a search for my successor. 
Now I'll turn it back to Shantanu."

Can you talk on -- you mentioned today on this call that it's seemingly endless in terms of the opportunity. Can you expand on that? Why is that the case? Because there is a view, not that I shared, that once the economy opens up, that the Creative folks are going to get out and enjoy the summer vacations and do less creative stuff. So we take a bit of a back separate digital transformation. I don't know how you feel about that, but if you can just talk to that tactical opening of the economy and if that might impede digital transformation or maybe not and then talk about why your confidence in the TAM of Creative is even greater than it was, say, 5 years back."

So first, let me just say that when you think about content and design, there is no question that it's fueling the global economy. 
And the way we segment our business, as we think about what we are doing for Creative pros, what we are doing for communicators and what we are doing for consumers and first to, I think, to share some numbers associated with that, I think we've said there are 49 million Creative professionals who use our products to make a living, the 700 million communicators and approximately 4 billion consumers. And so when you think about the TAM, whether that's $20 billion for the Creative pros, $15 billion for communicators or $6 billion for consumers in 2023, I mean that represents a $41 billion addressable market opportunity, given the importance of design. So it's a massive opportunity. 
What gives us confidence? I think when we think about strategically what we are trying to do, certainly, the first thing we're trying to do is advance every Creative category. And I'll just give you one example, Kash. 
I mean what's happening with immersive media and when you think about 3D to 2D and being able to do all these virtual shoots as the amount of content, that's an emerging business. I had a really great quarter. That continues on what we had said about video being one of the growth initiatives for us. So I think these new media types and advancing it is certainly critical. 
I think multi surface systems, what we can do associated with making sure mobile, mobile has been a really good growth opportunity for us. And the way we look at that, it's both as a result of the funnel that it provides for both mobile and desktop, but also as part of a system so people can create whenever they want. So even if they are going to be out in summer, as you say, they'll have access to all of our Creative tools wherever they go. 
The third one, I would say, is what we're doing with collaboration and the team and everything associated with allowing people to collaborate. 
Services, I mean Stock had another great quarter. We grew that business approximately 30% year-over-year. And the notion of just continuing to make sure that we do creativity for all, I think the world is going to be in a place where creative expression is going to dominate everything associated with education and productivity. So all of that give us really high confidence associated with the opportunity and our execution. 
And then if you think about it for Q1, really, just quickly, I think Q1 was a record quarter. We continue to see really great demand on the web associated with what's happening, and the absolute ARR was strong again. And this is, as you point out, despite the recovery being complete. And so we just feel like we're in absolutely sweet spot as it relates to what people want to do with our tools and services."

So I clearly think there's upside. And every day, you have good news in certain geographies and, unfortunately, not so good news, and so that only augurs well for us as we look at our business moving forward. 
But if I take big picture view associated with Experience Cloud, which was the second part of your question, digital transformation, just talking to all the CEOs that I'm talking to, those who've already invested in digital are absolutely doubling down because they recognize that this is the way to further differentiate. And those who are not are clearly investing in the people, technology and processes to be in this market, whether it's transformational accounts at the enterprise level that Anil talked about at the financial analyst meeting or whether it's at the small and medium business, your question associated with what we are able to do to enable them to have a digital store front, which is an absolute necessity for doing business today. There's a lot of interest in demand in both of those. I know a lot of you, as I read your reports, the checks that you're doing, you're hearing the interest in our solutions and -- from both the customers and the partners is high. And so we are going to see more demand for this. We had a good quarter. If you look at how we're targeting Dx. We clearly expect acceleration of revenue without -- with and without Workfront Q3 over Q2 and Q4 over Q3. So really excited, and I think we're in the sweet spot on all 3 of our growth areas."

John, we're going to miss you, but completely understand the desire to spend more time with family and philanthropy, so enjoy it. 
Two quarters ago, you called out your increased focus on driving experience cloud margin improvement. Can you give us an update on where you are in driving Experience Cloud margin improvement? And any sense to what you think about long-term margins could be for what Experience Cloud is today versus the future?"

But I think the decisions we made associated with reducing our focus on the transaction-based advertising revenue if you look at everything that's happening associated with that business, so there are other companies in that space, I think that was a good way to do it what we've done with the Experience platform. And with Anel coming in taking a soup to nuts approach associated with that entire P&L and the business opportunity, he's been able to align and simplify and improve it. 
And so I mean you don't accomplish the kinds of margins that we accomplished in the year without a focus across all of our businesses. And so we have an incredibly good leverage model, but there's more. I mean digital experience is still in that area where we're growing revenue. I mean 20% is what we've targeted for the entire year. We had 27% of subscription revenue in Q1. And so it really is one of those areas that's a growth opportunity, and you will see that translate into the bottom line over time. But John, maybe I'll have you also add to that."

Absolutely blue chip customers, whether it's financial services, whether it's in other online like retail, what we are doing with telecommunications. 
And so not only do we have that, but it's really served as the basis for what we've done with customer journey analytics. So if you take a step back and the big areas that we talked about, content and commerce, data insights and audiences, which is such a key part, I think that becomes even more important with what's happening in the cookie world so that you can have access to all your first-party data and profiles. 
So I think the decision to invest in that was right. The success that we're seeing in the marketplace and the leadership I think positions us incredibly well, Brent. And you'll hear a lot more about that at Summit. Certainly. I think the Workfront acquisition also has had the unique opportunity to be able to add to what we have in terms of our solutions and get workflow also and attribution associated with it.

You referred, for example, in the case of Creative to what you called a deeply collaborative shared system; in the case of Doc Cloud, you refer to intelligence applied to PDF as with Liquid Mode. All of that in the context of your applications and intelligent services.

And since there haven't been as many questions yet on Document Cloud, I'll use Document Cloud with the technology lens to answer your question. I mean, first, Liquid Mode, I was on the road. I was traveling on the road last week, and the entire preparation for this, I was doing on a mobile device with Liquid Mode. And I will tell you Liquid Mode for me was an absolute lifesaver in terms of being able to look at all these documents and do everything collaboratively on the road, so an unabashed plug for those who haven't tried Liquid More or haven't tried Adobe Scan to really see how it changes. 
And the way we think about it is when you apply that kind of AI to fundamentally change the nature and understanding the structure and semantics of documents, it opens up so many different possibilities on the segmentation. I mean we now have revenue that we drive through reader and reader distribution and upsells because we understand what people are trying to do and understand the intent. We're driving revenue through search engine optimization that we do on PDF because we have a one-click way of having them do more and more PDF functionality. We have a new revenue monetization model associated with APIs and being able to have people use PDF and embed that in their particular workflows. And we've always had -- Acrobat Sign had a great quarter again. I think John may have mentioned that we grew 50%. 
And so to your point, I mean AI and technology and being able to make that available and accessible in different ways is not just serving the customers better, but is clearly providing us new opportunities to monetize it that previously did not exist. And so I think you'll continue to see that in the innovation road map, whether it's Summit or Max. You'll see some really cool things, which will not just push the envelope for our Creative pros, but also make it way more accessible, productive and fun for communicators and consumers. John?"

When we entered the pandemic last year, we did pause hiring initially as we talked about to really focus our resources on our highest priorities, and we did that and successfully navigated the pandemic and really can take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. And so with that, of course, we talked about in Q3 that we're going to start to ramp hiring, and so we have done that. And we continue to look to invest, as I said, in R&D and sales capacity as well as variable marketing. 
In terms of the impact on OpEx, we had originally planned for margin expansion in FY '21 over FY '20. And these updated targets actually indicate even greater margin expansion, even though it will -- it accounts for our phase reentry as we come back to traveling as we reopen our facilities. So for us, the ability to grow the top line and the leverage in our operating model allows us to be able to do that. So for us, margin expansion is really all driven off of revenue growth.

I mean maybe I'll speak to that, and I'll also give you my color on sort of what happened with ARR. But first, as it relates to how we're expanding both the user base and acquisitions, I mean the net new ARR, when you look at it, it's primarily all net new ARR in terms of customer acquisition. And whether it's the mobile-only applications that we're providing, whether it's the web-based ability to do things in the browser, whether it's collaboration, that's certainly the way in which we are expanding our offering. And frankly, the way we do it is that anybody who uses one of our on-ramp products, whether it's an individual category app that is then using the entire CC all apps or whether it's a consumer app where they start to get exposed to things like maybe layers in Photoshop or a time line in Premiere Rush, they have the ability to then be up sold as well as to become more productive by going to Premiere or Photoshop. 
So it's very much been a part of our strategy all along, which is how do you attract customers to the platform and how do you think about then making sure that as they grow in their creative endeavors that we have the right on ramp, whether it's an offer that we provide at the right time, whether it's engagement that we do with Adobe Creative Live. I mean Creative Live has really become in that community of Behance, a great way for people to continue to grow and learn. And I think there are a whole cottage industry also of people who've done training and learning and education on Creative products. 
So that's the strategy, which is meet the customer where they are, whether it's on a surface or whether it's a degree of specialization and then make sure that as they expand their creative pursuits that we're the right product for that. And so if you think about it, I mean digital media ARR, what really happens is it's not -- while revenue may be more representative of the number of weeks in the quarter and so if you take the 14 week over 13 week, you can argue that it was probably 8 points of revenue that was extra as a result of the 14th week. But ARR is not as cyclical because ARR, when you have an enterprise part of the business, it's probably going to be back end-loaded by most enterprise, much like enterprise. So that's why we look at the Q1 ARR, which was a record for Creative is a really solid performance. So hopefully, that gives you a flavor. Revenue for Creative is a little bit more dependent on the number of weeks per ARR. And sort of you have these things that we do, which are cyclical, and that drives the strong growth that we saw across both Creative and Documents."

And again, as in the response to the previous question that was asked, this is not banking on any macroeconomic environment changes for the rest of the year. So it's based on what we know today and the interest. Commerce is an area that is seeing a fair amount of interest. The real-time customer data platform, the experience platform is seeing a significant amount of interest. Workfront, as we said, and John mentioned, that it's not the deferred revenue. It's the performance as well that's driving the upside in that particular business. Customer journey analytics and being able to address this in a multichannel, that's seeing a lot of interest.

I think the fact that we have Adobe Reader, which is the operating environment in which all of these workflows are happening, I think we've done a better job at awareness, frankly, of what we have in that. Hopefully, some of you have seen the incredibly new creative campaigns that we're running associated with that. 
We're actually getting a fair amount of wins from other competitive products that people might have been using in terms of moving over to Adobe, the partnerships that we have with Microsoft and ServiceNow in terms of being embedded, whether it's in Sharepoint or outlook or partnering with ServiceNow. So I think we're executing on the product side. I think we have some key differentiation. And this is not a zero-sum game. It's such a large opportunity. And I think the work from home has also certainly benefited us and everybody else in that space. So all of those, I think, are reasons why Sign just continues to be a real growth opportunity for us. 
The last thing I would mention is the ability to embed our Sign stuff within other people's offerings as well, I think we've made some good progress on that one as well. So all of these give us confidence.

And so even on the individual case, you have the ability to use a certain amount of Sign capability within Acrobat, and so I think our strength is in the combined offering."

And so I think -- actually, just to give you a little bit of an update on numbers, I mean the beauty of when we acquired Magento and put it in the commerce cloud was, first, it was B2B and B2C. That was an attractive area for us. Second, it was physical goods and digital goods, that was an interesting opportunity for us. I think the third thing that was important for us was the fact that we had the ability to have both a large ecosystem of partners who are implementing this as well as an open source community that was able to extend the functionality and, in effect, be extended R&D model. 
On the partner side, I mean, I think we've gone something from 2,800 or so partners that they had to well over 4,000. So the interest in partnering with us on the commerce Cloud is high. And our model, as we've always said, this goes back also to the earlier question that somebody had on the P&L associated with digital experience, our model is software, and we're happy actually to have a large ecosystem of partners that work with it. 
And maybe the last thing I would say on that particular front is that we're really continuing to expand what we do on the merchant services offering, so partners like PayPal and what we can do in conjunction with them and other credit card and other partners. I think that's going to also be a good area of continued growth for us."

And then, John, you can certainly add to that, which was -- I mean so first, from a strategic point of view, if you go to adobe.com, it's primarily subscription, and so we've done a fantastic job of converting that business to subscription. 
When you look at it globally and you consider some other markets where a lot of it is going through the resellers, even that has predominantly become subscription, but we'd be crazy not to have people if they do want some perpetual to buy the perpetual and then convert it to subscription because we still know that. So I think to your uber point, yes, we did see some strength in perpetual. China, I think, had also a pretty strong quarter as it related to Acrobat, and that may be a little bit more perpetual. 
Our strategy is clearly moving into the cloud. Our strategy is clearly demonstrating the value of where people see the ongoing innovation that we're providing. But that business, unlike the other business, we just want to attract more and more customers through any one of those offerings, and that's why we've continued to have the Acrobat Perpetual offer out there. But it's becoming smaller and smaller as a part of the business, it's definitely becoming smaller and smaller. And on adobe.com, it's virtually de minimis."

I wanted to ask you guys about a concern that I hear from investors and kind of get your take on it. While you guys are seeing a recovery on the SMB side of the equation, the fact of the matter is the digital media business did really well through all of last year. Even in the height of the pandemic in the upcoming May quarter, you guys saw really good ARR growth, it was up on a year-on-year basis, which exceeded a lot of people's expectations. But now there's a concern there's a really tough comp ahead that you guys saw work from home benefits or benefits that were due to sort of what's going on with the crisis that might create a difficult compare.

Is there anything that's going to fundamentally change when the economy changes? And we don't think so because we just continue to believe that the importance of all of those areas and the tailwinds that exist in the market will continue to exist. 
I mean I think in terms of our numbers, and you look at what we are doing, where we've said it's -- we've raised the target a little bit from what we had, the 1.75 billion to the 1.8 billion. And this is 10 years into it when you're driving record ARR, I would say that, that reflects the much larger market opportunity that we've created for ourselves. 
And so is there -- the way I actually look at it, Keith, is that it's brought more attention to what's possible with our tools. And once people experience the benefits of what they're doing with us, it's going to be hard to go back to not using those kinds of technologies, which is what gives us a lot of interest, hopefully. And you're certainly there, Keith, at the analyst meeting. That's why we try to lay out completely what we see in terms of communicators and consumers and Creative pros. 
And I mean the business is doing really well. We had -- we're expanding the Digital media segment revenue for the year. We're expanding revenue. And so that's all based on what we see as demand for what we have created and the tremendous amount of innovation that's ahead of us. So I think all of those give us a lot of confidence in the fundamental nature of the growth opportunities that we're focused on. 
And since that was the last question, I mean maybe just a couple of points I would like to, and I know a lot of you did, also publicly thank John. This was, I know for John, a very personal decision, and I'm happy that he's going to be able to focus on what's important for him, which is family and his philanthropic interest, and I'm deeply grateful. 
And on the overall business, it's hard, it's hard to believe that a year has passed since the pandemic impacted the world. But I think what's really incredible is digital is not just nice to have right now. It's absolutely mission-critical, and most companies would be thrilled to have one area of growth. We have 3 areas of growth: creativity, storytelling, design, what's happening with the future of work and remote work and the limitations of what you can do with in-person interaction, which will lead to more automation of digital documents and how every business in the planet is going to focus on engaging digitally with their customers. So massive opportunity. 
I think Q1 was a really strong quarter. We have a compelling strategy, outstanding innovation road map. And I really have to thank all our employees who've pivoted to work from home and executed magnificently in what have been difficult circumstances, and which is why the momentum led us to increase our targets for '21. And as I always say, I think the top line and bottom line performance really set us apart as investment for people. 
But stay safe, stay healthy, and we really look forward to having you attend Summit, where we will unveil the next generation of enterprise innovation. Thank you for joining us, and I'll pass it back to Jonathan."

It is hard to believe that it has been over a year since the pandemic began and the world changed forever. During this unprecedented time, we have gone from a world with digital to a digital-first world. Digital experiences have played a vital role in making every aspect of our lives possible, from keeping families and coworkers connected to enabling new ways of learning, to powering digital commerce and ensuring continuity of essential business operations. Overnight, we have transitioned to a global digital economy.  
Adobe's mission is to change the world through digital experiences. At Adobe, we're helping fuel the digital economy with our continuous innovation, our large and diverse set of global customers and partners and the unique expertise we have garnered from undergoing our own digital transformation. Our strategy of unleashing creativity, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses is mission-critical and driving our top and bottom line growth.  
Adobe had an outstanding first quarter with strong results across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We achieved $3.91 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 26% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.61, representing 33% year-over-year growth. And non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.14, representing 38% year-over-year growth.  
In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q1, achieving $2.86 billion in revenue, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $435 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q1 grew to $10.69 billion.  
This past year, we have seen the tremendous power creativity has to inspire, connect and entertain us. Whether it's a student uploading his video assignment, a social media influencer advocating for change or a small business owner designing her first website, everyone has a story to tell. Creative Cloud remains a market leader in core creative categories, including imaging, design, video, screen design and illustration, and we're expanding that leadership into emerging media types like 3D and AR. Creation and consumption across phones, tablets and desktops is exploding. We're building solutions for every surface and platform, enabling customers of every skill level to create whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. 
Our Behance community has grown to 25 million people, and programs like Adobe Live provide ongoing forums for creators to engage as a global community. In November, we turned Adobe MAX, our annual creativity conference, into a global digital event, culminating in 10 million livestreams. Creative Cloud has truly become the world's creative engine, and our future opportunities are endless.  
Q1 Creative Cloud performance was strong with net new Creative Cloud ARR of $337 million and revenue of $2.38 billion. Q1 highlights include strength in our student offering, enabling next-gen creators to tell their stories in the midst of an unprecedented remote learning environment; momentum in our Teams offering, demonstrating the increased demand for collaboration solutions globally; growth in our core creative categories, including imaging, led by Photoshop and Lightroom; demand for Premiere Pro, the leader in the exploding video category and the overwhelming favorite at the Sundance Film Festival for the third year in a row with 68% of films using it; significant growth in our creative mobile applications, including Lightroom mobile and Photoshop Express; an increase in demand for Creative Cloud services like Adobe Stock, which helped fill the void created when live photography and video shoots had to be postponed; and all of this results in record traffic to adobe.com, our world-class acquisition and growth engine and a hub for customer engagement across all surfaces.  
We continue to deliver groundbreaking product innovation, including Neural Filters and Super Resolution features in Photoshop that harness the power of AI and machine learning to simplify complex workflows and enhance images in seconds, extending our applications to multiple surfaces with Illustrator on the iPad and Fresco on the iPhone and building collaboration capabilities with Creative Cloud libraries. In support of our commitment to digital citizenship, we're leading the Content Authenticity Initiative now with over 150 members to set the standard for transparency and attribution across the content ecosystem. We recently founded the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity to advance broad adoption of content authenticity standards.  
This year has shown us the mission-critical role that digital documents increasingly play in powering a modern business of any size. In a world where work needs to be done from anywhere and with anyone, digital workflows have become the critical underpinning to drive productivity and efficiency across global teams. With Document Cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan and sign documents across desktops, web, mobile and through frictionless PDF services. Through our document services, we're unleashing the PDF ecosystem with APIs for third-party developers to customize the digital document experience. 
Q1 Document Cloud performance was stellar with net new Document Cloud ARR of $98 million and record revenue of $480 million. Q1 highlights include outstanding Acrobat growth across all routes to market; significant traffic increases to our Acrobat web experience, which delivers the ability to successfully complete PDF verb functionality in the browser, driven by best-in-class search engine optimization; powerful new Acrobat capabilities to accomplish converting, protecting and merging PDFs in the browser, furthering our strategy to make the PDF experience frictionless across devices and platforms; demand for our Acrobat Mobile and Adobe Scan apps; strong momentum for Adobe Sign, which is enabling critical e-signature workflows in businesses and government institutions around the world; delivery of an enhanced PDF reading experience with Acrobat Liquid Mode, which leverages Adobe Sensei to automatically reformat PDFs and for quick and easy consumption; and key customer wins, including Amazon, Aon Services, Bank of America, Federal Aviation Administration, Merck and National Australia Bank.  
The pandemic accelerated the need for digital transformation among businesses of all sizes across both B2C and B2B. Small and midsize businesses had to quickly set up digital storefronts. Enterprises that had not yet made substantial digital investments took the leap, and those with significant digital footprints doubled down further. As the world begins to reopen, digital businesses will be the winners. Only companies that have a deep understanding of their customers' preferences and the ability to personalize experiences at every stage of the customer journey will survive and thrive.  
Adobe created the customer experience management category 10 years ago that we continue to lead. Experience Cloud, built on a next-gen open platform, is the most comprehensive solution for content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and, most recently, marketing workflow. Through our acquisition of Workfront, Adobe has a unique opportunity to create a unified marketing system of record, bringing workflow management, efficiency and productivity gains to marketing teams challenged with siloed applications. Over 1,000 shared customers are already benefiting from the integration and synergies between Experience Cloud and Workfront.  
Experience Cloud revenue was $934 million in Q1 with subscription revenue of $812 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Q1 highlights include momentum for Adobe Experience Platform, which continues to be the platform of choice for enterprise customers to deliver real-time personalization at scale; increasing demand for our commerce offerings. The Adobe Digital Index predicts that the pandemic has permanently boosted online spend by 20%, and 2022 will be the first trillion-dollar year in e-commerce; solid performance in the Workfront business, demonstrating the need for a unified marketing workflow solution to drive productivity across global teams; enhancements in Customer Journey Analytics, delivering advanced anomaly detection, contribution analysis and intelligent alerts that identify hidden data patterns to more precisely understand customer behavior. 
Powering the digital modernization of government agencies across state, county and city levels in all 50 U.S. states. Governments are revamping their online presence, making websites and apps easier to navigate, ensuring content is personalized and updated in real-time and creating intuitive forms that work on any device; key customer wins, including Abbott Labs, Deutsche Post, Coca-Cola, FedEx, Kaiser Permanente, Mondelez, State of Illinois, and Sydney Water Corporation; and industry analyst recognition in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms and the Forrester Agile Content Management Systems Wave report. This is the fourth year in a row that Adobe was placed as a leader in the DXP Magic Quadrant and the sixth consecutive time Forrester has recognized Adobe's industry leadership in their CMS-focused Wave reports.  
Adobe Summit, our annual digital experience conference, will be hosted virtually at the end of April across the globe. In addition to unveiling exciting new technology innovation in Experience Cloud, we will have customers and inspirational leaders from companies that have been on the front lines, including Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer; and Rajesh Subramaniam, President and COO of FedEx.  
Adobe's fortitude is rooted in an unwavering focus on our employees, groundbreaking innovation and our purpose, which is to harness the best of Adobe to make a significant impact in the world. At Adobe, it's not only about what we do but how we do it. I'm proud of our continued industry recognition, including being named to multiple lists celebrating Adobe as a great and equitable place to work for all and being recognized on Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies list, Fortune's Most Admired Companies list, and the CDP's Climate Change A-list. I'm especially thankful to our 23,000 employees around the globe, whose dedication and talents delivered extraordinary results across every dimension of our business during these unprecedented times.  
Q1 was a record quarter for Adobe. As a result of our outstanding performance, tremendous opportunity across our business and continued confidence in our global execution, we are raising our annual targets. John?"

Q1 was a fantastic start to the year for Adobe with strong financial results across all of our businesses. We accelerated revenue growth, expanded operating margins and continued to drive demand across our portfolio of products and services, which are clearly resonating with enterprises and individuals in a world where digital has become the default.  
Harnessing the power of data, we continue to utilize our data-driven operating model, or DDOM, to drive traffic to adobe.com, generate demand for our products, acquire new customers and increase engagement. We are investing in massive market opportunities, delivering innovations across our products, and Workfront had a great first quarter as part of the Adobe family.  
As a result, in Q1, Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.91 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Recall that Q1 was a 14-week quarter for us versus the typical 13-week quarter. Business and financial highlights included GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.61 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.14; Digital Media revenue of $2.86 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $435 million; Digital Experience revenue of $934 million; cash flows from operations of $1.77 billion; remaining performance obligation of $11.61 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 1.9 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In Q1, we saw continued recovery in the business environment both in the U.S. and internationally particularly with small and medium businesses, which contributed to our strong financial performance in the quarter.  
In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 32% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1, and we exited the quarter with $10.69 billion of Digital Media ARR. 
We achieved Creative revenue of $2.38 billion, which represents 31% year-over-year growth, and we added $337 million of net new Creative ARR. Our Creative growth in Q1 was driven by strong consumer demand for our Creative solutions on adobe.com; driving improvements in usage, retention and engagement across our products; growth in our mobile business through app store subscriptions and top-of-funnel awareness; continued recovery in the SMB segment, which we target with our Creative Cloud for Teams offering; and investing in targeted campaigns and promotions to drive awareness and acquire new users, including in emerging markets.  
Adobe Document Cloud delivered another quarter of accelerated revenue growth. We achieved Document Cloud revenue of $480 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth, and we added $98 million of net new Document Cloud ARR. Documents are the currency of business, and the imperative for digitization has never been greater. Our Document Cloud growth in Q1 was driven by increasing demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all geos; strong enterprise term licensing with institutions; utilizing DDOM insights to drive improved conversion on adobe.com; success in the reseller channel both for subscriptions and our perpetual offering, including seat growth in the SMB segment; and strength in Adobe Sign, which grew revenue more than 50% year-over-year in the quarter.  
Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $934 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $812 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Our Q1 results continue to validate the strength of our industry-leading customer experience management, or CXM, solutions. Large enterprises across industries and geographies are standardizing on Adobe to manage customer interactions, gain actionable insights and unify their customer data with Adobe Experience Platform. In our commerce business, we continue to sign large deals with new customers and drive upsells at renewal points, enabling every business to transact online. Optimizing customer journeys across all channels in a digital-first world is critical to enterprises, and we see momentum with our larger customers adopting our complete Experience Cloud offering to drive omnichannel personalization at scale.  
We are driving the global CXM mandate across B2B and B2C from large enterprises to midsize companies across multiple verticals. Recent wins included expanding our reach in the public sector, where we are enabling critical constituent-facing services and adoption in the mid-market of our new AEM Cloud Service, Adobe Commerce and Marketo Engage.  
Lastly, we are off to a fast start in integrating Workfront and driving the strategic value proposition of combining best-in-class workflow technology with Adobe's leading CXM and Creative solutions. Workfront contributed $38 million of revenue in Q1 after purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue.  
We continue to drive savings from travel and entertainment and facilities operations as our employees work from home. We are expanding investment and hiring globally, particularly for R&D and sales and marketing roles, in order to capitalize on our large addressable markets.  
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $37 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the sequential currency increase to revenue was $34 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $62 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the year-over-year currency increase to revenue was $44 million.  
Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 12% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. The tax rate came in lower than expected primarily due to a favorable tax ruling in the quarter, which allowed us to reduce our withholding taxes and receive refunds for certain prior payments and, to a lesser extent, larger-than-expected tax benefits associated with share-based payments and favorable resolutions of other income tax matters.  
Our trade DSO was 38 days, which compares to 41 days in the year ago quarter and 37 days last quarter. Remaining performance obligation grew 17% year-over-year to $11.61 billion exiting Q1. Deferred revenue exiting the quarter was $4.29 billion, growing 19% year-over-year. 
Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.96 billion, which is sequentially down quarter-over-quarter due to the acquisition of Workfront. Cash flows from operations in Q1 were $1.77 billion. 
We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $888 million. We currently have $1.1 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which we expect to be exhausted by the end of this fiscal year. In December 2020, we announced that our Board authorized an additional $15 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal year 2024, which will be funded from future cash flow generation.  
For Q2, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $3.72 billion, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 21%, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $450 million, Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 18%, Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 20%, tax rate of approximately 19.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis, share count of approximately 482 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.09, and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.81.  
In light of Adobe's strong Q1 business performance and the momentum reflected in our second quarter targets, we are increasing our annual targets for fiscal 2021. We are now targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $15.45 billion, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 22%, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.8 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 20%, Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 23%, tax rate of approximately 17.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis, share count of approximately 481 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $9.13, and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $11.85.  
In Digital Media ARR, we expect to return to normal pre-COVID summer seasonality, which can lead to sequentially lower net new ARR in Q3, followed by year-end strength in Q4. We expect operating margin to be relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 and then dip slightly in Q4 as we get back to spending on travel and reoccupying our facilities.  
In summary, Q1 was a great start, and we expect fiscal 2021 to be another record year. Combining our strength in customer acquisition and engagement, our leading technologies and talented employee base, Adobe is poised to continue our track record of impressive top and bottom line growth.  
Lastly, as reported in our press release earlier today, I have expressed my intent to retire this year. It's a very difficult decision for me because I love Adobe. And you may ask why now. I have been very fortunate in my career, and I still have the passion and energy to fully dedicate myself to my philanthropic interests as well as prioritize my family and friends. We have navigated our way extremely well during the pandemic, and our Q1 results and raised targets are evidence that the company is on solid footing. So I feel comfortable that this is the right time for me. Our highly tenured finance and operations team is top-notch, and I plan on helping Shantanu through a transition period as the company launches a search for my successor.  
Now I'll turn it back to Shantanu."

You've been very consistent in talking about how large the TAM for Creative is. I think it goes back to 10 years prior. Can you talk on -- you mentioned today on this call that it's seemingly endless in terms of the opportunity. Can you expand on that? Why is that the case? Because there is a view, not that I share, that once the economy opens up, the Creative folks are going to get out and enjoy the summer vacations and do less creative stuff. So we'd take a bit of a backstep with digital transformation. I don't know how you feel about that, but if you can just talk to that tactical opening of the economy and if that might impede digital transformation or maybe not and then talk about why your confidence in the TAM of Creative is even greater than it was, say, 5 years back."

So first, let me just say that when you think about content and design, there is no question that it's fueling the global economy. And the way we segment our business, as we think about what we are doing for creative pros, what we are doing for communicators and what we are doing for consumers -- and first to, I think, just share some numbers associated with that, I think we've said there are 49 million creative professionals who use our products to make a living. There are 700 million communicators and approximately 4 billion consumers. And so when you think about the TAM, whether that's $20 billion for the creative pros, $15 billion for communicators or $6 billion for consumers in 2023, I mean that represents a $41 billion addressable market opportunity given the importance of design. So it's a massive opportunity. 
What gives us confidence? I think when we think about strategically what we are trying to do, certainly, the first thing we're trying to do is advance every Creative category. And I'll just give you one example, Kash. I mean what's happening with immersive media and when you think about 3D to 2D and being able to do all these virtual shoots as the amount of content, that's an emerging business. I had a really great quarter. That continues on what we had said about video being one of the growth initiatives for us. So I think these new media types and advancing it is certainly critical. 
I think multi-surface systems, what we can do associated with making sure mobile, mobile has been a really good growth opportunity for us. And the way we look at that, it's both as a result of the funnel that it provides for both mobile and desktop but also as part of a system so people can create whenever they want. So even if they are going to be out in summer, as you say, they'll have access to all of our Creative tools wherever they go. 
The third one, I would say, is what we're doing with collaboration and the team and everything associated with allowing people to collaborate. Services, I mean Stock had another great quarter. We grew that business approximately 30% year-over-year. And the notion of just continuing to make sure that we do creativity for all, I think the world is going to be in a place where creative expression is going to dominate everything associated with education and productivity. So all of that give us really high confidence associated with the opportunity and our execution. 
And then if you think about it for Q1 really just quickly, I think Q1 was a record quarter. We continue to see really great demand on the web associated with what's happening, and the absolute ARR was strong again. And this is, as you point out, despite the recovery being complete. And so we just feel like we're in an absolutely sweet spot as it relates to what people want to do with our tools and services."

First, are you kind of back to pre-COVID levels at this point in terms of SMB momentum? Or is there still more to gain there? 
And then secondly, just specific on Experience Cloud, I know even pre-COVID, there were some execution challenges that you're experiencing in the SMB space. So have those execution challenges been sort of fully addressed and you're seeing some of those more mid-market-oriented products that you've acquired executing the way you'd like to -- the way you'd like them to?

So I still think that when you think about what's happening in the world, it's still not fully back, right, to normal, and we're still in a sort of a pandemic situation. So I clearly think there's upside. And every day, you have good news in certain geographies and unfortunately not so good news. And so that only augurs well for us as we look at our business moving forward. 
But if I take big picture view associated with Experience Cloud, which was the second part of your question, digital transformation, just talking to all the CEOs that I'm talking to, those who've already invested in digital are absolutely doubling down because they recognize that this is the way to further differentiate. And those who are not are clearly investing in the people, technology and processes to be in this market, whether it's transformational accounts at the enterprise level that Anil talked about at the financial analyst meeting or whether it's at the small and medium business, your question associated with what we are able to do to enable them to have a digital storefront, which is an absolute necessity for doing business today, there's a lot of interest in demand in both of those. 
I know a lot of you, as I read your reports, the checks that you're doing, you're hearing the interest in our solutions and -- from both the customers and the partners is high. And so we are going to see more demand for this. We had a good quarter. If you look at how we're targeting DX, we clearly expect acceleration of revenue without -- with and without Workfront, Q3 over Q2 and Q4 over Q3. So we're really excited, and I think we're in the sweet spot on all 3 of our growth areas."

And with Anil coming in, taking a soup-to-nuts approach associated with that entire P&L and the business opportunity, he's been able to align and simplify and improve it. 
And so I mean you don't accomplish the kinds of margins that we accomplished in the year without a focus across all of our businesses. And so we have an incredibly good leverage model, but there's more. I mean Digital Experience is still in that area where we're growing revenue. I mean 20% is what we've targeted for the entire year. We had 27% of subscription revenue in Q1. And so it really is one of those areas that's a growth opportunity, and you will see that translate into the bottom line over time.

We have billions of profiles that are already going through this, absolutely blue-chip customers, whether it's in financial services, whether it's in other online like retail, what we are doing with telecommunications. And so not only do we have that, but it's really served as the basis for what we've done with Customer Journey Analytics. So if you take a step back and the big areas that we talked about, content and commerce, data insights and audiences, which is such a key part, I think that becomes even more important with what's happening in the cookie world so that you can have access to all your first-party data and profiles. 
So I think the decision to invest in that was right. The success that we're seeing in the marketplace and the leadership, I think, positions us incredibly well, Brent.

I think the Workfront acquisition also has had the unique opportunity to be able to add to what we have in terms of our solutions and get workflow also and attribution associated with it.

And since there haven't been as many questions yet on Document Cloud, I'll use Document Cloud with the technology lens to answer your question. I mean, first, Liquid Mode, I was on the road -- I was traveling on the road last week, and the entire preparation for this, I was doing on a mobile device with Liquid Mode. And I will tell you Liquid Mode for me was an absolute lifesaver in terms of being able to look at all these documents and do everything collaboratively on the road, so an unabashed plug for those who haven't tried Liquid More or haven't tried Adobe Scan to really see how it changes. 
And the way we think about it is when you apply that kind of AI to fundamentally change the nature and understanding the structure and semantics of documents, it opens up so many different possibilities on the segmentation. I mean we now have revenue that we drive through Reader and Reader distribution and upsells because we understand what people are trying to do and understand the intent. We're driving revenue through search engine optimization that we do on PDF because we have a one-click way of having them do more and more PDF functionality. We have a new revenue monetization model associated with APIs and being able to have people use PDF and embed that in their particular workflows. And we've always had -- Acrobat Sign had a great quarter again. I think John may have mentioned that we grew 50%. 
And so to your point, I mean AI and technology and being able to make that available and accessible in different ways is not just serving the customers better but is clearly providing us new opportunities to monetize it. That previously did not exist. And so I think you'll continue to see that in the innovation road map, whether it's Summit or MAX. You'll see some really cool things, which will not just push the envelope for our creative pros but also make it way more accessible, productive and fun for communicators and consumers. John?"

In regards to the job openings, the head count growth, when we entered the pandemic last year, we did pause hiring initially, as we talked about, to really focus our resources on our highest priorities. And we did that and successfully navigated the pandemic and really can have -- take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. And so with that, of course, we talked about in Q3 that we're going to start to ramp hiring, and so we have done that. And we continue to look to invest, as I said, in R&D and sales capacity as well as variable marketing. 
In terms of the impact on OpEx, we had originally planned for margin expansion in FY '21 over FY '20. And these updated targets actually indicate even greater margin expansion even though it will -- it accounts for our phased reentry as we come back to traveling as we reopen our facilities. So for us, the ability to grow the top line and the leverage in our operating model allows us to be able to do that. So for us, margin expansion is really all driven off of revenue growth. And ultimately, we can perform both very well on the top line and on bottom line."

Saket, I mean maybe I'll speak to that, and I'll also give you my color on sort of what happened with ARR.

Saket, I mean maybe I'll speak to that, and I'll also give you my color on sort of what happened with ARR. But first, as it relates to how we're expanding both the user base and acquisitions, I mean the net new ARR, when you look at it, it's primarily all net new ARR in terms of customer acquisition. And whether it's the mobile-only applications that we're providing, whether it's the web-based ability to do things in the browser, whether it's collaboration, that's certainly the way in which we are expanding our offering. And frankly, the way we do it is that anybody who uses one of our on-ramp products, whether it's individual category app that is then using the entire CC, all apps or whether it's a consumer app where they start to get exposed to things like maybe layers in Photoshop or a time line in Premiere Rush, they have the ability to then be upsold as well as to become more productive by going to Premiere or Photoshop. 
So it's very much been a part of our strategy all along, which is how do you attract customers to the platform and how do you think about then making sure that as they grow in their creative endeavors that we have the right on-ramp, whether it's an offer that we provide at the right time, whether it's engagement that we do with Adobe Creative Live. I mean Creative Live has really become in that community of Behance, a great way for people to continue to grow and learn. And I think there are whole cottage industry also of people who've done training and learning and education on Creative products. So that's the strategy, which is meet the customer where they are, whether it's on a surface or whether it's a degree of specialization, and then make sure that as they expand their creative pursuits that we're the right product for that. 
And so if you think about it, I mean Digital Media ARR, what really happens is it's not -- while revenue may be more representative of the number of weeks in a quarter and so if you take the 14 week over 13 week, you can argue that it was probably 8 points of revenue that was extra as a result of the 14th week. But ARR is not as cyclical because ARR, when you have an enterprise part of the business, it's probably going to be back-end-loaded by most enterprise, much like enterprise. So that's why we look at the Q1 ARR, which was a record for Creative. It's a really solid performance. So hopefully, that gives you a flavor. Revenue for Creative is a little bit more dependent on the number of weeks, but ARR is sort of -- you have these things that we do, which are cyclical, and that drives the strong growth that we saw across both Creative and Document."

I think the confidence comes from, first, the performance in Q1. As we said, we had 27% subscription revenue growth. I think the confidence comes from the conversations that we're all having with companies all across the globe from the pipeline that we have from what we know in terms of Summit. And again, as in the response to the previous question that was asked, this is not banking on any macroeconomic environment changes for the rest of the year. So it's based on what we know today and the interest. 
Commerce is an area that is seeing a fair amount of interest. The Real-Time Customer Data Platform, the Experience Platform is seeing a significant amount of interest. Workfront, as we said -- and John mentioned that it's not the deferred revenue. It's the performance as well that's driving the upside in that particular business. Customer Journey Analytics and being able to address this in a multichannel, that's seeing a lot of interest. I think you're going to see some new products also in terms of how we evolve our campaign product and analytics product to be more business-performance-related. And frankly, to a large extent, Ken, all of this is also predicated on how we run our business, right, and our DDOM and understanding what it takes to run an online business. We're world-class at that, and we're building products for ourselves. And so that gives us a lot of confidence that it will help every other customer out there."

Hopefully, some of you have seen the incredibly new creative campaigns that we're running associated with that. We're actually getting a fair amount of wins from other competitive products that people might have been using in terms of moving over to Adobe, the partnerships that we have with Microsoft and ServiceNow in terms of being embedded, whether it's in SharePoint or Outlook or partnering with ServiceNow. 
So I think we're executing on the product side. I think we have some key differentiation. And this is not a zero-sum game. It's such a large opportunity. And I think the work from home has also certainly benefited us and everybody else in that space. So all of those, I think, are reasons why Sign just continues to be a real growth opportunity for us. The last thing I would mention is the ability to embed our Sign stuff within other people's offerings as well, I think we've made some good progress on that one as well. So all of these give us confidence. 
And to your question, Sterling, we don't break it out because it's hard, right? Sometimes you have an enterprise deal where you have all of them using Acrobat and Sign. And so even on the individual case, you have the ability to use a certain amount of Sign capability within Acrobat. And so I think our strength is in the combined offering."

On the partner side, I mean I think we've gone something from 2,800 or so partners that they had to well over 4,000. So the interest in partnering with us on the Commerce Cloud is high. And our model, as we've always said, this goes back also to the earlier question that somebody had on the P&L associated with Digital Experience. Our model is software, and we're happy actually to have a large ecosystem of partners that work with it. And maybe the last thing I would say on that particular front is that we're really continuing to expand what we do on the merchant services offering, so partners like PayPal and what we can do in conjunction with them and other credit card and other partners.

But we'd be crazy not to have people if they do want some perpetual to buy the perpetual and then convert it to subscription because we still know that. So I think to your uber point, yes, we did see some strength in perpetual. China, I think, had also a pretty strong quarter as it related to Acrobat, and that may be a little bit more perpetual. 
Our strategy is clearly moving into the cloud. Our strategy is clearly demonstrating the value of where people see the ongoing innovation that we're providing. But that business, unlike the other business, we just want to attract more and more customers through any one of those offerings, and that's why we've continued to have the Acrobat perpetual offer out there.

Is there anything that's going to fundamentally change when the economy changes? And we don't think so because we just continue to believe that the importance of all of those areas and the tailwinds that exist in the market will continue to exist. I mean I think in terms of our numbers -- and you look at what we are doing, where we've said, it's -- we've raised the target a little bit from what we had, the $1.75 billion to the $1.8 billion. And this is 10 years into it, looking at driving record ARR. I would say that, that reflects the much larger market opportunity that we've created for ourselves. 
And so is there -- the way I actually look at it, Keith, is that it's brought more attention to what's possible with our tools. And once people experience the benefits of what they're doing with us, it's going to be hard to go back to not using those kinds of technologies, which is what gives us a lot of interest, hopefully. And you were certainly there, Keith, at the analyst meeting. That's why we try to lay out completely what we see in terms of communicators and consumers and creative pros. And I mean the business is doing really well. We had -- we're expanding the Digital Media segment revenue for the year. We're expanding revenue. And so that's all based on what we see as demand for what we have created and the tremendous amount of innovation that's ahead of us. So I think all of those give us a lot of confidence in the fundamental nature of the growth opportunities that we're focused on. 
And since that was the last question, I mean maybe just a couple of points. I would like to, and I know a lot of you did, also publicly thank John. This was, I know for John, a very personal decision, and I'm happy that he's going to be able to focus on what's important for him, which is family and his philanthropic interest, and I'm deeply grateful. 
And on the overall business, it's hard to believe that a year has passed since the pandemic impacted the world, but I think what's really incredible is digital is not just a nice-to-have right now. It's absolutely mission-critical, and most companies would be thrilled to have one area of growth. We have 3 areas of growth: creativity, storytelling, design; what's happening with the future of work and remote work and the limitations of what you can do with in-person interaction, which will lead to more automation of digital documents and how every business in the planet is going to focus on engaging digitally with their customers, so massive opportunity. I think Q1 was a really strong quarter. We have a compelling strategy, outstanding innovation road map. 
And I really have to thank all our employees who've pivoted to work from home and executed magnificently in what have been difficult circumstances and which is why the momentum led us to increase our targets for '21. And as I always say, I think the top line and bottom line performance really set us apart as investment for people. 
But stay safe, stay healthy, and we really look forward to having you attend Summit, where we will unveil the next generation of enterprise innovation. Thank you for joining us, and I'll pass it back to Jonathan."

From students to creative professionals to small businesses to the world's largest global enterprises, digital is transforming how we work, learn and play.  
Adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is working. Fueled by our groundbreaking innovation, proven capability to create and lead categories and our expansive global customer base, our opportunity and momentum has never been greater.  
In Q2, Adobe achieved $3.84 billion in revenue, representing 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.32 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.03.  
In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in Q2 in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, achieving $2.79 billion in revenue, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $518 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 grew to $11.21 billion.  
Over the last year, we have seen the critical role creativity has played in the world. Creative Cloud is empowering everyone from the most demanding professional to the high school student to the next generation of social media creators to tell their stories. Adobe is the leader in core creative categories such as imaging, design, video and illustration, and we're expanding our leadership in exciting new media types, including screen design and prototyping, 3D and AR.  
In a world that requires anyone to be able to create from anywhere, we're building products and services for every surface and platform. Our vibrant creative communities continue to be a tremendous source of inspiration, and our goal remains to provide access to a larger and increasingly diverse set of creators and design teams, furthering our strategy of unleashing creativity for all.  
Q2 Creative Cloud performance was strong, with net new Creative Cloud ARR of $405 million and revenue of $2.32 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth. Q2 highlights include new product innovations, including updates to Lightroom, Photoshop and Illustrator, that deliver enhanced creation and collaboration capabilities and greater speed and performance. Next week, we will unveil new innovations for Substance, our 3D solution designed to improve the creation process with new tools to help assemble, style and sculpt.  
Increasing engagement and retention across offerings, including greater customer uptake of training, participation in community events and continuous product enhancements derived from insights about customer usage and value. Momentum in our Creative Cloud teams offering globally, reinforcing the growth and adoption of Creative Cloud within small and medium businesses. Strong customer acquisition in core creative and emerging categories, especially photography and video, supported by exciting marketing campaigns globally for Photoshop and Premiere, and accelerating demand for 3D&I in key verticals such as gaming, automotive, fashion and e-commerce.  
Continued growth of mobile traffic, leading to new customer acquisition of mobile offerings like Lightroom Mobile and Photoshop Express and a strong funnel for desktop applications. Strong growth for Adobe Stock with an increasingly robust content library and growing submissions that provides sustained earnings for our contributors. Global momentum with accelerated demand in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Key customer wins, including ByteDance, Netflix, Microsoft and Unity; and new partnerships to inspire the next generation of creators, including one with Netflix that gives emerging creators access to tools, resources and mentorship to bring their stories to life, and another with Khan Academy, designed to provide teachers and students in underserved communities with access to digital tools and learning resources. 
In this digital-first business environment, seamless document workflows across every device and platform are more important than ever for the modern workforce to collaborate and be productive. Document Cloud is accelerating document productivity by powering the paper to digital transformation and enabling all document actions, including editing, sharing, scanning and signing, to be frictionless across web, desktop and mobile applications. 
We delivered strong Document Cloud revenue in Q2 with net new Document Cloud ARR of $113 million, and outstanding revenue of $469 million, representing 30% year-over-year growth. 
Q2 highlights include new product innovations, including new features in Acrobat Liquid Mode that further improve accessibility on mobile devices; new Adobe Scan functionality that enables users to combine, save and store scans more efficiently; and new Sign capabilities in Acrobat to help small and medium-sized businesses improve their digital footprint with easily embeddable forms and digital payments. Strength in Acrobat across all routes to market and offerings with enterprise bookings growth up over 60% year-over-year. Accelerated demand for Sign with new Sign customers doubling year-over-year and an increasing share of Acrobat users leveraging Sign capabilities. Explosive growth in Acrobat Web services driven by significant improvements in SEO for a new set of customers. In Q2, we drove 30 million visits to frictionless PDF pages and now offer capabilities for over 20 different document verbs. Continued growth of mobile traffic, including over 110 million mobile downloads of Adobe Scan, and 1 billion scans to date and a greater than 20% year-over-year increase in Acrobat mobile app adoption. Momentum across all geographies with accelerated demand in Europe, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand, and key customer wins, including ADP, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Toyota and Wells Fargo. 
I'm thrilled to welcome back David Wadhwani, who has rejoined Adobe as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer of our Digital Media business. His impressive track record and passion for Adobe and our customers make him the ideal person to lead our Digital Media business through its next phase of growth. 
Digital transformation has become an imperative for businesses of every size and every industry. According to our recent Adobe Digital Economy Index, e-commerce spending is projected to be $4.2 trillion globally this year and reach $1 trillion in the U.S. alone in 2022. We predict that U.S. online spending on the upcoming Prime Day will surpass the $10.9 billion mark that Cyber Monday reached in 2020. Across both B2C and B2B, companies around the globe are investing in digital to deliver personalized and engaging customer experiences. 
Experience Cloud is the most comprehensive solution for content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and marketing workflow. With unified customer profiles in an open and extensible architecture, Adobe Experience Platform is the clear platform of choice for enterprises to deliver real-time personalization at scale, powering more than 17 trillion audience segment evaluations every day. 
Experience Cloud revenue was $938 million in Q2, representing 21% year-over-year growth, and subscription revenue was $817 million, representing 25% year-over-year growth. 
In April, we held our Annual Digital Experience Conference, Adobe Summit, virtually. We drove an unprecedented 20 million views of Summit content from individuals around the globe, underscoring the significant interest and demand for customer experience management. Highlights of product announcements include: Adobe Journey Optimizer, which helps marketers optimize the customer journey across outbound and inbound customer touch points; Adobe Customer Journey Analytics, which enables brands to integrate and standardize their online and offline data and is years ahead of any competitive offering; the next generation of Adobe's real-time customer data platform to help brands optimize their acquisition and engagement strategies in a first-party data world; a preview of a pioneering marketing system of record built on Workfront technology designed to manage complex marketing workflows for greater efficiency and agility; and new intelligent commerce capabilities and a strategic partnership with FedEx that will allow every small and medium business to offer expedited shipping capabilities as part of their commerce platform. 
Beyond Summit, Q2 accomplishments include: strength in core offerings, including explosive bookings growth for Adobe Experience Platform and associated services like Customer Journey Analytics and real-time CDP, which combined blew past the $100 million book of business mark in Q2; success with large multi-solution deals in transformational accounts and improving close rates across geographies, customer segments and product pillars; building the future workforce by offering college instructors and students globally free access and curriculum for Adobe Analytics, the industry-leading customer data analytics platform; continued industry analyst recognition across all customer experience management segments, including being named the leader in the Forrester Wave for enterprise marketing software suites, achieving the top spot, each of the 5x the report has been published, and leadership in the Gartner Multichannel Marketing Hubs Magic Quadrant for the fourth year in a row; and key customer wins with brands like Nike, NatWest, NTT Docomo and T-Mobile. 
We're proud of the tremendous results and momentum across our business. As we plan for a post-pandemic world, we will remain flexible as different regions recover at different times. While offices in Australia and parts of Asia have been opened for some time, and conditions in the U.S. and parts of Europe are improving, we will continue to support our employees in places like India and Brazil where the situation remains challenging. 
Over the last year, we have been building a blueprint for the future of work at Adobe, which will be hybrid and flexible. In the U.S., we will be piloting a return to our San Jose office, starting with a small group of fully vaccinated employees in July. 
We are committed to leveraging the best of in-person and digital interactions to harness what makes Adobe special, our creativity, innovation and culture, driven by our most important asset, people. 
I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and resilience during a year that was not only marked by the pandemic, but by violence and racial injustice. I'm proud of the progress we have made in advancing our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion. We have made strides in our strategy to accelerate the representation, growth and advancement of the black community. 
But as [ Juneteenth ] approaches later this week, we know we have so much left to do. As we celebrate Pride Month in June, we're honoring and spotlighting our LGBTQ+ communities, both inside and outside of Adobe. These efforts represent Adobe's long-standing commitment to supporting our diverse employee base and making an impact in the communities where we live and work, our Principal, our Cofounders, Jack Warnock and Chuck Geschke, instilled in us. 
In Q2, we lost our beloved Cofounder, Chuck Geschke. Chuck left an indelible mark on Adobe, the technology industry and the world. While we miss him tremendously, it gives me great comfort knowing that Chuck was so proud of the company that Adobe has become. 
Adobe's strong culture, revered brand, innovative product road map and the world's best employees, customers and partners position us for continued success in 2021 and beyond.

Q2 was an excellent quarter for Adobe, with strong revenue growth, enterprise bookings and Digital Experience and net new ARR in Digital Media showing how our solutions are resonating with customers of all types in an increasingly digital world. 
With our data-driven operating model, or DDOM, we continue to utilize our own Experience Cloud technology to optimize customer journeys, driving increasing amounts of traffic to adobe.com to acquire new customers and raise awareness of our products.

Deal volume was sustained throughout the quarter with several large transactions closing earlier in the quarter, contributing to our revenue performance in Q2. We continue to see broad macroeconomic recovery, including in the commercial segment, and enterprises of all sizes are investing in digital transformation. 
Business performance and Digital Experience during the quarter was driven by strong bookings for Adobe Experience Platform, or AEP, and native applications built on AEP, including real-time CDP and Customer Journey Analytics, which continue to build momentum. Recent innovations and partnerships driving awareness and adoption of our analytics, commerce and campaign solutions, continued success with our Workfront offering as we realize the value of combining a best-in-class workflow solution with our CXM offerings to create an industry-leading marketing system of record. Momentum signing up transformational multi-solution engagements with enterprise customers across geographies, and strengthening customer renewal and expansion rates. 
Savings from T&E and site operations are continuing as our employees work from home. We are investing in our facilities as we reimagine the future of work, and many of our employees return to offices and business travel during Q3. 
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $10 million, both before and after applying the net impacts from hedging.

We are pleased with the first half performance, and we expect the momentum to continue with typical Q4 strength. 
With the momentum we are seeing across creativity, digital documents and customer experience management, we're on track for another record year with a strong first half already in the books. Few companies of our scale can post 20% plus revenue growth, world-class operating margins and our recurring revenue model built for long-term growth and profitability.

In terms of the new customers who are coming on to the platform, mobile and communicators is the way we define that, Keith, are a significant portion of the new customer base. Specialists, on the other hand, as it relates to 3D&I. Acrobat, as we also mentioned, had a very strong offering. And so I would say the photography and video offerings are really targeting everybody from creative professionals to communicators, to consumers as is Acrobat, but then we're also seeing some really good adoption of Acrobat across the spectrum. 
And in our prepared remarks, the last thing I'd say is we also talked about the revival of the Teams business. And as we all know, the small and medium business segment, I think, was most impacted last year. So really pleased with it, Keith.

As things are starting to open up, we're anticipating kind of a return to some of that seasonality that we saw in the past. And so we factored that into the guide.

And right through the pandemic, we've been talking about how the interest in our Digital Experience solutions and the belief when I have conversations with CEOs across every single vertical is that the only way to engage with customers is going to be digital. And I think people are starting to recognize that, that investment is an investment that they have to pay. So first, I think from a macro perspective, it's clear that digital transformation, and within digital transformation, customer experience management is front and center as something that they want to spend money on. 
The second thing I would say is the execution against our new Experience Platform, and both John and I touched on Customer Journey Analytics and the other services that we're building on top of that. Those are clearly resonating with customers because whether you're B2B or whether you're a B2C, you have to have the ability, right, to deliver the personalized experience. So I think the second thing I would say is that the innovation that we're delivering and the fact that we have Summit and the ability to engage with these customers, certainly, I think, was an accelerant for the business. 
The third thing I would say is the ecosystem and the ability of the ecosystem to very quickly ensure that these customers derive value from the investment that we're making. I think that helps both in terms of converting bookings to revenue, but it also helps in terms of growing the book of business with enterprises. So I would speak to all 3 of them. 
I think if you look at our targets as well in terms of the over 20% revenue growth, the close to 25% subscription revenue growth that we are seeing in that business, I think we continue to be optimistic that we have the right product that clearly meets the customer need. And the execution in the company against that business has been strong."

And so when you have the kind of $80-plus billion TAM that we have, we just continue to be really optimistic about that business. 
And from my perspective, we have the largest delever that we had. And if you look at the DX business, it's about focus on transformational accounts across all deal bands as well as different segmentation of the market. We tend to think of the corporate market, commercial market and the strategic markets. We're seeing strength across those particular businesses. And as I mentioned earlier to a previous question, the ability to convert bookings into revenue and to upsell them to more. 
What we've done with the Experience Platform and the ability to have all of the new services built on that, it's really very unique in the industry because that's sort of how we look at it. And so you should expect to see again Q4 be sort of the strongest close that typically happens in enterprise software. And we're clearly on track to exceed the target for DX for the entire year when you look at our performance in the first half and our guide for Q3 and John's comment about expecting Q4 to be seasonally strong."

We're doing that across different geographies. I think the value that we provide to customers, it doesn't matter whether it's an inflationary economy or not, we continue to believe that we're deriving tremendous value for our customers. And so the conversations that happened around Adobe are around the product road map and innovation and attracting new customers way more than trying to, at this point, look at price optimization. And so we have a massive TAM ahead of us. That's really the focus."

It's okay. I mean they're all good questions. And so I think first, Kash, on the $40-plus billion TAM, as you know, we have clearly transitioned the business from a Creative Cloud focused customer to just being a Creative Cloud, the communicators, the services that we've added associated with Stock photography and Sign, and I think we continue to have very exciting opportunities in terms of continuing to expand that TAM. And I think it all stems from design and creativity has never been more important, right? We talk about how it's the golden age of design and creativity. But for you as a consumer, whether you're interacting with a screen at a terminal or in a retail store or how you order something, I mean, it's all about content creation. And when you think about how much content we've all consumed in the pandemic at home, it's just gone through the roof. And we announced the partnership with Netflix and what we're doing with Khan Academy to make sure content creation is as seamless and productive. So I think that's driving it, and people love to say we want to be in the content and design business to personalize it as well as a career. So I would say that's the first thing that we're certainly seeing. 
International expansion, we've talked about how we continue to focus on international markets. And it originally started with dealing with piracy. But across the small and medium business TAM as those companies are also creating a marketplace for themselves with our content management solutions, our commerce solutions, content velocity is critical there. So I think all those are clearly tailwinds for the ever-increasing TAM. I think we increased it from $31 billion to $41 billion when we talked about it at the next FA meeting, and we'll certainly update that when we have our next. 
I think as it relates to David, I'm really excited, as I said. David played a significant role in the introduction of Creative Cloud when he was here. And I think the fact that we were able to excite him and recruit him back just, I think, speaks to the tremendous opportunity that he also sees for the business. And from my point of view, we have all of these unicorns within the Creative Cloud, and I'm looking to partner with David, whether it's expanding on our enterprise footprint, whether it's continuing to make sure that we get the opportunity around SAM -- around Sign addressed, what we are doing -- associated with the mobile offerings. I mean each one of these is a large business by itself. And having somebody of his caliber to continue to work with Scott on the product side and Abhay on the Document Cloud side, it's great to have that kind of bench when we have the kind of opportunity that we have. So hopefully, that answers the question around David as well, Kash."

A number of you I know have written to me, which I appreciate, of the impact that each one of you also felt when you interacted with Chuck. So I really have appreciated all of those comments. 
As it relates to the customer experience management question, Sterling, I think we're in the really early innings. We have some tremendous ideas ahead of us. And with [ Anil Chakravarthy ] -- I'll touch on a couple. I mean the real-time customer data platform is just really the infrastructure for every engagement that a customer has. We touched on the Journey Optimizer, which is think about optimizing the Customer Journey across outbound and inbound customer touch points both in physical and electronic, I mean, that's just a massive opportunity in terms of communicating, whether it's by e-mail, whether it's SMS, whether it's any of these new platforms that emerge. 
The Customer Journey Analytics, my perspective on Customer Journey Analytics is we used to do the fantastic job on web analytics, but this is increasingly becoming what is the analytics across all of the different online and offline data. And it's the way you run a business, and we're living proof of, when we talk about our DDOM, how we can use that. So I think the Customer Journey Analytics is also in terms of the ideas that we have on its infancy. 
And maybe the last one I'll touch on is what we've been previewing in terms of this marketing system of record and workflow. Trillions are being spent in marketing, and the process associated with rolling out those campaigns, understanding the efficacy of those campaigns, making those campaigns international, I think that all of that is really, really ahead of us in terms of what we can do. So we're very excited. 
And for all of these companies, as they have to transition with what's happening in browsers and dealing with a first-party data world or dealing with privacy concerns, all of that, frankly, is opportunities for us because we step up and enable them to engage with their customers and focus on their product offering rather than all this other stuff because we know how to do that well."

So I think you'll see more investment there. I think you'll see, certainly, as Europe and other parts of those economy open up, that will help. I think Japan -- the level of vaccination is low.

As you know, I can [indiscernible] eloquent about product stuff for a long time, but let me touch on at least the 2 ones that you did. I think as it relates to the cloud-based content management, the intent is very straightforward, which is how do you transition anybody who wishes to self-provision a cloud-based content offering. And think about it, if you're a small and medium business or if you're a large company trying to do a product campaign, you need to get a website. You need to get it localized. You need to get it up and running. You need to be able to do commerce. And so the fact that we've got this easy-to-provision cloud-based content management, which is the leader in the category, but in addition to that, as you mentioned, the APIs now, so people can actually embed these APIs that we have for our content management solution directly in. So we're very excited about that. We mentioned last quarter it saw significant adoption. And so I think that will continue to be a driver for the business. 
I think as it relates to your other question around what we are doing on the content stack, we've always mentioned that, for us, content and data, the 2 areas where we differentiate ourselves, the asset management problem is still a problem where we have a significant amount of innovation that we're continuing to deliver. And so -- but we're really excited. I mean net-net, I think Anil and the product team on the DX side have outlined a number of initiatives. Other companies talk about a lot of the stuff, but they don't have their products integrated. They don't have the ability to seamlessly provision. And so I think that's where we're going to continue to focus. 
And maybe an underappreciated area, Jay, is how easy these are now to set up and provision, and for practitioners of this business, to be really able to do it. 
I think your second question is a very interesting one, which is you're absolutely right, the merchant services ecosystem that Magento has, we've actually done a really good job of building that out. I mean, certainly, companies like PayPal that we've talked about, we've talked about what we can do with Fedex. More recently, there are a number of other such initiatives that are underway, some of which we're not at liberty to talk about yet. But I think dealing with payments, dealing with shipping, dealing with working capital, a lot of interesting ideas where we're very well positioned to both deliver value as well as to monetize it."

We don't break it out after a while because it's part of so many of these large transformational deals as well as integrated into other solutions. So -- but Workfront is going really well. It's the basis for a lot of the workflow that we're doing across each of our solutions, and we're on track to beat the targets that we gave for Workfront. So I do want to say that, that went well. 
I think as it relates to the overall TAM, which was your second question, we look at it as it's $80-plus billion. So there's plenty of available, and I think a lot of legacy software is going to get rolled out. And so for us, it's not just about what the growth rate is in that market. People are going to recognize that having a modern architecture for dealing with consumer engagement is going to become a bigger and bigger imperative. And frankly, the smart companies are opening up their budgets to start to invest in it sooner rather than later, as we said, on B2B and B2C. So we're really pleased with the 20%-plus growth that we're seeing. 25 points of subscription revenue growth, we think, is really good. We want to continue to focus on subscription revenue as the true measure of that business. And I think as we continue to deliver on the innovation and product road map, I think we would hope to continue to see those growth rates even as the business grows much larger."

We go in saying, here's the use case for if you're in travel and hospitality or retail or financial services or pharma. And I would say government and health care have also become larger customers of these kinds of solutions because of the necessity for regulated industries who previously may have relied on paper to say, you know what, we need to get into the modern era and deal with electronic documents.

I think from my perspective, I'm really pleased with our performance in Q2. It was an outstanding quarter. And to the question that was asked earlier, with many parts of the world returning to some sense of normalcy, that should only be good for our business because digital is this incredible tailwind where it's just a one-way street in terms of people wanting to invest. 
We do expect, therefore, a slight seasonality associated with our business, but we definitely have an expectation of a strong finish. And if you look at our first half performance, if you look at our targets for Q3 and the belief in the seasonally strong Q4 finish, it's going to be another outstanding year where we are going to exceed a lot of the targets that we talked about, if not all, at the beginning of the year. 
We're driving bookings. We're driving revenue performance from bookings as a result of making sure people get value for it. We're driving a lot of new businesses that have become material in the company. And so the breadth of our portfolio is impressive because digital is not just a nice to have. It's become super critical. 
And as I've always said, having 3 areas of explosive growth puts us in really rarefied atmosphere. And growing 20% plus on the top line, growing the bottom line as impressively as we have with strong cash flow, I think, really demonstrates how we're driving value for our customers and value for our shareholders. 
So thank you for joining us today, and have a great summer. And with that, I'll pass it back to Jonathan."

Adobe had another outstanding quarter as the shift to a digital-first world continues to accelerate. From students to creative professionals to small businesses to the world's largest global enterprises, digital is transforming how we work, learn and play.  
Adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is working. Fueled by our groundbreaking innovation, proven capability to create and lead categories and our expansive global customer base, our opportunity and momentum has never been greater.  
In Q2, Adobe achieved $3.84 billion in revenue, representing 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.32, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.03.  
In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in Q2 in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, achieving $2.79 billion in revenue, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $518 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 grew to $11.21 billion.  
Over the last year, we have seen the critical role creativity has played in the world. Creative Cloud is empowering everyone from the most demanding professional to the high school student to the next generation of social media creators to tell their stories. Adobe is the leader in core creative categories such as imaging, design, video and illustration, and we're expanding our leadership in exciting new media types, including screen design and prototyping, 3D and AR.  
In a world that requires anyone to be able to create from anywhere, we're building products and services for every surface and platform. Our vibrant creative communities continue to be a tremendous source of inspiration, and our goal remains to provide access to a larger and increasingly diverse set of creators and design teams, furthering our strategy of unleashing creativity for all.  
Q2 Creative Cloud performance was strong, with net new Creative Cloud ARR of $405 million and revenue of $2.32 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth. Q2 highlights include new product innovations, including updates to Lightroom, Photoshop and Illustrator, that deliver enhanced creation and collaboration capabilities and greater speed and performance. Next week, we will unveil new innovations for Substance, our 3D solution designed to improve the creation process with new tools to help assemble, style and sculpt.  
Increasing engagement and retention across offerings, including greater customer uptake of training, participation in community events and continuous product enhancements derived from insights about customer usage and value. Momentum in our Creative Cloud teams offering globally, reinforcing the growth and adoption of Creative Cloud within small and medium businesses. Strong customer acquisition in core creative and emerging categories, especially photography and video, supported by exciting marketing campaigns globally for Photoshop and Premiere, and accelerating demand for 3D&I in key verticals such as gaming, automotive, fashion and e-commerce.  
Continued growth of mobile traffic, leading to new customer acquisition of mobile offerings like Lightroom Mobile and Photoshop Express and a strong funnel for desktop applications. Strong growth for Adobe Stock with an increasingly robust content library and growing submissions that provides sustained earnings for our contributors. Global momentum with accelerated demand in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Key customer wins, including ByteDance, Netflix, Microsoft and Unity; and new partnerships to inspire the next generation of creators, including one with Netflix that gives emerging creators access to tools, resources and mentorship to bring their stories to life; and another with Khan Academy, designed to provide teachers and students in underserved communities with access to digital tools and learning resources. 
In this digital-first business environment, seamless document workflows across every device and platform are more important than ever for the modern workforce to collaborate and be productive. Document Cloud is accelerating document productivity by powering the paper to digital transformation and enabling all document actions, including editing, sharing, scanning and signing, to be frictionless across web, desktop and mobile applications. 
We delivered strong Document Cloud revenue in Q2 with net new Document Cloud ARR of $113 million, and outstanding revenue of $469 million, representing 30% year-over-year growth. 
Q2 highlights include new product innovations, including new features in Acrobat Liquid Mode that further improve accessibility on mobile devices; new Adobe Scan functionality that enables users to combine, save and store scans more efficiently; and new Sign capabilities in Acrobat to help small and medium-sized businesses improve their digital footprint with easily embeddable forms and digital payments. 
Strength in Acrobat across all routes to market and offerings with enterprise bookings growth up over 60% year-over-year. Accelerated demand for Sign with new Sign customers doubling year-over-year and an increasing share of Acrobat users leveraging Sign capabilities. Explosive growth in Acrobat Web services, driven by significant improvements in SEO for a new set of customers. In Q2, we drove 30 million visits to frictionless PDF pages and now offer capabilities for over 20 different document verbs. Continued growth of mobile traffic, including over 110 million mobile downloads of Adobe Scan and 1 billion scans to date and a greater than 20% year-over-year increase in Acrobat mobile app adoption. Momentum across all geographies with accelerated demand in Europe, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand; and key customer wins, including ADP, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Toyota and Wells Fargo. 
I'm thrilled to welcome back David Wadhwani, who has rejoined Adobe as Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer of our Digital Media business. His impressive track record and passion for Adobe and our customers make him the ideal person to lead our Digital Media business through its next phase of growth. 
Digital transformation has become an imperative for businesses of every size and every industry. According to our recent Adobe Digital Economy Index, e-commerce spending is projected to be $4.2 trillion globally this year and reach $1 trillion in the U.S. alone in 2022. We predict that U.S. online spending on the upcoming Prime Day will surpass the $10.9 billion mark that Cyber Monday reached in 2020. Across both B2C and B2B, companies around the globe are investing in digital to deliver personalized and engaging customer experiences. 
Experience Cloud is the most comprehensive solution for content and commerce, data insights and audiences, customer journeys and marketing workflow. With unified customer profiles in an open and extensible architecture, Adobe Experience Platform is the clear platform of choice for enterprises to deliver real-time personalization at scale, powering more than 17 trillion audience segment evaluations every day. 
Experience Cloud revenue was $938 million in Q2, representing 21% year-over-year growth, and subscription revenue was $817 million, representing 25% year-over-year growth. 
In April, we held our annual Digital Experience Conference, Adobe Summit, virtually. We drove an unprecedented 20 million views of Summit content from individuals around the globe, underscoring the significant interest and demand for customer experience management. Highlights of product announcements include: Adobe Journey Optimizer, which helps marketers optimize the customer journey across outbound and inbound customer touch points; Adobe Customer Journey Analytics, which enables brands to integrate and standardize their online and off-line data and is years ahead of any competitive offering; the next generation of Adobe's real-time customer data platform to help brands optimize their acquisition and engagement strategies in a first-party data world; a preview of a pioneering marketing system of record built on Workfront technology designed to manage complex marketing workflows for greater efficiency and agility; and new intelligent commerce capabilities and a strategic partnership with FedEx that will allow every small and medium business to offer expedited shipping capabilities as part of their commerce platform. 
Beyond Summit, Q2 accomplishments include: strength in core offerings, including explosive bookings growth for Adobe Experience Platform and associated services like Customer Journey Analytics and real-time CDP, which combined blew past the $100 million book of business mark in Q2; success with large multi-solution deals in transformational accounts and improving close rates across geographies, customer segments and product pillars; building the future workforce by offering college instructors and students globally free access and curriculum for Adobe Analytics, the industry-leading customer data analytics platform; continued industry analyst recognition across all customer experience management segments, including being named the leader in the Forrester Wave for enterprise marketing software suites, achieving the top spot, each of the 5x the report has been published, and leadership in the Gartner Multichannel Marketing Hubs Magic Quadrant for the fourth year in a row; and key customer wins with brands like Nike, NatWest, NTT DoCoMo and T-Mobile. 
We're proud of the tremendous results and momentum across our business. As we plan for a post-pandemic world, we will remain flexible as different regions recover at different times. While offices in Australia and parts of Asia have been open for some time, and conditions in the U.S. and parts of Europe are improving, we will continue to support our employees in places like India and Brazil where the situation remains challenging. 
Over the last year, we have been building a blueprint for the future of work at Adobe, which will be hybrid and flexible. In the U.S., we will be piloting a return to our San Jose office, starting with a small group of fully vaccinated employees in July. 
We are committed to leveraging the best of in-person and digital interactions to harness what makes Adobe special, our creativity, innovation and culture, driven by our most important asset, people. 
I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and resilience during a year that was not only marked by the pandemic, but by violence and racial injustice. I'm proud of the progress we have made in advancing our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion. We have made strides in our strategy to accelerate the representation, growth and advancement of the black community. 
But as Juneteenth approaches later this week, we know we have so much left to do. As we celebrate Pride Month in June, we're honoring and spotlighting our LGBTQ+ communities, both inside and outside of Adobe. These efforts represent Adobe's long-standing commitment to supporting our diverse employee base and making an impact in the communities where we live and work, a principle, our Co-Founders, Jack Warnock and Chuck Geschke, instilled in us. 
In Q2, we lost our beloved Co-Founder, Chuck Geschke. Chuck left an indelible mark on Adobe, the technology industry and the world. While we miss him tremendously, it gives me great comfort knowing that Chuck was so proud of the company that Adobe has become. 
Adobe's strong culture, revered brand, innovative product road map and the world's best employees, customers and partners position us for continued success in 2021 and beyond.

Deal volume was sustained throughout the quarter with several large transactions closing earlier in the quarter, contributing to our revenue performance in Q2. We continue to see broad macroeconomic recovery, including in the commercial segment, and enterprises of all sizes are investing in digital transformation. 
Business performance in Digital Experience during the quarter was driven by strong bookings for Adobe Experience Platform, or AEP, and native applications built on AEP, including real-time CDP and Customer Journey Analytics, which continue to build momentum; recent innovations and partnerships driving awareness and adoption of our analytics, commerce and campaign solutions; continued success with our Workfront offering as we realize the value of combining a best-in-class workflow solution with our CXM offerings to create an industry-leading marketing system of record; momentum signing up transformational multi-solution engagements with enterprise customers across geographies; and strengthening customer renewal and expansion rates. 
Savings from T&E and site operations are continuing as our employees work from home. We are investing in our facilities as we reimagine the future of work, and many of our employees return to offices and business travel during Q3. 
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $10 million, both before and after applying the net impacts from hedging. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $94 million. Net of impacts from hedging, the year-over-year currency increase to revenue was $78 million.

Our trade DSO was 35 days, which compares to 40 days in the year ago quarter and 38 days last quarter. RPO grew by 23% year-over-year to $12.23 billion exiting Q2, benefiting from strong enterprise licensing during the quarter.

We currently have $15.1 billion in remaining authority, of which $100 million was granted in May 2018 and $15 billion was granted in December 2020.

We are pleased with the first half performance, and we expect the momentum to continue with typical Q4 strength. 
With the momentum we are seeing across creativity, digital documents and customer experience management, we're on track for another record year with a strong first half already in the books. Few companies of our scale can boast 20% plus revenue growth, world-class operating margins and our recurring revenue model built for long-term growth and profitability.

Specialist, on the other hand, as it relates to 3D&I. Acrobat, as we also mentioned, had a very strong offering. And so I would say the photography and video offerings are really targeting everybody from creative professionals to communicators to consumers, as is Acrobat. But then we're also seeing some really good adoption of Acrobat across the spectrum. 
And in our prepared remarks, the last thing I'd say is we also talked about the revival of the Teams business. And as we all know, the small and medium business segment, I think, was most impacted last year. So really pleased with it, Keith.

As we talked about the last couple of quarters, last year was kind of a really strange year, right? We didn't see the seasonality we typically saw because of the pandemic and everybody being locked down. As things are starting to open up, we're anticipating kind of a return to some of that seasonality that we saw in the past. And so we factored that into the guide. But we're really excited that we can actually target the highest ARR guide ever in Q3. So overall, great performance, and we can see the momentum is still in the business."

And right through the pandemic, we've been talking about how the interest in our Digital Experience solutions and the belief, when I have conversations with CEOs across every single vertical, is that the only way to engage with customers is going to be digital. And I think people are starting to recognize that, that investment is an investment that they have to pay. So first, I think from a macro perspective, it's clear that digital transformation, and within digital transformation, customer experience management is front and center as something that they want to spend money on. 
The second thing I would say is the execution against our new Experience Platform, and both John and I touched on Customer Journey Analytics and the other services that we're building on top of that. Those are clearly resonating with customers because whether you're B2B or whether you're a B2C, you have to have the ability right now to deliver the personalized experience. So I think the second thing I would say is that the innovation that we're delivering and the fact that we have Summit and the ability to engage with these customers, certainly, I think, was an accelerant for the business. 
The third thing I would say is the ecosystem and the ability of the ecosystem to very quickly ensure that these customers derive value from the investment that we're making, I think that helps both in terms of converting bookings to revenue, but it also helps in terms of growing the book of business with enterprises. So I would speak to all 3 of them. 
I think if you look at our targets as well in terms of the over 20% revenue growth, the close to 25% subscription revenue growth that we are seeing in that business, I think we continue to be optimistic that we have the right product that clearly meets the customer need. And the execution in the company against that business has been strong."

And so when you have the kind of $80-plus billion TAM that we have, we just continue to be really optimistic about that business. 
And from my perspective, we have the largest delever that we had. And if you look at the DX business, it's about focus on transformational accounts across all deal bands as well as different segmentation of the market. We tend to think of the corporate market, commercial market and the strategic markets. We're seeing strength across those particular businesses. And as I mentioned earlier to a previous question, the ability to convert bookings into revenue and to upsell them to more. 
What we've done with the Experience Platform and the ability to have all of the new services built on that, it's really very unique in the industry because that's sort of how we look at it. And so you should expect to see again Q4 be sort of the strongest close that typically happens in enterprise software.

As you know, we have clearly transitioned the business from a Creative Cloud focused customer to just being a Creative Cloud, the communicators, the services that we've added associated with Stock photography and Sign. And I think we continue to have very exciting opportunities in terms of continuing to expand that TAM. And I think it all stems from design and creativity has never been more important, right? 
We talk about how it's the golden age of design and creativity. But for you as a consumer, whether you're interacting with a screen at a terminal or in a retail store or how you order something, I mean, it's all about content creation. And when you think about how much content we've all consumed in the pandemic at home, it's just gone through the roof. And we announced the partnership with Netflix and what we're doing with Khan Academy to make sure content creation is as seamless and productive. So I think that's driving it. And people love to say we want to be in the content and design business to personalize it as well as a career. So I would say that's the first thing that we're certainly seeing. 
International expansion, we've talked about how we continue to focus on international markets. And it originally started with dealing with piracy. But across the small and medium business TAM, as those companies are also creating a marketplace for themselves with our content management solutions, our commerce solutions, content velocity is critical there. So I think all those are clearly tailwinds for the ever-increasing TAM. I think we increased it from $31 billion to $41 billion when we talked about it at the next FA meeting, and we'll certainly update that when we have our next. 
I think as it relates to David, I'm really excited, as I said. David played a significant role in the introduction of Creative Cloud when he was here. And I think the fact that we were able to excite him and recruit him back just, I think, speaks to the tremendous opportunity that he also sees for the business. And from my point of view, we have all of these unicorns within the Creative Cloud. And I'm looking to partner with David, whether it's expanding on our enterprise footprint, whether it's continuing to make sure that we get the opportunity around SAM -- around Sign addressed, what we are doing -- associated with the mobile offerings. I mean each one of these is a large business by itself. And having somebody of his caliber to continue to work with Scott on the product side and Abhay on the Document Cloud side, it's great to have that kind of bench when we have the kind of opportunity that we have. So hopefully, that answers the question around David as well, Kash."

A number of you, I know, have written to me, which I appreciate, of the impact that each one of you also felt when you interacted with Chuck. So I really have appreciated all of those comments. 
As it relates to the customer experience management question, Sterling, I think we're in the really early innings. We have some tremendous ideas ahead of us. And with Anil Chakravarthy -- I'll touch on a couple. I mean the real-time customer data platform is just really the infrastructure for every engagement that a customer has. We touched on the Journey Optimizer, which is think about optimizing the customer journey across outbound and inbound customer touch points both in physical and electronic, I mean, that's just a massive opportunity in terms of communicating, whether it's by e-mail, whether it's SMS, whether it's any of these new platforms that emerge. 
The Customer Journey Analytics. My perspective on Customer Journey Analytics is we used to do the fantastic job on web analytics, but this is increasingly becoming what is the analytics across all of the different online and off-line data. And it's the way you run a business. And we're living proof of, when we talk about our DDOM, how we can use that. So I think the Customer Journey Analytics is also, in terms of the ideas that we have, on its infancy. 
And maybe the last one I'll touch on is what we've been previewing in terms of this marketing system of record and workflow. Trillions are being spent in marketing, and the process associated with rolling out those campaigns, understanding the efficacy of those campaigns, making those campaigns international, I think that all of that is really, really ahead of us in terms of what we can do. So we're very excited. 
And for all of these companies, as they have to transition with what's happening in browsers and dealing with a first-party data world or dealing with privacy concerns, all of that, frankly, is opportunities for us because we step up and enable them to engage with their customers and focus on their product offering rather than all this other stuff because we know how to do that well."

I think we've always -- most people talk about this and think about the B2C business, Sterling, which is, yes, they understand travel and hospitality. They understand retail. They understand banking. But this is now happening where it doesn't matter what business you're in. The ability to drive from leads to revenue for a B2B business is also digital. 
I mean if you're a company in the pharma industry, and you're not able to go visit doctors and talk to them about the innovation that you're doing, it's going to move digital. So I think there's just so much on that particular front."

They're just mission-critical, irrespective of which you have. 
And so what I think we'll see is that as people come back to work, the small and medium businesses will recognize that it's an opportunity for them to engage. So I think you'll see more investment there. I think you'll see, certainly, as Europe and other parts of those economy open up, that will help. I think Japan, the level of vaccination is low. So I think as they come back to work, that's only going to lead to more optimism. And so I think when you think about consumer confidence and you think about businesses want to invest, I think both of those are only going to be helped by a return to normalcy and a return to work.

As you know, I can wax eloquent about product stuff for a long time, but let me touch on at least the 2 ones that you did. I think as it relates to the cloud-based content management, the intent is very straightforward, which is how do you transition anybody who wishes to self-provision a cloud-based content offering. And think about it, if you're a small and medium business or if you're a large company trying to do a product campaign, you need to get a website. You need to get it localized. You need to get it up and running. You need to be able to do commerce. 
And so the fact that we've got this easy-to-provision cloud-based content management, which is the leader in the category, but in addition to that, as you mentioned, the APIs now, so people can actually embed these APIs that we have for our content management solution directly in. So we're very excited about that. We mentioned last quarter that it saw significant adoption. And so I think that will continue to be a driver for the business. 
I think as it relates to your other question around what we are doing on the content stack. We've always mentioned that, for us, content and data, the 2 areas where we differentiate ourselves, the asset management problem is still a problem where we have a significant amount of innovation that we're continuing to deliver. And so -- but we're really excited. I mean net-net, I think Anil and the product team on the DX side have outlined a number of initiatives. Other companies talk about a lot of the stuff, but they don't have their products integrated. They don't have the ability to seamlessly provision. And so I think that's where we're going to continue to focus. 
And maybe an underappreciated area, Jay, is how easy these are now to set up and provision and for practitioners of this business, to be really able to do it. 
I think your second question is a very interesting one, which is you're absolutely right, the merchant services ecosystem that Magento has, we've actually done a really good job of building that out. I mean, certainly, companies like PayPal that we've talked about, we've talked about what we can do with FedEx. More recently, there are a number of other such initiatives that are underway, some of which we're not at liberty to talk about [ really ] yet. But I think dealing with payments, dealing with shipping, dealing with working capital, a lot of interesting ideas where we're very well positioned to both deliver value as well as to monetize it."

So a, was the Experience Cloud, you think, impacted more during COVID than other parts of the business? Because I'm trying to understand whether there might be a harder snapback. 
And then b, when you think about the growth potential here, Gartner comes out with some numbers that areas in the Experience Cloud are growing 15%. Your own TAM analysis that you put out suggest that the market in '23 growth is more like 25%. How do you think about the business between those 2 potential growth rates?"

It's the basis for a lot of the workflow that we're doing across each of our solutions, and we're on track to beat the targets that we gave for Workfront. So I do want to say that, that went well. 
I think as it relates to the overall TAM, which was your second question. We look at it as it's $80-plus billion, so there's plenty of available and I think a lot of legacy software is going to get rolled out. And so for us, it's not just about what the growth rate is in that market. People are going to recognize that having a modern architecture for dealing with consumer engagement is going to become a bigger and bigger imperative. And frankly, the smart companies are opening up their budgets to start to invest in it sooner rather than later, as we said, on B2B and B2C. 
So we're really pleased with the 20%-plus growth that we're seeing. 25 points of subscription revenue growth, we think, is really good. We want to continue to focus on subscription revenue as the true measure of that business. And I think as we continue to deliver on the innovation and product road map, I think we would hope to continue to see those growth rates even as the business grows much larger."

I mean, documents are the fundamental currency of modern business, and automating that only has value. And I think our team has done a good job.

We go in saying, here's the use case for if you're in travel and hospitality or retail or financial services or pharma.

We do expect, therefore, a slight seasonality associated with our business, but we definitely have an expectation of a strong finish. And if you look at our first half performance, if you look at our targets for Q3 and the belief in the seasonally strong Q4 finish, it's going to be another outstanding year where we are going to exceed a lot of the targets that we talked about, if not all, at the beginning of the year. 
We're driving bookings. We're driving revenue performance from bookings as a result of making sure people get value for it. We're driving a lot of new businesses that have become material in the company. And so the breadth of our portfolio is impressive because digital is not just a nice to have. It's become super critical.

Good afternoon. I hope you're all staying safe and healthy.
Adobe had another outstanding quarter as people across the globe continue to embrace new ways of storytelling, learning and customer engagement in a digital-first environment. This quarter, we delivered significant new product innovations, announced the exciting acquisition of Frame.io, and continue to increase customer engagement across an ever-expanding customer base. We're executing on our strategy of unleashing creativity for all, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses as reflected in our strong performance.
In Q3, Adobe achieved $3.94 billion in revenue, representing 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.52 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.11. In Q3, we drove record performance in our Digital Media business, achieving $2.87 billion in revenue, representing 23% year-over-year growth. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $455 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $11.67 billion.
Creativity has always played a central role in the human experience. Over the last year, we have all witnessed the way creativity has sustained us. We've shared photographs with loved ones on different continents, taught our classes to students at their kitchen tables, and launched entirely new businesses online. Building on decades of leadership, Adobe continues to pave the way in core creative categories, including photography and design while pushing the boundaries across a wide range of emerging categories such as AR and 3D.
Whether it's the latest binge-worthy streaming Plus series, a social media video that sparks a movement or a corporate video, creation and consumption of video is experiencing explosive growth. In August, we announced an agreement to acquire Frame.io, a leading cloud-based video collaboration platform. Video editing is rarely a solo activity, and it's traditionally been highly inefficient. Frame.io, streamlines the video production process by enabling editors and key project stakeholders to seamlessly collaborate using cloud-first workflows. The combination of our leading video editing offerings, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects, with Frame.io's cloud-based review and approval functionality will radically accelerate the creative process and deliver an end-to-end video platform.
The addition of Frame.io, creates an opportunity for Adobe in conjunction with the partner ecosystem to expand beyond video editors to a broader set of customers, teams and enterprises. We hope to close the Frame.io transaction in Q4 and look forward to welcoming the team to Adobe.
Next month, we'll host Adobe MAX, the world's largest creativity conference. MAX has always been the place to be inspired, connect with the creative community and experience the latest creative cloud innovations. Our programming will feature iconic speakers, including Oscar-winning writer, director, producer Cloisteldas Winton, and SNL Star and executive producer, Kenon Thompson. This year's fully digital experience allows us to expand our reach and engage with more people across our global creative community than ever before. MAX will be hosted on Adobe's customed digital event platform built on Adobe Experience Cloud.
In Q3, we achieved Creative revenue of $2.37 billion with strong new user acquisition, engagement and renewal across all creative products and geographies with particular strength in our Creative Cloud for Teams offering. Q3 Creative Cloud highlights include innovative enhancements to our photography offerings, including new services and AI-driven capabilities in Lightroom. Creative Cloud applications now running natively on Apple's new silicon M1 chip delivering a boost in performance. The release of Adobe Substance 3D collection, a suite of interoperable tools and services that support 3D creativity. Partnerships such as the Great Untold with Netflix, enabling next-gen creators to tell their stories. And key customer wins at the Department of Education of the Philippines, Facebook, Nike, Rutgers University and the U.S. Department of the Interior.
Document Cloud is accelerating document productivity by powering the paper-to-digital revolution and enabling all document actions to be frictionless across web, desktop and mobile. From complex legal documents to sales contracts to employee welcome kits, documents are at the core of work using the power of AI with Adobe Sensei. Document Cloud is automating workflows and adding new value across all document words.
In Q3, Document Cloud achieved record revenue of $493 million, growing 31% year-over-year. Driving this performance was increased unit demand for Acrobat subscriptions globally and strength in the SMB segment. Q3 Document Cloud highlights include continued adoption of Adobe Sign and Acrobat with transactions growing over 10x in the last 3 years. Growth across Acrobat web and frictionless PDF, which optimize the customer journey and capture organic search-driven demand. Increased adoption and usage of mobile applications, including Acrobat, Scan and Sign with over 100 million monthly active users. Proliferation of liquid mode and adaptive and responsive mobile experience with over 300 million PDF files reflowed in the last year. Key customer wins at Daimler AG, FUJIFILM, Micron and PwC.
Businesses of every size across every category are investing in customer experience management. Adobe Experience Cloud is powering CXM for B2B and B2C companies with applications focused on customer journey management, data insights and audiences, content and personalization, commerce and marketing workflows. Adobe Experience Cloud empowers companies to deliver predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences across every touch point of the customer life cycle.
In the digital economy, companies are relying on digital presence and commerce as the dominant channels to drive business growth. According to the Adobe Digital Economy Index, U.S. consumers spent over $541 billion in e-commerce from January through August, 58% more than what we saw 2 years ago. In Q3, we delivered Experience Cloud revenue of $985 million, driven by strong performance across both subscription and professional services. Q3 subscription revenue was $864 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. As businesses reopen around the world, interest in Adobe CXM Solutions as an enterprise priority is resulting in increasing spend in both software and services. 
Q3 Experience Cloud highlights include: product innovations, including new personalization capabilities in Adobe Experience Cloud to help customers move from third-party cookies to first-party data strategies. Workfront momentum, reflecting the need for workflow and collaboration to deliver global campaigns and growing customer interest in our pioneering marketing system of record. Key partnerships in commerce with Walmart to integrate their omnichannel fulfillment technologies, and with PayPal to offer a robust, secure and integrated payment solution for companies of all sizes.
Continued industry analyst recognition, including being recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave Digital Experience platforms and achieving the highest score of all participating vendors for current offering. Adobe was also named a leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for personalization engines and a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for digital commerce. Strong customer adoption of Adobe Sensei-powered capabilities in Adobe Experience Cloud as over 80% of customers now rely on our AI-powered capabilities to drive data insights and optimizations. Key customer wins at Accor, the Australian government, Bertelsmann, Capital One, CVS Pharmacy, Daimler AG, Facebook, Ford Motor Company, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Honeywell, Real Madrid and the Gap. 
Adobe strength has always come from our most important asset, our people. I want to thank our 25,000 plus employees for their dedication and resilience, our customers and partners for their trust as we continue to navigate a dynamic external environment. I'm proud of the continued industry recognition we received as a great and equitable place to work. This quarter, Adobe received a 100% score on the Disability Quality Index for Best Places to Work for Disability inclusion, and we were named to People Magazine's companies that CareList for the fifth consecutive year. Last week, we held our Adobe For All Virtual Conference designed to bring employees together around our shared values of diversity, equity and inclusion.
As part of that event, we reaffirmed pay parity. We continue to pioneer opportunity parity to ensure that employees are offered equal career development and growth across all demographic groups. As part of our ongoing efforts to bring in more diverse talent, Adobe has established partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions. This new program offers a $1 million donation to schools, scholarships, internships and career readiness programs. Our goal with these deep focused partnerships is to provide opportunities for students to learn technology and creative skills. 
The health and safety of our employees remain our top priority. Our offices are slowly reopening to fully vaccinated employees on a voluntary basis. As we look ahead to the future of work at Adobe, we will remain hybrid and flexible and continue to do what's best for our employees and our business.
I'm confident that Adobe's culture of innovation, category-defining products, strong brand, and the unwavering dedication of our employees will drive our continued business success and a strong close to the fiscal year. John?"

In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 23% year-over-year growth in Q3, and we exited the quarter with $11.67 billion of Digital Media ARR. As anticipated, with regions beginning to reopen across the globe, we saw pronounced summer seasonality in Q3. This is consistent with the experience of businesses across industries, as evidenced by data from the Adobe Digital Index, which showed that June and July marked the highest consumer travel season in 2 years. This correlated with lower web traffic while individuals enjoyed their summer holidays.
We do see continued recovery in the SMB segment associated with the reopening. We achieved Creative revenue of $2.37 billion, which represents 21% year-over-year growth, and we added $348 million of net new Creative ARR. Our strong Q3 results demonstrate continued demand for our offerings and execution driven by our DDOM insights. Third quarter Creative growth drivers included strong engagement, retention and renewal across all creative products and customer segments, new user acquisition for Creative Cloud, all apps driven by global marketing campaigns. Continued recovery in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud for Teams offering, including through our reseller channel; driving subscriptions for our flagship products, including our photography and video applications on both desktop and mobile; and adoption of our 3D and immersive applications, including Adobe substance.
Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $493 million, which represents 31% year-over-year growth and we added $107 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Digital documents are essential to the changing nature of work, and we saw the paper-to-digital transformation continue in Q3 as Document Cloud remained our fastest-growing business. Third quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included adoption driven by the increased need to collaborate in a hybrid work environment, increasing unit demand for Acrobat subscriptions globally, strength in new licensing and renewal for our Acrobat for Teams offering in the SMB segment and continued adoption of our Acrobat web and Acrobat mobile offerings.
Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q3, we achieved revenue of $985 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $864 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. We continue to see subscription revenue acceleration in digital experience as large and midsized enterprises increased their investments in customer experience management. Business performance and digital experience during the quarter was driven by strong deal volume, including several large Adobe Experience platform deals, momentum in Adobe Commerce with strong revenue growth and new customer acquisition, merchant services growth through new strategic partnerships, increasing adoption of our work front and customer journey management offerings, strong customer retention as we focus relentlessly on value realization for our customers and demand for Adobe's professional services.
Operating expenses increased in Q3 as we continued to make strategic investments and increase headcount. We began to reopen our facilities and return to moderate levels of business travel. The majority of our employees continue to work from home, while the return to business travel is expected to ramp slowly, and we expect to further ramp our hiring in Q4.
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, the impact of FX net of accounting for hedging activities cause sequential currency increase to revenue of $10 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, the impact of FX net of accounting for hedging activities caused a currency increase to revenue of $80 million.
Adobe's effective tax rate in Q3 was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. The sequential reduction in our GAAP tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in U.S. tax accrued on foreign earnings and tax benefits associated with share-based payments.
Our trade DSO was 36 days, which compares to 37 days in the year ago quarter and 35 days last quarter. RPO grew by 22% year-over-year to $12.63 billion exiting Q3, benefiting from strong enterprise licensing during the quarter. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $6.16 billion. Cash flows from operations in Q3 were $1.42 billion, sequentially down from Q2 due to increases in prepaid expenses, income tax payments and a decrease in accrued expenses.
We repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $1 billion. We currently have $14.1 billion remaining of our $15 billion authority granted in December 2020, which goes through 2024. The following Q4 targets factor current macroeconomic conditions and typical year-end seasonal strength, including an expected increase in back-to-school spending and year-end enterprise licensing strength. Total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.07 billion, Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20% year-over-year, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $550 million, Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 22% year-over-year. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year, tax rate of approximately 17% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. Share count of approximately 480 million shares. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.52 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.18.
Given Adobe's year-to-date performance and our Q4 targets, we are clearly on track to exceed our updated annual targets for fiscal 2021 provided in March. With the massive opportunities across creativity, digital documents and customer experience management, we continue to invest and drive strong business results.

And then separately, what you're seeing in the enterprise adoption, particularly around AEP and on the CDP front that's driving some of the really strong guidance there."

So first, on your DME question as it related to the ARR, overall, we were really pleased. And I think it really speaks to the strength of our DDOM and the insights that we get associated with the business. I think going into the quarter, we had expected that the consumer with a little bit more return to normalcy, as was happening in the environment. Now this may have been a little prior to the Delta variant that we expected travel to increase and therefore, as a result, as summer seasonality and summer holidays was really sort of a 2-year time off from what they had to do. So as expected, we saw a little bit of less web traffic on that particular front.
The SMB was a highlight for us. The SMB which was impacted a little bit more. We are continuing to see strengths associated with the SMB. And to your point about the guide, I mean, I think our optimism and the relevance of our products and what's happening with digital as a tailwind really leads us to guide, as you pointed out, to 550, which would be the largest ever guide that we've given for Q4. And if you take a step back relative to the approximately 1,750 ARR guide that we had given at the beginning of the year, of the $1.8 billion that we've given in March, we're going to exceed easily all of those numbers. 
So as it relates to individual categories. Imaging continues to do really well. Video continues to do well. The Acrobat business, which is reflected both in the Creative Cloud and the Document Cloud is doing well. MAX is going to be an exciting. So net-net, I would say that the growth prospects for that particular business and the growth drivers remain intact. But again, very much in line, and this is what we feel good about the insights that we're getting on the business. So that's to answer your question on DME. And again, remember, we have a seasonally strong quarter in Q4 for DME. The enterprise deals tend to be a Q4. We also see education start to ramp up in Q4. So that hopefully gives you some color as to what happened in Q3 and what we expect in Q4. 
And on the DX side, to your second question, really pleased with what we saw in the adoption of the Adobe Experience platform and the applications. On top of that, the Adobe Journey Optimizer, the customer journey analytics continue to see strength. I think we're very unique and differentiated in the platform that we have, the real-time nature of what we are doing with personalization. And again, there, I think if last year, there was a lot of interest in that particular digital transformation and customer experience management, I think people recognize that this needs to be an enterprise spend priority for all of the businesses, irrespective of size, which is why both in terms of the Q3 performance as well as the Q4 targets. We continue to think that digital experience will also do well. So hopefully, that gives you color on both, Alex."

And so I think everybody started with a website, everybody started with the analytics. But I think where we've delivered the Adobe Experience platform and what we are talking about our personalization, I think that's a key differentiator. And whether you're a B2B company or a B2C company, you just have to invest in this particular business. And I think the team has done a particularly good job, both of messaging in different industries. The health care industry, for example, continues to do well, and there's more interest associated with that. The consumer businesses are starting to see a little bit of a come back as there's a little bit more normalcy. And so a lot of them, we're going after existing customers. We're going after new logos and selling more. But I would say the strength of the experience platform, the ability to have these profiles, the behavioral data that we're collecting in real time, the marketing message associated with telling them that they really need to focus on getting their first-party data to be an asset that they could put on their balance sheet and the nature of what's happening with digital commerce. I think all of those are trends. And then we win the deals because of the strength of our offering and the fact that we're really pure-play marketing that is significantly differentiated relative to anybody else."

And in many ways, it's the blue both to enable if you have people, technology and processes, it's helping with the processes part. But the promise of what we've also said there in terms of this pioneering marketing system of record, that's another area for the interest. And I think this was always a great company.

I think what Anil and the team has done of really focusing on marketing workflows and solving it for all of the different personas, that's definitely resonating.

Secondarily, with Frame I/O, just for clarification, is that in the forward ARR guide? Or is that included in the $550 million for Q4? And then perhaps more broadly, just on M&A strategy. The last 2 big deals seem to have a common thread in terms of collaboration. Is that just a sell-side analyst putting together 2 data points and draw on the trend line?

First, I think as it relates to Workfront, we're very clearly targeting a need that exists. And we had originally, I think, said something like Workfront would do 140 or 150 in revenue for FY '21. And then I think we've said that it's on track to significantly beat that, and that continues to be the case. As we do these larger deals, Keith, we don't break out Workfront. And so that's the way we think about the business. But Workfront is definitely appealing to that. 
Your second question as it relates to Frame.io, No, it is not in the ARR guide. I mean, clearly, until we close the deal, we would not. And so when that happens, as we said, we expect that to happen in Q4, we'll certainly update you on what that happens as it relates to Frame, but we're excited about that.
And your third question as it relates to collaboration as a team, it's part of what we've been talking about for a while, if you remember, what we've done with XD in terms of being able to do live editing. I think what we've done with the multi-surface applications where our applications run on mobile devices or iPads or tablets as well as desktops. It's just one of those themes that people are working from different locations. People are increasingly working with people. And so I think we have the ability to really provide value for our existing customers and attract new customers. 
I think with Frame, in particular, we're excited because it expands dramatically, the potential of the number of people who will become participants in the video workflow. And if they become, I hope you like the videos that we played at the beginning of the earnings call. And it's -- all of that stuff is being done remotely. And so we're pleased. And as you know, we're always thoughtful, Keith, about the acquisitions and making sure it's a case where we can bring significant value both to our shareholders and to our customers."

We had indicated that with the more of a reopening across different regions, we would start to see our facilities come online. Our business travel come back and certainly continue our hiring ramp. With the Delta variant probably slowed that down a little bit, and so that contributed to the margin expansion you saw in Q3. But overall, it was an outstanding quarter for all of our businesses. And what we've said is the long road, the path to margin expansion is related to revenue growth, given the leverage in our model. And after the contributions from the revenue performance in the quarter, continued expense savings that I just talked about, that contributed overall to the performance. But we expect those expenses to come back in a Phase III entry now, maybe a little slower than we originally thought when we talked about the second half. But that being said, when I think about our original targets in December, it implied margin expansion. When we did our updated targets in Q1, it was even larger margin expansion from what we saw. But we're executing against these huge market opportunities, and we'll continue to do that with an eye on continued top line growth, such as area that Shantanu explained, 3D and immersive Adobe Experience Platform, Sinok mobile, all of that."

The question is, can you quantify or in some way describe the business effect of that combination, even going back to the old DPS days of how this neutrality does in fact help you drive business through the integration across the 2 segments. 
Relatedly, with regard to DX specifically, you'll recall that over the last number of years, the company has often referred to you're having about 4 dozen or so use cases that you were targeting for Dx.

First, I think as it relates to your question around the integration between the clouds, as you know, first, let's even talk about Acrobat, right? Because so much of the Acrobat business is reflected both in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. And so that's one very tangible example of how we've integrated the clouds. I think taking a step back, the area that I would say is of the most interest to customers right now is what we have referred to in the past also as content velocity, which is people are creating more digital assets. They're spending more on content and how they both ensure that all of that content seamlessly is distributed, whether it's a marketing campaign, whether it's something that goes on a mobile application, whether it's something that goes on the website. And so I think that's the hard problem that we've been able to help facilitate for our customers, which is creating all of this content and making sure that it's the delivery is accelerated through marketing campaigns is an area of real integration between DME as well as DX. And where that shows up also in the revenue is the continued growth of AEM and AEM assets specifically because that's where the assets are really flowing between these 2 solutions. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the flavor. I think to the earlier questions that Gregg and others and Kirk had asked. I mean it also on the workflow, that's when people are looking at it and saying, ""Wow, if my freelancers have created content, how is that now being reflected in the DX."" So that's what I would answer your first question.
I think as it relates to the DX use cases, and we should certainly do an update, it's increased very dramatically. And the ones that I would say maybe as a highlight is the B2B use cases, the number of large B2B companies that are coming to us and saying, ""Hey, we recognize that whether it's for lead generation, whether it's for identification of customers, whether it's for even doing commerce, that's been a fairly big driver. I would say regulated industries, which if the original push around customer experience management was B2C and consumer-based companies. Now I think you're seeing way more of those workflows and use cases in regulated industries. So that's another one that I would do. 
I would say the global aspect of this, which is you have companies, whether you're an automotive company or you're a fast food company and you want to do this globally. I think that's a use case that we've seen a fairly dramatic increase. But -- so hopefully, that gives you one. And then this is where the partner ecosystem, candidly, also is driving so much more. And so the partner ecosystem is also building a lot of their value-added solutions on top of our horizontal platform. So net, I would say, it doesn't matter what business you are, what size you are, part of DX is relevant to what you need to do in order to engage with your customers."

As we said, I think when you look at the individual offerings that we have across Creative and Document Cloud, we just saw a little bit lower traffic there, but that's associated with, we believe, with individuals enjoying our holidays and it's pretty indicative using our own Adobe Digital Index data that showed that June and July were the highest travel months in 2 years. So I think that seasonality is hitting it a little bit. But again, we've got such a strong presence in both institutions, educational, government and enterprises on Document Cloud that we still see great growth and strength and it's demonstrated in just the continued growth of that business, which is our fastest-growing business right now."

I mean, I think the Creative has always been a segment that looks to us to deliver mission-critical products that enable them to make a livelihood. But the halo effect of that when you look at what we talk about at our analyst meetings and how big our communicator business already is as well as the outreach of that even into the consumer business. But stay tuned on that front, I think as we talk about our product road map and the excitement that we have to fulfill this vision of creativity for all, and target a broader and broader and broader set of customers with some great solutions using our artificial intelligence and Sensei technology. We have some very exciting things underway that will start to be served to customers. So very excited about that opportunity. It's a big opportunity.
It's already a big business for us. I mean when we talk about the fact that we're adding over $0.5 billion of net new ARR as our expectation for Q4. A significant portion of that is also going to what you would call communicators or prosumers and we're going to be delivering more and more really phenomenal products targeted at that customer segment."

And I'm curious to get your thoughts on the total available market that is new and incremental to Adobe's Creative business as a result of the acquisition that you made of Frame. And particularly, you used the word dramatically expands the scope of what you can do, meaning collaborators in addition to content creators. Can you just talk about what you meant by that? If you could just put a finer point. This does mean that the grade of TAM will be larger than what Wall Street thinks which has always been the case for the past 10 years or so. 
And secondly, not that it's a negative, but with the seasonal pattern in summer, showing some side of activity or people but on vacations, et cetera. Is there at all any risk that digital transformation takes a bit of a back seat as we go shopping not online, but we go to stores. Therefore, e-commerce activity might actually slow down a little, but the secular trend is still pretty solid in terms of adjustment are we in for some adjustment or maybe not, but I just want to get your thoughts on that."

I mean as it relates to your first question around video, I think we've been signaling for a while that video is really one of the exciting expansion opportunities for us and that's really played out. It's played out from the products that we've delivered, Premiere and After Effects continuing to be the leaders in that category, certainly Photoshop and Illustrator used a lot. But if you look at what's happening with all these streaming plus services, right? I mean, there isn't a company that isn't delivering a streaming plus service. And so I think the insatiable demand for video among consumers is only requiring more and more companies to have these streaming services and deliver more genre as it relates to video. All of that work right now. I mean, we talked a little bit of what we are doing as a partnership with Netflix as well. All of that is happening now with people in different locations through a collaborative process. So any time you can take a creative idea and make that happen quicker, faster to the right audience, that's only going to be incredibly valuable to our customers. And so I think that trend is only going to continue. And so we feel really good about what's happening in that particular space with video frame. We used to use Frame a bunch in the production of our own videos. And it's been exciting as we've talked to different people who, after the acquisition of Frame have come and said, ""Hey, Adobe, that's such a great product, but we think we can do more with it."" So I think that gives us a lot of optimism around whether it's the scrip writer, whether it's the reviewer of that, whether it's a creative agency, just being able to -- or all the corporate videos that's being done. And so certainly, I think as you add that as an enterprise product as well, you can certainly get a lot more TAM associated with it. We will update our TAMs, Kash, as we typically do. I think Jonathan referred or we'll talk about how we do our Q4 as well as our 2022, and we'll talk to you about TAMs on that front. But really excited about that. I think the external partnerships that exist for Frame and how it's plugged in, not just to the Adobe solutions, but other solutions is also an area of strength.
And I think to your second question around shopping and online, when we look at our DX business and the success that we had in Q3, I mean, a big part of that is more and more companies are certainly doing the multichannel, omnichannel, whatever they want to call it. And I think that's only going to continue to be a driver of our digital experience solutions because today, that's stable stakes. And so we just look at it and say, whether you're shopping in store or whether you're shopping online, you need a solution that treats you like a customer that we know of. And so I think that's going to only be an imperative for companies. I mean 1 thing we should have probably talked about also is if you look at our Q3 results, I mean, they were stronger than what we had said. There were a couple of nonrecurring items as part of that. And some of that actually had to do with usage in commerce. And so we are seeing that usage also ramp up. So I just wanted to get that also out there as we talk about the shopping online and shopping in a store.
And in terms of the demand for our DME solutions, we expect, as we said, the seasonal Q4 will be the strength. And as education comes back and there's more and more end of quarter activity, not just within Adobe but all companies, that's going to lead to increased demand and acceleration."

It's always going to give us this opportunity to drive healthy subscription growth. The DLA are not going to give us outsized revenue in Q4, it's going to be a sizable contribution, but we're driving subscriptions. And that's the strategy. And we do still have customers that buy perpetual, and so there'll be some fluctuations in that."

But I think it's just the amount of content that people are creating is increasing. And when the amount of content that people are creating, then content management becomes an important issue, workflow becomes an important issue and standardization of the products. And one of the things we did really well is what we call our named user deployment, and how when we have these enterprise licensing agreements, we offer enterprises the ability to download and distribute within the companies and the more we do training and evangelism of the products, that leads to adoption. So I would say there's an element of standardization, there's an element of more content. I mean, even if you're a public sector company right now, I mean, what you transact online, is becoming dramatically greater than it's ever been because the physical presence is seeing a cutback as a result of what's happened in the pandemic. So I think all of those are macro trends that are going to continue, but we've also done a really good job of actively making sure we evangelize what these solutions are good for. We do more training within these enterprises. We allow these named user deployments, as I said, which then leads to true-ups and the ability to get them into a higher band. So I think the execution on the sales front associated with going into these enterprises, that's getting better and better."

We've got billions of profiles. And so I think a lot of other companies are talking about how they take something that may be in a record somewhere and do things with it. But for us, it's the activation of that data. And that's where I think most people are really excited about what Adobe has to offer.
And the other thing that I think has really happened is people recognize that they have to get control of their first-party data. I think a lot of interest used to exist about customer acquisition and third-party data. But I think right now, it's about do we have even control of our first-party data? Do we have control of our behavioral and what is happening on multiple channels. And the fact that, that can be very easily answered as it relates to what we have done with the Adobe Experience Platform. And last but not least, I mean, remember, we're the only company that can go in and say, ""Hey, we have a B2B business and a B2C business.

Good afternoon. I hope you're all staying safe and healthy.
Adobe had another outstanding quarter as people across the globe continue to embrace new ways of storytelling, learning and customer engagement in a digital-first environment. This quarter, we delivered significant new product innovations, announced the exciting acquisition of Frame.io and continued to increase customer engagement across an ever-expanding customer base. We're executing on our strategy of unleashing creativity for all, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses as reflected in our strong performance. 
In Q3, Adobe achieved $3.94 billion in revenue, representing 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.52 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.11. In Q3, we drove record performance in our Digital Media business, achieving $2.87 billion in revenue, representing 23% year-over-year growth. Net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $455 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $11.67 billion. 
Creativity has always played a central role in the human experience. Over the last year, we have all witnessed the way creativity has sustained us. We've shared photographs with loved ones on different continents, taught our classes to students at their kitchen tables and launched entirely new businesses online. Building on decades of leadership, Adobe continues to pave the way in core creative categories, including photography and design, while pushing the boundaries across a wide range of emerging categories such as AR and 3D. 
Whether it's the latest binge-worthy streaming+ series, a social media video that sparks a movement or a corporate video, creation and consumption of video is experiencing explosive growth. In August, we announced an agreement to acquire Frame.io, a leading cloud-based video collaboration platform. Video editing is rarely a solo activity, and it's traditionally been highly inefficient. Frame.io streamlines the video production process by enabling editors and key project stakeholders to seamlessly collaborate using cloud-first workflows. 
The combination of our leading video editing offerings, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects, with Frame.io's cloud-based review and approval functionality will radically accelerate the creative process and deliver an end-to-end video platform. The addition of Frame.io creates an opportunity for Adobe in conjunction with the partner ecosystem to expand beyond video editors to a broader set of customers, teams and enterprises. We hope to close the Frame.io transaction in Q4 and look forward to welcoming the team to Adobe. 
Next month, we'll host Adobe MAX, the world's largest creativity conference. MAX has always been the place to be inspired, connect with the creative community and experience the latest Creative Cloud innovations. Our programming will feature iconic speakers, including Oscar-winning writer, director, producer Chloe Zhao, actress Tilda Swinton and SNL star and executive producer Kenan Thompson. This year's fully digital experience allows us to expand our reach and engage with more people across our global creative community than ever before. MAX will be hosted on Adobe's custom digital event platform built on Adobe Experience Cloud. 
In Q3, we achieved Creative revenue of $2.37 billion with strong new user acquisition, engagement and renewal across all Creative products and geographies with particular strength in our Creative Cloud for Teams offering. Q3 Creative Cloud highlights include innovative enhancements to our photography offerings, including new services and AI-driven capabilities in Lightroom; Creative Cloud applications now running natively on Apple's new silicon M1 chip, delivering a boost in performance; the release of Adobe Substance 3D Collection, a suite of interoperable tools and services that support 3D creativity; partnerships such as The Great Untold with Netflix, enabling next-gen creators to tell their stories; and key customer wins at the Department of Education of the Philippines, Facebook, Nike, Rutgers University and the U.S. Department of the Interior. 
Document Cloud is accelerating document productivity by powering the paper-to-digital revolution and enabling all document actions to be frictionless across web, desktop and mobile. From complex legal documents to sales contracts to employee welcome kits, documents are at the core of work. Using the power of AI with Adobe Sensei, Document Cloud is automating workflows and adding new value across all document verbs. 
In Q3, Document Cloud achieved record revenue of $493 million, growing 31% year-over-year. Driving this performance was increased unit demand for Acrobat subscriptions globally and strength in the SMB segment. Q3 Document Cloud highlights include continued adoption of Adobe Sign in Acrobat with transactions growing over 10x in the last 3 years; growth across Acrobat web and frictionless PDF, which optimize the customer journey and capture organic search-driven demand; increased adoption and usage of mobile applications, including Acrobat, Scan and Sign, with over 100 million monthly active users; proliferation of Liquid Mode, an adaptive and responsive mobile experience with over 300 million PDF files reflowed in the last year; key customer wins at Daimler AG, Fujifilm, Micron and PwC.
Businesses of every size across every category are investing in customer experience management. Adobe Experience Cloud is powering CXM for B2B and B2C companies with applications focused on customer journey management, data insights and audiences, content and personalization, commerce and marketing workflows. Adobe Experience Cloud empowers companies to deliver predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences across every touch point of the customer life cycle. 
In the digital economy, companies are relying on digital presence and commerce as the dominant channels to drive business growth. According to the Adobe Digital Economy Index, U.S. consumers spent over $541 billion in e-commerce from January through August, 58% more than what we saw 2 years ago. 
In Q3, we delivered Experience Cloud revenue of $985 million, driven by strong performance across both subscription and professional services. Q3 subscription revenue was $864 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. As businesses reopen around the world, interest in Adobe CXM solutions as an enterprise priority is resulting in increasing spend in both software and services.
Q3 Experience Cloud highlights include product innovations, including new personalization capabilities in Adobe Experience Cloud to help customers move from third-party cookies to first-party data strategies; Workfront momentum, reflecting the need for workflow and collaboration to deliver global campaigns and growing customer interest in a pioneering marketing system of record; key partnerships in commerce with Walmart to integrate their omnichannel fulfillment technologies and with PayPal to offer a robust, secure and integrated payment solution for companies of all sizes; continued industry analyst recognition, including being recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave: Digital Experience Platforms and achieving the highest score of all participating vendors for Current Offering, Adobe was also named a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Personalization Engines and a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Commerce; strong customer adoption of Adobe Sensei-powered capabilities in Adobe Experience Cloud as over 80% of customers now rely on our AI-powered capabilities to drive data insights and optimizations; key customer wins at Accor, the Australian government, Bertelsmann, Capital One, CVS Pharmacy, Daimler AG, Facebook, Ford Motor Company, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Honeywell, Real Madrid and The Gap.
Adobe's strength has always come from our most important asset, our people. I want to thank our 25,000-plus employees for their dedication and resilience, our customers and partners for their trust as we continue to navigate a dynamic external environment. 
I'm proud of the continued industry recognition we receive as a great and equitable place to work. This quarter, Adobe received a 100% score on the Disability Quality Index for Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, and we were named to People Magazine's Companies That Care List for the fifth consecutive year. 
Last week, we held our Adobe For All virtual conference designed to bring employees together around our shared values of diversity, equity and inclusion. As part of that event, we reaffirmed pay parity. We continue to pioneer opportunity parity to ensure that employees are offered equal career development and growth across all demographic groups. 
As part of our ongoing efforts to bring in more diverse talent, Adobe has established partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-serving Institutions. This new program offers $1 million donation to schools, scholarships, internships and career readiness programs. Our goal with these deep, focused partnerships is to provide opportunities for students to learn technology and creative skills.
The health and safety of our employees remain our top priority. Our offices are slowly reopening to fully vaccinated employees on a voluntary basis. As we look ahead to the future of work at Adobe, we will remain hybrid and flexible and continue to do what's best for our employees and our business. 
I'm confident that Adobe's culture of innovation, category-defining products, strong brand and the unwavering dedication of our employees will drive our continued business success and a strong close to the fiscal year. John?"

Our financial results feature strong growth across revenue, Digital Media ARR, Digital Experience subscription revenue, RPO and EPS, demonstrating the power of our category-defining offerings.
In a digital-first world, Adobe's market opportunity is larger than ever, and we are investing for sustained growth through product innovation and by driving awareness and demand for our products with customers of all sizes. With our data-driven operating model, or DDOM, we continue to leverage our Experience Cloud technology to create personalized experiences for our customers in real time, driving traffic to adobe.com and app stores to acquire new customers. 
As a result, in Q3, Adobe achieved record revenue of $3.94 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. Business and financial highlights included GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.52 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.11; Digital Media revenue of $2.87 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of $455 million; Digital Experience revenue of $985 million; cash flows from operations of $1.42 billion; RPO of $12.63 billion exiting the quarter; and repurchasing approximately 1.7 million shares of our stock during the quarter.
In our Digital Media segment, we achieved 23% year-over-year growth in Q3, and we exited the quarter with $11.67 billion of Digital Media ARR. As anticipated, with regions beginning to reopen across the globe, we saw pronounced summer seasonality in Q3. This is consistent with the experience of businesses across industries, as evidenced by data from the Adobe Digital Index, which showed that June and July marked the highest consumer travel season in 2 years. This correlated with lower web traffic while individuals enjoyed their summer holidays. We do see continued recovery in the SMB segment associated with the reopening. 
We achieved Creative revenue of $2.37 billion, which represents 21% year-over-year growth, and we added $348 million of net new Creative ARR. Our strong Q3 results demonstrate continued demand for our offerings and execution driven by our DDOM insights. Third quarter Creative growth drivers included strong engagement, retention and renewal across all creative products and customer segments; new user acquisition for Creative Cloud All Apps driven by global marketing campaigns; continued recovery in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud for Teams offering, including through our reseller channel; driving subscriptions for our flagship products, including our photography and video applications on both desktop and mobile; and adoption of our 3D and immersive applications, including Adobe Substance. 
Adobe achieved Document Cloud revenue of $493 million, which represents 31% year-over-year growth, and we added $107 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter. Digital documents are essential to the changing nature of work, and we saw the paper-to-digital transformation continue in Q3 as Document Cloud remained our fastest-growing business. Third quarter Document Cloud growth drivers included adoption of Sign in Acrobat driven by the increased need to collaborate in a hybrid work environment; increasing unit demand for Acrobat subscriptions globally; strength in new licensing and renewal for our Acrobat for Teams offering in the SMB segment; and continued adoption of our Acrobat web and Acrobat mobile offerings. 
Turning to our Digital Experience segment. In Q3, we achieved revenue of $985 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $864 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. We continue to see subscription revenue acceleration in Digital Experience as large and midsized enterprises increase their investments in customer experience management. Business performance in Digital Experience during the quarter was driven by strong deal volume, including several large Adobe Experience Platform deals; momentum in Adobe Commerce with strong revenue growth and new customer acquisition; merchant services growth through new strategic partnerships; increasing adoption of our Workfront and Customer Journey Management offerings; strong customer retention as we focus relentlessly on value realization for our customers; and demand for Adobe's professional services. 
Operating expenses increased in Q3 as we continued to make strategic investments and increase headcount. We began to reopen our facilities and return to moderate levels of business travel. The majority of our employees continue to work from home, while the return to business travel is expected to ramp slowly. And we expect to further ramp our hiring in Q4. 
From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, the impact of FX net of accounting for hedging activities caused a sequential currency increase to revenue of $10 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, the impact of FX net of accounting for hedging activities caused a currency increase to revenue of $80 million. 
Adobe's effective tax rate in Q3 was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. The sequential reduction in our GAAP tax rate is primarily due to a decrease in U.S. tax accrued on foreign earnings and tax benefits associated with share-based payments. 
Our trade DSO was 36 days, which compares to 37 days in the year ago quarter and 35 days last quarter. RPO grew by 22% year-over-year to $12.63 billion exiting Q3, benefiting from strong enterprise licensing during the quarter. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $6.16 billion. Cash flows from operations in Q3 were $1.42 billion, sequentially down from Q2 due to increases in prepaid expenses, income tax payments and a decrease in accrued expenses. 
We repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $1 billion. We currently have $14.1 billion remaining of our $15 billion authority granted in December 2020, which goes through 2024. 
The following Q4 targets factor current macroeconomic conditions and typical year-end seasonal strength, including an expected increase in back-to-school spending and year-end enterprise licensing strength: total Adobe revenue of approximately $4.07 billion; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20% year-over-year; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $550 million; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 22% year-over-year; Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year; tax rate of approximately 17% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 480 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.52; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.18. 
Given Adobe's year-to-date performance and our Q4 targets, we are clearly on track to exceed our updated annual targets for fiscal 2021 provided in March. With the massive opportunities across creativity, digital documents and customer experience management, we continue to invest and drive strong business results.

Because if we look at the beat versus guidance on kind of net new Digital Media ARR, look, at the same time, you had kind of the weakest beat but then the strongest guide in the last 3 years, which kind of speaks to and confirm some of the seasonality comments that you made. But can we just dive in to get a better sense of exactly what drove that for the Creative Cloud business? And then separately, what you're seeing in the enterprise adoption, particularly around AEP and on the CDP front that's driving some of the really strong guidance there."
24321,698534945,2399875,"Adobe Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2021",2021-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Adobe Inc.","Executives","Happy to do that, Alex.

So first, on your DME question as it related to the ARR, overall, we were really pleased. And I think it really speaks to the strength of our DDOM and the insights that we get associated with the business. I think going into the quarter, we had expected that -- the consumer with a little bit more return to normalcy, as was happening in the environment. Now this may have been a little prior to the Delta variant that we expected travel to increase and therefore, as a result, as summer seasonality and summer holidays was really sort of a 2-year time off from what they had to do, so as expected, we saw a little bit of less web traffic on that particular front.
The SMB was a highlight for us. The SMB, which was impacted a little bit more, we are continuing to see strengths associated with the SMB. And to your point about the guide, I mean, I think our optimism and the relevance of our products and what's happening with digital as a tailwind really leads us to guide, as you pointed out, to $550 million, which would be the largest ever guide that we've given for Q4. And if you take a step back relative to the approximately $1,750 million ARR guide that we had given at the beginning of the year or the $1.8 billion that we've given in March, we're going to exceed easily all of those numbers. 
So as it relates to individual categories, imaging continues to do really well. Video continues to do well. The Acrobat business, which is reflected both in the Creative Cloud and the Document Cloud, is doing well. MAX is going to be exciting. So net-net, I would say that the growth prospects for that particular business and the growth drivers remain intact but again, very much in line. And this is what we feel good about the insights that we're getting on the business. So that's to answer your question on DME. And again, remember, we have a seasonally strong quarter in Q4 for DME. The enterprise deals tend to be Q4. We also see education start to ramp up in Q4. So that hopefully gives you some color as to what happened in Q3 and what we expect in Q4. 
And on the DX side, to your second question, really pleased with what we saw in the adoption of the Adobe Experience Platform and the applications. On top of that, the Adobe Journey Optimizer, the Customer Journey Analytics continue to see strength. I think we're very unique and differentiated in the platform that we have, the real-time nature of what we are doing with personalization. And again, there, I think if last year there was a lot of interest in that particular digital transformation and customer experience management, I think people recognize that this needs to be an enterprise spend priority for all of the businesses irrespective of size, which is why both in terms of the Q3 performance as well as the Q4 targets, we continue to think that Digital Experience will also do well. So hopefully, that gives you color on both, Alex."

And at the end of the day, I think the macro trend that everybody is finding is that a digital presence and commerce and data and insights and analytics is absolutely sort of table stakes for anybody doing business. And so I think everybody started with a website. Everybody started with the analytics. But I think where we've delivered the Adobe Experience Platform and what we are talking about our personalization, I think that's a key differentiator. And whether you're a B2B company or a B2C company, you just have to invest in this particular business. 
And I think the team has done a particularly good job, both of messaging in different industries. The health care industry, for example, continues to do well, and there's more interest associated with that. The consumer businesses are starting to see a little bit of a comeback as there's a little bit more normalcy. And so a lot of them, we're going after existing customers. We're going after new logos and selling more. 
But I would say it's the strength of the Experience Platform, the ability to have these profiles, the behavioral data that we're collecting in real time, the marketing message associated with telling them that they really need to focus on getting their first-party data to be an asset that they could put on their balance sheet and the nature of what's happening with digital commerce. I think all of those are trends. And then we win the deals because of the strength of our offering and the fact that we're really pure-play marketing that is significantly differentiated relative to anybody else."

And how do they not only have an integrated suite of products but how do they get the workflow to be more efficient, especially as you're all working in a hybrid or working from home environment? 
So Workfront is definitely helping us. It's helping us with existing customers. It's helping us with deal sizes. And in many ways, it's the glue both to enable -- if you have people, technology and processes, it's helping with the processes part. But the promise of what we've also said there in terms of this pioneering marketing system of record, that's another area for the interest. And I think this was always a great company. I think they were looking to become more general purpose. I think what Anil and the team has done of really focusing on marketing workflows and solving it for all of the different personas, that's definitely resonating.

Secondarily, with Frame.io, just for clarification, is that in the forward ARR guide? Is that included in the $550 million for Q4? And then perhaps more broadly, just on M&A strategy. The last 2 big deals seem to have a common thread in terms of collaboration. Is that just a sell-side analyst putting together 2 data points and draw on the trend line? Or is that sort of a particular area of focus for Adobe in terms of adding to the portfolio on a go-forward basis?"

First, I think as it relates to Workfront, we're very clearly targeting a need that exists. And we had originally, I think, said something like Workfront would do $140 million or $150 million in revenue for FY '21. And then I think we've said that it's on track to significantly beat that, and that continues to be the case. As we do these larger deals, Keith, we don't break out Workfront. And so that's the way we think about the business. But Workfront is definitely appealing to that. 
Your second question as it relates to Frame.io, no, it is not in the ARR guide. I mean clearly, until we close the deal, we would not. And so when that happens -- as we said, we expect that to happen in Q4. We'll certainly update you on what that happens as it relates to Frame, but we're excited about that.
And your third question as it relates to collaboration as a team, it's part of what we've been talking about for a while. If you remember, what we've done with XD in terms of being able to do live editing, I think what we've done with the multi-surface applications where our applications run on mobile devices or iPads or tablets as well as desktops, it's just one of those themes that people are working from different locations. People are increasingly working with people. And so I think we have the ability to really provide value for our existing customers and attract new customers. 
I think with Frame, in particular, we're excited because it expands dramatically the potential of the number of people who will become participants in the video workflow. And if they become -- I hope you like the videos that we played at the beginning of the earnings call. And it's -- all of that stuff is being done remotely. And so we're pleased. And as you know, we're always thoughtful, Keith, about the acquisitions and making sure it's a case where we can bring significant value both to our shareholders and to our customers."

We had indicated that with the more of a reopening across different regions, we would start to see our facilities come online, our business travel come back and certainly continue our hiring ramp. The Delta variant probably slowed that down a little bit, and so that contributed to the margin expansion you saw in Q3. 
But overall, it was an outstanding quarter for all of our businesses. And what we've said is the long road, the path to margin expansion is really to revenue growth given the leverage in our model. And after the contributions from the revenue performance in the quarter, continued expense savings that I just talked about, that contributed overall to the performance. But we expect those expenses to come back in a phased reentry now, maybe a little slower than we originally thought when we talked about the second half. 
But that being said, when I think about our original targets in December, it implied margin expansion. When we did our updated targets in Q1, it was even larger margin expansion from what we saw. But we're executing against these huge market opportunities, and we'll continue to do that with an eye on continued top line growth, such as area that Shantanu touched on, which is 3D and immersive Adobe Experience Platform, Sign and Stock mobile, all of that."

And you'",175,"Shantanu, for you first, as I'm sure you recall over the last number of years, particularly at a conference like MAX, we've talked about the integration in many ways, the unique integration that you have between Digital Media and the DX business. And you'll recall it's gone by a certain acronym over time. The question is, can you quantify or in some way describe the business effect of that combination, even going back to the old DPS days of how this mutuality does in fact help you drive business through the integration across the 2 segments?
Relatedly, with regard to DX specifically, you'll recall that over the last number of years, the company has often referred to you're having about 4 dozen or so use cases that you were targeting for DX. And that was a number of years ago. So perhaps you could talk about how the number of targeted use cases has increased for DX in the last number of years, particularly now with the introduction of payment services and other new capabilities."

First, I think as it relates to your question around the integration between the clouds, as you know, first, let's even talk about Acrobat, right? Because so much of the Acrobat business is reflected both in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. A",526,"Sure, Jay. First, I think as it relates to your question around the integration between the clouds, as you know, first, let's even talk about Acrobat, right? Because so much of the Acrobat business is reflected both in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. And so that's one very tangible example of how we've integrated the clouds. I think taking a step back, the area that I would say is of the most interest to customers right now is what we have referred to in the past also as content velocity, which is people are creating more digital assets. They're spending more on content and how they both ensure that all of that content seamlessly is distributed, whether it's a marketing campaign, whether it's something that goes on a mobile application, whether it's something that goes on the website. 
And so I think that's the hard problem that we've been able to help facilitate for our customers, which is creating all of this content and making sure that it's -- the delivery is accelerated through marketing campaigns is an area of real integration between DME as well as DX. And where that shows up also in the revenue is the continued growth of AEM and AEM assets specifically because that's where the assets are really flowing between these 2 solutions. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the flavor. 
I think to the earlier questions that Gregg and others and Kirk had asked, I mean it's also on the workflow. That's when people are looking at it and saying, ""Wow, if my freelancers have created content, how is that now being reflected in the DX?"" So that's what I would answer your first question.
I think as it relates to the DX use cases, and we should certainly do an update, it's increased very dramatically. And the ones that I would say maybe as a highlight is the B2B use cases, the number of large B2B companies that are coming to us and saying, ""Hey, we recognize that whether it's for lead generation, whether it's for identification of customers, whether it's for even doing commerce, that's been a fairly big driver."" I would say regulated industries, which is the original push around customer experience management was B2C and consumer-based companies, now I think you're seeing way more of those workflows and use cases in regulated industries. So that's another one that I would do. 
I would say the global aspect of this, which is you have companies, whether you're an automotive company or you're a fast food company and you want to do this globally, I think that's a use case that we've seen a fairly dramatic increase. But -- so hopefully, that gives you one. And then this is where the partner ecosystem, candidly, also is driving so much more. And so the partner ecosystem is also building a lot of their value-added solutions on top of our horizontal platform. So net, I would say it doesn't matter what business you are, what size you are. Part of DX is relevant to what you need to do in order to engage with your customers."

And it's pretty indicative using our own Adobe Digital Index data that showed that June and July were the highest travel months in 2 years. 
So I think that seasonality is hitting it a little bit. But again, we've got such a strong presence in both institutions, educational, government and enterprises on Document Cloud that we still see great growth and strength. And it's demonstrated in just the continued growth of that business, which is our fastest-growing business right now."

I mean I think the Creative has always been a segment that looks to us to deliver mission-critical products that enable them to make a livelihood. But the halo effect of that when you look at what we talk about at our analyst meetings and how big our communicator business already is as well as the outreach of that even into the consumer business. But stay tuned on that front, I think, as we talk about our product road map and the excitement that we have to fulfill this vision of creativity for all and target a broader and broader and broader set of customers with some great solutions using our artificial intelligence and Sensei technology. We have some very exciting things underway that will start to be served to customers. 
So very excited about that opportunity. It's a big opportunity. It's already a big business for us. I mean when we talk about the fact that we're adding over $0.5 billion of net new ARR as our expectation for Q4, a significant portion of that is also going to what you would call communicators or prosumers. And we're going to be delivering more and more really phenomenal products targeted at that customer segment."

And I'm curious to get your thoughts on the total available market that is new and incremental to Adobe's Creative business as a result of the acquisition that you made of Frame. And particularly, you used the word dramatically expands the scope of what you can do, meaning collaborators in addition to content creators. Can you just talk about what you meant by that? If you could just put a finer point. Does this mean that the Creative TAM will be larger than what Wall Street thinks, which has always been the case for the past 10 years or so?
And secondly, not that it's a negative, but with the seasonal pattern in summer, showing some sign of activity where people went on vacations, et cetera, is there at all any risk that digital transformation takes a bit of a back seat as we go shopping not online but go to stores, therefore, e-commerce activity might actually slow down a little? But the secular trend is still pretty solid. In terms of adjustment, are we in for some adjustment? Or maybe not, but I just want to get your thoughts on that."

I mean as it relates to your first question around video, I think we've been signaling for a while that video is really one of the exciting expansion opportunities for us, and that's really played out. It's played out from the products that we've delivered, Premiere and After Effects continuing to be the leaders in that category, certainly Photoshop and Illustrator used a lot. But if you look at what's happening with all these streaming+ services, right, I mean, there isn't a company that isn't delivering a streaming+ service. And so I think the insatiable demand for video among consumers is only requiring more and more companies to have these streaming services and deliver more genre as it relates to video. 
All of that work right now -- I mean we talked a little bit of what we are doing as a partnership with Netflix as well. I mean all of that is happening now with people in different locations through a collaborative process. So any time you can take a Creative idea and make that happen quicker, faster to the right audience, that's only going to be incredibly valuable to our customers. And so I think that trend is only going to continue. And so we feel really good about what's happening in that particular space with video frame. 
We used to use Frame a bunch in the production of our own videos. And it's been exciting as we've talked to different people who after the acquisition of Frame, have come and said, ""Hey, Adobe, that's such a great product, but we think we can do more with it."" So I think that gives us a lot of optimism around whether it's the script writer, whether it's the reviewer of that, whether it's the creative agency, just being able to -- or all the corporate videos that's being done. And so certainly, I think as you add that as an enterprise product as well, you can certainly get a lot more TAM associated with it. 
We will update our TAMs, Kash, as we typically do. I think Jonathan referred -- or we'll talk about how we do our Q4 as well as our 2022, and we'll talk to you about TAMs on that front. But really excited about that. I think the external partnerships that exist for Frame and how it's plugged in not just to the Adobe solutions but other solutions is also an area of strength.
And I think to your second question around shopping and online, when we look at our DX business and the success that we had in Q3, I mean, a big part of that is more and more companies are certainly doing the multichannel, omnichannel, whatever they want to call it. And I think that's only going to continue to be a driver of our Digital Experience solutions because today, that's table stakes. And so we just look at it and say, whether you're shopping in store or whether you're shopping online, you need a solution that treats you like a customer that we know of. And so I think that's going to only be an imperative for companies. 
I mean one thing we should have probably talked about also is if you look at our Q3 results, I mean, they were stronger than what we had said. There were a couple of nonrecurring items as part of that. And some of that actually had to do with usage in commerce. And so we are seeing that usage also ramp up. So I just wanted to get that also out there as we talk about the shopping online and shopping in a store.
And in terms of the demand for our DME solutions, we expect, as we said, the seasonal Q4 will be the strength. And as education comes back and there's more and more end-of-quarter activity not just within Adobe but all companies, that's going to lead to increased demand and acceleration."

I think the strength in ARR growth, frankly, over the last over a year really has been really impressive. It's always going to give us this opportunity to drive healthy subscription growth. 
The ELAs are not going to give us outsized revenue in Q4. It's going to be a sizable contribution, but we're driving subscriptions. And that's the strategy. And we do still have customers that buy perpetual, and so there'll be some fluctuations in that."

But I think it's just the amount of content that people are creating is increasing. And when the amount of content that people are creating, then content management becomes an important issue. Workflow becomes an important issue and standardization of the products. And one of the things we did really well is what we call our named user deployment and how, when we have these enterprise licensing agreements, we offer enterprises the ability to download and distribute within the companies. And the more we do training and evangelism of the products, that leads to adoption. 
So I would say there's an element of standardization. There's an element of more content. I mean even if you're a public sector company right now, I mean, what you transact online is becoming dramatically greater than it's ever been because the physical presence is seeing a cutback as a result of what's happened in the pandemic. So I think all of those are macro trends that are going to continue, but we've also done a really good job of actively making sure we evangelize what these solutions are good for. We do more training within these enterprises. We allow these named user deployments, as I said, which then leads to true-ups and the ability to get them into a higher band. So I think the execution on the sales front associated with going into these enterprises, that's getting better and better."

We've got billions of profiles. And so I think a lot of other companies are talking about how they take something that may be in a record somewhere and do things with it. But for us, it's the activation of that data. And that's where I think most people are really excited about what Adobe has to offer.
And the other thing that I think has really happened is people recognize that they have to get control of their first-party data. I think a lot of interest used to exist about customer acquisition and third-party data. But I think right now, it's about do we have even control of our first-party data, do we have control of our behavioral and what is happening on multiple channels and the fact that, that can be very easily answered as it relates to what we have done with the Adobe Experience Platform.

We do expect a strong end of year for our business, as you saw from our targets. It's clear that we're in this unique position that we have 3 large growth opportunities ahead of us, and we're executing well against all 3 of those. And the innovation and the road map that exists across all 3 of those clouds just gives us continued optimism that we will serve our customers well, and we feel fortunate. 
I think the future of work and the fact that it's more hybrid will only continue to emphasize digital as a priority for companies of every size. And so whether that's an increase in content for personalization, whether that's more automation of digital documents and whether that's every business thing we need to understand how to do customer experience management, I believe Adobe is very uniquely positioned to drive those particular macroeconomic trends.
But thank you for joining us today. We look forward to MAX as well as the Q4 earnings call. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jonathan."

Welcome to this Virtual 2022 Financial Analyst Meeting. Adobe had another outstanding year in 2021. I'm incredibly proud of the dedication and resilience of Adobe's 25,000 employees all around the world in delivering breakthrough technologies for our customers. I'd like to start with a recap of the tremendous accomplishments we had across every dimension in 2021.
As a product geek at heart, I take immense pride in our team driving hundreds of innovations across Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Earlier this week, we introduced Creative Cloud Express to enable anyone to express their ideas simply and beautifully. Creative Cloud Express is the start of a brand-new journey, to introduce first-time creators to Adobe Creative tools while adding significant value to all of our current Creative Cloud subscribers.
I think it marks a new chapter of creation collaboration and sharing on the web and leverages the unique technology and capabilities of Adobe's flagship products. It also builds on the collaboration capabilities we debut at Max, including Illustrator and Photoshop on the web, Creative Cloud spaces and Creative Cloud Canvas.
With the addition of Frame.io, we're now incorporating review and approval functionality to deliver a powerful collaboration platform for end-to-end video collaboration. And we're continuing to add magic to our flagship applications, and we're enabling them to run natively on new hardware like Apple's M1 chip as well as Microsoft Windows Surface and Pen.
In Document Cloud, Acrobat web now supports 21 frictionless verbs create, export, extract and edit for both text and images in PDF. We've seen tremendous growth in Acrobat online as people tap our powerful free browser-based document tools to handle important tasks on the fly without the need to download any software. In addition, we made outstanding progress with PDF support within both the Chrome as well as Edge browsers.
And on the Experience Cloud platform, we extended our real-time customer data platform to B2B customers, bringing together individual and account profiles across systems to give B2B companies a single view of their customer for the very first time. We launched Adobe Journey Optimizer, harnessing over 20 years of industry-leading e-mail marketing and cross-channel campaign management expertise to empower brands to design and deliver personalized experiences across the entire customer journey in a single application.
With the new acquisition of Adobe Workfront, we're now empowering companies to optimize business outcomes by connecting creative and marketing professionals to manage all creative workflows across the entire marketing life cycle.
In addition, we've advanced our industry leadership in key areas across our portfolio. Clearly, underpinning our 3 clouds is the magic and power of Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, a significant differentiator for Adobe and an enabler to more rapid innovation.
We continued our investment in the Adobe Experience platform as the foundational platform for strong governance capabilities across our Experience Cloud business, accelerating innovations like real-time customer data platform and Adobe Journey optimizer on a global scale. We take our responsibility in the creative community very seriously. And as part of the content authenticity initiative, we published a draft specification as an open standard to combat online disinformation.
I'm amazed with the resiliency of our employees, and we pioneered all new digital event experiences with Adobe Summit and Adobe Max, extending our reach and engaging millions of people around the world.
I'm also tremendously proud of the industry recognition we continue to receive for our brand, our workplace, our culture and our practices. And just to name a few examples. We were again named Tom Riser on Interbrand's Best Global Brands list. We're named to Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, for the 21st year. People magazines companies, companies that care list for the fifth year. Fast companies, brands that matter list. And I think what's more significant for a lot of investors moving forward. The Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth year. And one that I'm particularly proud of, a 100% score for being the best place to work for disability inclusion.
When you look at our financial results, it puts us in an incredibly rare position in the industry. Not many companies can drive the top line and bottom line growth with an impressive margin the way we do, and we powered through $15 billion in 2021. And we accomplished some significant milestones in Q4, our first $1 billion digital experience revenue quarter, our first $3 billion digital media and $2 billion in cash flow, just some incredible financial statistics.
Dan Durn, our new CFO, will cover our Q4 as well as our FY '21 results in greater detail. Since he joined Adobe in October, I've really appreciated his experience and partnership, and I look forward to him sharing his perspective as well as having significant impact on Adobe's growth in the decade to come.
I'm also delighted to announce that Anil Chakravarthy and David Wadhwani have been promoted to the President of the Digital Experience and Digital Media businesses, respectively. I value their leadership and contributions and they will share more color around each of our businesses.
While 2021 was awesome. I'm actually most excited about what's to come for 2022 and beyond in the over 20 years that I've been at Adobe. We have this immense market opportunity. We have an incredible technology innovation road map and the best leadership team of any company on the planet.
And I think what we've done is provided 2022 targets that demonstrate the strength of the underlying business. Three incredibly large growing opportunities across our clouds, continued focus on execution based on the current economic climate. I think the one change that we all are experiencing is as the company scales beyond $15 billion, we also have to focus on FX expectations given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar.
But as excited as I am to talk about 2022. Today is really sharing about Adobe's tremendous growth story and how we're going to be driving the next decade of growth because that's really what underpins our growing over $200 billion addressable market opportunity.
As you'll hear throughout the day from our leadership team, our growth is anchored across these 5 key pillars, our proven track record and our focus on creating and leading categories. The ever-increasing expanding set of customers that we serve from consumers to creative pros to first-time creators to small and medium businesses to the largest enterprises in the world. Our ability to deliver incredible technology platforms that enable whole new classes of applications and accelerate our innovative cadence. The important shift we continue to make from building applications to enabling new business models apps, services, artificial intelligence and platforms that's paying dividends. And last but not least, an incredible global ecosystem of partners that spans the entire customer life cycle from experience creation and marketing to delivery and ongoing support.
And I think the message for you as investors is across every dimension, across every business, our aspirations are higher, and we're thinking bigger. There's this incredible once-in-a-lifetime expansive opportunity in front of us, and I think we're uniquely positioned to capture it.
And now to provide color on the strategy on how we're going to expand markets and categories, I'd like to welcome Ann Lewnes, who recently celebrated his 15th year at Adobe, our incredible Chief Marketing Officer, who's also taken on the additional responsibility for corporate strategy. Ann?"

Over the past 2 years, we've witnessed a profound global shift to all things digital. Everyone from students to small businesses to the largest global brands has had to make this dramatic pivot. Technology",1444,"Thank you, Shantanu, and good morning, everyone. Over the past 2 years, we've witnessed a profound global shift to all things digital. Everyone from students to small businesses to the largest global brands has had to make this dramatic pivot. Technology innovation, the proliferation of new devices and platforms and the increased desire and ability for anyone to create and deliver great digital experiences have all accelerated the move to a truly digital world, and there's no going back.
Whether it's through your phone, tablet or PC, it's easy for anyone, anywhere to create, work, learn, connect, shop, unwind and launch and grow businesses. While there continue to be massive challenges in the world, digital has also empowered us. Through the democratization of creativity, the development of rich digital experiences, the ability to work and learn from home, to shop and sell products online, or to connect with those you love, we are moving society forward. Digital has fundamentally changed everything.
According to Adobe Analytics, online spending during the 2021 holiday season is projected to be $200 billion, and total e-commerce spending is projected to reach $1 trillion in 2022. It's clear that digital is a requirement to conducting business today.
From your favorite local restaurant to Fortune 500 companies across every country and every industry, digital is powering today's businesses. Companies are automating mission-critical document processes like HR and legal, to drive increased efficiency and agility. At the same time, customers now expect rich personalized digital experiences that are relevant, engaging and consistent across any device.
It's well documented that digital-first businesses drive greater long-term growth and customer loyalty. At Adobe, our own technology has enabled us to transform into a digital-first business. Companies like Adobe are measuring every single customer interaction to understand behavior, intent and ultimately, to drive business impact. We do that by providing personalized digital experiences at scale through adobe.com across all of our digital channels and increasingly, through our products.
Digital has not only changed the way we live and work, but also how we connect with one another. Anyone can create or participate in an online community, whether it's with your family, friends, colleagues or those with whom you share interests and passions. And with the emergence of the creator economy, it's possible for enterprising content creators to build both a large following and monetize their passions, products or services.
Today, there are seemingly unlimited number of social platforms and ways to engage with one's desired audience. The ease with which you can share, promote and monetize content, products and services has enabled a whole new level of connection and commerce.
We're also finding new ways to work together even when we're apart through the proliferation of collaboration solutions like Frame.io, which we acquired in Q4.
Adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences is more important than ever before. The digital world runs on Adobe's tools and platforms. And through our unparalleled innovation, creativity, scale and advanced data-driven operating model, we are continuing to catalyze the growth of digital. Hundreds of millions of people across the globe use our products every single day, and we're impacting every aspect of society. Adobe continues to be uniquely positioned to lead in this next digital era.
Our 3 industry-leading cloud offerings are mission-critical across every geography and audience with Creative Cloud or unleashing creativity for all. Giving anyone, anywhere, the tools to express their creativity. With Document Cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. And with Experience Cloud, we're powering digital businesses of all sizes, giving them everything they need to design and deliver great customer experiences.
Underpinning our 3 clouds is the power of Adobe Sensei, our advanced AI ML framework that enables us to deliver a steady stream of unparalleled innovation.
Over the last year, we've seen the critical role that creativity has played in the world. Creative Cloud is empowering everyone from the high school student to the social media influencer to the most demanding creative professional to tell their story. The Creative Cloud TAM is projected to be approximately $63 billion in 2024. $25 billion of that TAM comes from our core base of creative professionals who purchased Creative Cloud applications and services like Adobe Stock.
New growth drivers in this segment include 3D and other immersive experiences as well as web first collaboration tools like Frame.io. $13 billion of the TAM is coming from communicators, nonprofessional creators, including small businesses, students and marketers.
As you'll hear from [indiscernible] anywhere.We're excited about the Document Cloud strategy and the large addressable market, which is projected to grow to $32 billion by 2024. $10 billion of that TAM is coming from knowledge workers, business professionals who typically use our core Acrobat desktop subscription offerings.
Growth is expected to come from the expansion of digital document use cases, e-signatures and increased collaboration capabilities. $8 billion of the TAM is coming from communicators, who are using Acrobat web and mobile applications to create scan and edit PDF files for both business and personal use. Growth in this segment is projected to come from expanding the freemium PDF base and capturing demand from new funnels with offerings designed for web and mobile use cases.
Finally, $14 billion of the TAM is coming from enterprises, who are using document services including Acrobat and e-signature solutions as well as APIs that developers use to seamlessly integrate with key line of business applications. Growth drivers in this segment include APIs to build powerful document workflows and expanded use cases.
Whether it's B2B or B2C, businesses of every size across every category are investing in customer experience management. Adobe Experience Cloud empowers companies to deliver predictive, personalized real-time digital experiences across every phase of the customer life cycle.
Our total addressable market for Adobe Experience Cloud is estimated to be $110 billion in 2024. $33 billion of the TAM is coming from the data insights and audiences category, which includes Adobe Experience Platform, real-time CDP and Adobe Analytics, including our new customer journey analytics offering. Future growth drivers include the increasing demand for a unified customer profile and personalization at scale.
$49 billion of TAM is coming from the content and commerce category, which includes our Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Commerce offerings. The volume of content needed by businesses to engage customers across every touch point is exploding at the pace at which it must be deployed is accelerating. The need for a seamlessly integrated commerce capability is accelerating at that same pace.
$18 billion of the TAM is coming from the customer journeys category, which includes Adobe Campaign, Marketo Engage and our new Adobe Journey optimizer. Growth in this segment is expected to come from the continued need for businesses to engage with their customers across an ever-increasing array of channels.
New to the TAM this year is the $10 billion marketing workflow category, which includes Adobe Workfront acquired last year. Growth here is expected to come from the increasing need for teams to efficiently plan, track and execute marketing campaigns.
Adobe has always been relentlessly focused on looking around the corner, inventing new growth opportunities and successfully driving growth within our existing businesses. We have pioneered and are leading 3 massive categories: creativity, digital documents and customer experience management.
This week, we announced Creative Cloud Express, our exciting new unified web and mobile offering that's perfect for anyone looking to quickly and easily make and share standout content. Creative Cloud Express is great for first-time creators and communicators but we'll also provide value to our current Creative Cloud subscribers. It's a great example of how we continue to expand our customer base and grow our TAM.
We win by creating enduring technology platforms from Sensei to the Adobe Experience Platform. They are the foundation for product innovation and our industry-leading applications and services.
Since transitioning Creative Cloud to a subscription model 10 years ago, we have continued to innovate our business models, building applications, services and platforms to bring value to market faster, better serve new customers and leverage new monetization models. It would be impossible to do all this alone. We have built a large ecosystem of partners from agencies to solution integrators to ISVs. That customize and extend our solutions to the needs of our joint customers. We continue to see massive opportunities from Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud.
With the market tailwinds, our world-class innovation and the best employees in the world, we believe we're well positioned for our next decade of growth.
And now I'd like to introduce Anil Chakravarti, President of our Digital Experience business.

And I look forward to sharing more on our momentum, opportunity and strategy for the Digital Experience business. It's really an exciting time for us, as Ann shared.Let me begin by discussing a",846,"Thank you, Ann. Hello, everyone. Good to be here with you. And I look forward to sharing more on our momentum, opportunity and strategy for the Digital Experience business. It's really an exciting time for us, as Ann shared.
Let me begin by discussing a couple of highlights from Q4. We had strong performance across the board. Our segment revenue cost over $1 billion for the first time with 23% year-over-year growth. Our subscription revenue grew to $886 million, up 27% year-over-year. And our subscription bookings in Q4 were up over 50% year-over-year. And with that, we were up over 40% year-over-year for full year FY '21.
A lot of that was powered by the success of our Adobe Experience Platform and the native apps that run on it. It's foundational to our digital experience business. We invested early in the platform and have a significant head start having launched the platform in 2019.
Our growth has accelerated. Earlier this year, we disclosed that we had passed over $100 million in revenue. And at the end of Q4, we surpassed $250 million in book of business, and we have seen a 300% year-over-year growth in customer count.
The scale that we are operating in production is massive, over 21 trillion segment evaluations per day. And our ecosystem is extremely broad with over 300 partner integrations. And as Shantanu and Ann both mentioned, we have really accelerated our innovation over the past 18 months with new native applications and services powered by Sensei.
A great example of this is Major League Baseball. They are leveraging digital to transform experiences for their customers with a focus on reaching that next generation of fans. And this is across all their channels. At home, on the go and in menu in the ballpark. They are focused on personalization at scale, delivering the right experience at the right time via the right channel to all of their fans.
And it's not just Major League Baseball. It's clear that every business is a digital business and customer experience management is critical to business success. The changes in the tailwinds that we have seen during the pandemic are here to stay, and this has contributed to a strong momentum in our Digital Experience business.
A couple of examples here again. Significant growth in average annual recurring revenue across our top 1,000, 100 and 25 accounts. We've seen strong growth across all accounts greater than $1 million in ARR. And all of our customers are building long-term partnerships with us. As an example, the combined total contract value of our top 10 accounts is $760 million, which is 3x higher than what it was at the end of FY '19.
When we think about customer experience management, it is imperative for every company today to deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers. That's how they reach and engage all their customers across the world. And it's critical for them to do that to deliver that next level digital business growth. It's all about personalized experiences that are tailored to the individuals, delivered in real time and delivered seamlessly across online and off-line channels based on first-party data and making sure that they honor customer preference and privacy.
And that's what we focus on. Our strategy is battle-tested and helps companies across the world achieve personalization at scale. We offer customers the best of both words, integrated AI-enabled comprehensive applications delivered on a real-time cloud scale platform. We have strong momentum with Workfront, with the ability to unify marketing workflow and increase marketing agility for all customers. And we are the strategic partner for customer experience management. I hear this from customers all around the world every day. And our ecosystem of partners is expansive with over 4,000 partners, as Ann mentioned, across ISVs, tech partners, system integrators and agencies.
This is how we make this happen for our customers through the Adobe Experience Cloud. We focus on 4 key categories: content and commerce; data insights and audiences; customer journeys and marketing workflow, all delivered on a common platform, which is the Adobe Experience Platform. We've had a strong innovation engine over the last 18 months, and that's continuing both on the application layer as well as the platform with AI and machine learning capabilities in the platform powered by Adobe Sensei. This is a huge moat for us with the combination of a comprehensive set of applications and an integrated platform.
In closing, I am incredibly excited about the opportunity we have for the digital experience business. We have strong momentum, and we are the clear leader in the customer experience management category. We have a large growth opportunity to help every company deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers around the world. And we have the best technology across our Adobe Experience platform and the native applications with the ability to grow rapidly as we have shown over the last couple of years. 
With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to David to cover the digital media business. David?"

As some of you know, I ran the digital media business during the transition to Creative Cloud. And while the business has certainly matured since the early days of that transition, some things haven't changed. Our product teams keep delivering incredible innovation and our business continues to show strong momentum.
Now before we dive into what I'm personally excited about for FY '22 and beyond, I want to hit on some Q4 highlights. Our Digital Media business in the quarter delivered $571 million of net new ARR in total.
With that, Creative Cloud crossed $10 billion in ARR, and we saw continued strength in our Creative Cloud offers, while seeing outsized growth for substance, which grew 100% year-over-year, thanks to increasing demand for 3D and the emerging metaverse platforms. We also saw outsized growth in our mobile applications, which grew over 55% year-over-year. Our mobile applications have now generated over 400 million mobile IDs to date and has been a great source of new user acquisition for us.
On the Document Cloud side, we grew ARR 31% for the year, ending at $1.9 billion. A bit of color behind these numbers. We now have 2.5 billion mobile and desktop devices with Reader or Acrobat installed on them. We're seeing explosive growth in Acrobat Web, where we saw monthly active users grow over 100% since last year. And our strategy of integrating Adobe Sign and Acrobat is clearly paying off for us with 85% year-over-year growth in Adobe Sign transactions in Acrobat.
In aggregate, we ended the year with approximately $12.2 billion of ARR. And while we posted a great FY '22 -- FY '21, we have even more exciting opportunities ahead for us. Let's start by talking a little bit about Creative Cloud.
The big picture here is that we're living in a time where content and creativity and design has never been more valued, where content is fueling the global economy, where the digital consumption is exploding and where virtually every business needs a digital presence. We're living in a world where creative expression is considered a 21st century skill in education. And we're living in a world where we're seeing emerging 3D and immersive technologies like the metaverse, creating demand for all new types of content. All of this continues to drive incredible tailwinds for Creative Cloud.
In particular, though, I wanted to spend a minute on the rise of the creator economy where we're seeing a growing number of individuals, solopreneurs and small business owners, creating businesses from their passions and monetizing their content, their goods or their services online.
The creator economy is already big with nearly 100 million small businesses on social media and with the majority of them saying that their online presence is more important to their success than their physical presence. Now despite it being big, it continues to grow at an incredible rate with nearly 4.5 million new businesses minted in the U.S. alone last year, which was a record. This has been a significant contributor to our success and a major contributor to the over 600 million free and paid monthly active users across our digital media products who are not considered creative professionals. And of course, this expansive opportunity needs an expansive strategy that drives our mission for creativity for all.
In the next few minutes, I'll lay out how Adobe can help anyone who wants to express themselves in creative ways. From a small business owner to the highest end production house, Adobe has a solution for them because of our investment in 5 key areas. And since we just launched Creative Cloud Express, I wanted to start by discussing how we empower the world with content first task-based creativity. Let's go ahead and start by looking at a video of Creative Cloud Express and what it can do.

It's free to get started. It doesn't require a desktop download because it's 100% web and mobile. It doesn't have a learning curve and users can create an account and publish content in minutes: second, it's got an unparalleled content library. So novice users can build beautiful images and social media posts, digital flyers and more in minutes. This includes 175 stock images from Adobe Stock, 20,000 fonts and thousands of templates and design assets, and it's all powered by a universal search capability that surfaces the right content and recommendations at the right time; third, it leverages decades of Adobe's product innovation. As you'd expect, we have great workflows with our Creative Cloud applications, but it also includes a slew of Sensei-based quick actions that make creating and editing images, videos and PDF easier than ever before; and fourth, we understand that people create content with the intent to distribute it. So Creative Cloud Express has integrations for single-click publishing to social media services.
And you can expect to see that our recent acquisition of Content Cal benefit will benefit CCX users with even more social planning and publishing capabilities in the very near future. Creative Cloud Express is easy to use and it's easy to get started with. Users can have a lot of success with the free tier, but they're also presented with freemium -- premium features and content for an affordable -- at an affordable monthly price. CCX is also entitled with most CC existing plans, which we expect will drive higher engagement and retention in our core Creative Cloud customer base.
And the go-to-market motion is very familiar to us. We'll combine our digital acquisition funnels and our product-led growth motion tuned for web and mobile. This gives us an opportunity to continually optimize user journeys while ramping this business over time. We also plan to leverage our existing footprint across education, reseller and an enterprise to scale the business.
We're thrilled to have Creative Cloud Express in market today. It's been amazing to see what people can make with it, and we really couldn't be more excited about this moment and what this means for a start of a whole new journey for Adobe.
So moving beyond Creative Cloud Express, we also have a lot going on across Creative Cloud as a whole. We're advancing the state of art in imaging, video and design and more by building new capabilities across desktop, web and mobile. For example, we introduced Photoshop and Illustrator for Web at Adobe Max. And we released a series of new sense-driven AI/ML capabilities, including neural filters and auto masking and Photoshop and auto captioning in Premier, just to name a few.
We also continue to -- our focus on democratizing 3D and immersive. Substance 3D NOW supports end-to-end 3D workflows. Users can design parametric 3D assets and designer composed rendering, virtual scenes in Stager, add texture, color, effects in Painter and create 3D materials with Sampler. This enables fully virtual photo shoots saving companies a lot of money and a lot of time and speeds up asset and scene creation for inclusion in games, videos and the emerging metaverse platforms.
Collaboration is another big area of focus for us. We're putting -- we're integrating collaboration directly into our apps and existing creative workflows. We're very excited about the Frame.io acquisition and see tremendous opportunity across individual corporate and media workflows with that product.
We shipped a public beta of share for review workflows at Max, and we demoed Spaces in Canvas, which we believe will enable teams to organize their creative assets and host live working sessions.
And last but not least, we continue to produce content that inspires and educates our users through services like Adobe Live. We help users monetize their work through services like Adobe Stock, and we help them connect and inspire each other through services like Behance, which now is closing in on almost 29 million members.
These 5 strategic pillars work together to ensure that anyone with creative needs can find a solution at Adobe, whether they're a creative professional trying to keep up with the increasing content demand or they're a communicator participating in the creator economy or a consumer looking to up their game in photography or a student developing 21st century skills.
We use our data-driven operating model, DDOM, to engage them as they express their interest online by perhaps searching for something like compositing in Photoshop or designing a Twitter post. Based on their intent, we then route them to one of our creative cloud apps, one of our mobile apps or one of our frictionless web quick actions. We make sure that they have early success, and then we introduce them to other capabilities in Creative Cloud or Creative Cloud Express before converting them to and engaging them as a paid user. This digital motion, combined with our reseller partners, our direct sales teams, gives us an amazing global footprint and reach.
So in summary, everything is going digital and content is fueling the digital economy. The result is a massive and growing TAM for Creative Cloud, as Ann talked about earlier. And our offerings, which now include Creative Cloud Express continue to expand to meet market demand for both professionals and nonprofessionals. We couldn't be more excited about the opportunity ahead for the Creative business.
And as you know, the other part of the digital media business is, of course, our Document Cloud, which is also experiencing significant tailwinds. Demand for PDF has never been greater. In fact, web searches for PDF have doubled in the last decade. And we believe the reason for this is that PDF has become the de facto format for unstructured data. PDF has also been the de facto standard for business-to-business collaboration where nowhere is this more pronounced, of course, than with e-signatures. This makes PDF an essential part of modernizing any business workflow, and Adobe is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend.
Our apps are installed on over 2.5 billion devices, and we've opened -- in our apps, we've opened or created 320 billion PDFs in the last 12 months alone. We continue to be a leading destination for PDF viewing and we saw 100 million free and paid sign-ups over the last year. And we see that Acrobat can be a gateway to related services. Adobe signed transactions in Acrobat, as I mentioned earlier, have increased 85% year-over-year as we continue to deepen the integration between the 2 offers.
Our strategy here is clearly working, and we're investing across 5 key motions to make sure it continues to. First, our document verb strategy has been very effective. We now have 21 verbs in market, everything from edit PDF to convert PDF to rotate PDF. And we're seeing continued -- and we're continuing to optimize our digital acquisition and increasing our share of voice across the 80 million PDF related searches that happen every month.
Second, we're proliferating e-signatures by integrating them into Acrobat across all services, desktop, web and mobile. Given our early success here over the last year, you can expect to see us continue bringing these products closer together in the years ahead.
Third, we remain committed to making PDF more intelligent for both interacting and reading. Adobe is reinventing mobile PDF viewing with liquid mode. We're accelerating document productivity with automated form field detection, and we're helping transform unstructured data to structured actionable data with our AI/ML-based extract functionality.
Fourth, we're unlocking business workflows through our PDF and sign APIs. This empowers developers to build document automation solutions that transform how their businesses work.
And fifth, we're leveraging our diversified go-to-market motions to reach anyone with a document need. Our global resellers and inside sales teams give us amazing access to a broad base of business demand. Our enterprise sales team allow us to sell tops down to CIOs looking to transform their business. And perhaps most importantly, our digital funnel continues to drive individual users into our conversion funnels.
Knowledge workers, communicators IT decision-makers and developers all have frictionless onboarding pathways. Our data-driven operating model helps customers discover Adobe technology when they're seeing -- when they're searching for PDF related verbs. And we engage them in ways that provide quick success on web, mobile and desktop before upselling them to freemium features, premium features, products, services or APIs that broaden their engagement with Adobe over time. In short, Document Cloud is incredibly well positioned for the years ahead.
I hope this gives you a sense of why we're excited about both the creative and document businesses. In summary, -- Both businesses are benefiting from significant tailwinds that are underpinning their large and growing TAMs. Both businesses are realizing the market benefits by leveraging our amazing brand awareness, our go-to-market footprint and our incredible pipeline of innovation. And both businesses have the opportunity to supercharge their existing data-driven operating model by pairing it with a product-led growth motion as our capabilities increasingly are accessed by users on web and mobile. So we're really excited about the year ahead.
And with that, I wanted to turn it over to Dan."

Let me begin by saying how thrilled I am to be here today and be a part of this amazing team at Adobe. Having just been here for a few months, it's obvious what a special company this is, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.
Now let me jump in with Adobe's Q4 results. Adobe achieved revenue of $4.11 billion, a significant milestone, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted EPS was $2.57, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.20. Digital Media segment revenue was $3.01
[Audio Gap]
Digital Experience subscription revenue was $886 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. We had record cash flows from operations of $2.05 billion in the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our stock.
Turning to our 3 strategic clouds. It was a tremendous finish to the year. In Q4, Adobe achieved $2.4 billion in creative revenue and added $430 million of net new Creative ARR. We exited the year with more than $10 billion of ending Creative ARR with strong performance throughout the year. Growth drivers in the quarter included acquisition of new users on adobe.com, strength in our team's offering, seasonal Q4 strength in the enterprise and success co-selling Frame.io with our Creative Cloud enterprise offerings.
However, while we saw increased demand for our offerings during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks, we did not see the traditional spikes we have had in previous years. This is consistent with this year's industry trends, in line with e-commerce holiday shopping data from the Adobe Digital Economy Index.
Adobe Document Cloud achieved $532 million in Q4. Revenue continues to be our -- and continues to be our fastest-growing business. We added a record $141 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter with ending ARR of $1.93 billion, growing 31% year-over-year. Our integrated document platform is clearly resonating with customers around the globe. We continue to see momentum with enterprises, small businesses and individuals using web and mobile first tools.
In digital experience, we achieved our first $1 billion revenue quarter. We're seeing strong demand for our real-time experience platform and app services as large enterprises are making investments in Adobe to drive customer experience management and personalization at scale. We drove record Q4 net subscription bookings. And for the full fiscal year, we grew net ASV greater than 40% year-over-year. 
Let's look quickly at the annual numbers. Adobe's financial performance in the year was outstanding with both top line acceleration and margin expansion in the year, resulting in more than $7 billion of operating cash flow. And remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to nearly $14 billion, absolutely world-class performance.
Now let's discuss what a unique investment opportunity Adobe is. These are some of the outstanding qualities of Adobe that have energized me about the opportunity, and it's what ultimately brought me here today. There's a fundamental shift towards digitization that's accelerating around the globe. And I believe Adobe is better positioned than any other company to capitalize on these opportunities.
Combining that with Adobe's financial track record as well as industry-defining products and platforms. The result is an immense runway ahead of this company for growth.
Let me elaborate a bit more on my view of this opportunity. In the years ahead, there's going to be fundamental shifts in all aspects of our lives, all of them digitally enabled. Digital enablement will increasingly shape and define how we live, how we create, how we communicate, how we collaborate, how companies serve their customers, how companies compete and how economies function. These changes are both powerful and pervasive. I call it the digitization of everything.
The digitization of everything is accelerating. And I believe what happens in the next 10 years is going to define the rest of the century. Similar to what happened in the Industrial Revolution. Except now, digital content and data are going to be the fuel of the digital economy. This is a generational opportunity. And we're talking about unlocking trillions of dollars of economic value in the global economy.
When you look at Adobe's foundational strengths, there's a very few companies that is leveraged to the digitization of the global economy as well as we are. From the way people create and communicate, to the future of productivity and digital collaboration in a distributed work environment, to the digitization of businesses, driving customer engagement with data-driven insights to personalize customer experiences but do it at massive scale to AI and machine learning with Adobe's unique strengths.
Again, digital content and data are the fuel of the digital economy. And I believe no one is better positioned than Adobe to be the digital enabler of the world.
How many companies on the planet have this profile? How many companies have this opportunity? Not very many. When I think about our near-term strengths combined with our long-term opportunities, there's a uniqueness here that's incredibly exciting.
Let's double-click on the company's financial performance and take a closer look at what I'm talking about. Starting with revenue growth. You can see consistent sustained revenue growth over the last 4 years as the company has grown subscription revenues at a 24% CAGR. That has been the strategy continuing to grow while producing a revenue stream that's even more ratable and predictable.
I'm incredibly impressed by this team's acumen what they've been able to accomplish as well as by the contribution to revenue growth from newer initiatives, including Adobe Stock, Substance 3D, Acrobat Web, Sign Creative Cloud mobile apps and the Adobe Experience Platform.
Underlying this financial performance is an incredibly diverse business from our broad base of customers to diversified products and platforms, comprehensive business models and go-to-market reach that spans across all geographies.
With growing and diverse revenue streams, the company has been able to expand profitability over the last 4 years, while accelerating the top line. Adobe's disciplined execution and investment rigor has enabled the company to balance long-term investments while also focusing on profitability. This time period also includes the integration of several strategic acquisitions, Magento, Marketo Algorithmic, Workfront, Frame.io. It's impressive the way Adobe has managed to combine expanded profitability with strong, sustained top line growth and M&A integration.
Let's talk about RPO. Contractually committed future revenues, which make Adobe's future performance, incredibly predictable and reliable. Exiting fiscal year 2021, RPO grew 23% on the strength of our enterprise bookings. RPO consists of deferred revenue and unbilled backlog with the current portion expected to flow into revenue over the next 12 months. It's also important to note that most of our adobe.com subscriptions are billed monthly and don't show up as deferred revenue. The remaining contractual commitments of those subscriptions, which average about 6 months in length at any given time are included in unbilled backlog.
The cash flow performance really speaks for itself as you can see the way our operating cash flows have accelerated over the last 2 fiscal years, sustained growth and profitability at scale is not easy to achieve. The momentum at Adobe is strong. as evidenced by our first $2 billion quarter of operating cash flows. A strong capital structure with robust investment-grade credit rating positions us to continue to drive growth and provides flexibility, making access to capital affordable for Adobe.
Let's talk about our capital allocation strategy. First, we focus on investing in the business to drive long-term growth. Given the tremendous opportunities in front of us, some of our recent innovative R&D initiatives include our next-generation data platform as well as Creative Cloud Express, which we announced earlier this week. We're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing to scale those businesses globally.
Second, our cash and investment balances as well as our debt capacity enable inorganic growth opportunities. You've seen the way we've accelerated growth and made accretive strategic additions over the last fiscal year with Workfront and Frame.io.
Lastly and importantly, we focus on returning capital to our shareholders. Our stock repurchase program is funded through growth in our operating cash flows, and you can see how successful we've been in driving down the average shares outstanding over the last 4 years. Since 2018, we've returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. Exiting Q4, we have $13.1 billion of remaining stock repurchase authority through the end of our fiscal 2024.
The hallmark of a great technology company is consistent innovation in category-defining products. Adobe has done that across all its businesses and we'll dive into each of them next to discuss the performance drivers.
First, Creative. The company has driven sustained ARR and revenue growth, which accelerated from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. Let me tell you about the underlying data-driven operating model used to drive this performance. It all starts with innovation and the most comprehensive industry-defining portfolio of products. Our brilliant marketing campaigns generate awareness about Adobe's offerings, and drive traffic to adobe.com to engage customers to try, buy, use and renew.
It's about taking creators on a journey. First, with simpler applications, including our mobile tablet and web applications, connecting them with vibrant creative communities and then providing journeys that empower them to do more as they advance, including services like Adobe Stock, cloud libraries and collaboration features.
Now with the addition of Frame.io and Creative Cloud Express, we're continuing to grow the business by broadening the aperture and reaching new creators and stakeholders that will power the world's content. We continue to drive strong growth for Document Cloud.
Again, you see this in the sustained revenue growth with ARR growing even faster as the business shifts to being increasingly subscription-based. With approximately 90% of Document Cloud revenues in FY 2021 now being subscription. The main Document Cloud growth driver continues to be new user acquisition. We're seeing strong growth of Acrobat on adobe.com across geographies, growth on the web as well as in mobile and seed expansion in the enterprise, PDF and document workflows are mission critical to the way people work and collaborate in the digital-first world.
As Anil mentioned earlier, there's tremendous growth opportunity within our cohort of large customers. As we focus on cross-selling and moving them along the maturity curve, towards the transformational adoption of our entire platform and set of customer experience management solutions. The average ARR and total contract value of our largest customers demonstrate how massive this opportunity is. And we grow by adding new logos to our customer base and then expanding within those accounts on multiyear journeys.
As impressive as this company's track record is, I believe there's even more growth ahead of us. I fundamentally believe there's a $1 trillion market cap opportunity in Adobe's future, having crossed the $15 billion mark in revenue. What is the path to $30 billion look like? And then from there, how are we going to get to $45 billion. It starts with an estimated $205 billion TAM, and a huge ecosystem that we've built around our market-leading products and services. How are we going to get there? We're going to continue to broaden our appeal to a wider universe of customers engage and retain our current customers across all geographies.
We're also going to grow by innovating and investing to enter new categories that further complement and expand our growth trajectory and better enable our customers in the digital era. When we execute on that strategy over the next decade, our scale and success will put Adobe in a class that only a few software companies have achieved.
Having passed the $15 billion revenue mark, we're going to start reporting revenues in constant currency given the potential impact of foreign exchange movements. Following a year in which FX was a tailwind to reported revenues, the recent U.S. dollar strength is expected to result in a headwind to our reported revenue and growth rates for fiscal year 2022. Consistent with our annual practice, we've revalued our Digital Media ARR balance to account for the movements in the FX rates.
For operating expenses, we continue to save on travel and facilities in fiscal year 2021. While many of our employees continue to work from home. We expect these expenses to ramp throughout FY 2022. We also plan to invest in increasing headcount and integrating Frame.io. We believe these are critical investments we're making -- we believe these are critical investments we're making, and we're going to focus relentlessly on the organic growth opportunities ahead.
Lastly, fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year with an extra week in Q1. That week added approximately $267 million of revenue and $25 million of net new Digital Media ARR. The math around the return to a 52-week fiscal year is expected to be a 2-point headwind on our full year FY '22 growth rates and a 7-point headwind in Q1.
Here's Adobe's fiscal year 2022 annual targets. We show our segment growth targets on an actual and adjusted basis in constant currency, factoring for the additional week last year. Total Adobe revenue of approximately $17.9 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.9 billion. Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis.
Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 16% year-over-year, or 19% on an adjusted basis.
Tax rate of approximately 17.5% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $10.25 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $13.70.
For Q1 of fiscal 2022, we're targeting revenue of approximately $4.23 billion. Net new digital media ARR of approximately $400 million. Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 8% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 11% year-over-year or 18% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 20% on an adjusted basis. Tax rate of approximately 16% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.63 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.35.
I want to conclude by sharing what this company has achieved over the last 4 years, whether it's revenue growth and profitability, outstanding cash flow generation and shareholder returns, Adobe's track record demonstrates why this company is in a class of its own. I firmly believe that our best days are ahead. Thanks so much for your time today. I'm going to now pass it back to Shantanu."

As I said earlier, I'm incredibly excited about Adobe's future and our ability to not only lead but also create new categories.
I think if you zoom out a little bit and think about it from a macro perspective, all over the world, it's clear that digital is empowering individuals, transforming businesses and connecting communities. And frankly, digital is going to play a much bigger role in work, life and entertainment going forward. We've seen the rise of the creator economy and the democratization of creativity.
Work and education are now hybrid and here to stay in that form. Cloud and web technology advances are powering unprecedented levels of real-time collaboration. Document workflows are increasingly going to be automated. And most important, the mandate for our digital business is more [indiscernible] most experiences that are both contextual as well as personalized. E-commerce growth is building on the record highs achieved during the pandemic. From a technology base, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become indispensable facilitators of our daily lives.
And so I think, in short, digital technologies are enabling more people to create, collaborate, learn, work, be productive and make a living than ever before. I love our mission and the ability to change the world through digital experiences puts us at the nexus of all of these trends. We're incredibly well positioned to drive meaningful impact across every aspect of society, and that will benefit billions of people around the world for years to come.
As we think about the company at Adobe, we believe it's not just what we do, but it's also how you do that it really matters. From the very beginning, John Warnock and Chuck our founders, committed to building a company that does the right thing. And the sense of purpose has guided our evolution and growth over the past 4 decades.
I think we're all witnessing the shift in the role that companies have to play in social issues and the expectations that stakeholders and investors have for corporations.
As you reflect on how companies have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. It's been remarkable with that stakeholders around the world are looking to the private sector to become more active in social issues. And people are making decisions on the products that they buy and the places that they work based on where companies stand.
As our products have become ubiquitous and we've helped many more companies harness the transformative power of our digital technologies, our responsibility and our commitment to corporate citizenship has also grown dramatically. And I believe that the issues on which Adobe is uniquely positioned to make an impact are on Adobe for all, making sure we create a diverse and inclusive culture for our employees as well as position that for our customers and partners.
On the belief that technology will transform and in addition to providing technology, we have a responsibility to understand what that means. And I think most important to being able to allow everyone who has a story to tell their story, the notion of creativity for all.
The reality is that we've been leaning into these for several areas already, and our efforts are making a real impact across the company and our customer communities for many years. But I think it's this purpose that motivates our employees to focus on having more impact and frankly, inventing the future.
I love the fact that our strategy has remained relatively consistent for the past decade. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, to accelerate document productivity and to power digital businesses is more mission-critical than ever before. I think most companies would be thrilled, frankly, to have one of these growth opportunities. And we're fortunate that we have 3 businesses that are absolutely in the sweet spot of where the world needs technology to play a more important role.
We have the right strategy. It's applied to an exceptional and growing opportunity, and so we're in no way opportunity constrained.
I'm going to end with how I started. I believe that Adobe is uniquely positioned to drive the next decade of growth. We have a proven capability to create and lead categories, and we're always looking around the corner to the white space that exists that will provide new opportunities for Adobe.
We're thinking bigger about every part of our business, how we scale and how we expand the customers that we serve. We continue to focus on innovation, delivering leading products, services and platforms as we leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're continuously thinking about innovating in business models as well to rapidly deliver more value to a larger set of customers, to capitalize on global growth opportunities and to enable new monetization models that are emerging. And at the end of the day, our technology support a vibrant and growing ecosystem of partners that create customize and extend our solutions to meet the unique needs of our joint customers.
But at the end of the day, our greatest asset as being an intellectual property company and what's truly driving our growth is a highly engaged global employee base, over 25,000 strong to whom I'm internally grateful.
Thank you again for joining us today. I believe 2021 was a fantastic year and we clearly expect that momentum to continue in 2022 and beyond. We look forward to our 40th anniversary next year. Adobe stands in an enviable position, an impressive track record of innovation, category and brand leadership, great financial performance and multiple growth opportunities. Coupled with the expanding market opportunity, the depth of our technology platforms and the motivated employee base, I certainly believe that Adobe's best days are ahead of us.
And with that, we'll roll a video while we assemble the management team for our Q&A.

Firstly, it was a record quarter as well as it was a record year. And when we think about what our digital media guide was, I mean we certainly expected frame to close in the quarter and it closed pretty early in the quarter. And so what we do is we think about a range of outcomes and what that might do, and certainly, we wanted to focus on frame as well, but it was probably not explicitly factored into the quarter.
When you consider it from different customer segments, the team business actually performed really well right through the quarter. And so the team's offering and the strength in the small and medium business was great.
Enterprise, we actually actively redirected and pivoted the team to think about video and frame and how we were continuously selling it. As I said, it closed early in the quarter. And so Enterprise had the traditional Q4 strength as well that we normally expect. The individual demand was actually fairly strong right through the year.
As Dan mentioned, maybe the one slight change is that as you think about what's happening with online shopping, while we continue to see demand up and to the right, we perhaps did not see as much of the spike as you would have perhaps seen traditionally in either the Black Friday or the Cyber Monday weeks. But apart from that, strength and demand continues to be strong. And clearly, we factored that into our guidance for fiscal 2022, which is the strongest ARR guide that we've ever guided to.

We delivered some of the mind-blowing Adobe Magic throughout our actual Pro products, neuro filters and Photoshop, for example, a lot of the collaboration features. And we really made a proclamation that Creative Cloud going forward will be as much about collaboration as it is about creativity, which if you think about it, invites many more stakeholders of creativity into the fold. And that's what we're seeing across all of our enterprise as well as small businesses.
Everyone wants to be a stakeholder and have a say and be able to jump in and give feedback. And so we're building our products for the future to enable that.
I also want to mention, of course, last week, we launched Creative Cloud Express. This is just the start of an amazing new chapter for us. We've had a number of products in the market in our incubation zone, we call it, as we learn about how to really fulfill our mission of creativity for all. And now we've galvanized on all of the learnings, all of the signals and we just couldn't be more excited about the new journey we're on here with that product in particular."

All the innovation that Scott's talked about and has been driving. One of the big things that you have to recognize is that it's really what's driving the TAM growth that Ann talked about earlier, both in terms of expanding the base of people we can access with something like Creative Cloud Express and also increasing the value that we're providing to our Creative Pro base.
So as you start looking at where we're going with the business, we're building on the momentum. As we talked about, we had 2 -- almost $2 billion of net new ARR added in FY '21. We had our strongest guide ever, and it's really on the back of that. One more thing with regard to Creative Cloud Express and how that will start to drive opportunity for us. It can start by actually adding a lot of new users to the franchise. One of the things that we've been doing a phenomenal job with, and I think this expands is bringing new users to Adobe, getting them successful with what they're doing and then start to mature them up the value curve into creative cloud subscription or now Creative Cloud Express subscription.
But we're also making this available to all creative cloud customers. This is something that we see a lot of Creative Cloud customers occasionally want speed and content first development. For those users, we see the opportunity to really drive higher engagement and retention, even beyond where we already are.
And then as you start to have more plans that are separated for the kinds of things people want to do, it gives us the opportunity to drive more price optimization across the lines as well. So we're very excited about where we're heading and what this really adds to the mix we have."

And we certainly outperformed that guidance as it relates to Digital Media ARR accomplishment in 2021. And if you look at how we've guided for 2022, it's actually a little bit closer to our 2021 guide as a starting point. And so clearly, we continue to be incredibly optimistic associated with the underlying strength of the business. The overall need for creativity just continues.
We don't believe in any way, shape or form, there were sort of pull-ins, and I know that sort of exists for other companies. We just continue to see secular strength and some of the new initiatives that we have underway. I mean we've really pivoted the team to be thinking about enterprise and video. We have Creative Cloud Express. The usage is going to build dramatically. We already have the largest communicator business, I think, among the creative community. So we're incredibly optimistic about how that business looks. And then if you look at it from a quarterization perspective.
Again, let's just go back and look at what we guided in Q1 of 2021. As you know, when we guided to a number, we were factoring in the $24 million that we outlined was an additional part of what we accomplished as part of the 13 versus 14 week. And so if you look at it, it's very much in line. In other words, the trends of the business continue, and the optimism in the business continues. So that's how I would think about it, Alex."

To what extent should we think about this as defensive to some of the emerging competitors that are ramping up in the marketplace?
And is there any risk of downshifting of the existing Creative Cloud customers who need a lighter rate solution? Now here's a cheaper offering, if you will. Is there any potential that you can see some downshifting within the base of people trying to price optimize there?

And so I think with online and our DDOM, we now have absolutely the ability to target and personalize our offerings of case against a broader set of customers and to make sure that we make it all net positive and net from a customer satisfaction as well as a net positive from the ARR that we accomplished.
A couple of other things. I mean first, our creative business with the communicator segment is already the largest creative business in the world. I mean, when you think about what's happening with Photoshop or Lightroom or the Express set of products.
And I think what Express really does is it actually adds value to every single creative cloud subscriber. I mean they are creative cloud subscribers who are incredibly proficient in video who sometimes want to do a quick flyer associated with it. And so I think this brings more and more and more people into the fold. It's similar, frankly, to what we've done with the Document Cloud, where when you think about what's happening with this organic demand that we've created for PDF.
And so net-net, I think it's accretive. And then I'll hand it over to David to speak specifically about how this might roll out, but it is actually an enabler for us, and it unifies, frankly, all of the different creative offerings that we've already had for the communicator segment."

Just adding to that, we look at this as a really pivotal moment in terms of the -- our ability to fulfill a need that we know our customers have. If you think back to what we talked about earlier, we have 400 million IDs that have been created on mobile devices already. we have 600 million monthly active users across our digital media products that are not creative professionals.
And Creative Cloud Express represents an opportunity to give all of them something that we can onboard them to in an effective way. As Shantanu also talked about, one of the things that we find really exciting about this is that our Creative Cloud base as well is looking for sometimes often, they're looking for the power and precision of our creative flagship applications. But sometimes they just want a velocity-driven content-first creation model too. And by giving Creative Cloud Express to most of our credit cloud plans, we expect to drive even higher engagement and retention there.
And the last thing I want to say is that this fundamentally expands how we think about our go-to-market motion. We have talked for the last many years about our data-driven operating model and how that drives our ability to pull and acquire users, bring them into our acquisition funnels, with product-led growth because of our increasing investment in mobile and web. We have the ability to do a lot more quick iteration and optimize the user journey, so that conversion of that 600 million mile into paid and premium customers and engagement with them continues.
And the last thing I will say is that I don't think you can look at this market as you've got nonprofessionals and professionals. We have a lot of nonprofessionals that really want to use the power and precision of Creative Cloud. And so we look at this as this ongoing seamless journey from the first time you come in, you want to do something with creative expression. You can do it for free with Creative Cloud Express. We then move you up that change, so you have the premium content and availability of the premium features and content and creative Cloud Express paid plan. And then we see people are able to actually move all the way up to the power and precision of Creative Cloud. So it's really a seamless end-to-end journey."

But one of the very exciting things that we've learned over the last few years is really around the distinct customer needs that were just not covered, frankly, by Spark or Photoshop Express other things we were doing or other kind of competitive tools out there. And I just wanted to share a few of those because I think they're really relevant. I mean first of all, we're seeing a lot of these customers that come in wanting to make something with a template. They want to be able to go further.
So our product team is actually very excited about the prospect of a customer being able to make something and then take it to the next level using one of our more pros applications like Photoshop or Illustrator. Also the desire for artificial intelligence. A lot of customers come in from small businesses, et cetera, and they have an idea of what they want to make, but they want some assistance in making something remarkable. They want fonts to be recommended to them. They want colors that will perform better on social media. And so we have an opportunity to do that.
And then finally, the idea of a multimedia editor was another really important insight for us in the development of Creative Cloud Express. Because what we learned is that while a lot of customers come in through the top of the funnel because they want to make a flyer, they want to edit a video, they want to edit an image. When they come in, they actually realize, maybe I'll add some animation, maybe I'll add some sound. And before you know it, it's a multimedia creation. And so we're very much building Creative Cloud Express, not just for the customer is now, but where we see the market going. People are going to want to stand out with their media, and that's something that I believe Adobe can uniquely deliver with this product."

And that's a major investment that all companies are making.
And so what we've been able to do is to really take advantage of all of the knowledge we have and the applications we have across all of these areas and populate that data in the Adobe Experience platform. And that gives us a clear head start with every company and then say then opening it up by saying that it is open to developers, the data model is an open data model. It runs on top of a cloud so that it's horizontally scalable, that has really made it something that every enterprise of any size can use, but they can also get started in a particular geography or in a particular business unit or a customer segment and scale from there.
So I'm really excited. I think across our categories, we definitely see a lot of strength. And more as we now see some of the trends that we've just talked about with the creative economy and so on, that will continue to add more use cases that will be built on top of the platform."

The innovation that went into the building of the experience platform and the unification, frankly, of everything that Aneel has talked about, whether it's content and commerce, whether it's data and insights, whether it's the marketing flow associated with Workfront, which is also doing well. There really isn't another company that enables somebody whether you're the marketer, the Chief Revenue Officer, the Chief Digital Officer, to very quickly say, I want to get all my data, whether it's online or off-line into one particular place. And even more important, to activate it.
And so I think from my perspective, the momentum associated with having this unified platform and you can get customers really up and running so rapidly, that's pretty amazing.
The second thing I would say is that we've done a really good job with the Digital Strategy Group as well as what Aneel had outlined earlier about these transformative accounts.
And so again, as we shared in the data, the ability to sell multiple solutions, the ability to upsell, the ability to co-sell, I think that also gives us a lot of confidence that now we have the platform, we have the apps and services on it. We have the AI associated with it. And I think if you take a step back, there isn't a company that doesn't want to talk to us about, a, Adobe, how did you do it? And b, how do we really make sure that we can get this up and running and activate it faster.

I think the best place to start is underlying performance of the business. I think we're exposed to great market opportunities. Companies got the right strategy and performing well against those strategies. As we think about performance in the current environment against that backdrop of good performance, we want to strip out noise in the 1-year look ahead set of numbers. And I think there's 2 things that we point to when we separate the noise from what's been communicated.
First is FX. Second is the extra 53-week versus 52-week. And so let's go 1 layer deep in each of those. As we think about the 53 versus 52-week, that's about a 2% adder to growth for the overall company in fiscal '21. And as we window into fiscal '22, that's going to be about a 2-point headwind. Because that extra week occurred in Q1, and you look at Q1 FY '22, it's about a 7-point headwind from just that 1 extra week alone as we look 1 quarter forward.
As we take a look at FX and we think about the currency moves. Not surprisingly, FX for our business over 2021 also added about a 2-point tailwind from a growth perspective, broadly speaking, across the business. As we look forward into the next year, it creates about a 1 point headwind given the recent moves that we've seen over the last couple of weeks -- I'm sorry, last couple of months of the dollar strengthening versus a variety of currencies around the globe. That gives you a sense of the magnitude of the moves from both of those 2 factors as we extract underlying performance from a bit of the noise we see.
If we were to go to 1 click further down and take a look at how both of those factors affect the Digital Media business versus the digital experience business. I would say from the 52 versus 53-week dynamic, you'll see more of that upside and more of that headwind from a growth standpoint impacting the DME business, then you do the DX business. But it's just a slight difference between the 2 businesses, depending on how we engage commercially with our customers, and I can go into that in a little more detail if you'd like.
On the FX side, you see a similar dynamic. You see slightly accentuated performance to the upside and downside tailwind and headwind from FX on the Digital Media business than you do on the DX business. It's a slight change, but you see a slight bias to the upside and downside of DME versus DX. I think that unpacks the numbers and gets to the true underlying performance of the company.
And as you take a step back and look at how our businesses have performed over the last couple of years, you'll see what we've just guided is about in line with where we've been for the last couple of years. So again, the company continues to perform pretty well."

And so I guess when you're $15 billion of revenue, it's neither practical, and it's, frankly, too expensive to hedge all the FX exposure that you were accustomed to maybe we're doing. So if you strip out that FX part, and if you think about ARR, just very tactically to be clear. What we do is we have an ARR at the beginning of the year. With the strength of the dollar in November, you could argue it's the hardest compare on a pure FX. And then we both devalue the beginning book of business on ARR, and then we are using that dollar rate for the ARR for the quarter.
And so then, again, if you think about it, at a $1.9 billion guide that we have for ARR, clearly, the underlying strength of business and the units, that is not what's impacting the business. So just I think that's the other way that I unpack what was the impact of FX as well as to specifically tell you how we take the dollar rate at the beginning of the year for the ARR calculation."

So as you look at how we engage with customers, you engage with customers through adobe.com and other channels on a daily basis, and you're exposed to every single extra day of that week to the upside and the downside depending on which year you're in.
On the DX business, the vast majority of our -- not the vast -- the majority of our revenues will get booked on a daily basis, but there are parts of that business that engage with customers on a monthly basis. And as you can imagine, when that extra week falls in a month and you engage with customers on a monthly basis, you won't see the upside or the downside on that business.
So on a like-for-like basis, you'll see more of that dynamic float into the Digital Media business than you will the DX business. But again, as you think about a 2-point tailwind FX in FY '21 and a 1 point headwind in FY '22, you're talking about slight separation to the upside and downside and -- depending on which year you're in to this dynamic."

And then certainly, with the benefit of the enterprise selling and the top down, we're able to go and have solution-oriented conversations with them.
But one of the key areas that we've been focused on over the last 12 months that have really been productive for us is to leverage our footprint in terms of our desktop applications, predominantly things like reader across mobile, desktop and web and drive awareness and utilization of our services through that. As I mentioned earlier, we saw an 85% year-over-year increase in terms of Adobe signed transactions that were successfully completed or initiated in Acrobat. And you can expect to see us continue to do that. We want signatures and Adobe Sign to be available to anyone that uses Acrobat going forward, and we'll continue to double down on that strategy."

We're going to invest for growth. We're going to invest in market-leading and defining products. And we're going to continue to lead the way we've done in the past.

If you look at the Adobe Digital Index, what has clearly happened over the last 12 months, 18 months, even pre-pandemic, but certainly during the pandemic is there's more and more activity happening online. That is a secular trend that's actually not going to change. We see it.
There's more energy, there's more traffic, there's more activity associated with what's going online. If you look at what I think a lot of companies are looking at, the traditional spikes that you may have seen. A couple of weeks, the Black Friday week or the Cyber Monday week. I think those are maybe a little bit more muted because it's a little bit more of that traffic. You're seeing actually a steady growth as opposed to those spikes.
So if I take a step back and think about our Digital Media business teams and the small and medium business, nice performance. If I look at the enterprise, as I said, traditional close to the quarter. If I look at the individual business, a little bit of those spikes that we would have seen, we did see growth. We did see growth in both of those weeks, but it was perhaps a little bit less than that. And then you're back to, again, the secular demand.
So as I think about the business. It's not about the long-term demand. It's not about the market leadership of our products. I think it's just a little bit of how maybe online shopping globally has changed a little bit in terms of what the experience is. So that's what I attribute it to.
And we're back on Q1, look at our guide and let's go execute against the opportunities that we have. So I'll really point to a little bit of those couple of weeks. And it's not just Adobe. It's certainly represented. If you look at the Adobe Digital Index and what we thought was the growth rate going to be for the entire community and how that got a little muted. So that's the way I would look at it."

We also are able to provide more value. As people are trying to accelerate the velocity of content, they have to build content more quickly. So things that Scott and team are doing around the addition of collaboration, means that we are able to add more value. The Frame.io acquisition is a great example of that. But we've also added some core new collaborative capabilities to Creative Cloud itself.
And third is the emergence of these new content types. We've been all tracking the growth of 3D, but also now with the emergence of the Metaverse, we're starting to see more demand for new types of content.

And dovetailing that to Shantanu's observation that you're looking to accelerate as opposed to go for margin expansion, which is great. And with that construct in mind, and certainly, when I look at your guidance, it doesn't suggest any deceleration, but maybe a little bit of conservatism, if anything.
If you could just talk about the levers in your business, Shantanu, that could cause the company to better than expected or downside levers as well for fiscal '22, that would be great. But more longer term, if you look at metaverse, the concept of metaverse and how Satya Nadella talks about the qualitive metaverse on the business side, how we work, a combination of virtual and presence, he outlines a view of the world that is fairly compelling. I'm curious how you thought about how Adobe is positioned for that world, the metaverse and the consumer context in enterprise virtual work context as laid out by Satya?"

And before I get to the metaverse, maybe the one thing we didn't quite cover is if you look at the big trends that people are talking about, Kash, the one thing we're maybe not in is EVs and batteries, right? So that's",1056,"Well, thanks for the question, Kash. And before I get to the metaverse, maybe the one thing we didn't quite cover is if you look at the big trends that people are talking about, Kash, the one thing we're maybe not in is EVs and batteries, right? So that's perhaps the one area of digital that Adobe is still not really involved in.
As I think about web 3D and ISI, I think about the metaverse, what it really means and implies is that things that you were accustomed to doing in the physical world, increasingly more and more of that, you're going to do in the virtual world. And so if you think about it that way, whether you're doing shopping, whether you're playing games, whether you're creating, co-creating with other people, whether you're expanding it. The aspect of creating all of that metaverse world, would be a company in the planet than Adobe to be able to do that. So that's at 1 dimension, which is this exponential need for content is only going to increase.
I think the other way I think about what's happening in the metaverse, and if you think about it from that point of view is where prior only physical goods in creativity were deemed worthy of buying. I think now even all these virtual goods are going to have a value associated with it. And so when you think about what's happening with NFTs and blockchain. Again, Adobe, I think, is incredibly well positioned. We've already demonstrated some leadership in that with what we've done in Photoshop. And so I think the commerce aspects associated with not just large businesses, and we talked about the large businesses. But even individual businesses, I think Adobe is uniquely positioned.
I think opportunities like that. Adobe is probably a little bit more conservative than others in order to, in terms of putting it directly in our forecast for the year. But make no mistake. I mean, we're thinking about how these new opportunities, the fact that we bought a 3D company a while ago, the fact that we have Aero, and we're working with all of the OS providers in terms of thinking about augmented reality and virtual reality. We're absolutely in the middle of it. We're not just counting it in terms of what happens in terms of revenue off the top.
But if you take even more of a step and go to your question associated with how do we think about the opportunity, I will actually say, Kash, as we were all preparing as a group to prepare this, we had so much material. And we were talking about how do we try and condense it.
So I really hope you look at what than forced us to do, which is the deck has so much more information in it. We were trying to really provide sort of an abstract of all of that material. And I think it just reflects the interest that we have. I mean all 3 of our businesses, and let's go maybe digital experience. We've been talking about that for a while. And you're seeing just some tremendous adoption of our solutions in that. Digital is only going to go up and to the right, and I think Adobe is incredibly well positioned.
The real-time customer data platform, the experience platform, how we've unified our products. It actually reminds me of the really heavy lifting that we did many years ago in what we did on our content creation tools with the unified profiles and the data and insights to deliver value to our customers. So it feels really good.
I think what we are doing around Document Cloud, on the web, across surfaces, PDF, liquid mode in terms of the AI. We're really spending a lot of time thinking about how businesses are going to automate, what it means to have a hybrid work environment, which is clearly a big trend and really making sure that we unify that with respect to our innovation. So really fantastic job by the teams there across all surfaces.
And certainly, Creative Cloud, the heritage of the company, this notion of everyone who has a story to tell, I actually tend to think of it as the web has now come alive. The web's now come alive. And perhaps one of the things we didn't talk about, the biggest asset even on the web is Adobe's file formats. So the ability to deal with the Photoshop file format. The ability to deal with Illustrator for logos. The ability to deal with in design, if you want to create these flyers.
And actually for the creative community to participate in this massive community that's being created, we've done all the heavy lifting that now makes that magic possible. And we have a broader set of offerings than ever before in terms of being able to target people. Wherever you are in the world, we have pricing flexibility, and we have a DDOM that allows us to do it.
So I just take a step back and look at it and say, ""You know what, Adobe is really uniquely positioned."" We have a fabulous team. We didn't talk enough about that. certainly, my colleagues here and Dana, who is not on the stage, but our GC is an executive team as well as the 25,000 employees, don't take for granted what we have in terms of this motivated stuff.
And so I just look at it and say, we're focused on top line growth to the questions that Brent and others ask. We're always going to be focused on making sure that we have profitable growth and focus on the margin as well. But I feel just uniquely excited about the opportunities that we have.
The one thing I missed is unfortunately we're not all together. And please stay safe, stay healthy during this holiday season. I think that's the really important thing. But as a management team and as an employee base, I could not be more excited about the future that Adobe has. And so thank you very much all of you for joining us virtually, and thank you for the team for all of the work that went into the preparation. Have a nice day."

Anil will go over our digital experience strategy, and David will cover digital media strategy after that. And then Dan Durn, who joined in October as Adobe's Chief Financial Officer, will provide a detailed financial summary as well as discussing Adobe's long-term strategy.

Before we get started, as a reminder, some of the information we'll be providing includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those statements, and we encourage you to review the risk factors in our SEC filings for more information. Additionally, we'll be providing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics. Reconciliations between the 2 are available on Adobe's Investor Relations website. 
I will now pass it over to Adobe's Chairman and CEO, Shantanu Narayen."

Welcome to this Virtual 2022 Financial Analyst Meeting. Adobe had another outstanding year in 2021. I'm incredibly proud of the dedication and resilience of Adobe's 25,000 employees all around the world in delivering breakthrough technologies for our customers. 
I'd like to start with a recap of the tremendous accomplishments we had across every dimension in 2021. 
As a product geek at heart, I take immense pride in our team driving hundreds of innovations across Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Earlier this week, we introduced Creative Cloud Express to enable anyone to express their ideas simply and beautifully. Creative Cloud Express is the start of a brand-new journey, to introduce first-time creators to Adobe Creative tools while adding significant value to all of our current Creative Cloud subscribers. I think it marks a new chapter of creation, collaboration and sharing on the web and leverages the unique technology and capabilities of Adobe's flagship products. It also builds on the collaboration capabilities we debuted at MAX, including Illustrator and Photoshop on the web, Creative Cloud spaces and Creative Cloud Canvas. 
With the addition of Frame.io, we're now incorporating review and approval functionality to deliver a powerful collaboration platform for end-to-end video collaboration. And we're continuing to add magic to our flagship applications, and we're enabling them to run natively on new hardware like Apple's M1 chip as well as Microsoft Windows' Surface and Pen. 
In Document Cloud, Acrobat web now supports 21 frictionless verbs: create, export, extract and edit for both text and images in PDF. We've seen tremendous growth in Acrobat online as people tap our powerful, free browser-based document tools to handle important tasks on the fly without the need to download any software. In addition, we made outstanding progress with PDF support within both the Chrome as well as Edge browsers. 
And on the Experience Cloud platform, we extended our real-time customer data platform to B2B customers, bringing together individual and account profiles across systems to give B2B companies a single view of their customer for the very first time. We launched Adobe Journey Optimizer, harnessing over 20 years of industry-leading e-mail marketing and cross-channel campaign management expertise to empower brands to design and deliver personalized experiences across the entire customer journey in a single application. 
With the new acquisition of Adobe Workfront, we're now empowering companies to optimize business outcomes by connecting creative and marketing professionals to manage all creative workflows across the entire marketing life cycle. In addition, we've advanced our industry leadership in key areas across our portfolio. Clearly, underpinning our 3 clouds is the magic and power of Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, a significant differentiator for Adobe and an enabler to more rapid innovation. 
We continued our investment in the Adobe Experience platform as the foundational platform for strong governance capabilities across our Experience Cloud business, accelerating innovations like real-time customer data platform and Adobe Journey optimizer on a global scale. We take our responsibility in the creative community very seriously. And as part of the content authenticity initiative, we published a draft specification as an open standard to combat online disinformation. 
I'm amazed with the resiliency of our employees, and we pioneered all new digital event experiences with Adobe Summit and Adobe Max, extending our reach and engaging millions of people around the world. I'm also tremendously proud of the industry recognition we continue to receive for our brand, our workplace, our culture and our practices. And just to name a few examples. We were again named [ top ] riser on Interbrand's Best Global Brands list. We're named to Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For for the 21st year; People Magazine's Companies that Care list for the fifth year; Fast Company's Brands that Matter list. And I think what's most significant for a lot of investors moving forward, The Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth year. And one that I'm particularly proud of, a 100% score for being the best place to work for disability inclusion. 
When you look at our financial results, it puts us in an incredibly rare position in the industry. Not many companies can drive the top line and bottom line growth with an impressive margin the way we do, and we powered through $15 billion in 2021. And we accomplished some significant milestones in Q4, our first $1 billion digital experience revenue quarter, our first $3 billion digital media, and $2 billion in cash flow, just some incredible financial statistics. 
Dan Durn, our new CFO, will cover our Q4 as well as our FY '21 results in greater detail. Since he joined Adobe in October, I've really appreciated his experience and partnership, and I look forward to him sharing his perspective as well as having significant impact on Adobe's growth in the decade to come. 
I'm also delighted to announce that Anil Chakravarthy and David Wadhwani have been promoted to the President of the Digital Experience and Digital Media businesses, respectively. I value their leadership and contributions, and they will share more color around each of our businesses. 
While 2021 was awesome. I'm actually most excited about what's to come for 2022 and beyond in the over 20 years that I've been at Adobe. We have this immense market opportunity. We have an incredible technology innovation road map and the best leadership team of any company on the planet. And I think what we've done is provided 2022 targets that demonstrate the strength of the underlying business. 3 incredibly large-growing opportunities across our clouds, continued focus on execution based on the current economic climate. I think the one change that we all are experiencing is as the company scales beyond $15 billion, we also have to focus on FX expectations given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar. 
But as excited as I am to talk about 2022. Today is really sharing about Adobe's tremendous growth story and how we're going to be driving the next decade of growth because that's really what underpins our growing over $200 billion addressable market opportunity. As you'll hear throughout the day from our leadership team, our growth is anchored across these 5 key pillars: our proven track record and our focus on creating and leading categories; the ever-increasing expanding set of customers that we serve, from consumers to creative pros to first-time creators to small and medium businesses to the largest enterprises in the world; our ability to deliver incredible technology platforms that enable whole new classes of applications and accelerate our innovative cadence; the important shift we continue to make from building applications to enabling new business models apps, services, artificial intelligence and platforms that's paying dividends; and last but not least, an incredible global ecosystem of partners that spans the entire customer life cycle, from experience creation and marketing, to delivery and ongoing support. 
And I think the message for you as investors is across every dimension, across every business, our aspirations are higher, and we're thinking bigger. There's this incredible once-in-a-lifetime expansive opportunity in front of us, and I think we're uniquely positioned to capture it. 
And now to provide color on the strategy on how we're going to expand markets and categories, I'd like to welcome Ann Lewnes, who recently celebrated his 15th year at Adobe; our incredible Chief Marketing Officer, who's also taken on the additional responsibility for corporate strategy. Ann?"

Over the past 2 years, we've witnessed a profound global shift to all things digital. Everyone from students to small businesses to the largest global brands has had to make this dramatic pivot. Technolog",1532,"Thank you, Shantanu, and good morning, everyone. 
Over the past 2 years, we've witnessed a profound global shift to all things digital. Everyone from students to small businesses to the largest global brands has had to make this dramatic pivot. Technology innovation, the proliferation of new devices and platforms, and the increased desire and ability for anyone to create and deliver great digital experiences have all accelerated the move to a truly digital world, and there's no going back. 
Whether it's through your phone, tablet or PC, it's easy for anyone, anywhere to create, work, learn, connect, shop, unwind and launch and grow businesses. While there continue to be massive challenges in the world, digital has also empowered us. Through the democratization of creativity, the development of rich digital experiences, the ability to work and learn from home, to shop and sell products online, or to connect with those you love, we are moving society forward. Digital has fundamentally changed everything. 
According to Adobe Analytics, online spending during the 2021 holiday season is projected to be $200 billion, and total e-commerce spending is projected to reach $1 trillion in 2022. It's clear that digital is a requirement to conducting business today. From your favorite local restaurant to Fortune 500 companies across every country and every industry, digital is powering today's businesses. Companies are automating mission-critical document processes like HR and legal, to drive increased efficiency and agility. At the same time, customers now expect rich personalized digital experiences that are relevant, engaging and consistent across any device. 
It's well documented that digital-first businesses drive greater long-term growth and customer loyalty. At Adobe, our own technology has enabled us to transform into a digital-first business. Companies like Adobe are measuring every single customer interaction to understand behavior, intent and, ultimately, to drive business impact. We do that by providing personalized digital experiences at scale through adobe.com, across all of our digital channels and, increasingly, through our products. 
Digital has not only changed the way we live and work, but also how we connect with one another. Anyone can create or participate in an online community, whether it's with your family, friends, colleagues or those with whom you share interests and passions. And with the emergence of the creator economy, it's possible for enterprising content creators to build both a large following and monetize their passions, products or services. 
Today, there are seemingly unlimited number of social platforms and ways to engage with one's desired audience. The ease with which you can share, promote and monetize content, products and services has enabled a whole new level of connection and commerce. We're also finding new ways to work together even when we're apart through the proliferation of collaboration solutions like Frame.io, which we acquired in Q4. 
Adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences is more important than ever before. The digital world runs on Adobe's tools and platforms. And through our unparalleled innovation, creativity, scale and advanced data-driven operating model, we are continuing to catalyze the growth of digital. Hundreds of millions of people across the globe use our products every single day, and we're impacting every aspect of society. Adobe continues to be uniquely positioned to lead in this next digital era. 
Our 3 industry-leading cloud offerings are mission-critical across every geography and audience with Creative Cloud or unleashing creativity for all, giving anyone, anywhere, the tools to express their creativity. With Document Cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. And with Experience Cloud, we're powering digital businesses of all sizes, giving them everything they need to design and deliver great customer experiences. 
Underpinning our 3 clouds is the power of Adobe Sensei, our advanced AI ML framework that enables us to deliver a steady stream of unparalleled innovation. 
Over the last year, we've seen the critical role that creativity has played in the world. Creative Cloud is empowering everyone, from the high school student to the social media influencer to the most demanding creative professional to tell their story. The Creative Cloud TAM is projected to be approximately $63 billion in 2024. $25 billion of that TAM comes from our core base of creative professionals who purchased Creative Cloud applications and services like Adobe Stock. 
New growth drivers in this segment include 3D and other immersive experiences as well as web first collaboration tools like Frame.io. $13 billion of the TAM is coming from communicators, nonprofessional creators, including small businesses, students and marketers. As you'll hear from David, many communicators are already using Creative Cloud, and we hope to see even more of them with products like Creative Cloud express which we just launched on Monday. The remaining $7 billion of TAM comes from consumers including hobbyists and social media users. The biggest growth drivers here are mobile applications in categories like video and imaging such as Adobe's Photoshop Express. 
Digital documents are core to the future of work PDFs and document workflows empower everyone from individuals to the largest enterprises to be productive anytime, anywhere. We're excited about the Document Cloud strategy and the large addressable market, which is projected to grow to $32 billion by 2024. $10 billion of that TAM is coming from knowledge workers, business professionals who typically use our core Acrobat desktop subscription offerings. Growth is expected to come from the expansion of digital document use cases, e-signatures and increased collaboration capabilities. $8 billion of the TAM is coming from communicators, who are using Acrobat web and mobile applications to create, scan and edit PDF files for both business and personal use. Growth in this segment is projected to come from expanding the freemium PDF base and capturing demand from new funnels with offerings designed for web and mobile use cases. Finally, $14 billion of the TAM is coming from enterprises, who are using document services, including Acrobat and e-signature solutions as well as APIs that developers use to seamlessly integrate with key line of business applications. Growth drivers in this segment include APIs to build powerful document workflows and expanded use cases. 
Whether it's B2B or B2C, businesses of every size across every category are investing in customer experience management. Adobe Experience Cloud empowers companies to deliver predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences across every phase of the customer life cycle. Our total addressable market for Adobe Experience Cloud is estimated to be $110 billion in 2024. $33 billion of the TAM is coming from the data insights and audiences category, which includes Adobe Experience Platform, real-time CDP and Adobe Analytics, including our new customer journey analytics offering. Future growth drivers include the increasing demand for a unified customer profile and personalization at scale. $49 billion of TAM is coming from the content and commerce category, which includes our Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Commerce offerings. 
The volume of content needed by businesses to engage customers across every touch point is exploding and the pace at which it must be deployed is accelerating. The need for a seamlessly integrated commerce capability is accelerating at that same pace. $18 billion of the TAM is coming from the customer journeys category, which includes Adobe Campaign, Marketo Engage and our new Adobe Journey optimizer. Growth in this segment is expected to come from the continued need for businesses to engage with their customers across an ever-increasing array of channels. 
New to the TAM this year is the $10 billion marketing workflow category, which includes Adobe Workfront acquired last year. Growth here is expected to come from the increasing need for teams to efficiently plan, track and execute marketing campaigns. 
Adobe has always been relentlessly focused on looking around the corner, inventing new growth opportunities and successfully driving growth within our existing businesses. We have pioneered and are leading 3 massive categories: creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. This week, we announced Creative Cloud Express, our exciting new unified web and mobile offering that's perfect for anyone looking to quickly and easily make and share standout content. Creative Cloud Express is great for first-time creators and communicators, but will also provide value to our current Creative Cloud subscribers. It's a great example of how we continue to expand our customer base and grow our TAM. 
We win by creating enduring technology platforms, from Sensei to the Adobe Experience Platform. They are the foundation for product innovation and our industry-leading applications and services. 
Since transitioning Creative Cloud to a subscription model 10 years ago, we have continued to innovate our business models, building applications, services and platforms to bring value to market faster, better serve new customers and leverage new monetization models. It would be impossible to do all this alone. We have built a large ecosystem of partners, from agencies to solution integrators to ISVs, that customize and extend our solutions to the needs of our joint customers. We continue to see massive opportunities from Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. With the market tailwinds, our world-class innovation and the best employees in the world, we believe we're well positioned for our next decade of growth. 
And now I'd like to introduce Anil Chakravarthy, President of our Digital Experience business.

24321,698536199,2462550,"Adobe Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 16, 2021",2021-12-16,"Earnings Calls","Adobe Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ann. Hello, everyone. Good to be here with you. And I look forward to sharing more on our momentum, opportunity and strategy for the Digital Experience business. It's really an exciting time for us, as Ann shared. Let me begin by discussing a",846,"Thank you, Ann. Hello, everyone. Good to be here with you. And I look forward to sharing more on our momentum, opportunity and strategy for the Digital Experience business. It's really an exciting time for us, as Ann shared. 
Let me begin by discussing a couple of highlights from Q4. We had strong performance across the board. Our segment revenue cost over $1 billion for the first time with 23% year-over-year growth. Our subscription revenue grew to $886 million, up 27% year-over-year. And our subscription bookings in Q4 were up over 50% year-over-year. And with that, we were up over 40% year-over-year for full year FY '21. 
A lot of that was powered by the success of our Adobe Experience Platform and the native apps that run on it. It's foundational to our digital experience business. We invested early in the platform and have a significant head start having launched the platform in 2019. Our growth has accelerated. Earlier this year, we disclosed that we had passed over $100 million in revenue. And at the end of Q4, we surpassed $250 million in book of business, and we have seen a 300% year-over-year growth in customer count. 
The scale that we are operating in production is massive, over 21 trillion segment evaluations per day. And our ecosystem is extremely broad with over 300 partner integrations. And as Shantanu and Ann both mentioned, we have really accelerated our innovation over the past 18 months with new native applications and services powered by Sensei. 
A great example of this is Major League Baseball. They are leveraging digital to transform experiences for their customers with a focus on reaching that next generation of fans. And this is across all their channels. At home, on the go and in menu in the ballpark. They are focused on personalization at scale, delivering the right experience at the right time via the right channel to all of their fans. 
And it's not just Major League Baseball. It's clear that every business is a digital business and customer experience management is critical to business success. The changes in the tailwinds that we have seen during the pandemic are here to stay, and this has contributed to a strong momentum in our Digital Experience business. 
A couple of examples here again. Significant growth in average annual recurring revenue across our top 1,000, 100 and 25 accounts. We've seen strong growth across all accounts greater than $1 million in ARR. And all of our customers are building long-term partnerships with us. As an example, the combined total contract value of our top 10 accounts is $760 million, which is 3x higher than what it was at the end of FY '19. 
When we think about customer experience management, it is imperative for every company today to deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers. That's how they reach and engage all their customers across the world. And it's critical for them to do that to deliver that next level digital business growth. It's all about personalized experiences that are tailored to the individuals, delivered in real time and delivered seamlessly across online and off-line channels based on first-party data and making sure that they honor customer preference and privacy. 
And that's what we focus on. Our strategy is battle-tested and helps companies across the world achieve personalization at scale. We offer customers the best of both worlds: integrated AI-enabled comprehensive applications delivered on a real-time cloud scale platform. We have strong momentum with Workfront, with the ability to unify marketing workflow and increase marketing agility for all customers. And we are the strategic partner for customer experience management. I hear this from customers all around the world every day. And our ecosystem of partners is expansive with over 4,000 partners, as Ann mentioned, across ISVs, tech partners, system integrators and agencies. 
This is how we make this happen for our customers through the Adobe Experience Cloud. We focus on 4 key categories: content and commerce; data insights and audiences; customer journeys and marketing workflow, all delivered on a common platform, which is the Adobe Experience Platform. We've had a strong innovation engine over the last 18 months, and that's continuing both on the application layer as well as the platform with AI and machine learning capabilities in the platform powered by Adobe Sensei. This is a huge moat for us with the combination of a comprehensive set of applications and an integrated platform. 
In closing, I am incredibly excited about the opportunity we have for the digital experience business. We have strong momentum, and we are the clear leader in the customer experience management category. We have a large growth opportunity to help every company deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers around the world. And we have the best technology across our Adobe Experience platform and the native applications with the ability to grow rapidly as we have shown over the last couple of years.  
With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to David to cover the digital media business. David?"
24321,698536199,2462550,"Adobe Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 16, 2021",2021-12-16,"Earnings Calls","Adobe Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Anil, and hello, everyone.

As some of you know, I ran the digital media business during the transition to Creative Cloud. And while the business has certainly matured since the early days of that transition, some things haven't changed. Our product teams keep delivering incredible innovation and our business continues to show strong momentum. 
Now before we dive into what I'm personally excited about for FY '22 and beyond, I want to hit on some Q4 highlights. Our Digital Media business in the quarter delivered $571 million of net new ARR in total. With that, Creative Cloud crossed $10 billion in ARR, and we saw continued strength in our Creative Cloud offers, while seeing outsized growth for substance, which grew 100% year-over-year, thanks to increasing demand for 3D and the emerging metaverse platforms. We also saw outsized growth in our mobile applications, which grew over 55% year-over-year. Our mobile applications have now generated over 400 million mobile IDs to date and has been a great source of new user acquisition for us. On the Document Cloud side, we grew ARR 31% for the year, ending at $1.9 billion. 
A bit of color behind these numbers. We now have 2.5 billion mobile and desktop devices with Reader or Acrobat installed on them. We're seeing explosive growth in Acrobat Web, where we saw monthly active users grow over 100% since last year. And our strategy of integrating Adobe Sign and Acrobat is clearly paying off for us, with 85% year-over-year growth in Adobe Sign transactions in Acrobat. In aggregate, we ended the year with approximately $12.2 billion of ARR. 
And while we posted a great FY '22 -- FY '21, we have even more exciting opportunities ahead for us. Let's start by talking a little bit about Creative Cloud. 
The big picture here is that we're living in a time where content and creativity and design has never been more valued, where content is fueling the global economy, where the digital consumption is exploding and where virtually every business needs a digital presence. We're living in a world where creative expression is considered a 21st century skill in education. And we're living in a world where we're seeing emerging 3D and immersive technologies like the metaverse, creating demand for all new types of content. All of this continues to drive incredible tailwinds for Creative Cloud. 
In particular, though, I wanted to spend a minute on the rise of the creator economy where we're seeing a growing number of individuals, solopreneurs and small business owners creating businesses from their passions and monetizing their content, their goods or their services online. The creator economy is already big with nearly 100 million small businesses on social media and with the majority of them saying that their online presence is more important to their success than their physical presence. 
Now despite it being big, it continues to grow at an incredible rate with nearly 4.5 million new businesses minted in the U.S. alone last year, which was a record. This has been a significant contributor to our success and a major contributor to the over 600 million free and paid monthly active users across our digital media products who are not considered creative professionals. And of course, this expansive opportunity needs an expansive strategy that drives our mission for creativity for all. 
In the next few minutes, I'll lay out how Adobe can help anyone who wants to express themselves in creative ways. From a small business owner to the highest end production house, Adobe has a solution for them because of our investment in 5 key areas. And since we just launched Creative Cloud Express, I wanted to start by discussing how we empower the world with content first task-based creativity. Let's go ahead and start by looking at a video of Creative Cloud Express and what it can do.

First, we remove all barriers to adoption. It's free to get started. It doesn't require a desktop download because it's 100% web and mobile. It doesn't have a learning curve. And users can create an account and publish content in minutes. Second, it's got an unparalleled content library, so novice users can build beautiful images and social media posts, digital flyers and more in minutes. This includes 175 stock images from Adobe Stock, 20,000 fonts and thousands of templates and design assets. And it's all powered by a universal search capability that surfaces the right content and recommendations at the right time. Third, it leverages decades of Adobe's product innovation. As you'd expect, we have great workflows with our Creative Cloud applications, but it also includes a slew of Sensei-based quick actions that make creating and editing images, videos and PDF easier than ever before. And fourth, we understand that people create content with the intent to distribute it. So Creative Cloud Express has integrations for single-click publishing to social media services. And you can expect to see that our recent acquisition of ContentCal benefit -- will benefit CCX users with even more social planning and publishing capabilities in the very near future. 
Creative Cloud Express is easy to use and it's easy to get started with. Users can have a lot of success with the free tier, but they're also presented with freemium -- premium features and content for an affordable -- at an affordable monthly price. CCX is also entitled with most CC existing plans, which we expect will drive higher engagement and retention in our core Creative Cloud customer base. And the go-to-market motion is very familiar to us. We'll combine our digital acquisition funnels and our product-led growth motion tuned for web and mobile. This gives us an opportunity to continually iterate and optimize user journeys while ramping this business over time. We also plan to leverage our existing footprint across education, reseller and enterprise to scale the business. 
We're thrilled to have Creative Cloud Express in market today. It's been amazing to see what people can make with it. And we really couldn't be more excited about this moment and what this means for a start of a whole new journey for Adobe. 
So moving beyond Creative Cloud Express, we also have a lot going on across Creative Cloud as a whole. We're advancing the state of art in imaging, video and design and more by building new capabilities across desktop, web and mobile. For example, we introduced Photoshop and Illustrator for web at Adobe Max. And we released a series of new Sensei-driven AI/ML capabilities, including neural filters and auto masking in Photoshop and auto captioning in Premier, just to name a few. 
We also continue to -- our focus on democratizing 3D and immersive. Substance 3D now supports end-to-end 3D workflows. Users can design parametric 3D assets in Designer; compose rendering virtual scenes in Stager; add texture, color, effects in Painter; and create 3D materials with Sampler. This enables fully virtual photo shoots saving companies a lot of money and a lot of time and speeds up asset and scene creation for inclusion in games, videos and the emerging metaverse platforms. 
Collaboration is another big area of focus for us. We're putting -- we're integrating collaboration directly into our apps and existing creative workflows. We're very excited about the Frame.io acquisition and see tremendous opportunity across individual corporate and media workflows with that product. We shipped a public beta of share for review workflows at MAX, and we demoed Spaces in Canvas, which we believe will enable teams to organize their creative assets and host live working sessions. 
And last but not least, we continue to produce content that inspires and educates our users through services like Adobe Live. We help users monetize their work through services like Adobe Stock, and we help them connect and inspire each other through services like Behance, which now is closing in on almost 29 million members. 
These 5 strategic pillars work together to ensure that anyone with creative needs can find a solution at Adobe, whether they're a creative professional trying to keep up with the increasing content demand, or they're a communicator participating in the creator economy, or a consumer looking to up their game in photography, or a student developing 21st century skills. We use our data-driven operating model, DDOM, to engage them as they express their interest online by perhaps searching for something like compositing in Photoshop or designing a Twitter post. Based on their intent, we then route them to one of our Creative Cloud apps, one of our mobile apps, or one of our frictionless web quick actions. We make sure that they have early success, and then we introduce them to other capabilities in Creative Cloud or Creative Cloud Express before converting them to and engaging them as a paid user. This digital motion, combined with our reseller partners, our direct sales teams, gives us an amazing global footprint and reach. 
So in summary, everything is going digital and content is fueling the digital economy. The result is a massive and growing TAM for Creative Cloud, as Ann talked about earlier. And our offerings, which now include Creative Cloud Express, continue to expand to meet market demand for both professionals and nonprofessionals. We couldn't be more excited about the opportunity ahead for the Creative business. 
And as you know, the other part of the digital media business is, of course, our Document Cloud, which is also experiencing significant tailwinds. Demand for PDF has never been greater. In fact, web searches for PDF have doubled in the last decade. And we believe the reason for this is that PDF has become the de facto format for unstructured data. PDF has also been the de facto standard for business-to-business collaboration where nowhere is this more pronounced, of course, than with e-signatures. This makes PDF an essential part of modernizing any business workflow, and Adobe is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend. 
Our apps are installed on over 2.5 billion devices, and we've opened -- in our apps, we've opened or created 320 billion PDFs in the last 12 months alone. We continue to be a leading destination for PDF viewing and we saw 100 million free and paid sign-ups over the last year. And we see that Acrobat can be a gateway to related services. Adobe Sign transactions in Acrobat, as I mentioned earlier, have increased 85% year-over-year as we continue to deepen the integration between the 2 offers. 
Our strategy here is clearly working, and we're investing across 5 key motions to make sure it continues to. First, our document verb strategy has been very effective. We now have 21 verbs in market, everything from edit PDF to convert PDF to rotate PDF. And we're seeing continued -- and we're continuing to optimize our digital acquisition and increasing our share of voice across the 80 million PDF-related searches that happen every month. 
Second, we're proliferating e-signatures by integrating them into Acrobat across all services: desktop, web and mobile. Given our early success here over the last year, you can expect to see us continue bringing these products closer together in the years ahead. 
Third, we remain committed to making PDF more intelligent for both interacting and reading. Adobe is reinventing mobile PDF viewing with liquid mode. We're accelerating document productivity with automated form field detection, and we're helping transform unstructured data to structured actionable data with our AI/ML-based extract functionality. 
Fourth, we're unlocking business workflows through our PDF and sign APIs. This empowers developers to build document automation solutions that transform how their businesses work. 
And fifth, we're leveraging our diversified go-to-market motions to reach anyone with a document need. Our global resellers and inside sales teams give us amazing access to a broad base of business demand. Our enterprise sales team allow us to sell tops down to CIOs looking to transform their business. And perhaps most importantly, our digital funnel continues to drive individual users into our conversion funnels. 
Knowledge workers, communicators, IT decision-makers and developers all have frictionless onboarding pathways. Our data-driven operating model helps customers discover Adobe technology when they're seeing -- when they're searching for PDF-related verbs. And we engage them in ways that provide quick success on web, mobile and desktop before upselling them to freemium features -- premium features, products, services or APIs that broaden their engagement with Adobe over time. In short, Document Cloud is incredibly well positioned for the years ahead. 
I hope this gives you a sense of why we're excited about both the creative and document businesses. In summary, both businesses are benefiting from significant tailwinds that are underpinning their large and growing TAMs. Both businesses are realizing the market benefits by leveraging our amazing brand awareness, our go-to-market footprint and our incredible pipeline of innovation. And both businesses have the opportunity to supercharge their existing data-driven operating model by pairing it with a product-led growth motion as our capabilities increasingly are accessed by users on web and mobile. So we're really excited about the year ahead. 
And with that, I wanted to turn it over to Dan."

Let me begin by saying how thrilled I am to be here today and be a part of this amazing team at Adobe. Having just been here for a few months, it's obvious what a special company this is, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.
Now let me jump in with Adobe's Q4 results. Adobe achieved revenue of $4.11 billion, a significant milestone, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted EPS was $2.57, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.20. Digital Media segment revenue was $3.01 billion.  The business' first $3 billion quarter, which represents 21% year-over-year growth, with net new Digital Media ARR of $571 million. Digital Experience achieved its first $1 billion quarter, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $886 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. We had record cash flows from operations of $2.05 billion in the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our stock.
Turning to our 3 strategic clouds. It was a tremendous finish to the year. In Q4, Adobe achieved $2.4 billion in creative revenue and added $430 million of net new Creative ARR. We exited the year with more than $10 billion of ending Creative ARR with strong performance throughout the year. Growth drivers in the quarter included acquisition of new users on adobe.com, strength in our team's offering, seasonal Q4 strength in the enterprise and success co-selling Frame.io with our Creative Cloud enterprise offerings. However, while we saw increased demand for our offerings during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks, we did not see the traditional spikes we have had in previous years. This is consistent with this year's industry trends, in line with e-commerce holiday shopping data from the Adobe Digital Economy Index.
Adobe Document Cloud achieved $532 million in Q4. Revenue continues to be our -- and continues to be our fastest-growing business. We added a record $141 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter with ending ARR of $1.93 billion, growing 31% year-over-year. Our integrated document platform is clearly resonating with customers around the globe. We continue to see momentum with enterprises, small businesses and individuals using web and mobile first tools.
In digital experience, we achieved our first $1 billion revenue quarter. We're seeing strong demand for our real-time experience platform and app services as large enterprises are making investments in Adobe to drive customer experience management and personalization at scale. We drove record Q4 net subscription bookings. And for the full fiscal year, we grew net ASV greater than 40% year-over-year. 
Let's look quickly at the annual numbers. Adobe's financial performance in the year was outstanding with both top line acceleration and margin expansion in the year resulting in more than $7 billion of operating cash flow. And remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to nearly $14 billion, absolutely world-class performance.
Now let's discuss what a unique investment opportunity Adobe is. These are some of the outstanding qualities of Adobe that have energized me about the opportunity, and it's what ultimately brought me here today. There's a fundamental shift towards digitization that's accelerating around the globe. And I believe Adobe is better positioned than any other company to capitalize on these opportunities. Combining that with Adobe's financial track record as well as industry-defining products and platform, the result is an immense runway ahead of this company for growth.
Let me elaborate a bit more on my view of this opportunity. In the years ahead, there's going to be fundamental shifts in all aspects of our lives, all of them digitally enabled. Digital enablement will increasingly shape and define how we live, how we create, how we communicate, how we collaborate, how companies serve their customers, how companies compete and how economies function. These changes are both powerful and pervasive. I call it the digitization of everything.
The digitization of everything is accelerating. And I believe what happens in the next 10 years is going to define the rest of the century, similar to what happened in the Industrial Revolution. Except now, digital content and data are going to be the fuel of the digital economy. This is a generational opportunity. And we're talking about unlocking trillions of dollars of economic value in the global economy.
When you look at Adobe's foundational strengths, there's a very few companies that is as leveraged to the digitization of the global economy as well as we are. From the way people create and communicate, to the future of productivity and digital collaboration in a distributed work environment, to the digitization of businesses, driving customer engagement with data-driven insights to personalize customer experiences but do it at massive scale, to AI and machine learning, global trends towards digitization have so many intersections with Adobe's unique strengths. Again, digital content and data are the fuel of the digital economy. And I believe no one is better positioned than Adobe to be the digital enabler of the world. How many companies on the planet have this profile? How many companies have this opportunity? Not very many. When I think about our near-term strengths, combined with our long-term opportunities, there's a uniqueness here that's incredibly exciting.
Let's double-click on the company's financial performance and take a closer look at what I'm talking about. Starting with revenue growth. You can see consistent sustained revenue growth over the last 4 years as the company has grown subscription revenues at a 24% CAGR. That has been the strategy, continuing to grow while producing a revenue stream that's even more ratable and predictable. I'm incredibly impressed by this team's acumen and what they've been able to accomplish as well as by the contribution to revenue growth from newer initiatives, including Adobe Stock, Substance 3D, Acrobat Web, Sign, Creative Cloud, mobile apps and the Adobe Experience Platform.
Underlying this financial performance is an incredibly diverse business from our broad base of customers to diversified products and platforms, comprehensive business models and go-to-market reach that spans across all geographies.
With growing and diverse revenue streams, the company has been able to expand profitability over the last 4 years, while accelerating the top line. Adobe's disciplined execution and investment rigor has enabled the company to balance long-term investments while also focusing on profitability. This time period also includes the integration of several strategic acquisitions, Magento, Marketo Algorithmic, Workfront, Frame.io. It's impressive the way Adobe has managed to combine expanded profitability with strong, sustained top line growth and M&A integration.
Let's talk about RPO, contractually committed future revenues, which make Adobe's future performance, incredibly predictable and reliable. Exiting fiscal year 2021, RPO grew 23% on the strength of our enterprise bookings. RPO consists of deferred revenue and unbilled backlog with the current portion expected to flow into revenue over the next 12 months. It's also important to note that most of our adobe.com subscriptions are billed monthly and don't show up as deferred revenue. The remaining contractual commitments of those subscriptions, which average about 6 months in length at any given time, are included in unbilled backlog.
The cash flow performance really speaks for itself as you can see the way our operating cash flows have accelerated over the last 2 fiscal years, sustained growth and profitability at scale is not easy to achieve. The momentum at Adobe is strong, as evidenced by our first $2 billion quarter of operating cash flows. A strong capital structure with robust investment-grade credit rating positions us to continue to drive growth and provides flexibility, making access to capital affordable for Adobe.
Let's talk about our capital allocation strategy. First, we focus on investing in the business to drive long-term growth. Given the tremendous opportunities in front of us, some of our recent innovative R&D initiatives include our next-generation data platform as well as Creative Cloud Express, which we announced earlier this week. We're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing to scale those businesses globally.
Second, our cash and investment balances as well as our debt capacity enable inorganic growth opportunities. You've seen the way we've accelerated growth and made accretive strategic additions over the last fiscal year with Workfront and Frame.io.
Lastly and importantly, we focus on returning capital to our shareholders. Our stock repurchase program is funded through growth in our operating cash flows, and you can see how successful we've been in driving down the average shares outstanding over the last 4 years. Since 2018, we've returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. Exiting Q4, we have $13.1 billion of remaining stock repurchase authority through the end of our fiscal 2024.
The hallmark of a great technology company is consistent innovation in category-defining products. Adobe has done that across all its businesses and we'll dive into each of them next to discuss the performance drivers.
First, creative. The company has driven sustained ARR and revenue growth, which accelerated from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. Let me tell you about the underlying data-driven operating model used to drive this performance. It all starts with innovation and the most comprehensive industry-defining portfolio of products. Our brilliant marketing campaigns generate awareness about Adobe's offerings, and drive traffic to adobe.com to engage customers to try, buy, use and renew.
It's about taking creators on a journey. First, with simpler applications, including our mobile, tablet and web applications, connecting them with vibrant creative communities and then providing journeys that empower them to do more as they advance, including services like Adobe Stock, cloud libraries and collaboration features. Now with the addition of Frame.io and Creative Cloud Express, we're continuing to grow the business by broadening the aperture and reaching new creators and stakeholders that will power the world's content. 
We continue to drive strong growth for Document Cloud. Again, you see this in the sustained revenue growth, with ARR growing even faster as the business shifts to being increasingly subscription-based. With approximately 90% of Document Cloud revenues in FY 2021 now being subscription. The main Document Cloud growth driver continues to be new user acquisition. We're seeing strong growth of Acrobat on adobe.com across geographies, growth on the web as well as in mobile and seed expansion in the enterprise. PDF and document workflows are mission critical to the way people work and collaborate in the digital-first world.
As Anil mentioned earlier, there's tremendous growth opportunity within our cohort of large customers. As we focus on cross-selling and moving them along the maturity curve towards the transformational adoption of our entire platform and set of customer experience management solutions. The average ARR and total contract value of our largest customers demonstrate how massive this opportunity is. And we grow by adding new logos to our customer base and then expanding within those accounts on multiyear journeys.
As impressive as this company's track record is, I believe there's even more growth ahead of us. I fundamentally believe there's a $1 trillion market cap opportunity in Adobe's future, having crossed the $15 billion mark in revenue. What does the path to $30 billion look like? And then from there, how are we going to get to $45 billion? It starts with an estimated $205 billion TAM and a huge ecosystem that we've built around our market-leading products and services. How are we going to get there? 
We're going to continue to broaden our appeal to a wider universe of customers, engage and retain our current customers across all geographies. We're also going to grow by innovating and investing to enter new categories that further complement and expand our growth trajectory and better enable our customers in the digital era. When we execute on that strategy over the next decade, our scale and success will put Adobe in a class that only a few software companies have achieved.
Having passed the $15 billion revenue mark, we're going to start reporting revenues in constant currency given the potential impact of foreign exchange movements. Following a year in which FX was a tailwind to reported revenues, the recent U.S. dollar strength is expected to result in a headwind to our reported revenue and growth rates for fiscal year 2022. Consistent with our annual practice, we've revalued our Digital Media ARR balance to account for the movements in the FX rates.
For operating expenses, we continue to save on travel and facilities in fiscal year 2021 while many of our employees continue to work from home. We expect these expenses to ramp throughout FY 2022. We also plan to invest in increasing headcount and integrating Frame.io. We believe these are critical investments we're making -- we believe these are critical investments we're making, and we're going to focus relentlessly on the organic growth opportunities ahead.
Lastly, fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year with an extra week in Q1. That week added approximately $267 million of revenue and $25 million of net new Digital Media ARR. The math around the return to a 52-week fiscal year is expected to be a 2-point headwind on our full year FY '22 growth rates and a 7-point headwind in Q1.
Here's Adobe's fiscal year 2022 annual targets. We show our segment growth targets on an actual and adjusted basis in constant currency, factoring for the additional week last year. 
Total Adobe revenue of approximately $17.9 billion. Net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.9 billion, Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 16% year-over-year, or 19% on an adjusted basis. Tax rate of approximately 17.5% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $10.25 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $13.70.
For Q1 of fiscal 2022, we're targeting revenue of approximately $4.23 billion. Net new digital media ARR of approximately $400 million. Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 8% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 11% year-over-year or 18% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 20% on an adjusted basis. Tax rate of approximately 16% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.63 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.35.
I want to conclude by sharing what this company has achieved over the last 4 years, whether it's revenue growth and profitability, outstanding cash flow generation and shareholder returns, Adobe's track record demonstrates why this company is in a class of its own. I firmly believe that our best days are ahead. 
Thanks so much for your time today. I'm going to now pass it back to Shantanu."

As I said earlier, I'm incredibly excited about Adobe's future and our ability to not only lead but also create new categories.",999,"Thank you, Dan, and thanks as well to Ann, Anil and David for outlining the opportunities across our 3 industry-leading clouds. As I said earlier, I'm incredibly excited about Adobe's future and our ability to not only lead but also create new categories.
I think if you zoom out a little bit and think about it from a macro perspective, all over the world, it's clear that digital is empowering individuals, transforming businesses and connecting communities. And frankly, digital is going to play a much bigger role in work, life and entertainment going forward. 
We've seen the rise of the creator economy and the democratization of creativity. Work and education are now hybrid and here to stay in that form. Cloud and web technology advances are powering unprecedented levels of real-time collaboration. Document workflows are increasingly going to be automated. And most important, the mandate for our digital business is more urgent than ever before as customers now expect digital-first experiences that are both contextual as well as personalized. 
E-commerce growth is building on the record highs achieved during the pandemic. From a technology base, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become indispensable facilitators of our daily lives. And so I think, in short, digital technologies are enabling more people to create, collaborate, learn, work, be productive and make a living than ever before. 
I love our mission, and the ability to change the world through digital experiences puts us at the nexus of all of these trends. We're incredibly well positioned to drive meaningful impact across every aspect of society, and that will benefit billions of people around the world for years to come.
As we think about the company at Adobe, we believe it's not just what we do, but it's also how you do that it really matters. From the very beginning, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, our founders, committed to building a company that does the right thing. And the sense of purpose has guided our evolution and growth over the past 4 decades. I think we're all witnessing the shift in the role that companies have to play in social issues and the expectations that stakeholders and investors have for corporations.
As you reflect on how companies have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. It's been remarkable with that stakeholders around the world are looking to the private sector to become more active in social issues, and people are making decisions on the products that they buy and the places that they work based on where companies stand.
As our products have become ubiquitous and we've helped many more companies harness the transformative power of our digital technologies, our responsibility and our commitment to corporate citizenship has also grown dramatically. And I believe that the issues on which Adobe is uniquely positioned to make an impact are on Adobe For All making sure we create a diverse and inclusive culture for our employees as well as position that for our customers and partners. On the belief that technology will transform and in addition to providing technology, we have a responsibility to understand what that means. And I think most important to being able to allow everyone who has a story to tell their story, the notion of creativity for all.
The reality is that we've been leaning into these for several areas already, and our efforts are making a real impact across the company and our customer communities for many years. But I think it's this purpose that motivates our employees to focus on having more impact and, frankly, inventing the future.
I love the fact that our strategy has remained relatively consistent for the past decade. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, to accelerate document productivity and to power digital businesses is more mission-critical than ever before. I think most companies would be thrilled, frankly, to have one of these growth opportunities. And we're fortunate that we have 3 businesses that are absolutely in the sweet spot of where the world needs technology to play a more important role. We have the right strategy. It's applied to an exceptional and growing opportunity, and so we're in no way opportunity constrained.
I'm going to end with how I started. I believe that Adobe is uniquely positioned to drive the next decade of growth. We have a proven capability to create and lead categories, and we're always looking around the corner to the white space that exists that will provide new opportunities for Adobe.
We're thinking bigger about every part of our business, how we scale and how we expand the customers that we serve. We continue to focus on innovation, delivering leading products, services and platforms as we leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're continuously thinking about innovating in business models as well to rapidly deliver more value to a larger set of customers, to capitalize on global growth opportunities and to enable new monetization models that are emerging. And at the end of the day, our technology support a vibrant and growing ecosystem of partners that create, customize and extend our solutions to meet the unique needs of our joint customers.
But at the end of the day, our greatest asset as being an intellectual property company and what's truly driving our growth is a highly engaged global employee base, over 25,000 strong to whom I'm eternally grateful.
Thank you again for joining us today. I believe 2021 was a fantastic year, and we clearly expect that momentum to continue in 2022 and beyond. As we look forward to our 40th anniversary next year, Adobe stands in an enviable position, an impressive track record of innovation, category and brand leadership, great financial performance and multiple growth opportunities. Coupled with the expanding market opportunity, the depth of our technology platforms and the motivated employee base, I certainly believe that Adobe's best days are ahead of us.
And with that, we'll roll a video while we assemble the management team for our Q&A.

Firstly, it was a record quarter as well as it was a record year. And when we think about what our digital media guide was, I mean we certainly expected Frame to close in the quarter, and it closed pretty early in the quarter. And so what we do is we think about a range of outcomes and what that might do, and certainly, we wanted to focus on Frame as well, but it was probably not explicitly factored into the quarter.
When you consider it from different customer segments, the team business actually performed really well right through the quarter. And so the team's offering and the strength in the small and medium business was great.
Enterprise, we actually actively redirected and pivoted the team to think about video and Frame and how we were continuously selling it. As I said, it closed early in the quarter. And so Enterprise had the traditional Q4 strength as well that we normally expect. 
The individual demand was actually fairly strong right through the year. As Dan mentioned, maybe the one slight change is that as you think about what's happening with online shopping, while we continue to see demand up and to the right, we perhaps did not see as much of the spike as you would have perhaps seen traditionally in either the Black Friday or the Cyber Monday weeks. But apart from that, strength and demand continues to be strong. And clearly, we factored that into our guidance for fiscal 2022, which is the strongest ARR guide that we've ever guided to.
I think as it relates to the product and the differentiation, maybe I'll have Scott touch on that, and then David can certainly speak to other issues of the business."

In terms of product differentiation for Creative Cloud, I mean what a year we had. We delivered some of the mind-blowing Adobe Magic throughout our actual Pro products, neuro filters in Photoshop, for example, a lot of the collaboration features. And we really made a proclamation that Creative Cloud going forward will be as much about collaboration as it is about creativity, which if you think about it, invites many more stakeholders of creativity into the fold. And that's what we're seeing across all of our enterprise as well as small businesses. Everyone wants to be a stakeholder and have a say and be able to jump in and give feedback. And so we're building our products for the future to enable that.
I also want to mention, of course, last week, we launched Creative Cloud Express. This is just the start of an amazing new chapter for us. We've had a number of products in the market in our incubation zone, we call it, as we learn about how to really fulfill our mission of creativity for all. And now we've galvanized on all of the learnings, all of the signals, and we just couldn't be more excited about the new journey we're on here with that product in particular."

So as you start looking at where we're going with the business, we're building on the momentum. As we talked about, we had 2 -- almost $2 billion of net new ARR added in FY '21. We had our strongest guide ever, and it's really on the back of that. One more thing with regard to Creative Cloud Express and how that will start to drive opportunity for us. It can start by actually adding a lot of new users to the franchise. One of the things that we've been doing a phenomenal job with, and I think this expands, is bringing new users to Adobe, getting them successful with what they're doing, and then start to mature them up the value curve into Creative Cloud subscription or now Creative Cloud Express subscription.
But we're also making this available to all Creative Cloud customers. This is something that we see a lot of Creative Cloud customers occasionally want speed and content first development. For those users, we see the opportunity to really drive higher engagement and retention, even beyond where we already are.
And then as you start to have more plans that are separated for the kinds of things people want to do, it gives us the opportunity to drive more price optimization across the lines as well. So we're very excited about where we're heading and what this really adds to the mix we have."

So just give us a sense of mix. Like what -- now it's the back of the year and you had looked back at COVID impacts both in the first half and the second half, the holiday season.

And let me maybe roll back a little bit to what we accomplished in 2020 and then how we guided for 2021. 
As you know, we guided a little bit below what our 2020 guidance was in 2021 when we started. And we certainly outperformed that guidance as it relates to Digital Media ARR accomplishment in 2021. And if you look at how we've guided for 2022, it's actually a little bit closer to our 2021 guide as a starting point. And so clearly, we continue to be incredibly optimistic associated with the underlying strength of the business. The overall need for creativity just continues.
We don't believe in any way, shape or form, there were sort of pull-ins, and I know that sort of exists for other companies. We just continue to see secular strength and some of the new initiatives that we have underway. I mean we've really pivoted the team to be thinking about enterprise and video. We have Creative Cloud Express. The usage is going to build dramatically. We already have the largest communicator business, I think, among the creative community. So we're incredibly optimistic about how that business looks. 
And then if you look at it from a quarterization perspective. Again, let's just go back and look at what we guided in Q1 of 2021. As you know, when we guided to a number, we were factoring in the $24 million that we outlined was an additional part of what we accomplished as part of the 13 versus 14 week. And so if you look at it, it's very much in line. In other words, the trends of the business continue, and the optimism in the business continues. So that's how I would think about it, Alex."

If you take a step back, I think this just speaks to the enormous opportunity that exists for creators. And if you look at our offerings already today, Keith, I mean, we have an incredible diversity of offerings. We have Photoshop Express on mobile that's doing great as it relates to the ARR. And we have the Creative Cloud product that also allows now the substance 3D products, that's probably the most expensive.
And so I think with online and our DDOM, we now have absolutely the ability to target and personalize our offerings against a broader set of customers and to make sure that we make it all net positive and net from a customer satisfaction as well as a net positive from the ARR that we accomplished.
A couple of other things. I mean first, our creative business with the communicator segment is already the largest creative business in the world. I mean, when you think about what's happening with Photoshop or Lightroom or the Express set of products. And I think what Express really does is it actually adds value to every single creative cloud subscriber. I mean they are creative cloud subscribers who are incredibly proficient in video who sometimes want to do a quick flyer associated with it. And so I think this brings more and more and more people into the fold. It's similar, frankly, to what we've done with the Document Cloud, where when you think about what's happening with this organic demand that we've created for PDF. And so net-net, I think it's accretive. 
And then I'll hand it over to David to speak specifically about how this might roll out, but it is actually an enabler for us, and it unifies, frankly, all of the different creative offerings that we've already had for the communicator segment."

Just adding to that, we look at this as a really pivotal moment in terms of our ability to fulfill a need that we know our customers have. If you think back to what we talked about earlier, we have 400 million IDs that have been created on mobile devices already. we have 600 million monthly active users across our digital media products that are not creative professionals. And Creative Cloud Express represents an opportunity to give all of them something that we can onboard them to in an effective way. 
As Shantanu also talked about, one of the things that we find really exciting about this is that our Creative Cloud base as well is looking for sometimes -- often, they're looking for the power and precision of our creative flagship applications. But sometimes, they just want a velocity-driven, content-first creation model, too. And by giving Creative Cloud Express to most of our Creative Cloud plans, we expect to drive even higher engagement and retention there.
And the last thing I want to say is that this fundamentally expands how we think about our go-to-market motion. We have talked for the last many years about our data-driven operating model and how that drives our ability to pull and acquire users, bring them into our acquisition funnels. With product-led growth because of our increasing investment in mobile and web, we have the ability to do a lot more quick iteration and optimize the user journey, so that conversion of that 600 million mile into paid and premium customers, and engagement with them continues.
And the last thing I will say is that I don't think you can look at this market as you've got nonprofessionals and professionals. We have a lot of nonprofessionals that really want to use the power and precision of Creative Cloud. And so we look at this as this ongoing seamless journey from the first time you come and you want to do something with creative expression, you can do it for free with Creative Cloud Express. We then move you up that chain so you have the premium content and availability of the premium features and content in Creative Cloud Express paid plan. And then we see people are able to actually move all the way up to the power and precision of Creative Cloud. So it's really a seamless end-to-end journey."

But one of the very exciting things that we've learned over the last few years is really around the distinct customer needs that were just not covered, frankly, by Spark or Photoshop Express, other things we were doing or other kind of competitive tools out there. And I just wanted to share a few of those because I think they're really relevant. 
I mean first of all, we're seeing a lot of these customers that come in, wanting to make something with a template. They want to be able to go further. So our product team is actually very excited about the prospect of a customer being able to make something and then take it to the next level using one of our more pro-ish applications like Photoshop or Illustrator. 
Also the desire for artificial intelligence. A lot of customers come in from small businesses, et cetera, and they have an idea of what they want to make, but they want some assistance in making something remarkable. They want fonts to be recommended to them. They want colors that will perform better on social media. And so we have an opportunity to do that.
And then finally, the idea of a multimedia editor was another really important insight for us in the development of Creative Cloud Express. Because what we learned is that while a lot of customers come in through the top of the funnel because they want to make a flyer, they want to edit a video, they want to edit an image. When they come in, they actually realize, maybe I'll add some animation, maybe I'll add some sound. And before you know it, it's a multimedia creation. And so we're very much building Creative Cloud Express, not just for where the customer is now, but where we see the market going. People are going to want to stand out with their media, and that's something that I believe Adobe can uniquely deliver with this product."

And every company companies, B2C companies, B2B companies and companies that are experimenting with new business models, direct to consumer, for example, they're all starting to invest across the board in digital experience. And we see that play out across all of the categories that I laid out. Definitely with 1 view of the customer, a single view of the customer that carries through the unified profile that we have in the Adobe Experience platform, that is at the heart of all customer engagement. So if you kind of map it to how we think of our DDOM, everything from discover to try, to buy, to use, to renew, that whole journey needs a common unified profile so that you can deliver a consistent experience across all channels. And that's a major investment that all companies are making.
And so what we've been able to do is to really take advantage of all of the knowledge we have and the applications we have across all of these areas and populate that data in the Adobe Experience platform. And that gives us a clear head start with every company, and then say -- then opening it up by saying that it is open to developers, the data model is an open data model. It runs on top of a cloud so that it's horizontally scalable. That has really made it something that every enterprise of any size can use, but they can also get started in a particular geography or in a particular business unit or a customer segment and scale from there.
So I'm really excited. I think across our categories, we definitely see a lot of strength. And more as we now see some of the trends that we've just talked about with the creative economy and so on, that will continue to add more use cases that will be built on top of the platform."

The innovation that went into the building of the experience platform and the unification, frankly, of everything that Anil has talked about, whether it's content and commerce, whether it's data and insights, whether it's the marketing flow associated with Workfront, which is also doing well, there really isn't another company that enables somebody, whether you're the marketer, the Chief Revenue Officer, the Chief Digital Officer, to very quickly say, I want to get all my data, whether it's online or off-line, into one particular place. And even more important, to activate it. And so I think from my perspective, the momentum associated with having this unified platform and you can get customers really up and running so rapidly, that's pretty amazing.
The second thing I would say is that we've done a really good job with the Digital Strategy Group as well as what Anil had outlined earlier about these transformative accounts. And so again, as we shared in the data, the ability to sell multiple solutions, the ability to upsell, the ability to co-sell, I think that also gives us a lot of confidence that now we have the platform, we have the apps and services on it, we have the AI associated with it. And I think if you take a step back, there isn't a company that doesn't want to talk to us about, a, Adobe, how did you do it? And b, how do we really make sure that we can get this up and running and activate it faster. 
So I really hope in 2022, you'll see how we make increasing progress in terms of not only just the selling, but the provisioning and, frankly, the value realization. And I think we've done a good job on that front as well under Anil's leadership."

I think the best place to start is underlying performance of the business. I think we're exposed to great market opportunities. Companies got the right strategy and performing well against those strategies. 
As we think about performance in the current environment against that backdrop of good performance, we want to strip out noise in the 1-year look ahead set of numbers. And I think there's 2 things that we point to when we separate the noise from what's been communicated. First is FX. Second is the extra 53-week versus 52-week. And so let's go 1 layer deep in each of those. 
As we think about the 53 versus 52-week, that's about a 2% adder to growth for the overall company in fiscal '21. And as we window into fiscal '22, that's going to be about a 2-point headwind. Because that extra week occurred in Q1, and you look at Q1 FY '22, it's about a 7-point headwind from just that 1 extra week alone as we look 1 quarter forward.
As we take a look at FX and we think about the currency moves. Not surprisingly, FX for our business over 2021 also added about a 2-point tailwind from a growth perspective, broadly speaking, across the business. As we look forward into the next year, it creates about a 1 point headwind given the recent moves that we've seen over the last couple of weeks -- I'm sorry, last couple of months of the dollar strengthening versus a variety of currencies around the globe. That gives you a sense of the magnitude of the moves from both of those 2 factors as we extract underlying performance from a bit of the noise we see.
If we were to go to 1 click further down and take a look at how both of those factors affect the Digital Media business versus the Digital Experience business. I would say from the 52 versus 53-week dynamic, you'll see more of that upside and more of that headwind from a growth standpoint impacting the DME business than you do the DX business. But it's just a slight difference between the 2 businesses, depending on how we engage commercially with our customers, and I can go into that in a little more detail if you'd like.
On the FX side, you see a similar dynamic. You see slightly accentuated performance to the upside and downside tailwind and headwind from FX on the Digital Media business than you do on the DX business. It's a slight change, but you see a slight bias to the upside and downside of DME versus DX. I think that unpacks the numbers and gets to the true underlying performance of the company.
And as you take a step back and look at how our businesses have performed over the last couple of years, you'll see what we've just guided is about in line with where we've been for the last couple of years. So again, the company continues to perform pretty well."

First is, as Dan tells me, which is, first, welcome to the big leagues. And so I guess when you're $15 billion of revenue, it's neither practical, and it's, frankly, too expensive to hedge all the FX exposure that you were accustomed to maybe we're doing. 
So if you strip out that FX part, and if you think about ARR, just very tactically to be clear. What we do is we have an ARR at the beginning of the year. With the strength of the dollar in November, you could argue it's the hardest compare on a pure FX. And then we both devalue the beginning book of business on ARR, and then we are using that dollar rate for the ARR for the quarter.
And so then, again, if you think about it, at a $1.9 billion guide that we have for ARR, clearly, the underlying strength of business and the units, that is not what's impacting the business. So just I think that's the other way that I unpack what was the impact of FX as well as to specifically tell you how we take the dollar rate at the beginning of the year for the ARR calculation."

And then certainly, with the benefit of the enterprise selling and the top down, we're able to go and have solution-oriented conversations with them.
But one of the key areas that we've been focused on over the last 12 months that have really been productive for us is to leverage our footprint in terms of our desktop applications, predominantly things like Reader across mobile, desktop and web, and drive awareness and utilization of our services through that. As I mentioned earlier, we saw an 85% year-over-year increase in terms of Adobe Sign transactions that were successfully completed or initiated in Acrobat. And you can expect to see us continue to do that. We want signatures and Adobe Sign to be available to anyone that uses Acrobat going forward, and we'll continue to double down on that strategy."

I think that just really enables us given we have the APIs and the developer motions to really even further extend that. But this notion of automating document workflows is just going to continue to go up into the right."

So you will see some of those costs come back, and that's reflected in our guide. 
And so when we take a look at the opportunity in front of us and we think about the runway for growth, we think about how well we're positioned in each of our respective businesses, and we think about where the world is going and the key enablement role we, as a company, can play to enable that digitization of the world, we're going to invest for growth. We're going to invest in market-leading and defining products. And we're going to continue to lead the way we've done in the past. So you'll see some of that complement the investments we're going to make. 
And then as you think about the Adobe Experience Platform and you think about Creative Cloud Express, we're going to invest in sales and marketing to grow and scale those businesses globally. So we're going to be oriented to growth, and you'll see that reflected in both the performance and the decision-making going forward."

And if you look at our 2022 targets, it actually continues to show a lot of optimism in what we can do. I think Frame.io is a little dilutive.

If you look at the Adobe Digital Index, what has clearly happened over the last 12 months, 18 months, even pre-pandemic, but certainly during the pandemic is there's more and more activity happening online. That is a secular trend that's actually not going to change. We see it. There's more energy, there's more traffic, there's more activity associated with what's going online. 
If you look at what I think a lot of companies are looking at, the traditional spikes that you may have seen. A couple of weeks, the Black Friday week or the Cyber Monday week. I think those are maybe a little bit more muted because it's a little bit more of that traffic. You're seeing actually a steady growth as opposed to those spikes.
So if I take a step back and think about our Digital Media business teams and the small and medium business, nice performance. If I look at the enterprise, as I said, traditional close to the quarter. If I look at the individual business, a little bit of those spikes that we would have seen, we did see growth. We did see growth in both of those weeks, but it was perhaps a little bit less than that. And then you're back to, again, the secular demand.
So as I think about the business. It's not about the long-term demand. It's not about the market leadership of our products. I think it's just a little bit of how maybe online shopping globally has changed a little bit in terms of what the experience is. So that's what I attribute it to.
And we're back on Q1, look at our guide and let's go execute against the opportunities that we have. So I'll really point to a little bit of those couple of weeks. And it's not just Adobe. It's certainly represented. If you look at the Adobe Digital Index and what we thought was the growth rate going to be for the entire community and how that got a little muted. So that's the way I would look at it."

First is just with the increased demand for content, we're seeing more creative professionals coming to the market. So we're seeing the base of people we can sell to as creative professionals continuing to grow.
We also are able to provide more value. As people are trying to accelerate the velocity of content, they have to build content more quickly. So things that Scott and team are doing around the addition of collaboration, means that we are able to add more value. The Frame.io acquisition is a great example of that. But we've also added some core new collaborative capabilities to Creative Cloud itself.
And third is the emergence of these new content types. We've been all tracking the growth of 3D, but also now with the emergence of the Metaverse, we're starting to see more demand for new types of content. And if you look at the performance of substance 3D and the fact that, that business, as an example, grew 100% year-over-year, it shows you that the business and the growth that we're seeing is tracking to the TAM expansion that Ann talked about earlier."

And dovetailing that to Shantanu's observation that you're looking to accelerate as opposed to go for margin expansion, which is great. And with that construct in mind, and certainly, when I look at your guidance, it doesn't suggest any deceleration, but maybe a little bit of conservatism, if anything.
If you could just talk about the levers in your business, Shantanu, that could cause the company to do better than expected or downside levers as well for fiscal '22, that would be great. But more longer term, if you look at metaverse, the concept of metaverse, and how Satya Nadella talks about the growth of the metaverse on the business side, how we work, a combination of virtual and presence, he outlines a view of the world that is fairly compelling. I'm curious how you thought about how Adobe is positioned for that world, the metaverse and the consumer context in enterprise virtual work context as laid out by Satya?"

So that's",1054,"Well, thanks for the question, Kash. And before I get to the metaverse, maybe the one thing we didn't quite cover is if you look at the big trends that people are talking about, Kash, the one thing we're maybe not in is EVs and batteries, right? So that's perhaps the one area of digital that Adobe is still not really involved in.
As I think about web 3D and as I think about the metaverse, what it really means and implies is that things that you were accustomed to doing in the physical world, increasingly more and more of that, you're going to do in the virtual world. And so if you think about it that way, whether you're doing shopping, whether you're playing games, whether you're creating, co-creating with other people, whether you're expanding it, the aspect of creating all of that metaverse worlds, what a better company in the planet than Adobe to be able to do that. So that's at 1 dimension, which is this exponential need for content is only going to increase.
I think the other way I think about what's happening in the metaverse, and if you think about it from that point of view, is where prior only physical goods in creativity were deemed worthy of buying, I think now, even all these virtual goods are going to have a value associated with it. And so when you think about what's happening with NFTs and blockchain. Again, Adobe, I think, is incredibly well positioned. We've already demonstrated some leadership in that with what we've done in Photoshop. And so I think the commerce aspects associated with not just large businesses, and we talked about the large businesses. But even individual businesses, I think Adobe is uniquely positioned.
I think opportunities like that, adobe is probably a little bit more conservative than others in order to -- in terms of putting it directly in our forecast for the year. But make no mistake. I mean, we're thinking about how these new opportunities, the fact that we bought a 3D company a while ago, the fact that we have Aero, and we're working with all of the OS providers in terms of thinking about augmented reality and virtual reality. We're absolutely in the middle of it. We're not just counting it in terms of what happens in terms of revenue off the top.
But if you take even more of a step and go to your question associated with how do we think about the opportunity, I will actually say, Kash, as we were all preparing as a group to prepare this, we had so much material. And we were talking about how do we try and condense it.
So I really hope you look at what Jonathan forced us to do, which is the deck has so much more information in it. We were trying to really provide sort of an abstract of all of that material. And I think it just reflects the interest that we have. I mean all 3 of our businesses, and let's go maybe digital experience. We've been talking about that for a while. And you're seeing just some tremendous adoption of our solutions in that. Digital is only going to go up and to the right, and I think Adobe is incredibly well positioned.
The real-time customer data platform, the experience platform, how we've unified our products, it actually reminds me of the really heavy lifting that we did many years ago, in what we did on our content creation tools with the unified profiles and the data and insights to deliver value to our customers. So it feels really good.
I think what we are doing around Document Cloud, on the web, across surfaces, PDF, liquid mode in terms of the AI, we're really spending a lot of time thinking about how businesses are going to automate, what it means to have a hybrid work environment, which is clearly a big trend and really making sure that we unify that with respect to our innovation. So really fantastic job by the teams there across all surfaces.
And certainly, Creative Cloud, the heritage of the company, this notion of everyone who has a story to tell, I actually tend to think of it as the web's now come alive. The web's now come alive. And perhaps one of the things we didn't talk about, the biggest asset, even on the web, is Adobe's file formats. So the ability to deal with the Photoshop file format. The ability to deal with Illustrator for logos. The ability to deal within Design, if you want to create these flyers. And actually for the creative community to participate in this massive community that's being created, we've done all the heavy lifting that now makes that magic possible. And we have a broader set of offerings than ever before in terms of being able to target people. Wherever you are in the world, we have pricing flexibility, and we have a DDOM that allows us to do it.
So I just take a step back and look at it and say, ""You know what? Adobe is really uniquely positioned."" We have a fabulous team. We didn't talk enough about that. Certainly, my colleagues here and Dana, who's not on the stage, but our GC as an executive team as well as the 25,000 employees, don't take for granted what we have in terms of this motivated stuff.
And so I just look at it and say, we're focused on top line growth. To the questions that Brent and others ask, we're always going to be focused on making sure that we have profitable growth and focus on the margin as well. But I think just uniquely excited about the opportunities that we have.
The one thing I missed is unfortunately we're not all together. And please stay safe, stay healthy during this holiday season. I think that's the really important thing. But as a management team and as an employee base, I could not be more excited about the future that Adobe has. 
And so thank you very much all of you for joining us virtually, and thank you for the team for all of the work that went into the preparation. Have a nice day."

Anil will go over our digital experience strategy, and David will cover digital media strategy after that.

Welcome to this Virtual 2022 Financial Analyst Meeting. Adobe had another outstanding year in 2021. I'm incredibly proud of the dedication and resilience of Adobe's 25,000 employees all around the world in delivering breakthrough technologies for our customers. 
I'd like to start with a recap of the tremendous accomplishments we had across every dimension in 2021. 
As a product geek at heart, I take immense pride in our team driving hundreds of innovations across Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. Earlier this week, we introduced Creative Cloud Express to enable anyone to express their ideas simply and beautifully. Creative Cloud Express is the start of a brand-new journey, to introduce first-time creators to Adobe Creative tools while adding significant value to all of our current Creative Cloud subscribers. I think it marks a new chapter of creation, collaboration and sharing on the web and leverages the unique technology and capabilities of Adobe's flagship products. It also builds on the collaboration capabilities we debuted at MAX, including Illustrator and Photoshop on the web, Creative Cloud spaces and Creative Cloud Canvas. 
With the addition of Frame.io, we're now incorporating review and approval functionality to deliver a powerful collaboration platform for end-to-end video collaboration. And we're continuing to add magic to our flagship applications, and we're enabling them to run natively on new hardware like Apple's M1 chip as well as Microsoft Windows' Surface and Pen. 
In Document Cloud, Acrobat web now supports 21 frictionless verbs: create, export, extract and edit for both text and images in PDF. We've seen tremendous growth in Acrobat online as people tap our powerful, free browser-based document tools to handle important tasks on the fly without the need to download any software. In addition, we made outstanding progress with PDF support within both the Chrome as well as Edge browsers. 
And on the Experience Cloud platform, we extended our real-time customer data platform to B2B customers, bringing together individual and account profiles across systems to give B2B companies a single view of their customer for the very first time. We launched Adobe Journey Optimizer, harnessing over 20 years of industry-leading e-mail marketing and cross-channel campaign management expertise to empower brands to design and deliver personalized experiences across the entire customer journey in a single application. 
With the new acquisition of Adobe Workfront, we're now empowering companies to optimize business outcomes by connecting creative and marketing professionals to manage all creative workflows across the entire marketing life cycle. In addition, we've advanced our industry leadership in key areas across our portfolio. Clearly, underpinning our 3 clouds is the magic and power of Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, a significant differentiator for Adobe and an enabler to more rapid innovation. 
We continued our investment in the Adobe Experience platform as the foundational platform for strong governance capabilities across our Experience Cloud business, accelerating innovations like real-time customer data platform and Adobe Journey optimizer on a global scale. We take our responsibility in the creative community very seriously. And as part of the content authenticity initiative, we published a draft specification as an open standard to combat online disinformation. 
I'm amazed with the resiliency of our employees, and we pioneered all new digital event experiences with Adobe Summit and Adobe Max, extending our reach and engaging millions of people around the world. I'm also tremendously proud of the industry recognition we continue to receive for our brand, our workplace, our culture and our practices. And just to name a few examples. We were again named [ top ] riser on Interbrand's Best Global Brands list. We're named to Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For for the 21st year; People Magazine's Companies that Care list for the fifth year; Fast Company's Brands that Matter list. And I think what's most significant for a lot of investors moving forward, The Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth year. And one that I'm particularly proud of, a 100% score for being the best place to work for disability inclusion. 
When you look at our financial results, it puts us in an incredibly rare position in the industry. Not many companies can drive the top line and bottom line growth with an impressive margin the way we do, and we powered through $15 billion in 2021. And we accomplished some significant milestones in Q4, our first $1 billion digital experience revenue quarter, our first $3 billion digital media, and $2 billion in cash flow, just some incredible financial statistics. 
Dan Durn, our new CFO, will cover our Q4 as well as our FY '21 results in greater detail. Since he joined Adobe in October, I've really appreciated his experience and partnership, and I look forward to him sharing his perspective as well as having significant impact on Adobe's growth in the decade to come. 
I'm also delighted to announce that Anil Chakravarthy and David Wadhwani have been promoted to the President of the Digital Experience and Digital Media businesses, respectively. I value their leadership and contributions, and they will share more color around each of our businesses. 
While 2021 was awesome. I'm actually most excited about what's to come for 2022 and beyond in the over 20 years that I've been at Adobe. We have this immense market opportunity. We have an incredible technology innovation road map and the best leadership team of any company on the planet. And I think what we've done is provided 2022 targets that demonstrate the strength of the underlying business. 3 incredibly large-growing opportunities across our clouds, continued focus on execution based on the current economic climate. I think the one change that we all are experiencing is as the company scales beyond $15 billion, we also have to focus on FX expectations given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar. 
But as excited as I am to talk about 2022. Today is really sharing about Adobe's tremendous growth story and how we're going to be driving the next decade of growth because that's really what underpins our growing over $200 billion addressable market opportunity. As you'll hear throughout the day from our leadership team, our growth is anchored across these 5 key pillars: our proven track record and our focus on creating and leading categories; the ever-increasing expanding set of customers that we serve, from consumers to creative pros to first-time creators to small and medium businesses to the largest enterprises in the world; our ability to deliver incredible technology platforms that enable whole new classes of applications and accelerate our innovative cadence; the important shift we continue to make from building applications to enabling new business models apps, services, artificial intelligence and platforms that's paying dividends; and last but not least, an incredible global ecosystem of partners that spans the entire customer life cycle, from experience creation and marketing, to delivery and ongoing support. 
And I think the message for you as investors is across every dimension, across every business, our aspirations are higher, and we're thinking bigger. There's this incredible once-in-a-lifetime expansive opportunity in front of us, and I think we're uniquely positioned to capture it. 
And now to provide color on the strategy on how we're going to expand markets and categories, I'd like to welcome Ann Lewnes, who recently celebrated his 15th year at Adobe; our incredible Chief Marketing Officer, who's also taken on the additional responsibility for corporate strategy. Ann?"

Over the past 2 years, we've witnessed a profound global shift to all things digital. Everyone from students to small businesses to the largest global brands has had to make this dramatic pivot. Technolog",1532,"Thank you, Shantanu, and good morning, everyone. 
Over the past 2 years, we've witnessed a profound global shift to all things digital. Everyone from students to small businesses to the largest global brands has had to make this dramatic pivot. Technology innovation, the proliferation of new devices and platforms, and the increased desire and ability for anyone to create and deliver great digital experiences have all accelerated the move to a truly digital world, and there's no going back. 
Whether it's through your phone, tablet or PC, it's easy for anyone, anywhere to create, work, learn, connect, shop, unwind and launch and grow businesses. While there continue to be massive challenges in the world, digital has also empowered us. Through the democratization of creativity, the development of rich digital experiences, the ability to work and learn from home, to shop and sell products online, or to connect with those you love, we are moving society forward. Digital has fundamentally changed everything. 
According to Adobe Analytics, online spending during the 2021 holiday season is projected to be $200 billion, and total e-commerce spending is projected to reach $1 trillion in 2022. It's clear that digital is a requirement to conducting business today. From your favorite local restaurant to Fortune 500 companies across every country and every industry, digital is powering today's businesses. Companies are automating mission-critical document processes like HR and legal, to drive increased efficiency and agility. At the same time, customers now expect rich personalized digital experiences that are relevant, engaging and consistent across any device. 
It's well documented that digital-first businesses drive greater long-term growth and customer loyalty. At Adobe, our own technology has enabled us to transform into a digital-first business. Companies like Adobe are measuring every single customer interaction to understand behavior, intent and, ultimately, to drive business impact. We do that by providing personalized digital experiences at scale through adobe.com, across all of our digital channels and, increasingly, through our products. 
Digital has not only changed the way we live and work, but also how we connect with one another. Anyone can create or participate in an online community, whether it's with your family, friends, colleagues or those with whom you share interests and passions. And with the emergence of the creator economy, it's possible for enterprising content creators to build both a large following and monetize their passions, products or services. 
Today, there are seemingly unlimited number of social platforms and ways to engage with one's desired audience. The ease with which you can share, promote and monetize content, products and services has enabled a whole new level of connection and commerce. We're also finding new ways to work together even when we're apart through the proliferation of collaboration solutions like Frame.io, which we acquired in Q4. 
Adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences is more important than ever before. The digital world runs on Adobe's tools and platforms. And through our unparalleled innovation, creativity, scale and advanced data-driven operating model, we are continuing to catalyze the growth of digital. Hundreds of millions of people across the globe use our products every single day, and we're impacting every aspect of society. Adobe continues to be uniquely positioned to lead in this next digital era. 
Our 3 industry-leading cloud offerings are mission-critical across every geography and audience with Creative Cloud or unleashing creativity for all, giving anyone, anywhere, the tools to express their creativity. With Document Cloud, we're accelerating document productivity, modernizing how people view, share and engage with documents. And with Experience Cloud, we're powering digital businesses of all sizes, giving them everything they need to design and deliver great customer experiences. 
Underpinning our 3 clouds is the power of Adobe Sensei, our advanced AI ML framework that enables us to deliver a steady stream of unparalleled innovation. 
Over the last year, we've seen the critical role that creativity has played in the world. Creative Cloud is empowering everyone, from the high school student to the social media influencer to the most demanding creative professional to tell their story. The Creative Cloud TAM is projected to be approximately $63 billion in 2024. $25 billion of that TAM comes from our core base of creative professionals who purchased Creative Cloud applications and services like Adobe Stock. 
New growth drivers in this segment include 3D and other immersive experiences as well as web first collaboration tools like Frame.io. $13 billion of the TAM is coming from communicators, nonprofessional creators, including small businesses, students and marketers. As you'll hear from David, many communicators are already using Creative Cloud, and we hope to see even more of them with products like Creative Cloud express which we just launched on Monday. The remaining $7 billion of TAM comes from consumers including hobbyists and social media users. The biggest growth drivers here are mobile applications in categories like video and imaging such as Adobe's Photoshop Express. 
Digital documents are core to the future of work PDFs and document workflows empower everyone from individuals to the largest enterprises to be productive anytime, anywhere. We're excited about the Document Cloud strategy and the large addressable market, which is projected to grow to $32 billion by 2024. $10 billion of that TAM is coming from knowledge workers, business professionals who typically use our core Acrobat desktop subscription offerings. Growth is expected to come from the expansion of digital document use cases, e-signatures and increased collaboration capabilities. $8 billion of the TAM is coming from communicators, who are using Acrobat web and mobile applications to create, scan and edit PDF files for both business and personal use. Growth in this segment is projected to come from expanding the freemium PDF base and capturing demand from new funnels with offerings designed for web and mobile use cases. Finally, $14 billion of the TAM is coming from enterprises, who are using document services, including Acrobat and e-signature solutions as well as APIs that developers use to seamlessly integrate with key line of business applications. Growth drivers in this segment include APIs to build powerful document workflows and expanded use cases. 
Whether it's B2B or B2C, businesses of every size across every category are investing in customer experience management. Adobe Experience Cloud empowers companies to deliver predictive, personalized, real-time digital experiences across every phase of the customer life cycle. Our total addressable market for Adobe Experience Cloud is estimated to be $110 billion in 2024. $33 billion of the TAM is coming from the data insights and audiences category, which includes Adobe Experience Platform, real-time CDP and Adobe Analytics, including our new customer journey analytics offering. Future growth drivers include the increasing demand for a unified customer profile and personalization at scale. $49 billion of TAM is coming from the content and commerce category, which includes our Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Commerce offerings. 
The volume of content needed by businesses to engage customers across every touch point is exploding and the pace at which it must be deployed is accelerating. The need for a seamlessly integrated commerce capability is accelerating at that same pace. $18 billion of the TAM is coming from the customer journeys category, which includes Adobe Campaign, Marketo Engage and our new Adobe Journey optimizer. Growth in this segment is expected to come from the continued need for businesses to engage with their customers across an ever-increasing array of channels. 
New to the TAM this year is the $10 billion marketing workflow category, which includes Adobe Workfront acquired last year. Growth here is expected to come from the increasing need for teams to efficiently plan, track and execute marketing campaigns. 
Adobe has always been relentlessly focused on looking around the corner, inventing new growth opportunities and successfully driving growth within our existing businesses. We have pioneered and are leading 3 massive categories: creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. This week, we announced Creative Cloud Express, our exciting new unified web and mobile offering that's perfect for anyone looking to quickly and easily make and share standout content. Creative Cloud Express is great for first-time creators and communicators, but will also provide value to our current Creative Cloud subscribers. It's a great example of how we continue to expand our customer base and grow our TAM. 
We win by creating enduring technology platforms, from Sensei to the Adobe Experience Platform. They are the foundation for product innovation and our industry-leading applications and services. 
Since transitioning Creative Cloud to a subscription model 10 years ago, we have continued to innovate our business models, building applications, services and platforms to bring value to market faster, better serve new customers and leverage new monetization models. It would be impossible to do all this alone. We have built a large ecosystem of partners, from agencies to solution integrators to ISVs, that customize and extend our solutions to the needs of our joint customers. We continue to see massive opportunities from Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. With the market tailwinds, our world-class innovation and the best employees in the world, we believe we're well positioned for our next decade of growth. 
And now I'd like to introduce Anil Chakravarthy, President of our Digital Experience business.

24321,698536199,2477888,"Adobe Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 16, 2021",2021-12-16,"Earnings Calls","Adobe Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ann. Hello, everyone. Good to be here with you. And I look forward to sharing more on our momentum, opportunity and strategy for the Digital Experience business. It's really an exciting time for us, as Ann shared. Let me begin by discussing a",846,"Thank you, Ann. Hello, everyone. Good to be here with you. And I look forward to sharing more on our momentum, opportunity and strategy for the Digital Experience business. It's really an exciting time for us, as Ann shared. 
Let me begin by discussing a couple of highlights from Q4. We had strong performance across the board. Our segment revenue cost over $1 billion for the first time with 23% year-over-year growth. Our subscription revenue grew to $886 million, up 27% year-over-year. And our subscription bookings in Q4 were up over 50% year-over-year. And with that, we were up over 40% year-over-year for full year FY '21. 
A lot of that was powered by the success of our Adobe Experience Platform and the native apps that run on it. It's foundational to our digital experience business. We invested early in the platform and have a significant head start having launched the platform in 2019. Our growth has accelerated. Earlier this year, we disclosed that we had passed over $100 million in revenue. And at the end of Q4, we surpassed $250 million in book of business, and we have seen a 300% year-over-year growth in customer count. 
The scale that we are operating in production is massive, over 21 trillion segment evaluations per day. And our ecosystem is extremely broad with over 300 partner integrations. And as Shantanu and Ann both mentioned, we have really accelerated our innovation over the past 18 months with new native applications and services powered by Sensei. 
A great example of this is Major League Baseball. They are leveraging digital to transform experiences for their customers with a focus on reaching that next generation of fans. And this is across all their channels. At home, on the go and in menu in the ballpark. They are focused on personalization at scale, delivering the right experience at the right time via the right channel to all of their fans. 
And it's not just Major League Baseball. It's clear that every business is a digital business and customer experience management is critical to business success. The changes in the tailwinds that we have seen during the pandemic are here to stay, and this has contributed to a strong momentum in our Digital Experience business. 
A couple of examples here again. Significant growth in average annual recurring revenue across our top 1,000, 100 and 25 accounts. We've seen strong growth across all accounts greater than $1 million in ARR. And all of our customers are building long-term partnerships with us. As an example, the combined total contract value of our top 10 accounts is $760 million, which is 3x higher than what it was at the end of FY '19. 
When we think about customer experience management, it is imperative for every company today to deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers. That's how they reach and engage all their customers across the world. And it's critical for them to do that to deliver that next level digital business growth. It's all about personalized experiences that are tailored to the individuals, delivered in real time and delivered seamlessly across online and off-line channels based on first-party data and making sure that they honor customer preference and privacy. 
And that's what we focus on. Our strategy is battle-tested and helps companies across the world achieve personalization at scale. We offer customers the best of both worlds: integrated AI-enabled comprehensive applications delivered on a real-time cloud scale platform. We have strong momentum with Workfront, with the ability to unify marketing workflow and increase marketing agility for all customers. And we are the strategic partner for customer experience management. I hear this from customers all around the world every day. And our ecosystem of partners is expansive with over 4,000 partners, as Ann mentioned, across ISVs, tech partners, system integrators and agencies. 
This is how we make this happen for our customers through the Adobe Experience Cloud. We focus on 4 key categories: content and commerce; data insights and audiences; customer journeys and marketing workflow, all delivered on a common platform, which is the Adobe Experience Platform. We've had a strong innovation engine over the last 18 months, and that's continuing both on the application layer as well as the platform with AI and machine learning capabilities in the platform powered by Adobe Sensei. This is a huge moat for us with the combination of a comprehensive set of applications and an integrated platform. 
In closing, I am incredibly excited about the opportunity we have for the digital experience business. We have strong momentum, and we are the clear leader in the customer experience management category. We have a large growth opportunity to help every company deliver personalization at scale to millions of customers around the world. And we have the best technology across our Adobe Experience platform and the native applications with the ability to grow rapidly as we have shown over the last couple of years.  
With that, it's my pleasure to turn it over to David to cover the digital media business. David?"
24321,698536199,2477888,"Adobe Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 16, 2021",2021-12-16,"Earnings Calls","Adobe Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Anil, and hello, everyone.

As some of you know, I ran the digital media business during the transition to Creative Cloud. And while the business has certainly matured since the early days of that transition, some things haven't changed. Our product teams keep delivering incredible innovation and our business continues to show strong momentum. 
Now before we dive into what I'm personally excited about for FY '22 and beyond, I want to hit on some Q4 highlights. Our Digital Media business in the quarter delivered $571 million of net new ARR in total. With that, Creative Cloud crossed $10 billion in ARR, and we saw continued strength in our Creative Cloud offers, while seeing outsized growth for substance, which grew 100% year-over-year, thanks to increasing demand for 3D and the emerging metaverse platforms. We also saw outsized growth in our mobile applications, which grew over 55% year-over-year. Our mobile applications have now generated over 400 million mobile IDs to date and has been a great source of new user acquisition for us. On the Document Cloud side, we grew ARR 31% for the year, ending at $1.9 billion. 
A bit of color behind these numbers. We now have 2.5 billion mobile and desktop devices with Reader or Acrobat installed on them. We're seeing explosive growth in Acrobat Web, where we saw monthly active users grow over 100% since last year. And our strategy of integrating Adobe Sign and Acrobat is clearly paying off for us, with 85% year-over-year growth in Adobe Sign transactions in Acrobat. In aggregate, we ended the year with approximately $12.2 billion of ARR. 
And while we posted a great FY '22 -- FY '21, we have even more exciting opportunities ahead for us. Let's start by talking a little bit about Creative Cloud. 
The big picture here is that we're living in a time where content and creativity and design has never been more valued, where content is fueling the global economy, where the digital consumption is exploding and where virtually every business needs a digital presence. We're living in a world where creative expression is considered a 21st century skill in education. And we're living in a world where we're seeing emerging 3D and immersive technologies like the metaverse, creating demand for all new types of content. All of this continues to drive incredible tailwinds for Creative Cloud. 
In particular, though, I wanted to spend a minute on the rise of the creator economy where we're seeing a growing number of individuals, solopreneurs and small business owners creating businesses from their passions and monetizing their content, their goods or their services online. The creator economy is already big with nearly 100 million small businesses on social media and with the majority of them saying that their online presence is more important to their success than their physical presence. 
Now despite it being big, it continues to grow at an incredible rate with nearly 4.5 million new businesses minted in the U.S. alone last year, which was a record. This has been a significant contributor to our success and a major contributor to the over 600 million free and paid monthly active users across our digital media products who are not considered creative professionals. And of course, this expansive opportunity needs an expansive strategy that drives our mission for creativity for all. 
In the next few minutes, I'll lay out how Adobe can help anyone who wants to express themselves in creative ways. From a small business owner to the highest end production house, Adobe has a solution for them because of our investment in 5 key areas. And since we just launched Creative Cloud Express, I wanted to start by discussing how we empower the world with content first task-based creativity. Let's go ahead and start by looking at a video of Creative Cloud Express and what it can do.

First, we remove all barriers to adoption. It's free to get started. It doesn't require a desktop download because it's 100% web and mobile. It doesn't have a learning curve. And users can create an account and publish content in minutes. Second, it's got an unparalleled content library, so novice users can build beautiful images and social media posts, digital flyers and more in minutes. This includes 175 stock images from Adobe Stock, 20,000 fonts and thousands of templates and design assets. And it's all powered by a universal search capability that surfaces the right content and recommendations at the right time. Third, it leverages decades of Adobe's product innovation. As you'd expect, we have great workflows with our Creative Cloud applications, but it also includes a slew of Sensei-based quick actions that make creating and editing images, videos and PDF easier than ever before. And fourth, we understand that people create content with the intent to distribute it. So Creative Cloud Express has integrations for single-click publishing to social media services. And you can expect to see that our recent acquisition of ContentCal benefit -- will benefit CCX users with even more social planning and publishing capabilities in the very near future. 
Creative Cloud Express is easy to use and it's easy to get started with. Users can have a lot of success with the free tier, but they're also presented with freemium -- premium features and content for an affordable -- at an affordable monthly price. CCX is also entitled with most CC existing plans, which we expect will drive higher engagement and retention in our core Creative Cloud customer base. And the go-to-market motion is very familiar to us. We'll combine our digital acquisition funnels and our product-led growth motion tuned for web and mobile. This gives us an opportunity to continually iterate and optimize user journeys while ramping this business over time. We also plan to leverage our existing footprint across education, reseller and enterprise to scale the business. 
We're thrilled to have Creative Cloud Express in market today. It's been amazing to see what people can make with it. And we really couldn't be more excited about this moment and what this means for a start of a whole new journey for Adobe. 
So moving beyond Creative Cloud Express, we also have a lot going on across Creative Cloud as a whole. We're advancing the state of art in imaging, video and design and more by building new capabilities across desktop, web and mobile. For example, we introduced Photoshop and Illustrator for web at Adobe Max. And we released a series of new Sensei-driven AI/ML capabilities, including neural filters and auto masking in Photoshop and auto captioning in Premier, just to name a few. 
We also continue to -- our focus on democratizing 3D and immersive. Substance 3D now supports end-to-end 3D workflows. Users can design parametric 3D assets in Designer; compose rendering virtual scenes in Stager; add texture, color, effects in Painter; and create 3D materials with Sampler. This enables fully virtual photo shoots saving companies a lot of money and a lot of time and speeds up asset and scene creation for inclusion in games, videos and the emerging metaverse platforms. 
Collaboration is another big area of focus for us. We're putting -- we're integrating collaboration directly into our apps and existing creative workflows. We're very excited about the Frame.io acquisition and see tremendous opportunity across individual corporate and media workflows with that product. We shipped a public beta of share for review workflows at MAX, and we demoed Spaces in Canvas, which we believe will enable teams to organize their creative assets and host live working sessions. 
And last but not least, we continue to produce content that inspires and educates our users through services like Adobe Live. We help users monetize their work through services like Adobe Stock, and we help them connect and inspire each other through services like Behance, which now is closing in on almost 29 million members. 
These 5 strategic pillars work together to ensure that anyone with creative needs can find a solution at Adobe, whether they're a creative professional trying to keep up with the increasing content demand, or they're a communicator participating in the creator economy, or a consumer looking to up their game in photography, or a student developing 21st century skills. We use our data-driven operating model, DDOM, to engage them as they express their interest online by perhaps searching for something like compositing in Photoshop or designing a Twitter post. Based on their intent, we then route them to one of our Creative Cloud apps, one of our mobile apps, or one of our frictionless web quick actions. We make sure that they have early success, and then we introduce them to other capabilities in Creative Cloud or Creative Cloud Express before converting them to and engaging them as a paid user. This digital motion, combined with our reseller partners, our direct sales teams, gives us an amazing global footprint and reach. 
So in summary, everything is going digital and content is fueling the digital economy. The result is a massive and growing TAM for Creative Cloud, as Ann talked about earlier. And our offerings, which now include Creative Cloud Express, continue to expand to meet market demand for both professionals and nonprofessionals. We couldn't be more excited about the opportunity ahead for the Creative business. 
And as you know, the other part of the digital media business is, of course, our Document Cloud, which is also experiencing significant tailwinds. Demand for PDF has never been greater. In fact, web searches for PDF have doubled in the last decade. And we believe the reason for this is that PDF has become the de facto format for unstructured data. PDF has also been the de facto standard for business-to-business collaboration where nowhere is this more pronounced, of course, than with e-signatures. This makes PDF an essential part of modernizing any business workflow, and Adobe is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend. 
Our apps are installed on over 2.5 billion devices, and we've opened -- in our apps, we've opened or created 320 billion PDFs in the last 12 months alone. We continue to be a leading destination for PDF viewing and we saw 100 million free and paid sign-ups over the last year. And we see that Acrobat can be a gateway to related services. Adobe Sign transactions in Acrobat, as I mentioned earlier, have increased 85% year-over-year as we continue to deepen the integration between the 2 offers. 
Our strategy here is clearly working, and we're investing across 5 key motions to make sure it continues to. First, our document verb strategy has been very effective. We now have 21 verbs in market, everything from edit PDF to convert PDF to rotate PDF. And we're seeing continued -- and we're continuing to optimize our digital acquisition and increasing our share of voice across the 80 million PDF-related searches that happen every month. 
Second, we're proliferating e-signatures by integrating them into Acrobat across all services: desktop, web and mobile. Given our early success here over the last year, you can expect to see us continue bringing these products closer together in the years ahead. 
Third, we remain committed to making PDF more intelligent for both interacting and reading. Adobe is reinventing mobile PDF viewing with liquid mode. We're accelerating document productivity with automated form field detection, and we're helping transform unstructured data to structured actionable data with our AI/ML-based extract functionality. 
Fourth, we're unlocking business workflows through our PDF and sign APIs. This empowers developers to build document automation solutions that transform how their businesses work. 
And fifth, we're leveraging our diversified go-to-market motions to reach anyone with a document need. Our global resellers and inside sales teams give us amazing access to a broad base of business demand. Our enterprise sales team allow us to sell tops down to CIOs looking to transform their business. And perhaps most importantly, our digital funnel continues to drive individual users into our conversion funnels. 
Knowledge workers, communicators, IT decision-makers and developers all have frictionless onboarding pathways. Our data-driven operating model helps customers discover Adobe technology when they're seeing -- when they're searching for PDF-related verbs. And we engage them in ways that provide quick success on web, mobile and desktop before upselling them to freemium features -- premium features, products, services or APIs that broaden their engagement with Adobe over time. In short, Document Cloud is incredibly well positioned for the years ahead. 
I hope this gives you a sense of why we're excited about both the creative and document businesses. In summary, both businesses are benefiting from significant tailwinds that are underpinning their large and growing TAMs. Both businesses are realizing the market benefits by leveraging our amazing brand awareness, our go-to-market footprint and our incredible pipeline of innovation. And both businesses have the opportunity to supercharge their existing data-driven operating model by pairing it with a product-led growth motion as our capabilities increasingly are accessed by users on web and mobile. So we're really excited about the year ahead.

Let me begin by saying how thrilled I am to be here today and be a part of this amazing team at Adobe. Having just been here for a few months, it's obvious what a special company this is, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.
Now let me jump in with Adobe's Q4 results. Adobe achieved revenue of $4.11 billion, a significant milestone, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted EPS was $2.57, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.20. Digital Media segment revenue was $3.01 billion.  The business' first $3 billion quarter, which represents 21% year-over-year growth, with net new Digital Media ARR of $571 million. Digital Experience achieved its first $1 billion quarter, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $886 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth. We had record cash flows from operations of $2.05 billion in the quarter, and we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our stock.
Turning to our 3 strategic clouds. It was a tremendous finish to the year. In Q4, Adobe achieved $2.4 billion in creative revenue and added $430 million of net new Creative ARR. We exited the year with more than $10 billion of ending Creative ARR with strong performance throughout the year. Growth drivers in the quarter included acquisition of new users on adobe.com, strength in our team's offering, seasonal Q4 strength in the enterprise and success co-selling Frame.io with our Creative Cloud enterprise offerings. However, while we saw increased demand for our offerings during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weeks, we did not see the traditional spikes we have had in previous years. This is consistent with this year's industry trends, in line with e-commerce holiday shopping data from the Adobe Digital Economy Index.
Adobe Document Cloud achieved $532 million in Q4. Revenue continues to be our -- and continues to be our fastest-growing business. We added a record $141 million of net new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter with ending ARR of $1.93 billion, growing 31% year-over-year. Our integrated document platform is clearly resonating with customers around the globe. We continue to see momentum with enterprises, small businesses and individuals using web and mobile first tools.
In digital experience, we achieved our first $1 billion revenue quarter. We're seeing strong demand for our real-time experience platform and app services as large enterprises are making investments in Adobe to drive customer experience management and personalization at scale. We drove record Q4 net subscription bookings. And for the full fiscal year, we grew net ASV greater than 40% year-over-year. 
Let's look quickly at the annual numbers. Adobe's financial performance in the year was outstanding with both top line acceleration and margin expansion in the year resulting in more than $7 billion of operating cash flow. And remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to nearly $14 billion, absolutely world-class performance.
Now let's discuss what a unique investment opportunity Adobe is. These are some of the outstanding qualities of Adobe that have energized me about the opportunity, and it's what ultimately brought me here today. There's a fundamental shift towards digitization that's accelerating around the globe. And I believe Adobe is better positioned than any other company to capitalize on these opportunities. Combining that with Adobe's financial track record as well as industry-defining products and platform, the result is an immense runway ahead of this company for growth.
Let me elaborate a bit more on my view of this opportunity. In the years ahead, there's going to be fundamental shifts in all aspects of our lives, all of them digitally enabled. Digital enablement will increasingly shape and define how we live, how we create, how we communicate, how we collaborate, how companies serve their customers, how companies compete and how economies function. These changes are both powerful and pervasive. I call it the digitization of everything.
The digitization of everything is accelerating. And I believe what happens in the next 10 years is going to define the rest of the century, similar to what happened in the Industrial Revolution. Except now, digital content and data are going to be the fuel of the digital economy. This is a generational opportunity. And we're talking about unlocking trillions of dollars of economic value in the global economy.
When you look at Adobe's foundational strengths, there's a very few companies that is as leveraged to the digitization of the global economy as well as we are. From the way people create and communicate, to the future of productivity and digital collaboration in a distributed work environment, to the digitization of businesses, driving customer engagement with data-driven insights to personalize customer experiences but do it at massive scale, to AI and machine learning, global trends towards digitization have so many intersections with Adobe's unique strengths. Again, digital content and data are the fuel of the digital economy. And I believe no one is better positioned than Adobe to be the digital enabler of the world. How many companies on the planet have this profile? How many companies have this opportunity? Not very many. When I think about our near-term strengths, combined with our long-term opportunities, there's a uniqueness here that's incredibly exciting.
Let's double-click on the company's financial performance and take a closer look at what I'm talking about. Starting with revenue growth. You can see consistent sustained revenue growth over the last 4 years as the company has grown subscription revenues at a 24% CAGR. That has been the strategy, continuing to grow while producing a revenue stream that's even more ratable and predictable. I'm incredibly impressed by this team's acumen and what they've been able to accomplish as well as by the contribution to revenue growth from newer initiatives, including Adobe Stock, Substance 3D, Acrobat Web, Sign, Creative Cloud, mobile apps and the Adobe Experience Platform.
Underlying this financial performance is an incredibly diverse business from our broad base of customers to diversified products and platforms, comprehensive business models and go-to-market reach that spans across all geographies.
With growing and diverse revenue streams, the company has been able to expand profitability over the last 4 years, while accelerating the top line. Adobe's disciplined execution and investment rigor has enabled the company to balance long-term investments while also focusing on profitability. This time period also includes the integration of several strategic acquisitions, Magento, Marketo Algorithmic, Workfront, Frame.io. It's impressive the way Adobe has managed to combine expanded profitability with strong, sustained top line growth and M&A integration.
Let's talk about RPO, contractually committed future revenues, which make Adobe's future performance, incredibly predictable and reliable. Exiting fiscal year 2021, RPO grew 23% on the strength of our enterprise bookings. RPO consists of deferred revenue and unbilled backlog with the current portion expected to flow into revenue over the next 12 months. It's also important to note that most of our adobe.com subscriptions are billed monthly and don't show up as deferred revenue. The remaining contractual commitments of those subscriptions, which average about 6 months in length at any given time, are included in unbilled backlog.
The cash flow performance really speaks for itself as you can see the way our operating cash flows have accelerated over the last 2 fiscal years, sustained growth and profitability at scale is not easy to achieve. The momentum at Adobe is strong, as evidenced by our first $2 billion quarter of operating cash flows. A strong capital structure with robust investment-grade credit rating positions us to continue to drive growth and provides flexibility, making access to capital affordable for Adobe.
Let's talk about our capital allocation strategy. First, we focus on investing in the business to drive long-term growth. Given the tremendous opportunities in front of us, some of our recent innovative R&D initiatives include our next-generation data platform as well as Creative Cloud Express, which we announced earlier this week. We're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing to scale those businesses globally.
Second, our cash and investment balances as well as our debt capacity enable inorganic growth opportunities. You've seen the way we've accelerated growth and made accretive strategic additions over the last fiscal year with Workfront and Frame.io.
Lastly and importantly, we focus on returning capital to our shareholders. Our stock repurchase program is funded through growth in our operating cash flows, and you can see how successful we've been in driving down the average shares outstanding over the last 4 years. Since 2018, we've returned approximately $12 billion to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. Exiting Q4, we have $13.1 billion of remaining stock repurchase authority through the end of our fiscal 2024.
The hallmark of a great technology company is consistent innovation in category-defining products. Adobe has done that across all its businesses and we'll dive into each of them next to discuss the performance drivers.
First, creative. The company has driven sustained ARR and revenue growth, which accelerated from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021. Let me tell you about the underlying data-driven operating model used to drive this performance. It all starts with innovation and the most comprehensive industry-defining portfolio of products. Our brilliant marketing campaigns generate awareness about Adobe's offerings, and drive traffic to adobe.com to engage customers to try, buy, use and renew.
It's about taking creators on a journey. First, with simpler applications, including our mobile, tablet and web applications, connecting them with vibrant creative communities and then providing journeys that empower them to do more as they advance, including services like Adobe Stock, cloud libraries and collaboration features. Now with the addition of Frame.io and Creative Cloud Express, we're continuing to grow the business by broadening the aperture and reaching new creators and stakeholders that will power the world's content. 
We continue to drive strong growth for Document Cloud. Again, you see this in the sustained revenue growth, with ARR growing even faster as the business shifts to being increasingly subscription-based. With approximately 90% of Document Cloud revenues in FY 2021 now being subscription. The main Document Cloud growth driver continues to be new user acquisition. We're seeing strong growth of Acrobat on adobe.com across geographies, growth on the web as well as in mobile and seed expansion in the enterprise. PDF and document workflows are mission critical to the way people work and collaborate in the digital-first world.
As Anil mentioned earlier, there's tremendous growth opportunity within our cohort of large customers. As we focus on cross-selling and moving them along the maturity curve towards the transformational adoption of our entire platform and set of customer experience management solutions. The average ARR and total contract value of our largest customers demonstrate how massive this opportunity is. And we grow by adding new logos to our customer base and then expanding within those accounts on multiyear journeys.
As impressive as this company's track record is, I believe there's even more growth ahead of us. I fundamentally believe there's a $1 trillion market cap opportunity in Adobe's future, having crossed the $15 billion mark in revenue. What does the path to $30 billion look like? And then from there, how are we going to get to $45 billion? It starts with an estimated $205 billion TAM and a huge ecosystem that we've built around our market-leading products and services. How are we going to get there? 
We're going to continue to broaden our appeal to a wider universe of customers, engage and retain our current customers across all geographies. We're also going to grow by innovating and investing to enter new categories that further complement and expand our growth trajectory and better enable our customers in the digital era. When we execute on that strategy over the next decade, our scale and success will put Adobe in a class that only a few software companies have achieved.
Having passed the $15 billion revenue mark, we're going to start reporting revenues in constant currency given the potential impact of foreign exchange movements. Following a year in which FX was a tailwind to reported revenues, the recent U.S. dollar strength is expected to result in a headwind to our reported revenue and growth rates for fiscal year 2022. Consistent with our annual practice, we've revalued our Digital Media ARR balance to account for the movements in the FX rates.
For operating expenses, we continue to save on travel and facilities in fiscal year 2021 while many of our employees continue to work from home. We expect these expenses to ramp throughout FY 2022. We also plan to invest in increasing headcount and integrating Frame.io. We believe these are critical investments we're making -- we believe these are critical investments we're making, and we're going to focus relentlessly on the organic growth opportunities ahead.
Lastly, fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year with an extra week in Q1. That week added approximately $267 million of revenue and $25 million of net new Digital Media ARR. The math around the return to a 52-week fiscal year is expected to be a 2-point headwind on our full year FY '22 growth rates and a 7-point headwind in Q1.
Here's Adobe's fiscal year 2022 annual targets. We show our segment growth targets on an actual and adjusted basis in constant currency, factoring for the additional week last year. 
Total Adobe revenue of approximately $17.9 billion. Net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.9 billion, Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 14% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 16% year-over-year, or 19% on an adjusted basis. Tax rate of approximately 17.5% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $10.25 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $13.70.
For Q1 of fiscal 2022, we're targeting revenue of approximately $4.23 billion. Net new digital media ARR of approximately $400 million. Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 8% year-over-year or 17% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 11% year-over-year or 18% on an adjusted basis. Digital Experience subscription revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year or 20% on an adjusted basis. Tax rate of approximately 16% on a GAAP basis and 17% on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.63 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $3.35.
I want to conclude by sharing what this company has achieved over the last 4 years, whether it's revenue growth and profitability, outstanding cash flow generation and shareholder returns, Adobe's track record demonstrates why this company is in a class of its own. I firmly believe that our best days are ahead. 
Thanks so much for your time today. I'm going to now pass it back to Shantanu."

As I said earlier, I'm incredibly excited about Adobe's future and our ability to not only lead but also create new categories.",999,"Thank you, Dan, and thanks as well to Ann, Anil and David for outlining the opportunities across our 3 industry-leading clouds. As I said earlier, I'm incredibly excited about Adobe's future and our ability to not only lead but also create new categories.
I think if you zoom out a little bit and think about it from a macro perspective, all over the world, it's clear that digital is empowering individuals, transforming businesses and connecting communities. And frankly, digital is going to play a much bigger role in work, life and entertainment going forward. 
We've seen the rise of the creator economy and the democratization of creativity. Work and education are now hybrid and here to stay in that form. Cloud and web technology advances are powering unprecedented levels of real-time collaboration. Document workflows are increasingly going to be automated. And most important, the mandate for our digital business is more urgent than ever before as customers now expect digital-first experiences that are both contextual as well as personalized. 
E-commerce growth is building on the record highs achieved during the pandemic. From a technology base, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become indispensable facilitators of our daily lives. And so I think, in short, digital technologies are enabling more people to create, collaborate, learn, work, be productive and make a living than ever before. 
I love our mission, and the ability to change the world through digital experiences puts us at the nexus of all of these trends. We're incredibly well positioned to drive meaningful impact across every aspect of society, and that will benefit billions of people around the world for years to come.
As we think about the company at Adobe, we believe it's not just what we do, but it's also how you do that it really matters. From the very beginning, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, our founders, committed to building a company that does the right thing. And the sense of purpose has guided our evolution and growth over the past 4 decades. I think we're all witnessing the shift in the role that companies have to play in social issues and the expectations that stakeholders and investors have for corporations.
As you reflect on how companies have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. It's been remarkable with that stakeholders around the world are looking to the private sector to become more active in social issues, and people are making decisions on the products that they buy and the places that they work based on where companies stand.
As our products have become ubiquitous and we've helped many more companies harness the transformative power of our digital technologies, our responsibility and our commitment to corporate citizenship has also grown dramatically. And I believe that the issues on which Adobe is uniquely positioned to make an impact are on Adobe For All making sure we create a diverse and inclusive culture for our employees as well as position that for our customers and partners. On the belief that technology will transform and in addition to providing technology, we have a responsibility to understand what that means. And I think most important to being able to allow everyone who has a story to tell their story, the notion of creativity for all.
The reality is that we've been leaning into these for several areas already, and our efforts are making a real impact across the company and our customer communities for many years. But I think it's this purpose that motivates our employees to focus on having more impact and, frankly, inventing the future.
I love the fact that our strategy has remained relatively consistent for the past decade. Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, to accelerate document productivity and to power digital businesses is more mission-critical than ever before. I think most companies would be thrilled, frankly, to have one of these growth opportunities. And we're fortunate that we have 3 businesses that are absolutely in the sweet spot of where the world needs technology to play a more important role. We have the right strategy. It's applied to an exceptional and growing opportunity, and so we're in no way opportunity constrained.
I'm going to end with how I started. I believe that Adobe is uniquely positioned to drive the next decade of growth. We have a proven capability to create and lead categories, and we're always looking around the corner to the white space that exists that will provide new opportunities for Adobe.
We're thinking bigger about every part of our business, how we scale and how we expand the customers that we serve. We continue to focus on innovation, delivering leading products, services and platforms as we leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning. We're continuously thinking about innovating in business models as well to rapidly deliver more value to a larger set of customers, to capitalize on global growth opportunities and to enable new monetization models that are emerging. And at the end of the day, our technology support a vibrant and growing ecosystem of partners that create, customize and extend our solutions to meet the unique needs of our joint customers.
But at the end of the day, our greatest asset as being an intellectual property company and what's truly driving our growth is a highly engaged global employee base, over 25,000 strong to whom I'm eternally grateful.
Thank you again for joining us today. I believe 2021 was a fantastic year, and we clearly expect that momentum to continue in 2022 and beyond. As we look forward to our 40th anniversary next year, Adobe stands in an enviable position, an impressive track record of innovation, category and brand leadership, great financial performance and multiple growth opportunities. Coupled with the expanding market opportunity, the depth of our technology platforms and the motivated employee base, I certainly believe that Adobe's best days are ahead of us.
And with that, we'll roll a video while we assemble the management team for our Q&A.

Firstly, it was a record quarter as well as it was a record year. And when we think about what our digital media guide was, I mean we certainly expected Frame to close in the quarter, and it closed pretty early in the quarter. And so what we do is we think about a range of outcomes and what that might do, and certainly, we wanted to focus on Frame as well, but it was probably not explicitly factored into the quarter.
When you consider it from different customer segments, the team business actually performed really well right through the quarter. And so the team's offering and the strength in the small and medium business was great.
Enterprise, we actually actively redirected and pivoted the team to think about video and Frame and how we were continuously selling it. As I said, it closed early in the quarter. And so Enterprise had the traditional Q4 strength as well that we normally expect. 
The individual demand was actually fairly strong right through the year. As Dan mentioned, maybe the one slight change is that as you think about what's happening with online shopping, while we continue to see demand up and to the right, we perhaps did not see as much of the spike as you would have perhaps seen traditionally in either the Black Friday or the Cyber Monday weeks. But apart from that, strength and demand continues to be strong. And clearly, we factored that into our guidance for fiscal 2022, which is the strongest ARR guide that we've ever guided to.
I think as it relates to the product and the differentiation, maybe I'll have Scott touch on that, and then David can certainly speak to other issues of the business."

And that's what we're seeing across all of our enterprise as well as small businesses. Everyone wants to be a stakeholder and have a say and be able to jump in and give feedback. And so we're building our products for the future to enable that.
I also want to mention, of course, last week, we launched Creative Cloud Express. This is just the start of an amazing new chapter for us. We've had a number of products in the market in our incubation zone, we call it, as we learn about how to really fulfill our mission of creativity for all. And now we've galvanized on all of the learnings, all of the signals, and we just couldn't be more excited about the new journey we're on here with that product in particular."

So as you start looking at where we're going with the business, we're building on the momentum. As we talked about, we had 2 -- almost $2 billion of net new ARR added in FY '21. We had our strongest guide ever, and it's really on the back of that. One more thing with regard to Creative Cloud Express and how that will start to drive opportunity for us. It can start by actually adding a lot of new users to the franchise. One of the things that we've been doing a phenomenal job with, and I think this expands, is bringing new users to Adobe, getting them successful with what they're doing, and then start to mature them up the value curve into Creative Cloud subscription or now Creative Cloud Express subscription.
But we're also making this available to all Creative Cloud customers. This is something that we see a lot of Creative Cloud customers occasionally want speed and content first development. For those users, we see the opportunity to really drive higher engagement and retention, even beyond where we already are.
And then as you start to have more plans that are separated for the kinds of things people want to do, it gives us the opportunity to drive more price optimization across the lines as well. So we're very excited about where we're heading and what this really adds to the mix we have."

As you know, we guided a little bit below what our 2020 guidance was in 2021 when we started. And we certainly outperformed that guidance as it relates to Digital Media ARR accomplishment in 2021. And if you look at how we've guided for 2022, it's actually a little bit closer to our 2021 guide as a starting point. And so clearly, we continue to be incredibly optimistic associated with the underlying strength of the business. The overall need for creativity just continues.
We don't believe in any way, shape or form, there were sort of pull-ins, and I know that sort of exists for other companies. We just continue to see secular strength and some of the new initiatives that we have underway. I mean we've really pivoted the team to be thinking about enterprise and video. We have Creative Cloud Express. The usage is going to build dramatically. We already have the largest communicator business, I think, among the creative community. So we're incredibly optimistic about how that business looks. 
And then if you look at it from a quarterization perspective. Again, let's just go back and look at what we guided in Q1 of 2021. As you know, when we guided to a number, we were factoring in the $24 million that we outlined was an additional part of what we accomplished as part of the 13 versus 14 week. And so if you look at it, it's very much in line. In other words, the trends of the business continue, and the optimism in the business continues. So that's how I would think about it, Alex."

To what extent should we think about this as defensive to some of the emerging competitors that are ramping up in the marketplace? 
And is there any risk of downshifting of the existing Creative Cloud customers who need a lighter rate solution? Now here's a cheaper offering, if you will. Is there any potential that you can see some downshifting within the base of people trying to price optimize there?

If you take a step back, I think this just speaks to the enormous opportunity that exists for creators. And if you look at our offerings already today, Keith, I mean, we have an incredible diversity of offerings. We have Photoshop Express on mobile that's doing great as it relates to the ARR. And we have the Creative Cloud product that also allows now the substance 3D products, that's probably the most expensive.
And so I think with online and our DDOM, we now have absolutely the ability to target and personalize our offerings against a broader set of customers and to make sure that we make it all net positive and net from a customer satisfaction as well as a net positive from the ARR that we accomplished.
A couple of other things. I mean first, our creative business with the communicator segment is already the largest creative business in the world. I mean, when you think about what's happening with Photoshop or Lightroom or the Express set of products. And I think what Express really does is it actually adds value to every single creative cloud subscriber. I mean they are creative cloud subscribers who are incredibly proficient in video who sometimes want to do a quick flyer associated with it. And so I think this brings more and more and more people into the fold. It's similar, frankly, to what we've done with the Document Cloud, where when you think about what's happening with this organic demand that we've created for PDF. And so net-net, I think it's accretive. 
And then I'll hand it over to David to speak specifically about how this might roll out, but it is actually an enabler for us, and it unifies, frankly, all of the different creative offerings that we've already had for the communicator segment."

Just adding to that, we look at this as a really pivotal moment in terms of our ability to fulfill a need that we know our customers have. If you think back to what we talked about earlier, we have 400 million IDs that have been created on mobile devices already. we have 600 million monthly active users across our digital media products that are not creative professionals. And Creative Cloud Express represents an opportunity to give all of them something that we can onboard them to in an effective way. 
As Shantanu also talked about, one of the things that we find really exciting about this is that our Creative Cloud base as well is looking for sometimes -- often, they're looking for the power and precision of our creative flagship applications. But sometimes, they just want a velocity-driven, content-first creation model, too. And by giving Creative Cloud Express to most of our Creative Cloud plans, we expect to drive even higher engagement and retention there.
And the last thing I want to say is that this fundamentally expands how we think about our go-to-market motion. We have talked for the last many years about our data-driven operating model and how that drives our ability to pull and acquire users, bring them into our acquisition funnels. With product-led growth because of our increasing investment in mobile and web, we have the ability to do a lot more quick iteration and optimize the user journey, so that conversion of that 600 million mile into paid and premium customers, and engagement with them continues.
And the last thing I will say is that I don't think you can look at this market as you've got nonprofessionals and professionals. We have a lot of nonprofessionals that really want to use the power and precision of Creative Cloud. And so we look at this as this ongoing seamless journey from the first time you come and you want to do something with creative expression, you can do it for free with Creative Cloud Express. We then move you up that chain so you have the premium content and availability of the premium features and content in Creative Cloud Express paid plan. And then we see people are able to actually move all the way up to the power and precision of Creative Cloud. So it's really a seamless end-to-end journey."

But one of the very exciting things that we've learned over the last few years is really around the distinct customer needs that were just not covered, frankly, by Spark or Photoshop Express, other things we were doing or other kind of competitive tools out there. And I just wanted to share a few of those because I think they're really relevant. 
I mean first of all, we're seeing a lot of these customers that come in, wanting to make something with a template. They want to be able to go further. So our product team is actually very excited about the prospect of a customer being able to make something and then take it to the next level using one of our more pro-ish applications like Photoshop or Illustrator. 
Also the desire for artificial intelligence. A lot of customers come in from small businesses, et cetera, and they have an idea of what they want to make, but they want some assistance in making something remarkable. They want fonts to be recommended to them. They want colors that will perform better on social media. And so we have an opportunity to do that.
And then finally, the idea of a multimedia editor was another really important insight for us in the development of Creative Cloud Express. Because what we learned is that while a lot of customers come in through the top of the funnel because they want to make a flyer, they want to edit a video, they want to edit an image. When they come in, they actually realize, maybe I'll add some animation, maybe I'll add some sound. And before you know it, it's a multimedia creation. And so we're very much building Creative Cloud Express, not just for where the customer is now, but where we see the market going. People are going to want to stand out with their media, and that's something that I believe Adobe can uniquely deliver with this product."

And every company companies, B2C companies, B2B companies and companies that are experimenting with new business models, direct to consumer, for example, they're all starting to invest across the board in digital experience. And we see that play out across all of the categories that I laid out. Definitely with 1 view of the customer, a single view of the customer that carries through the unified profile that we have in the Adobe Experience platform, that is at the heart of all customer engagement. So if you kind of map it to how we think of our DDOM, everything from discover to try, to buy, to use, to renew, that whole journey needs a common unified profile so that you can deliver a consistent experience across all channels. And that's a major investment that all companies are making.
And so what we've been able to do is to really take advantage of all of the knowledge we have and the applications we have across all of these areas and populate that data in the Adobe Experience platform. And that gives us a clear head start with every company, and then say -- then opening it up by saying that it is open to developers, the data model is an open data model. It runs on top of a cloud so that it's horizontally scalable. That has really made it something that every enterprise of any size can use, but they can also get started in a particular geography or in a particular business unit or a customer segment and scale from there.
So I'm really excited. I think across our categories, we definitely see a lot of strength. And more as we now see some of the trends that we've just talked about with the creative economy and so on, that will continue to add more use cases that will be built on top of the platform."

The innovation that went into the building of the experience platform and the unification, frankly, of everything that Anil has talked about, whether it's content and commerce, whether it's data and insights, whether it's the marketing flow associated with Workfront, which is also doing well, there really isn't another company that enables somebody, whether you're the marketer, the Chief Revenue Officer, the Chief Digital Officer, to very quickly say, I want to get all my data, whether it's online or off-line, into one particular place. And even more important, to activate it. And so I think from my perspective, the momentum associated with having this unified platform and you can get customers really up and running so rapidly, that's pretty amazing.
The second thing I would say is that we've done a really good job with the Digital Strategy Group as well as what Anil had outlined earlier about these transformative accounts. And so again, as we shared in the data, the ability to sell multiple solutions, the ability to upsell, the ability to co-sell, I think that also gives us a lot of confidence that now we have the platform, we have the apps and services on it, we have the AI associated with it. And I think if you take a step back, there isn't a company that doesn't want to talk to us about, a, Adobe, how did you do it? And b, how do we really make sure that we can get this up and running and activate it faster. 
So I really hope in 2022, you'll see how we make increasing progress in terms of not only just the selling, but the provisioning and, frankly, the value realization. And I think we've done a good job on that front as well under Anil's leadership."

I think the best place to start is underlying performance of the business. I think we're exposed to great market opportunities. Companies got the right strategy and performing well against those strategies. 
As we think about performance in the current environment against that backdrop of good performance, we want to strip out noise in the 1-year look ahead set of numbers. And I think there's 2 things that we point to when we separate the noise from what's been communicated. First is FX. Second is the extra 53-week versus 52-week. And so let's go 1 layer deep in each of those. 
As we think about the 53 versus 52-week, that's about a 2% adder to growth for the overall company in fiscal '21. And as we window into fiscal '22, that's going to be about a 2-point headwind. Because that extra week occurred in Q1, and you look at Q1 FY '22, it's about a 7-point headwind from just that 1 extra week alone as we look 1 quarter forward.
As we take a look at FX and we think about the currency moves. Not surprisingly, FX for our business over 2021 also added about a 2-point tailwind from a growth perspective, broadly speaking, across the business. As we look forward into the next year, it creates about a 1 point headwind given the recent moves that we've seen over the last couple of weeks -- I'm sorry, last couple of months of the dollar strengthening versus a variety of currencies around the globe. That gives you a sense of the magnitude of the moves from both of those 2 factors as we extract underlying performance from a bit of the noise we see.
If we were to go to 1 click further down and take a look at how both of those factors affect the Digital Media business versus the Digital Experience business. I would say from the 52 versus 53-week dynamic, you'll see more of that upside and more of that headwind from a growth standpoint impacting the DME business than you do the DX business. But it's just a slight difference between the 2 businesses, depending on how we engage commercially with our customers, and I can go into that in a little more detail if you'd like.
On the FX side, you see a similar dynamic. You see slightly accentuated performance to the upside and downside tailwind and headwind from FX on the Digital Media business than you do on the DX business. It's a slight change, but you see a slight bias to the upside and downside of DME versus DX. I think that unpacks the numbers and gets to the true underlying performance of the company.
And as you take a step back and look at how our businesses have performed over the last couple of years, you'll see what we've just guided is about in line with where we've been for the last couple of years. So again, the company continues to perform pretty well."

First is, as Dan tells me, which is, first, welcome to the big leagues. And so I guess when you're $15 billion of revenue, it's neither practical, and it's, frankly, too expensive to hedge all the FX exposure that you were accustomed to maybe we're doing. 
So if you strip out that FX part, and if you think about ARR, just very tactically to be clear. What we do is we have an ARR at the beginning of the year. With the strength of the dollar in November, you could argue it's the hardest compare on a pure FX. And then we both devalue the beginning book of business on ARR, and then we are using that dollar rate for the ARR for the quarter.
And so then, again, if you think about it, at a $1.9 billion guide that we have for ARR, clearly, the underlying strength of business and the units, that is not what's impacting the business. So just I think that's the other way that I unpack what was the impact of FX as well as to specifically tell you how we take the dollar rate at the beginning of the year for the ARR calculation."

And as you can imagine, when that extra week falls in a month and you engage with customers on a monthly basis, you won't see the upside or the downside on that business. So on a like-for-like basis, you'll see more of that dynamic float into the Digital Media business than you will the DX business.

And you can expect to see us continue to do that. We want signatures and Adobe Sign to be available to anyone that uses Acrobat going forward, and we'll continue to double down on that strategy."

So you will see some of those costs come back, and that's reflected in our guide. 
And so when we take a look at the opportunity in front of us and we think about the runway for growth, we think about how well we're positioned in each of our respective businesses, and we think about where the world is going and the key enablement role we, as a company, can play to enable that digitization of the world, we're going to invest for growth. We're going to invest in market-leading and defining products. And we're going to continue to lead the way we've done in the past. So you'll see some of that complement the investments we're going to make. 
And then as you think about the Adobe Experience Platform and you think about Creative Cloud Express, we're going to invest in sales and marketing to grow and scale those businesses globally. So we're going to be oriented to growth, and you'll see that reflected in both the performance and the decision-making going forward."

And so I think it, again, is all about the growth opportunity. You know it. We have an unbelievable leverage model. And so the leverage model will demonstrate itself. And if you look at our 2022 targets, it actually continues to show a lot of optimism in what we can do. I think Frame.io is a little dilutive. And again, as we said, some of these things, the Experience Cloud and what we are doing with getting more experience cloud adoption globally, what we are doing around Document Cloud and Creative Cloud and Creative Cloud Express, I mean, we want to make sure that we are spending wisely and is the expert on attribution not just within the company but in the world, and so we'll continue to do it.

If you look at the Adobe Digital Index, what has clearly happened over the last 12 months, 18 months, even pre-pandemic, but certainly during the pandemic is there's more and more activity happening online. That is a secular trend that's actually not going to change. We see it. There's more energy, there's more traffic, there's more activity associated with what's going online. 
If you look at what I think a lot of companies are looking at, the traditional spikes that you may have seen. A couple of weeks, the Black Friday week or the Cyber Monday week. I think those are maybe a little bit more muted because it's a little bit more of that traffic. You're seeing actually a steady growth as opposed to those spikes.
So if I take a step back and think about our Digital Media business teams and the small and medium business, nice performance. If I look at the enterprise, as I said, traditional close to the quarter. If I look at the individual business, a little bit of those spikes that we would have seen, we did see growth. We did see growth in both of those weeks, but it was perhaps a little bit less than that. And then you're back to, again, the secular demand.
So as I think about the business. It's not about the long-term demand. It's not about the market leadership of our products. I think it's just a little bit of how maybe online shopping globally has changed a little bit in terms of what the experience is. So that's what I attribute it to.
And we're back on Q1, look at our guide and let's go execute against the opportunities that we have. So I'll really point to a little bit of those couple of weeks. And it's not just Adobe. It's certainly represented. If you look at the Adobe Digital Index and what we thought was the growth rate going to be for the entire community and how that got a little muted. So that's the way I would look at it."

We also are able to provide more value. As people are trying to accelerate the velocity of content, they have to build content more quickly. So things that Scott and team are doing around the addition of collaboration, means that we are able to add more value. The Frame.io acquisition is a great example of that. But we've also added some core new collaborative capabilities to Creative Cloud itself.
And third is the emergence of these new content types. We've been all tracking the growth of 3D, but also now with the emergence of the Metaverse, we're starting to see more demand for new types of content. And if you look at the performance of substance 3D and the fact that, that business, as an example, grew 100% year-over-year, it shows you that the business and the growth that we're seeing is tracking to the TAM expansion that Ann talked about earlier."

And dovetailing that to Shantanu's observation that you're looking to accelerate as opposed to go for margin expansion, which is great. And with that construct in mind, and certainly, when I look at your guidance, it doesn't suggest any deceleration, but maybe a little bit of conservatism, if anything.
If you could just talk about the levers in your business, Shantanu, that could cause the company to do better than expected or downside levers as well for fiscal '22, that would be great. But more longer term, if you look at metaverse, the concept of metaverse, and how Satya Nadella talks about the growth of the metaverse on the business side, how we work, a combination of virtual and presence, he outlines a view of the world that is fairly compelling. I'm curious how you thought about how Adobe is positioned for that world, the metaverse and the consumer context in enterprise virtual work context as laid out by Satya?"

And before I get to the metaverse, maybe the one thing we didn't quite cover is if you look at the big trends that people are talking about, Kash, the one thing we're maybe not in is EVs and batteries, right? So that's",1054,"Well, thanks for the question, Kash. And before I get to the metaverse, maybe the one thing we didn't quite cover is if you look at the big trends that people are talking about, Kash, the one thing we're maybe not in is EVs and batteries, right? So that's perhaps the one area of digital that Adobe is still not really involved in.
As I think about web 3D and as I think about the metaverse, what it really means and implies is that things that you were accustomed to doing in the physical world, increasingly more and more of that, you're going to do in the virtual world. And so if you think about it that way, whether you're doing shopping, whether you're playing games, whether you're creating, co-creating with other people, whether you're expanding it, the aspect of creating all of that metaverse worlds, what a better company in the planet than Adobe to be able to do that. So that's at 1 dimension, which is this exponential need for content is only going to increase.
I think the other way I think about what's happening in the metaverse, and if you think about it from that point of view, is where prior only physical goods in creativity were deemed worthy of buying, I think now, even all these virtual goods are going to have a value associated with it. And so when you think about what's happening with NFTs and blockchain. Again, Adobe, I think, is incredibly well positioned. We've already demonstrated some leadership in that with what we've done in Photoshop. And so I think the commerce aspects associated with not just large businesses, and we talked about the large businesses. But even individual businesses, I think Adobe is uniquely positioned.
I think opportunities like that, adobe is probably a little bit more conservative than others in order to -- in terms of putting it directly in our forecast for the year. But make no mistake. I mean, we're thinking about how these new opportunities, the fact that we bought a 3D company a while ago, the fact that we have Aero, and we're working with all of the OS providers in terms of thinking about augmented reality and virtual reality. We're absolutely in the middle of it. We're not just counting it in terms of what happens in terms of revenue off the top.
But if you take even more of a step and go to your question associated with how do we think about the opportunity, I will actually say, Kash, as we were all preparing as a group to prepare this, we had so much material. And we were talking about how do we try and condense it.
So I really hope you look at what Jonathan forced us to do, which is the deck has so much more information in it. We were trying to really provide sort of an abstract of all of that material. And I think it just reflects the interest that we have. I mean all 3 of our businesses, and let's go maybe digital experience. We've been talking about that for a while. And you're seeing just some tremendous adoption of our solutions in that. Digital is only going to go up and to the right, and I think Adobe is incredibly well positioned.
The real-time customer data platform, the experience platform, how we've unified our products, it actually reminds me of the really heavy lifting that we did many years ago, in what we did on our content creation tools with the unified profiles and the data and insights to deliver value to our customers. So it feels really good.
I think what we are doing around Document Cloud, on the web, across surfaces, PDF, liquid mode in terms of the AI, we're really spending a lot of time thinking about how businesses are going to automate, what it means to have a hybrid work environment, which is clearly a big trend and really making sure that we unify that with respect to our innovation. So really fantastic job by the teams there across all surfaces.
And certainly, Creative Cloud, the heritage of the company, this notion of everyone who has a story to tell, I actually tend to think of it as the web's now come alive. The web's now come alive. And perhaps one of the things we didn't talk about, the biggest asset, even on the web, is Adobe's file formats. So the ability to deal with the Photoshop file format. The ability to deal with Illustrator for logos. The ability to deal within Design, if you want to create these flyers. And actually for the creative community to participate in this massive community that's being created, we've done all the heavy lifting that now makes that magic possible. And we have a broader set of offerings than ever before in terms of being able to target people. Wherever you are in the world, we have pricing flexibility, and we have a DDOM that allows us to do it.
So I just take a step back and look at it and say, ""You know what? Adobe is really uniquely positioned."" We have a fabulous team. We didn't talk enough about that. Certainly, my colleagues here and Dana, who's not on the stage, but our GC as an executive team as well as the 25,000 employees, don't take for granted what we have in terms of this motivated stuff.
And so I just look at it and say, we're focused on top line growth. To the questions that Brent and others ask, we're always going to be focused on making sure that we have profitable growth and focus on the margin as well. But I think just uniquely excited about the opportunities that we have.
The one thing I missed is unfortunately we're not all together. And please stay safe, stay healthy during this holiday season. I think that's the really important thing. But as a management team and as an employee base, I could not be more excited about the future that Adobe has. 
And so thank you very much all of you for joining us virtually, and thank you for the team for all of the work that went into the preparation. Have a nice day."
