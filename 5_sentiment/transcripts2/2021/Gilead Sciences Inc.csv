We're pleased to have this opportunity to provide an update on our progress and answer your questions. I'll begin by offering brief remarks and then hand off to the team to go into more detail. 
Before we begin, I want to thank all those who contributed to the progress we will highlight today, both our teams across the company and our many partners and collaborators worldwide. 
Let me start by looking back at the fourth quarter. Our work continued across 3 main areas, as it has throughout 2020: responding to the pandemic with our antiviral therapy, Veklury; delivering on our commitment to people with HIV, cancer, viral hepatitis and other conditions; and thirdly, executing on our strategy. 
As a result of our efforts to expand and strengthen our portfolio, we're going into 2021 in a very different position to how we began 2020. Last month, we provided updated guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 to ensure that you had a clear picture coming into today's earnings announcement. This updated guidance was largely based on the significant increase in the uptake of Veklury. In the United States alone, hospitalizations quadrupled between October and January. And approximately 1 out of every 2 patients hospitalized in the U.S. are being treated with Veklury today. 
We're grateful that Veklury is able to play such an important role in getting patients out of the hospital faster, 5 days on average, based on the NIAID ACTT-1 trial, especially as many parts of the world struggle with hospital capacity. 
The higher uptick of Veklury, along with the continued growth of our leading treatment for HIV, Biktarvy, helped to offset the ongoing impact to the pandemic on some parts of our business. Veklury and Biktarvy also helped to mitigate the expected impact of loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in October. 
Our efforts to build out our portfolio of medicines continued in the fourth quarter with our agreement to acquire MYR. The acquisition, which is on track to close in the first quarter of this year subject to regulatory clearances and other closing conditions, will bring us a first-in-class medicine called Hepcludex for the treatment of hepatitis D or HDV. This is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and affects some patients who are already infected with hepatitis B. Hepcludex is conditionally approved in Europe and has FDA breakthrough therapy designation as an investigational agent in the United States. 
The acquisition of Immunomedics closed in the fourth quarter, bringing the most significant recent addition to our pipeline today, Trodelvy. Trodelvy is a foundational medicine in our cancer portfolio with significant potential across multiple tumor types. We're very pleased with how the integration with Immunomedics is going and look forward to updating you on our progress with Trodelvy. 
Andy, Johanna and Merdad will share more detail on the quarter. I'd like to turn now to the year ahead. The first thing I would say is that we're moving forward with a clear path to growth. We have multiple opportunities in new therapeutic areas, especially oncology. We're very pleased with the strong and diverse oncology portfolio we have today. This portfolio consists of both marketed therapies, such as Trodelvy and Tecartus and Yescarta from Kite and programs across various stages of the pipeline. There are currently 27 internal ongoing clinical-stage programs for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 
We also have many promising opt-in opportunities. One of those options is for the anti-TIGIT program through our collaboration with Arcus Biosciences. Earlier this week, it was announced that we are increasing our investment in Arcus to help fund the continued progress of the promising Arcus pipeline. 
The foundation for our near- and long-term growth is our continued leadership in antivirals. We are confident in the longevity of our HIV business. We expect Biktarvy to continue to be a mainstay of HIV treatment long into the future. And our investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, could be a best-in-class, long-acting option for both treatment and prevention. Lenacapavir is a highly potent, and importantly, its flexible dosing profile gives us the potential to develop multiple long-acting treatment and prevention options. 
In 2021, we expect a number of important milestones in the areas I've just mentioned. Merdad will provide more detail on the regulatory milestones, and I will highlight a few for now within the broader context of what you can expect from us. 
Starting with our leadership in antivirals. We will, of course, be focused on the continued growth of Biktarvy and maintaining its leadership as the #1 prescribed treatment for HIV in major markets. We plan to file an NDA in the U.S. for lenacapavir in a heavily treatment-experienced population. This should be in the second half of the year. We will also continue to explore the right options for combinations. 
In viral hepatitis, we look forward to expanding our business in HBV and HDV by growing sales of Vemlidy in the U.S. and Asia, and pending completion of the MYR acquisition, the anticipated filing of a BLA in the second half of the year. 
For Veklury, we look to realize the full potential of the therapy as the pandemic evolves. As you know, we are studying new formulations and routes of administration for Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19. 
With the strong antiviral business as our foundation, we are looking forward to the continued expansion of oncology as a new pillar of growth. Trodelvy, which will have its first full year on the market following approval, will be a significant contributor to our growth this year. We expect to hear about conversion from accelerated to full approval in the coming weeks based on the FDA review of the ASCENT data. 
At the same time, we'll be pursuing the many pipeline opportunities for Trodelvy. It is currently being studied in 10 different tumor types. We expect to hear from the FDA on accelerated approval for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer in the first half of the year. And we're also anticipating a readout of the Phase III TROPiCS-02 study in hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer in the second half. 
Data from the Phase III ZUMA-7 study is expected in the first half of the year for Yescarta's potential expansion into second-line DLBCL. And we should see Phase Ib data from magrolimab in MDS in the second half of the year with the possibility of a regulatory submission based on these results. In addition, we'll assess opt-in opportunities throughout the year as data becomes available and continue to advance our internal programs. 
I want to add that we are focused on prioritizing in order to deliver on these opportunities. We now have a portfolio that allows us to be much more selective in terms of what we take forward. This means being very disciplined about investing where there's highest potential value. You've seen some of that with our decisions around filgotinib and our investment in Trodelvy. 
Just briefly on the enterprise-level activities. We will continue to expand our talent base and deepen our expertise outside antivirals as we did in 2020. We will also maintain our strong focus on inclusion and diversity. As part of this, we are strengthening our efforts to promote racial equity. Today, we announced that Gilead has become a founding member of a coalition called 1 10. This is a group of U.S. companies that is committed to hiring and promoting 1 million Black Americans into family-sustaining jobs over the next 10 years. 
In addition, we'll continue to advance our ESG program and targets in line with our strategy. We will update you on our progress in these areas each quarter. There's a lot of important work ahead of us in 2021, and we're very much looking forward to turning our opportunities into tangible progress that will benefit patients, communities and our shareholders. 
With that, I'll now pass over the call to Andy."
29002,701922799,2192570,"Gilead Sciences, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone.

Our performance was strong for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, a clear reflection of the solid underlying fundamentals of our business and the increased demand we saw for Veklury amid the COVID-19 pandemic. You will find our detailed Q4 and full year 2020 results in the press release and materials we have posted on our website. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2020 performance and provide our guidance for 2021. 
Turning now to the financial highlights. Total revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 were $7.4 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.19. This compares to total revenue of $5.9 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 for the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 99% year-over-year primarily due to higher product sales, improved gross margin driven by a prior year inventory charge and a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by increased R&D and SG&A investments, including $190 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to amending our agreement with Galapagos. 
Product sales for the fourth quarter and full year were $7.3 billion and $24.4 billion, up 26% and 10%, respectively, compared to the same periods last year as the most recent COVID-19 surge drove uptake of Veklury. Sequentially, this increase was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the U.S. in October. 
Veklury contributed $1.9 billion and $2.8 billion in sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, largely driven by increased utilization and COVID-19 hospitalizations in the U.S. For the full year, excluding Veklury, product sales were down 3% due to the recent losses of exclusivity for Atripla, Truvada, Letairis and Ranexa in the U.S. as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our HIV and HCV franchises. 
Despite the impact of the pandemic and the LOEs relating to Atripla and Truvada in the U.S., HIV revenue grew 3% year-over-year driven by Biktarvy and Descovy. For Q4, product sales excluding Veklury decreased 4% sequentially primarily due to the Atripla and Truvada LOES. Cell therapy revenues were up 34% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the year primarily due to the continued uptake of Yescarta in Europe and the U.S. launch of Tecartus in July. 
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $918 million for the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the year, down 35% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. 2020 cost of goods sold was lower primarily because of a $500 million inventory write-down charge in Q4 of 2019. Excluding this, non-GAAP product margins remain relatively flat year-over-year. 
Non-GAAP R&D expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 31% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year primarily driven by the $190 million charge associated with the Galapagos amendment that I mentioned earlier and approximately $70 million in milestones paid to Pioneer as well as pipeline investments in Trodelvy and magrolimab. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was up 20% year-over-year primarily due to our significant investment in Veklury. We also increased our investment in oncology programs, including Trodelvy and magrolimab. 
These increases in investment were partially offset by lower clinical expenses from the completion of certain inflammation programs and postponement of certain clinical trials due to the pandemic. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 37% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. The increase in the quarter was driven by the timing of marketing expenses related to Biktarvy, along with Veklury and Trodelvy commercialization efforts and higher spend on corporate grants to support philanthropic organizations. 
We allocated significant additional funds to nonprofit grantees in Q4 to support racial equity and social justice efforts, help our nonprofit grantees weather the pandemic and provide for our signature giving programs, including Compass, Radian and HEP Connect. 
For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 10% as a result of higher costs associated with the commercialization efforts for Veklury, our continued expansion in China, increased corporate grants, remdesivir donations and a $97 million charge related to a previously disclosed legal settlement. 
Turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, paid $858 million in dividends and drew down a $1 billion term loan in connection with the closing of our $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics. For the year, we returned approximately 67% of free cash flow to our shareholders, consisting of $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.6 billion in share repurchases. We also repaid $1 billion of debt on January 1 this year. 
Turning to our guidance for 2021. Our 2021 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on Slides 18 and 19 in the earnings presentation available on our website. As always, our guidance is based on our current expectations for our business in 2021, and results may vary depending upon, among other things, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remain unpredictable. In addition, while our guidance reflects the impact of recent corporate development transactions and our planned acquisition of MYR as well as funding for ordinary course partnering activities in 2021, our guidance does not factor in the possibility of any extraordinary business development costs or acquisitions or significant opt-ins that we may complete over the course of the coming year. 
With that background, we expect that product sales excluding Veklury for 2021 will be in the range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. Due to the uncertainty related to pandemic, we expect Veklury revenue to be in the range of USD 2 billion to USD 3 billion, which results in total product sales range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. As we've discussed over the past quarters, Veklury, in many ways, acts as a hedge against the potential impacts of a continued COVID-19 pandemic. 
This guidance reflects anticipated revenue growth of approximately 9% to 10% excluding LOEs and Veklury driven by growth from Biktarvy, Trodelvy, Vemlidy and our cell therapy franchise. And while there remains uncertainty with the pandemic, we are making certain assumptions regarding the recovery in underlying market dynamics starting in the second quarter of 2021. And as COVID-19 vaccinations accelerate, any delay with the vaccine rollouts or any significant reacceleration of the global pandemic could once again adversely impact our business. 
As a reminder, looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate total product sales excluding Veklury will decline by a low single-digit percentage, similar to what we've seen over the past 3 years. This is expected to be driven by customary U.S. seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively affect our payer mix in the first quarter. 
In addition, unlike prior years, Q1 of 2021 will also be impacted by the recent loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the United States. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in Q1 total product sales, we remain very confident in the health of our business as reflected in our guidance for the coming year. 
Turning to our expectations for our product gross margins in 2021. Our non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 87% to 88% in 2021, consistent with our historic range. With respect to our operating expenses in 2021, we expect that both non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses will see a flat to low single-digit percentage decline through disciplined expense management, with flexibility to continue investing in our R&D pipeline and other strategic opportunities going forward. This guidance includes the impact of our planned acquisition of MYR as well as our allocation of approximately $350 million for future investments and ordinary course R&D collaborations. 
In addition, our SG&A guidance reflects the expected impact in 2021 of our oncology build-out and funding for a number of time-limited corporate initiatives related to information technology and data analytics. 
Our non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.9 billion in 2021. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21%, which is higher than 2020, primarily due to a decrease in tax credits and settlements with tax authorities that reduced our 2020 tax rate. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.75 per share to $7.45 per share driven by increased operational efficiencies as compared to 2020 and partially offset by the higher non-GAAP effective tax rate, along with greater projected interest expense and lower projected interest income as compared to 2020. 
Our balance sheet remains robust, and our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on continuing to prioritize investment in our business and R&D pipeline and maintaining a rigorous focus on disciplined expense management. 
Finally, we continue to be committed to growing our dividend over time, and we were pleased to announce earlier today that we have increased our dividend by 4.4% for 2021. Additionally, as we disclosed a few weeks ago, we plan to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year, including the $1 billion of debt we repaid at the beginning of this year. We also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity compensation plans. 
I'll now turn the call over to Johanna."

I'll begin by taking you through some of the market dynamics we saw in the fourth quarter as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that it's had on our business. 
As we entered the quarter in the U.S. and around the world, the number of COVID-19 cases surged. This had 2 significant effects on our business. Recovery was dampened by our hep C and HIV medications as people delayed visits to their health care providers. And the number of hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 dramatically increased, leading to significant uptake of Veklury. 
Driven by Veklury, we had robust growth in Q4 with a 13% increase in total product sales compared to the prior quarter. Excluding Veklury revenues, our business declined 4% amid the pandemic and loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in the U.S. Overall, while we expect the pandemic to continue to cause near-term uncertainty, we're confident in the strong underlying trends, which I'll highlight for you this afternoon. 
Starting with HIV. We saw 3% growth in sales across our HIV franchise in 2020 compared with the prior year despite the Atripla and Truvada LOE. Biktarvy continues to stand out in the HIV treatment market, growing 10% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Biktarvy remains the #1 prescribed regimen across key global markets and in the U.S., where 1 in 2 new patients start on Biktarvy. 
In PrEP, we ended the year with a 46% U.S. market share for Descovy, exceeding our goal of 40% to 45%. As expected, we saw a generic competitor enter the market in Q4, impacting Truvada revenue as we work to maintain strong commercial assets for Descovy. Going forward, we expect demand for PrEP to recover as the pandemic subsides, and we will stay competitive growing the business with the market. 
This generic competition and the surge in the pandemic led to a decline in Q4 HIV revenues of 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. In addition, in line with historical trends, we saw seasonal inventory build in Q4, which we expect to bleed out into Q1 of this year. 
We're well positioned and confident in our leadership in HIV today and in the future. Biktarvy will continue to be a key growth driver as the go-to single-tablet regimen for HIV treatment, with patent protection extending to 2033 in the U.S. as well as the European Union. We remain enthusiastic about the prospects of growing our leadership as we advance our long-acting antiviral lenacapavir. Success in the long-acting market will depend on having a product candidate with the right profile for patients. We believe lenacapavir has the potential to be that product, and Merdad will share more detail about its profile in his remarks. 
Turning to Trodelvy. As Dan mentioned, we completed our acquisition of Immunomedics in October. During the quarter, Trodelvy recorded $64 million in sales, with $49 million of that revenue recognized by Gilead following the close of the acquisition for a full year totaling $137 million in revenue. 
I'm impressed with the progress the teams have made launching new medication amid the pandemic. In its first 8 months, Trodelvy has become the clear #1 therapy in third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The breadth of Trodelvy adoption and recognition of the product continues to grow, and we're now seeing unaided Trodelvy awareness of about 90% among physicians and academic institutions. 
Our ambition is to achieve similar awareness numbers with community providers, which will be driven by the anticipated full FDA approval of Trodelvy for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and publication of the previously presented ASCENT data in the first half of 2021. We're also on track to complete the European filing in the first quarter of this year. 
Specific to hepatitis. The COVID-19 surge impacted the recovery we saw in Q3 across our HCV franchise. Our HCV business showed 9% sequential decline, impacted by the pandemic and timing of purchases in markets outside of the U.S. We continue to maintain anywhere between 50% and 60% market share across our core markets, which we believe sets us well for recovery. 
In HBV, we expect to continue to grow our business and anticipate sales exceeding $1 billion by 2022 driven by the U.S. and Asia markets. We're looking forward to closing the MYR acquisition, which will bring Hepcludex to Gilead, a medicine as a first-in-class and potentially best-in-class treatment for hepatitis D or HDV, an orphan disease that has been historically underdiagnosed and for which there were no approved treatment options prior to Hepcludex. HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and is associated with poor long-term survival rates. We believe our experience in hepatitis and the operational synergies with respect to Gilead's existing field force in HBV will allow us to reach patients with HDV. 
Hepcludex already has conditional approval in Europe and remains an investigational agent in the U.S. Pending the close of the deal, we anticipate filing for U.S. approval in the second half of this year. 
In closing, I just want to share a few remarks about Veklury. As Dan noted, Veklury remains an important treatment option for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We're seeing utilization rates of 50% to 60% among eligible patients in the U.S. and are very proud of the role we played in helping patients during this challenging time. 
As we've seen over the past year, predicting the trajectory of the pandemic has proven difficult to say the least. We anticipate demand will continue to fluctuate as COVID-19 cases rise and fall. While we're encouraged by the progress of our industry has made with the introduction of vaccines, we expect Veklury will remain a critical tool for patients and physicians well into the future. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Merdad."

I'm pleased to share with you some updates on our pipeline as we made tremendous progress in 2020, expanding and diversifying our portfolio across our therapeutic areas. We entered 2021 with a larger, more balanced clinical pipeline that gives us the opportunity to advance important new therapies aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs now and in the future. Through acquisitions, partnerships and by advancing internal candidates, we grew our portfolio of projects by 50% last year, and I look forward to sharing more about that with you today. 
I'll start with oncology. In 2020, we significantly enhanced our oncology portfolio that now has 27 internal clinical-stage oncology programs aimed at patients with the greatest unmet medical needs. At the center of our oncology portfolio is, of course, Trodelvy. As Dan and Johanna mentioned, we anticipate several key clinical milestones this year that will help us broaden Trodelvy's use and understand which patients are most likely to benefit. 
With the accelerated approval for third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in hand, we look forward to the anticipated full approval of Trodelvy for patients with metastatic third-line triple-negative breast cancer, supported by the confirmatory Phase III ASCENT study. You'll recall that these are really strong data. Despite having received a median of 4 prior anticancer regimens, patients treated with Trodelvy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, with a median survival of 12.1 months compared with 6.7 months for chemotherapy and a hazard ratio of 0.48. 
These data have been accepted for publication, and we anticipate publication of these results in a peer-reviewed journal early this year. These data have set Trodelvy on the path to becoming the new standard of care for patients with third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. 
Additional data have demonstrated that Trodelvy has a potential to transform care for people with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common form of bladder cancer. We've submitted an application for accelerated approval to the FDA and anticipate a decision in the first half of this year. 
Next, we're looking to further expand Trodelvy for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70% to 75% of all forms of breast cancer. And those study results are expected in the second half of the year. 
Beyond breast and bladder cancers, we're working quickly to explore other tumors with the goal of establishing the breadth of Trodelvy's activity. We'll continue to evaluate the role of Trop-2 expression in tumors along the way. One of the trials we're leveraging is a TROPiCS-03 basket study where we continue to enroll patients. We plan to provide an update on this study, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, in the second half of this year. We are proceeding at risk with plans to start a randomized study in lung cancer in the second half of the year as well, pending TROPiCS-03 data. We expect to begin a substantial number of new studies with Trodelvy this year, adding to the 4 internal and 13 ongoing investigator-sponsored studies. 
Now moving on to magrolimab. We're rapidly advancing this program with the goal of helping patients with hematologic malignancies and exploring the role of CD47 inhibition in the treatment of solid tumors. The first solid tumor studies are set to begin as early as this year. We expect results from the Phase Ib study in MDS later this year, which will inform our ongoing discussions with the FDA. Pending these data, we could potentially file for accelerated approval. In addition, we've begun enrolling patients in the Phase III ENHANCE study intended to support full approval and to confirm the Phase Ib data. 
Moving to Kite. We're very pleased with the process -- progress of our colleagues at Kite that is being made with the company's cell therapy medicines, bringing Yescarta and Tecartus to new diseases and to patients earlier in their treatment. In addition to the second-line DLBCL data that Dan mentioned, we're expected -- that are expected in the first half of this year, we filed for approval to expand the use of Yescarta to patients with indolent NHL. If approved, this would be the first CAR-T therapy for patients with this form of lymphoma. 
We're also excited about the emerging data from our partnerships, including Arcus' anti-TIGIT and CD73 inhibitor programs as well as our collaborations with Pioneer and Tizona, to name a few. Taken in total, these agreements in both oncology and other therapeutic areas allow us to expand the breadth of our portfolio with access to cutting-edge research programs in a way that manages the risk of our internal portfolio. 
We've intentionally constructed a pipeline with a large number of programs in Phase I and fewer derisked programs in Phases II and III with a goal of creating a long-term, sustainable, productive pipeline to fuel our future. 
Turning to HIV. I want to echo Johanna's comments about the impact [indiscernible] Biktarvy has for people living with HIV. At the same time, we recognize some individuals prefer less frequent, long-acting regimens. We're excited about the potential of long-acting antivirals and believe that our capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, has a number of attributes that have important possibilities for both treatment and prevention. 
Beginning with treatment. People living with HIV tell us that either a weekly oral regimen or subcutaneous injection every 3 to 6 months are preferred regimens. As we look at how we'll combine lenacapavir with other agents, the potential dosing flexibility of lenacapavir offers possibilities to explore in clinical research both oral and subcutaneous administration. We expect to identify an internally developed agent or an external partner for lenacapavir to move into combination trials over the next 12 to 18 months. This will complement our first lenacapavir FDA filing expected in the second half of this year for use in the heavily treatment-experienced individuals with HIV. 
Now turning to prevention. We also believe there are many people for whom a subcutaneous injection possibly as infrequently as once every 6 months could provide a significant advantage. I'm pleased to share that we'll begin Phase III studies this year with lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV. We're planning 2 Phase III studies. 
The first will be in cisgender men, transgender women and men and gender nonbinary people who have sex with men. That will begin in the first half of 2021. The second is in adolescent girls and young women, and that will begin in the second half of 2021. 
Finally, I want to close with some commentary on Veklury and our ongoing commitment to patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Like so many others, we're encouraged to see the progress with the approval of the first vaccines and introduction of other therapeutics. Veklury continues to be a critical tool for patients and physicians in the fight against COVID-19. Clinical data from the randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled NIAID ACTT-1 trial has established the efficacy and safety of remdesivir. The Gilead-sponsored simple studies and real-world patient and physician experience continue to support the critical role of Veklury as a standard of care in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 
Veklury is the only anti vermilion that has been approved or granted temporary authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in approximately 50 countries worldwide. We welcome the addition of new medicines that are helping to ease the burden, and we'll continue to work to understand how best to use Veklury and how to advance the use of Veklury in additional settings and formulations with the goal of treating additional patients who may benefit. 
As Dan shared with you, you can expect to hear from us often as we look ahead toward a number of exciting milestones. A growing pipeline means we hope to have more data to share and more news about regulatory filings. We're focused on delivering important transformative therapies to improve care for people with serious illnesses. And I look forward to discussing the expansion of Trodelvy, magrolimab data, the lenacapavir milestones and the initiation of key Phase III trials over the course of the year.

Our guidance, and you see in some of the pages that we tried to help people think through the core business and the materials that we posted.

So we're going to grow through the LOEs, and then we think we should have some additional momentum coming out of 2021 into the subsequent years. 
And we also have a very capital-efficient and efficient corporate model, as you know, Michael. So when you talk about kind of bottom line growth, we see a lot of potential for leverage as we're driving top line growth to really expand EPS growth over the coming years as well.

One is Gilead has prided itself on making sure we really understand what patients need out there, every step of the way for the past couple of decades, which led us, obviously, to the robustness around Biktarvy as really the standard of care in the treatment setting and Descovy. 
And we also pursue a philosophy of having an anchor molecule. And what we're really excited about with capsid is this presents the opportunity for a true anchor molecule for long-acting that meets patients' needs, the types of needs that we think are really going to move -- potentially move some of the patients from a very convenient one to once a day to a less frequent dosing. So I remind you that we've got lots of options with lenacapavir, and I'll turn it over to Merdad to go through some of those. Over to you, Merdad."

Look, we have a number of internal assets that we can combine with lenacapavir. Given that lenacapavir is a capsid inhibitor, it gives us a lot of flexibility to look for what the second component could be there. So ranging from things like bictegravir and TAP to other things in our pipeline, we believe those can all internally form part of a combination regimen going forward. We would anticipate that we'll start doing Phase I studies this year, and then data will follow from that in terms of what -- which combination partner we would choose. 
On the second part of your question whether we would look only at 6 months. I would say, it's important to think about lenacapavir both having oral and subcutaneous approaches. So on the oral side, we think we can dose orally about once a week. And so that could form one regimen that we would approach to go for a once-weekly oral regimen. 
For subcu, it will partly depend on what the combination molecule would be and what dosing interval we can get with that. We'd certainly like to target 6 months. But if necessary, we can go to every 3 months or something like that. So it'll really depend on what the partner is. 
The key issue here is that we have a lot of flexibility with lenacapavir, and it gives us a lot of options to sort of see how we can work. And that's where we're going to go. 
And the last thing I'd say is for PrEP. The studies I mentioned, the ones that are getting started, are going to be every 6 months. So that is the regimen we're using for PrEP."

I would split up the question between treatment and PrEP. I think in treatment, the expectation is the market will continue to grow at the 2%, 3% that we've been seeing year-over-year. And so I think it'll be more of a little bit of a switch from oral to long-acting within the treatment. I think the real opportunity for expansion with long-actings will be in the prevention market. I -- we've said before that we've only scratched the surface at about 20%, 25% of the total market today in prevention with Truvada and Descovy. I think the opportunity really is to expand that market with long-actings that would make it much more flexible for folks, people at risk of HIV.

As you look at Yescarta, it's growing externally outside the U.S. in what we call ACE, which is Europe, Canada and Australia. And also in the U.S., Yescarta is growing significantly above our expectations. 
The dynamic in the U.S. for Yescarta is a couple fold. As we saw with our other CAR-T therapies in the market, the class overall has declined from 23% to 20%, which is significant in Q4. And the reason for that is referrals are down because of COVID obviously. And that's driving the majority of it and also lack of ICU beds. The lack of ICU bed does disproportionately affect Yescarta because where -- the majority of our sales are in the inpatient side. 
So as we look at what specifically, not just COVID overall, but you dig down to under what is COVID, you have the referral aspect. When the community physicians aren't seeing patients, patients aren't going into the offices. And then you also have at the ATC, the issue of ICU bed capacity and where else can you treat those patients. 
So overall, it's -- the biggest driver is the class share decline and secondarily is the a little bit of the product sales based on the ICU beds. Does that help answer the question?"

So like talk to me a little bit about how you're thinking about margins and maintaining margins with so many trials that you might want to begin and the robustness of that and then also talk to me about -- do you have a perspective on the likelihood of the combination of triple combination working versus the doublet because other people have the doublet? So just hitting your perspective on the confidence you have and then also in thinking about all these trials that you may want to begin. And if you can maintain some sort of -- give us some sense of margins and R&D expense going in the out-years?"

Let me start with -- we lost Dan again, I'm sorry. Let me start with the margin question. So we're not providing longer-term guidance, but we have flexibility in the way that we've structured the deals, as you know. So until we opt in, the R&D expense is borne by Arcus, as with many of our partnerships. Obviously, we're planning for success and looking at our R&D expense in the future and making sure that we have the flexibility in our capital structure and otherwise to push these programs forward if the data supports it. And 
we have a lot of leverage in our model. So we, again, have very strong margins. At a high level, Robin, what I'd say is we don't expect that any of the opt-ins, unless we're really opting into all of the programs across the board that we have options on, would fundamentally change our margin profile. And if they did, obviously, that would be in the short term, potentially a good problem to have. So we're really comfortable with the structure that we have where we are at our margins today, where we see them going. We like our R&D load today in terms of the amount of scale we've added to our R&D programs and our spend levels. You see that we're going to work very hard to manage our expenses thoughtfully with our team. So from our vantage point, we're in a good spot. 
Let me hand it over to Merdad on the clinical question."

Yes, so as I mentioned earlier, the share has been actually quite stable. So what we've seen is really -- with Truvada LOE, what we've seen is a little bit of mix within Truvada between branded and generics. But we haven't seen that impact the Descovy at all. On the contrary, it stayed strong at that level of share. And we expect that to continue to basically be anywhere between 40% and 45% or so throughout the year. 
Having said that, we did see a little bit of a decline quarter-over-quarter, that 6% or so. And that was largely due to the contracting to maintain strong commercial access. So the one difference has been much more around -- because it's TAP, because it's in prevention, it's highly commercially -- commercial payers. And so therefore, we're really quite focused on just making sure that people at risk have access to Descovy in light of the strong profile and safety profile that it offers. 
And so we've definitely seen erosion with Truvada, strong erosion in Q4, and that will continue as we think about coming quarters this year. But really from a Descovy standpoint, the expectation is that we continue to maintain strong commercial access. And obviously, that might mean a little bit more contracting, so a little bit more discounting on that front, but one that's important for us to make sure that people living at risk have access to Descovy as we continue forward. So hopefully, that kind of addresses your question on PrEP market."

And -- but we don't think that the ORR evaluation, the interim analysis, was actually going to form the substantive-enough data to get an approval in HER-positive. 
So what we did is we looked initially at the study when -- as part of the evaluation. Together with the team in Immunomedics, we resized the study to power it appropriately for overall survival. And at the end of the year, we'll read out PFS, which we think has a much better opportunity for reading out and giving us a fileable end point. 
So I think that was really the -- our conclusion was essentially that the ORR was only just going to cost us alpha, but not really get us something that we could file with. And we have not unblinded any data. We don't -- it was not based on anything other than wanting to get to the PFS. 
So on the inhaled remdesivir, it's going well. That study is moving through Phase I and has moved forward nicely. And no, the Phase I study is probably not adequate -- not probably, is not adequate for approval. It's -- when you move from parenteral to an inhaled approach, it's effectively moving it to a drug-device combination approach. And so all the issues there -- a PK bridge is usually when you can show that the exposure is the same. But since the exposure will be very different systemically, it will be -- primarily the exposure will be in the lung. You can't do a bridging for PK. So it ends up being a clinical efficacy question as opposed to just a PK question. So the studies are designed to -- will be designed to go forward with evidence of clinical efficacy for approval."

It's only 8 months in, so they haven't had a full year yet. And what we're seeing in 2020 is very encouraging. As of last October, more than 1 out of 4 patients were initiated on Trodelvy in third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. 
What we also are seeing is in December, when physicians were actually asked to report their own prescribing, so a little bit of an ATU-type approach, they were suggesting somewhere north of 40% of their third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients were receiving Trodelvy. And so we're seeing a nice uptake. I think we have an opportunity to continue that uptake as we think about expanding not only in the academic centers, but also with our community providers. And I think that's the opportunity as we think in the next little while. And I think that will be driven mostly with the fact that we'll be able to promote the overall survival data with the FDA approval, the full approval for the ASCENT data and the publication. So all of those things will be important inflection points for us as we move forward. 
But we're very excited as we see physicians and are really getting physician feedback around making sure that they can get through their second-line options pretty quickly to get to third line. And we have very strong payer support as well in reimbursement. So there's been no barriers on that front either. So good shape so far.

And we started to see coming out of it in Q3. But of course, in Q4 with the surge of cases and hospitalization, we saw that dampening again.

Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to have this opportunity to provide an update on our progress and answer your questions. I'll begin by offering brief remarks and then hand off to the team to g",1328,"Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to have this opportunity to provide an update on our progress and answer your questions. I'll begin by offering brief remarks and then hand off to the team to go into more detail. 
Before we begin, I want to thank all those who contributed to the progress we will highlight today, both our teams across the company and our many partners and collaborators worldwide. 
Let me start by looking back at the fourth quarter. Our work continued across 3 main areas, as it has throughout 2020: responding to the pandemic with our antiviral therapy, Veklury; delivering on our commitment to people with HIV, cancer, viral hepatitis and other conditions; and thirdly, executing on our strategy. 
As a result of our efforts to expand and strengthen our portfolio, we're going into 2021 in a very different position to how we began 2020. Last month, we provided updated guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 to ensure that you had a clear picture coming into today's earnings announcement. This updated guidance was largely based on the significant increase in the uptake of Veklury. In the United States alone, hospitalizations quadrupled between October and January. And approximately 1 out of every 2 patients hospitalized in the U.S. are being treated with Veklury today. 
We're grateful that Veklury is able to play such an important role in getting patients out of the hospital faster, 5 days on average, based on the NIAID ACTT-1 trial, especially as many parts of the world struggle with hospital capacity. 
The higher uptick of Veklury, along with the continued growth of our leading treatment for HIV, Biktarvy, helped to offset the ongoing impact to the pandemic on some parts of our business. Veklury and Biktarvy also helped to mitigate the expected impact of loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in October. 
Our efforts to build out our portfolio of medicines continued in the fourth quarter with our agreement to acquire MYR. The acquisition, which is on track to close in the first quarter of this year subject to regulatory clearances and other closing conditions, will bring us a first-in-class medicine called Hepcludex for the treatment of hepatitis D or HDV. This is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and affects some patients who are already infected with hepatitis B. Hepcludex is conditionally approved in Europe and has FDA breakthrough therapy designation as an investigational agent in the United States. 
The acquisition of Immunomedics closed in the fourth quarter, bringing the most significant recent addition to our pipeline today, Trodelvy. Trodelvy is a foundational medicine in our cancer portfolio with significant potential across multiple tumor types. We're very pleased with how the integration with Immunomedics is going and look forward to updating you on our progress with Trodelvy. 
Andy, Johanna and Merdad will share more detail on the quarter. I'd like to turn now to the year ahead. The first thing I would say is that we're moving forward with a clear path to growth. We have multiple opportunities in new therapeutic areas, especially oncology. We're very pleased with the strong and diverse oncology portfolio we have today. This portfolio consists of both marketed therapies, such as Trodelvy and Tecartus and Yescarta from Kite and programs across various stages of the pipeline. There are currently 27 internal ongoing clinical-stage programs for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 
We also have many promising opt-in opportunities. One of those options is for the anti-TIGIT program through our collaboration with Arcus Biosciences. Earlier this week, it was announced that we are increasing our investment in Arcus to help fund the continued progress of the promising Arcus pipeline. The foundation for our near- and long-term growth is our continued leadership in antivirals. We are confident in the longevity of our HIV business. We expect Biktarvy to continue to be a mainstay of HIV treatment long into the future. And our investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, could be a best-in-class, long-acting option for both treatment and prevention. Lenacapavir is a highly potent, and importantly, its flexible dosing profile gives us the potential to develop multiple long-acting treatment and prevention options. 
In 2021, we expect a number of important milestones in the areas I've just mentioned. Merdad will provide more detail on the regulatory milestones, and I will highlight a few for now within the broader context of what you can expect from us. 
Starting with our leadership in antivirals. We will, of course, be focused on the continued growth of Biktarvy and maintaining its leadership as the #1 prescribed treatment for HIV in major markets. We plan to file an NDA in the U.S. for lenacapavir in a heavily treatment-experienced population. This should be in the second half of the year. We will also continue to explore the right options for combinations. 
In viral hepatitis, we look forward to expanding our business in HBV and HDV by growing sales of Vemlidy in the U.S. and Asia, and pending completion of the MYR acquisition, the anticipated filing of a BLA in the second half of the year. 
For Veklury, we look to realize the full potential of the therapy as the pandemic evolves. As you know, we are studying new formulations and routes of administration for Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19. 
With the strong antivirals business as our foundation, we are looking forward to the continued expansion of oncology as a new pillar of growth. Trodelvy, which will have its first full year on the market following approval, will be a significant contributor to our growth this year. We expect to hear about conversion from accelerated to full approval in the coming weeks based on the FDA review of the ASCENT data. 
At the same time, we'll be pursuing the many pipeline opportunities for Trodelvy. It is currently being studied in 10 different tumor types. We expect to hear from the FDA on accelerated approval for Trodelvy in metastatic urothelial cancer in the first half of the year. And we're also anticipating a readout of the Phase III TROPiCS-02 study in hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer in the second half. 
Data from the Phase III ZUMA-7 study is expected in the first half of the year for Yescarta's potential expansion into second-line DLBCL. And we should see Phase Ib data from magrolimab in MDS in the second half of the year, with the possibility of a regulatory submission based on these results. 
In addition, we'll assess opt-in opportunities throughout the year as data becomes available and continue to advance our internal programs.
I want to add that we are focused on prioritizing in order to deliver on these opportunities. We now have a portfolio that allows us to be much more selective in terms of what we take forward. This means being very disciplined about investing where there's highest potential value. You've seen some of that with our decisions around filgotinib and our investment in Trodelvy. 
Just briefly on the enterprise-level activities. We will continue to expand our talent base and deepen our expertise outside antivirals as we did in 2020. We will also maintain our strong focus on inclusion and diversity. As part of this, we are strengthening our efforts to promote racial equity. Today, we announced that Gilead has become a founding member of a coalition called OneTen. This is a group of U.S. companies that is committed to hiring and promoting 1 million Black Americans into family-sustaining jobs over the next 10 years. 
In addition, we'll continue to advance our ESG program and targets in line with our strategy. We will update you on our progress in these areas each quarter. There's a lot of important work ahead of us in 2021, and we're very much looking forward to turning our opportunities into tangible progress that will benefit patients, communities and our shareholders. 
With that, I'll now pass over the call to Andy."
29002,701922799,2192914,"Gilead Sciences, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Our performance was strong for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, a clear reflection of the solid underlying fundamentals of our business and the increased demand we saw for Veklury amid the COVID-19 pande",1542,"Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Our performance was strong for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, a clear reflection of the solid underlying fundamentals of our business and the increased demand we saw for Veklury amid the COVID-19 pandemic. You will find our detailed Q4 and full year 2020 results in the press release and materials we have posted on our website. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2020 performance and provide our guidance for 2021. 
Turning now to the financial highlights. Total revenues for the fourth quarter 2020 were $7.4 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.19. This compares to total revenue of $5.9 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 for the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 99% year-over-year primarily due to higher product sales, improved gross margin driven by a prior year inventory charge and a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by increased R&D and SG&A investments, including $190 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to amending our agreement with Galapagos. 
Product sales for the fourth quarter and full year were $7.3 billion and $24.4 billion, up 26% and 10%, respectively, compared to the same periods last year as the most recent COVID-19 surge drove uptake of Veklury. Sequentially, this increase was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the U.S. in October. 
Veklury contributed $1.9 billion and $2.8 billion in sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, largely driven by increased utilization and COVID-19 hospitalizations in the U.S. For the full year, excluding Veklury, product sales were down 3% due to the recent losses of exclusivity for Atripla, Truvada, Letairis and Ranexa in the U.S. as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our HIV and HCV franchises. 
Despite the impact of the pandemic and the LOEs relating to Atripla and Truvada in the U.S., HIV revenue grew 3% year-over-year driven by Biktarvy and Descovy. For Q4, product sales excluding Veklury, decreased 4% sequentially primarily due to the Atripla and Truvada LOEs. Cell therapy revenues were up 34% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the year, primarily due to the continued uptake of Yescarta in Europe and the U.S. launch of Tecartus in July. 
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $918 million for the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the year, down 35% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. 2020 cost of goods sold was lower primarily because of a $500 million inventory write-down charge in Q4 of 2019. Excluding this, non-GAAP product margins remain relatively flat year-over-year. 
Non-GAAP R&D expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 31% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year, primarily driven by the $190 million charge associated with the Galapagos amendment that I mentioned earlier and approximately $70 million in milestones paid to Pionyr, as well as pipeline investments in Trodelvy and magrolimab. For the full year, non-GAAP R&D expense was up 20% year-over-year, primarily due to our significant investment in Veklury. We also increased our investment in oncology programs, including Trodelvy and magrolimab. 
These increases in investment were partially offset by lower clinical expenses from the completion of certain inflammation programs and postponement of certain clinical trials due to the pandemic. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 37% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. The increase in the quarter was driven by the timing of marketing expenses related to Biktarvy, along with Veklury and Trodelvy commercialization efforts and higher spend on corporate grants to support philanthropic organizations. 
We allocated significant additional funds to nonprofit grantees in Q4 to support racial equity and social justice efforts, help our nonprofit grantees weather the pandemic and provide for our signature giving programs, including COMPASS, RADIAN and HepConnect. 
For the full year, non-GAAP SG&A expense increased 10% as a result of higher costs associated with the commercialization efforts for Veklury, our continued expansion in China, increased corporate grants, remdesivir donations and a $97 million charge related to a previously disclosed legal settlement. 
Turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations, paid $858 million in dividends and drew down a $1 billion term loan in connection with the closing of our $21 billion acquisition of Immunomedics. For the year, we returned approximately 67% of free cash flow to our shareholders, consisting of $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.6 billion in share repurchases. We also repaid $1 billion of debt on January 1 of this year. 
Turning to our guidance for 2021. Our 2021 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on Slides 18 and 19 in the earnings presentation available on our website. As always, our guidance is based on our current expectations for our business in 2021, and results may vary depending upon, among other things, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which remain unpredictable. 
In addition, while our guidance reflects the impact of recent corporate development transactions and our planned acquisition of MYR, as well as funding for ordinary course partnering activities in 2021, our guidance does not factor in the possibility of any extraordinary business development costs or acquisitions or significant opt-ins that we may complete over the course of the coming year. 
With that background, we expect that product sales, excluding Veklury, for 2021 will be in the range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. Due to the uncertainty related to the pandemic, we expect Veklury revenue to be in the range of USD 2 billion to USD 3 billion, which results in total product sales range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. 
As we've discussed over the past quarters, Veklury, in many ways, acts as a hedge against the potential impacts of a continued COVID-19 pandemic. 
This guidance reflects anticipated revenue growth of approximately 9% to 10%, excluding LOEs in Veklury driven by growth from Biktarvy, Trodelvy, Vemlidy and our cell therapy franchise. And while there remains uncertainty with the pandemic, we are making certain assumptions regarding the recovery in underlying market dynamics starting in the second quarter of 2021. And as COVID-19 vaccinations accelerate, any delay with the vaccine rollouts or any significant reacceleration of the global pandemic could once again adversely impact our business. 
As a reminder, looking ahead to Q1, we anticipate total product sales, excluding Veklury, will decline by a low single-digit percentage, similar to what we've seen over the past 3 years. This is expected to be driven by customary U.S. seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively affect our payer mix in the first quarter. 
In addition, unlike prior years, Q1 of 2021 will also be impacted by the recent loss of exclusivity of Atripla and Truvada in the United States. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in Q1 total product sales, we remain very confident in the health of our business as reflected in our guidance for the coming year. 
Turning to our expectations for our product gross margins in 2021. Our non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 87% to 88% in 2021, consistent with our historic range. With respect to our operating expenses in 2021, we expect that both non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A expenses will see a flat to low single-digit percentage decline through disciplined expense management, with flexibility to continue investing in our R&D pipeline and other strategic opportunities going forward. This guidance includes the impact of our planned acquisition of MYR as well as our allocation of approximately $350 million for future investments and ordinary course R&D collaborations. 
In addition, our SG&A guidance reflects the expected impact in 2021 of our oncology build-out and funding for a number of time-limited corporate initiatives related to information technology and data analytics. 
Our non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $12.9 billion in 2021. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21%, which is higher than 2020, primarily due to a decrease in tax credits and settlements with tax authorities that reduced our 2020 tax rate. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.75 per share to $7.45 per share driven by increased operational efficiencies as compared to 2020 and partially offset by the higher non-GAAP effective tax rate, along with greater projected interest expense and lower projected interest income as compared to 2020. 
Our balance sheet remains robust, and our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on continuing to prioritize investment in our business and R&D pipeline and maintaining a rigorous focus on disciplined expense management. 
Finally, we continue to be committed to growing our dividend over time, and we were pleased to announce earlier today that we have increased our dividend by 4.4% for 2021. Additionally, as we disclosed a few weeks ago, we plan to repay at least $4 billion of debt this year, including the $1 billion of debt we repaid at the beginning of this year. We also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity compensation plans. 
I'll now turn the call over to Johanna."

I'll begin by taking you through some of the market dynamics we saw in the fourth quarter as we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that it's had on our business. 
As we entered the quarter in the U.S. and around the world, the number of COVID-19 cases surged. This had 2 significant effects on our business. Recovery was dampened by our Hep C and HIV medications as people delayed visits to their health care providers. And the number of hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 dramatically increased, leading to significant uptick of Veklury. 
Driven by Veklury, we had robust growth in Q4, with a 13% increase in total product sales compared to the prior quarter. Excluding Veklury revenues, our business declined 4% amid the pandemic and loss of exclusivity for Atripla and Truvada in the U.S. Overall, while we expect the pandemic to continue to cause near-term uncertainty, we're confident in the strong underlying trends, which I'll highlight for you this afternoon. 
Starting with HIV. We saw 3% growth in sales across our HIV franchise in 2020 compared with the prior year despite the Atripla and Truvada LOE. Biktarvy continued to stand out in the HIV treatment market, growing 10% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Biktarvy remains the #1 prescribed regimen across key global markets and in the U.S., where 1 in 2 new patients start on Biktarvy. 
In PrEP, we ended the year with a 46% U.S. market share for Descovy, exceeding our goal of 40% to 45%. As expected, we saw a generic competitor enter the market in Q4, impacting Truvada revenue as we work to maintain strong commercial assets for Descovy. Going forward, we expect demand for PrEP to recover as the pandemic subsides, and we will stay competitive growing the business with the market. 
This generic competition and the surge in the pandemic led to a decline in Q4 HIV revenues of 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. In addition, in line with historical trends, we saw seasonal inventory build in Q4, which we expect to bleed out into Q1 of this year. 
We're well positioned and confident in our leadership in HIV today and in the future. Biktarvy will continue to be a key growth driver as the go-to single-tablet regimen for HIV treatment, with patent protection extending to 2033 in the U.S. as well as the European Union. We remain enthusiastic about the prospects of growing our leadership as we advance our long-acting antiviral lenacapavir. Success in the long-acting market will depend on having a product candidate with the right profile for patients. We believe lenacapavir has the potential to be that product, and Merdad will share more detail about its profile in his remarks. 
Turning to Trodelvy. As Dan mentioned, we completed our acquisition of Immunomedics in October. During the quarter, Trodelvy recorded $64 million in sales, with $49 million of that revenue recognized by Gilead following the close of the acquisition for a full year totaling $137 million in revenue. 
I'm impressed with the progress the teams have made launching new medication amid the pandemic. In its first 8 months, Trodelvy has become the clear #1 therapy in third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The breadth of Trodelvy adoption and recognition of the product continues to grow, and we're now seeing unaided Trodelvy awareness of about 90% among physicians and academic institutions. 
Our ambition is to achieve similar awareness numbers with community providers, which will be driven by the anticipated full FDA approval of Trodelvy for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and publication of the previously presented ASCENT data in the first half of 2021. We're also on track to complete the European filing in the first quarter of this year. 
Specific to hepatitis. The COVID-19 surge impacted the recovery we saw in Q3 across our HCV franchise. Our HCV business showed 9% sequential decline, impacted by the pandemic and timing of purchases in markets outside the U.S. We continue to maintain anywhere between 50% and 60% market share across our core markets, which we believe sets us well for recovery. 
In HBV, we expect to continue to grow our business and anticipate sales exceeding $1 billion by 2022, driven by the U.S. and Asia markets. We're looking forward to closing the MYR acquisition, which will bring Hepcludex to Gilead, a medicine with a first-in-class and potentially best-in-class treatment for hepatitis D or HDV, an orphan disease that has been historically underdiagnosed and for which there were no approved treatment options prior to Hepcludex. HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis and is associated with poor long-term survival rates. We believe our experience in hepatitis and the operational synergies with respect to Gilead's existing field force in HBV will allow us to reach patients with HDV. 
Hepcludex already has conditional approval in Europe and remains an investigational agent in the U.S. Pending the close of the deal, we anticipate filing for U.S. approval in the second half of this year. 
In closing, I just want to share a few remarks about Veklury. As Dan noted, Veklury remains an important treatment option for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We're seeing utilization rates of 50% to 60% amongst eligible patients in the U.S. and are very proud of the role we played in helping patients during this challenging time. 
As we've seen over the past year, predicting the trajectory of the pandemic has proven difficult, to say the least. We anticipate demand will continue to fluctuate as COVID-19 cases rise and fall. While we're encouraged by the progress of our industry has made with the introduction of vaccines, we expect Veklury will remain a critical tool for patients and physicians well into the future. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Merdad."

I'm pleased to share with you some updates on our pipeline as we made tremendous progress in 2020, expanding and diversifying our portfolio across our therapeutic areas.

I'm pleased to share with you some updates on our pipeline as we made tremendous progress in 2020, expanding and diversifying our portfolio across our therapeutic areas. We entered 2021 with a larger, more balanced clinical pipeline that gives us the opportunity to advance important new therapies aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs now and in the future. Through acquisitions, partnerships and by advancing internal candidates, we grew our portfolio of projects by 50% last year, and I look forward to sharing more about that with you today. 
I'll start with oncology. In 2020, we significantly enhanced our oncology portfolio that now has 27 internal clinical-stage oncology programs aimed at patients with the greatest unmet medical needs. At the center of our oncology portfolio is, of course, Trodelvy. As Dan and Johanna mentioned, we anticipate several key clinical milestones this year that will help us broaden Trodelvy's use and understand which patients are most likely to benefit. 
With the accelerated approval for third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in hand, we look forward to the anticipated full approval of Trodelvy for patients with metastatic third-line triple-negative breast cancer, supported by the confirmatory Phase III ASCENT study. You'll recall that these are really strong data. Despite having received a median of 4 prior anticancer regimens, patients treated with Trodelvy showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, with a median survival of 12.1 months compared with 6.7 months for chemotherapy and hazard ratio of 0.48. 
These data have been accepted for publication, and we anticipate publication of these results in a peer-reviewed journal early this year. These data have set Trodelvy on the path to becoming the new standard of care for patients with third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. 
Additional data have demonstrated that Trodelvy has a potential to transform care for people with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common form of bladder cancer. We've submitted an application for accelerated approval to the FDA and anticipate a decision in the first half of this year. 
Next, we're looking to further expand Trodelvy for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70% to 75% of all forms of breast cancer. And those study results are expected in the second half of the year. 
Beyond breast and bladder cancers, we're working quickly to explore other tumors with the goal of establishing the breadth of Trodelvy's activity. We'll continue to evaluate the role of Trop-2 expression in tumors along the way. One of the trials we're leveraging is a TROPiCS-03 basket study where we continue to enroll patients. We plan to provide an update on this study, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, in the second half of this year. We are proceeding at risk with plans to start a randomized study in lung cancer in the second half of the year as well, pending TROPiCS-03 data. We expect to begin a substantial number of new studies with Trodelvy this year, adding to the 4 internal and 13 ongoing investigator-sponsored studies. 
Now moving on to magrolimab. We're rapidly advancing this program with the goal of helping patients with hematologic malignancies and exploring the role of CD47 inhibition in the treatment of solid tumors. The first solid tumor studies are set to begin as early as this year. We expect results from the Phase Ib study in MDS later this year, which will inform our ongoing discussions with the FDA. Pending these data, we could potentially file for accelerated approval. In addition, we've begun enrolling patients in the Phase III ENHANCE study intended to support full approval and to confirm the Phase Ib data. 
Moving to Kite. We're very pleased with the process -- progress of our colleagues at Kite that is being made with the company's cell therapy medicines, bringing Yescarta and Tecartus to new diseases and to patients earlier in their treatment. In addition to the second-line DLBCL data that Dan mentioned, we're expected -- that are expected in the first half of this year, we filed for approval to expand the use of Yescarta to patients with indolent NHL. If approved, this would be the first CAR-T therapy for patients with this form of lymphoma. 
We're also excited about the emerging data from our partnerships, including Arcus' anti-TIGIT and CD73 inhibitor programs, as well as our collaborations with Pionyr and Tizona, to name a few. Taken in total, these agreements in both oncology and other therapeutic areas allow us to expand the breadth of our portfolio with access to cutting-edge research programs in a way that manages the risk of our internal portfolio. 
We've intentionally constructed a pipeline with a large number of programs in Phase I and fewer derisked programs in Phases II and III with a goal of creating a long-term, sustainable, productive pipeline to fuel our future. 
Turning to HIV. I want to echo Johanna's comments about the impact once-daily Biktarvy has for people living with HIV. At the same time, we recognize some individuals prefer less frequent, long-acting regimens. We're excited about the potential of long-acting antivirals and believe that our capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, has a number of attributes that have important possibilities for both treatment and prevention. 
Beginning with treatment. People living with HIV tell us that either a weekly oral regimen or a subcutaneous injection every 3 to 6 months are preferred regimens. As we look at how we'll combine lenacapavir with other agents, the potential dosing flexibility of lenacapavir offers possibilities to explore in clinical research, both oral and subcutaneous administration. We expect to identify an internally developed agent or an external partner for lenacapavir to move into combination trials over the next 12 to 18 months. This will complement our first lenacapavir FDA filing expected in the second half of this year for use in the heavily treatment-experienced individuals with HIV. 
Now turning to prevention. We also believe there are many people for whom a subcutaneous injection, possibly as infrequently as once every 6 months, could provide a significant advantage. I'm pleased to share that we'll begin Phase III studies this year with lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV. We're planning 2 Phase III studies. 
The first will be in cisgender men, transgender women and men and gender nonbinary people who have sex with men. That will begin in the first half of 2021. The second is in adolescent girls and young women, and that will begin in the second half of 2021. 
Finally, I want to close with some commentary on Veklury and our ongoing commitment to patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Like so many others, we're encouraged to see the progress with the approval of the first vaccines and introduction of other therapeutics. Veklury continues to be a critical tool for patients and physicians in the fight against COVID-19. Clinical data from the randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled NIAID ACTT-1 trial has established the efficacy and safety of remdesivir. The Gilead-sponsored simple studies and real-world patient and physician experience continue to support the critical role of Veklury as a standard of care in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 
Veklury is the only antiviral medicine that has been approved or granted temporary authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 in approximately 50 countries worldwide. We welcome the addition of new medicines that are helping to ease the burden, and we'll continue to work to understand how best to use Veklury and how to advance the use of Veklury in additional settings and formulations with the goal of treating additional patients who may benefit. 
As Dan shared with you, you can expect to hear from us often as we look ahead toward a number of exciting milestones. A growing pipeline means we hope to have more data to share and more news about regulatory filings. We're focused on delivering important transformative therapies to improve care for people with serious illnesses.

It doesn't belie, our confidence in Veklury exists, but of course -- and we're seeing it track, obviously, very well with hospitalizations. But we also want to have, and we want you to have confidence in our ability to grow the underlying business excluding Veklury. 
So yes, we're committed to that. I think you see that in the guidance that we delivered here today for 2021. And we're committed -- and that's despite the fact that we are offsetting a significant amount of generic erosion with Atripla and Truvada. So obviously, as we head into 2022 and beyond, we don't have that headwind as well.

And we think we have all the puzzle pieces together that will allow us to do that. 
Our guidance, and you see in some of the pages that we tried to help people think through the core business and the materials that we posted. And I would emphasize and focus people on the 9% to 10% growth in the core business, excluding the impact of the LOEs. So we're going to grow through the LOEs, and then we think we should have some additional momentum coming out of 2021 into the subsequent years. 
And we also have a very capital-efficient and efficient corporate model, as you know, Michael. So when you talk about kind of bottom line growth, we see a lot of potential for leverage as we're driving top line growth to really expand EPS growth over the coming years as well. So we're excited about where we are and where we're going and look forward to updating you throughout the year."

One is Gilead has prided itself on making sure we really understand what patients need out there, every step of the way for the past couple of decades, which led us, obviously, to the robustness around Biktarvy as really the standard of care in the treatment setting, and Descovy. 
And we also pursue a philosophy of having an anchor molecule. And what we're really excited about with capsid is this presents the opportunity for a true anchor molecule for long-acting that meets patients' needs, the types of needs that we think are really going to move -- potentially move some of the patients from a very convenient one from once-a-day to a less frequent dosing. So I remind you that we've got lots of options with lenacapavir, and I'll turn it over to Merdad to go through some of those. Over to you, Merdad."

Look, we have a number of internal assets that we can combine with lenacapavir. Given that lenacapavir is a capsid inhibitor, it gives us a lot of flexibility to look for what the second component could be there. So ranging from things like bictegravir and TAF to other things in our pipeline, we believe those can all internally form part of a combination regimen going forward. We would anticipate that we'll start doing Phase I studies this year, and then data will follow from that in terms of what -- which combination partner we would choose. 
On the second part of your question whether we would look only at 6 months. I would say, it's important to think about lenacapavir both having oral and subcutaneous approaches. So on the oral side, we think we can dose orally about once a week. And so that could form one regimen that we would approach to go for a once-weekly oral regimen. 
For subcu, it will partly depend on what the combination molecule would be and what dosing interval we can get with that. We'd certainly like to target 6 months. But if necessary, we can go to every 3 months or something like that. So it'll really depend on what the partner is. 
The key issue here is that we have a lot of flexibility with lenacapavir, and it gives us a lot of options to sort of see how we can work, and that's where we're going to go. 
And the last thing I'd say is for PrEP. The studies I mentioned, the ones that are getting started, are going to be every 6 months. So that is the regimen we're using for PrEP."

I think that one for us was really an opportunity to go into the market, fast opportunity to get physician experience with lenacapavir and kind of create that foundation for lena. 
I would split up the question between treatment and PrEP. I think in treatment, the expectation is the market will continue to grow at the 2%, 3% that we've been seeing year-over-year. And so I think it'll be more of a little bit of a switch from oral to long-acting within the treatment. I think the real opportunity for expansion with long-actings will be in the prevention market. I -- we've said before that we've only scratched the surface at about 20%, 25% of the total market today in prevention with Truvada and Descovy. I think the opportunity really is to expand that market with long-actings that would make it much more flexible for folks, people at risk of HIV.

As you look at Yescarta, it's growing externally outside the U.S. in what we call ACE, which is Europe, Canada and Australia. And also in the U.S., Tecartus is growing significantly above our expectations. 
The dynamic in the U.S. for Yescarta is a couple fold. As we saw with our other CAR-T therapies in the market, the class overall has declined from 23% to 20%, which is significant in Q4. And the reason for that is referrals are down because of COVID obviously, and that's driving the majority of it, and also lack of ICU beds. The lack of ICU beds does disproportionately affect Yescarta because we're -- the majority of our sales are in the inpatient side. 
So as we look at what specifically, not just COVID overall, but you dig down to under what is COVID, you have the referral aspect. When the community physicians aren't seeing patients, patients aren't going into the offices. And then you also have, at the ATC, the issue of ICU bed capacity and where else can you treat those patients. 
So overall, it's -- the biggest driver is the class share decline and secondarily is the -- a little bit of the product sales based on the ICU beds. Does that help answer the question?"

Yes, so as I mentioned earlier, the share has been actually quite stable. So what we've seen is really, with Truvada LOE, what we've seen is a little bit of mix within Truvada, between branded and generics. But we haven't seen that impact the Descovy at all. On the contrary, it stayed strong at that level of share. And we expect that to continue to basically be anywhere between 40% and 45% or so throughout the year. 
Having said that, we did see a little bit of a decline quarter-over-quarter, that 6% or so. And that was largely due to the contracting to maintain strong commercial access. So the one difference has been much more around -- because it's TAF, because it's in prevention, it's highly commercially -- commercial payers. And so therefore, we're really quite focused on just making sure that people at risk have access to Descovy in light of the strong profile and safety profile that it offers. 
And so we've definitely seen erosion with Truvada, strong erosion in Q4, and that will continue as we think about coming quarters this year. But really from a Descovy standpoint, the expectation is that we continue to maintain strong commercial access. And obviously, that might mean a little bit more contracting, so a little bit more discounting on that front, but one that's important for us to make sure that people living at risk have access to Descovy as we continue forward. So hopefully, that kind of addresses your question on PrEP market."

And -- but we don't think that the ORR evaluation, the interim analysis, was actually going to form the substantive-enough data to get an approval in HR-positive. 
So what we did is we looked initially at the study when -- as part of the evaluation. Together with the team in Immunomedics, we resized the study to power it appropriately for overall survival. And at the end of the year, we'll read out PFS, which we think has a much better opportunity for reading out and giving us a fileable end point. 
So I think that was really the -- our conclusion was essentially that the ORR was only just going to cost us alpha, but not really get us something that we could file with. And we have not unblinded any data. We don't -- it was not based on anything other than wanting to get to the PFS. 
So on the inhaled remdesivir, it's going well. That study is moving through Phase I and has moved forward nicely. And no, the Phase I study is probably not adequate -- not probably, is not adequate for approval. It's -- when you move from parenteral to an inhaled approach, it's effectively moving it to a drug-device combination approach. And so all the issues there -- a PK bridge is usually when you can show that the exposure is the same. But since the exposure will be very different systemically, it will be -- primarily the, exposure will be in the lung. You can't do a bridging for PK. So it ends up being a clinical efficacy question as opposed to just a PK question. So the studies are designed to -- will be designed to go forward with evidence of clinical efficacy for approval."

It's only 8 months in, so they haven't had a full year yet. And what we're seeing in 2020 is very encouraging. As of last October, more than 1 out of 4 patients were initiated on Trodelvy in third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. 
What we also are seeing is, in December, when physicians were actually asked to report their own prescribing, so a little bit of an ATU-type approach, they were suggesting somewhere north of 40% of their third-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients were receiving Trodelvy. And so we're seeing a nice uptake. I think we have an opportunity to continue that uptake as we think about expanding not only in the academic centers, but also with our community providers. And I think that's the opportunity as we think in the next little while. And I think that will be driven mostly with the fact that we'll be able to promote the overall survival data as soon as we have the FDA approval, the full approval for the ASCENT data and the publication. So all of those things will be important inflection points for us as we move forward. 
But we're very excited as we see physicians and are really getting physician feedback around making sure that they can get through their second-line options pretty quickly to get to third line. And we have very strong peer support as well in reimbursement. So there's been no barriers on that front either. So good shape so far.

And we started to see us coming out of it in Q3. But of course, in Q4, with the surge of cases and hospitalization, we saw that dampening again.

We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Before I hand it over to the team to go into the details of our commercial pipeline and financial results, I wanted to share our overall assessment of Gilead's first quarter. 
2021 is a pivotal year for Gilead. And as you can see on Slide 4, we're off to a solid start. Our first quarter total product sales were in line with our internal expectations. While our core business was more impacted by COVID-19 than we anticipated, this was offset by higher Biktarvy sales. In the United States, 1 in 2 hospitalized patients are receiving Biktarvy, and worldwide Biktarvy continues to play a key role as a standard of care treatment for patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. 
Given the desperate situation in India, Gilead has been working with the Indian government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees to increase supply of remdesivir and provide donated medicine. As the trajectory of the pandemic evolves globally, we will continue to invest in multiple clinical studies of Biktarvy, including alternative formulations. 
Earlier this month, we received 2 FDA approvals for Trodelvy, the full approval for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer extended the label to second-line plus patients. This means Trodelvy could help many more patients as there are more than double the number of patients in this category as there are in the third line setting. We also received accelerated approval in second-line plus metastatic urothelial cancer. In March, we announced a new partnership to combine investigational lenacapavir with Merck's investigational islatravir, for long-acting HIV treatment, accelerating the path to the next wave of therapies. While many people living with HIV may prefer a daily regimen like Biktarvy, we believe that broadening their options to include weekly oral therapies and infrequent injections every 3 months or longer, addresses a significant patient need and sets up strong, sustainable HIV leadership into the late 2030s. 
Long-acting formulations such as lenacapavir as monotherapy are also likely to unlock further PrEP usage and reach many more people at risk of HIV. We are also pleased with our progress in advancing lenacapavir in both treatment and prevention settings as part of our internal clinical development. This past quarter, we reported compelling long-acting efficacy data for lenacapavir and in heavily treatment-experienced people with multidrug-resistant HIV. We are fully confident that lenacapavir will be the foundation for our long-acting HIV treatment and prevention portfolio. And while we advanced lenacapavir, Biktarvy usage continues to grow with 1 in 2 people living with HIV, starting their treatment on Biktarvy in the U.S. In addition, Biktarvy is capturing 1 and 2 switches, and approximately half of those are switching from a regimen that includes a non-Gilead agent. 
In addition to securing regulatory approvals in oncology, we have already achieved several other pipeline milestones, including EMA validation of the Trodelvy MAA for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and submission of the supplemental biologics license application to FDA for Tecartus in relapse or refractory all. Building on the work we did last year, we continue with the disciplined prioritization of our pipeline across Gilead. To share one example, Kite completed an optimization exercise this past quarter to ensure that resources are focused on the most promising opportunities to make a difference for patients. 
Finally, we're looking forward to a full year of clinical news flow for Gilead. Our pipeline list for 2021 includes over 20 milestones across therapeutic areas. While they are all important steps in Gilead's journey to serve more patients and diversify our business, Slide 5 lists the most significant items so you can track our progress more clearly. These include the Phase III TROPiCS 2 PFS readout for Trodelvy in hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Yescarta's Phase III ZUMA 7 readout for second-line DLBCL, which could result in an SBLA submission later this year. The Phase III readout for Hepcludex that could lead to BLA filing.  Phase II or 7 interim readout in non-small cell lung cancer, which could inform an opt-in decision. Magrolimab's Phase Ib data readout in MDS, which could lead to a submission for accelerated approval later this year. And potential Phase II initiation of lenacapavir and islatravir as a long-acting oral HIV treatment in the second half of 2021. 
Aspirations for patients are bold and our pipeline offers diversity across indications and risk profiles. While execution will continue to be a focus, these milestones give us a great deal of optimism about the future and our ability to deliver therapies that make a meaningful difference for patients. 
Before I hand off, I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Bill Lee, who is retiring from his role as Executive Vice President of Research after 30 years at Gilead. On behalf of all of this, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to Bill for his outstanding contributions that have helped to benefit millions of patients around the world. I would also like to welcome Dr. Flavius Martin, who joined Gilead as the new EVP of Research on April 12. Flavius has an impressive track record in overseeing industry-leading research and advancing new therapeutic candidates. 
With that, I'll invite Johanna to update you on our commercial operations in the first quarter."

Starting on Slide 7, it was a solid quarter of execution for the commercial team, with total product revenue of $6.3 billion, up 16% from the first quarter of last year. This was in line with our internal expectations as Biktarvy sales offset a more substantial pandemic-related impact on our core business than we had anticipated. Excluding Biktarvy, total product revenue was $4.9 billion reflecting inventory and pricing seasonality, the anticipated HIV loss of exclusivity in the U.S.  and ongoing pandemic related dynamics in HIV and HCV. 
Moving to HIV on Slide 8. Revenue was down sequentially as expected, primarily due to seasonal trends. As a reminder, two things happen every year to our HIV business that contribute to a sequential decline in Q4 to Q1. First, the channel builds inventory in the fourth quarter then draws it down in Q1. In the first quarter of 2021, this inventory impact contributed an estimated $410 million to the sequential decline. Second, we realized lower net HIV prices in the first quarter due to items such as increased co-pay support and Part D discounts, which tend to normalize throughout the rest of the year. This quarter, we had 2 additional impacts. A year-over-year decline of $335 million in Truvada and revenue associated with the in the U.S. and a difficult comparison in the first quarter of 2020, given the pandemic-related HIV stocking we saw in March of 2020 as well as the impact of the pandemic on HIV market demand. 
Our focus is on share-driven by demand. Overall, 3 and 4 people living with HIV initiate or switch to Gilead products, highlighting the strength in demand for our life-changing medicines. While the pandemic dampened market size and switched volumes, we maintain share, in line with prior quarters across our total HIV portfolio despite generic erosion. 
In terms of product lines, Biktarvy was up 8% year-over-year but down sequentially as expected, driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Despite the pandemic impact on the new starts and switch volume in HIV, demand fundamental for Biktarvy remains strong with 5 share point growth compared to the same time last year and 2 share point growth just in the last quarter in the United States. As Dan mentioned earlier, 1 out of 2 people living with HIV, initiating or switching therapy is prescribed Biktarvy. Further, nearly half of Biktarvy switches come from incremental sources. 
Descovy revenue was down sequentially and year-over-year, largely driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Although PrEP volume continues to be impacted by the pandemic, Descovy share remains stable and strong at around 45% and positions us well as the PrEP market recovers post pandemic. 
Moving to Slide 9. HCV's first quarter revenue was $510 million. We continue to maintain a leading share of about 60% in the U.S. and 50% in Europe. Despite COVID continuing to impact patient starts, we did see a very modest sequential improvement overall in patient volumes, although it remains depressed versus pre-COVID level. HCV also benefited from a pricing adjustment in France. 
As shown on Slide 10, in Q1, HBV and HCV sales totaled $220 million with HBV sales of $214 million, growing 15% year-over-year, driven by strong and ready demand, most notably in China and in the U.S. We continue to expect the HBV franchise sales to reach $1 billion by full year 2022. 
With the completion of the acquisition during the first quarter, our portfolio now includes Hepcludex. There are currently no available treatments for HDV making Hepcludex, which has received conditional approval by the EMA, a first-in-class treatment. This innovative drug blocks viral entry into liver cell. And we're targeting a BLA submission later this year and are excited by the opportunity to make Hepcludex more broadly available and address the unmet need for people who are infected with HDV. 
Moving to Slide 11. Trodelvy delivered $72 million in first full quarter as part of the Gilead portfolio. In a span of just 3 weeks this month, Trodelvy received FDA full approval for second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, received accelerated approval in second-line plus metastatic urothelial cancer and had its ASCENT Phase III data published in the New England Journal of Medicine just a week ago. We can now leverage treatment efficacy data from the full trial population in our discussions with physicians and build even greater confidence to consider this potentially transformative therapy. This more than doubles the patient population, extending our reach to 6,000 second-line metastatic TNBC patients in the U.S., in addition to over 4,000 patients in the third line plus population. 
Given the poor prognosis and difficulty in treating both second and third-line metastatic TNBC patients, Trodelvy could extend medium overall survival by almost a year, while also nearly tripling the median progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy. Outside the U.S., we submitted the TNBC marketing authorization application based on the ASCENT Phase III clinical study for an accelerated review process. We look forward to continuing discussions with the European Medicines Agency and anticipate approval as early as December of this year. 
Additionally, Trodelvy TNBC is under review with the U.K., Canada, Switzerland and Australia as part of Project Orbis. 
On Slide 12, Christie, who is on the call to answer for your questions shortly, you can see that our cell therapy business had a strong quarter with revenue of $191 million, up 36% from the same quarter last year, driven by growing adoption of start in Europe with our industry-leading 4-year 44% overall survival. The recent approval of for in follicular lymphoma broaden our addressable patient population and support our ongoing growth. Tecartus continues to see strong launch demand as physicians and patients adopt the first and only cell therapy approved for relapsed or refractory cell lymphoma. 
Moving to Descovy on Slide 13. First quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, with demand tracking to hospitalization rates. Although we saw lower hospitalization rates and increasing vaccination rates in certain parts of the world, overall progress was more gradual than expected over the first quarter. And as such, we are now assuming a slower pandemic recovery for the second quarter. As the pace of recovery builds momentum in the second half of the year, this should contribute to the modest recovery in patient starts for HCV as well as HIV franchises. We will continue to play our part to support broader access for eligible patients in need of remdesivir. We are working with our voluntary licensees to accelerate production capacity for India, while also donating over 450,000 vials of Biktarvy to help patients as the supply of licensed generics increases. Our thoughts are with those who continue to tackle the worst of this pandemic. 
And so with that, I will hand over the call to Merdad."

As both Dan and Joanna mentioned, we're off to a solid start in a catalyst-heavy 2021, and my comments today will focus on near-term events and changes to our pipeline. A comprehensive update on our broader pipeline is included in the appendix of the slide deck available on our IR website. 
I'll start with our virology pipeline. We remain as focused as ever on driving innovation in HIV therapies, and there are no changes to the expected time lines associated with our lenacapavir programs. In HIV prevention, we're activating sites for our first Phase III study of lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV, and will begin screening patients later this quarter. This study will focus on preventing infection in transgender men, transgender women and men and gender nonbinary people who have sex with men. In the second half of 2021, we plan to initiate a study looking at lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women. In treatment, we presented additional data from our Phase II/III Capella trial for lenacapavir at and we continue to expect our first-line lenacapavir filing for use with other retrovirals and heavily treatment-experienced individuals in the second half of this year. We anticipate data later this year from the Phase II calibrate study in the treatment-naive population to support virologically-suppressed indication. And we plan to launch a Phase II trial for a long-acting oral treatment combination of Gilead's lenacapavir and Merck islatravir in the second half of this year. Both medicines have shown long half lives and high potency at low doses. As such, we believe that the lenacapavir plus islatravir combination is promising, and we're excited by our new partnership and working with our colleagues at Merck to bring the maximum benefit possible to people living with HIV. Based on our commitment to HIV, we continue to work towards a potential cure. We have several early-stage programs evaluating combinations to understand the biology and identify path for this important mission. Leveraging our internal expertise as well as external partnerships, including and Gritstone. 
On Slide 16, moving on to the oncology pipeline, which has over 20 internal clinical stage programs, including many built around Trodelvy. We're excited to have received full FDA approval of Trodelvy second line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer based on the confirmatory basically ASCENT trial data. In the U.S. alone, this indication expands upon the accelerated approval for third line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to now include second-line patients who've had at least 1 prior treatment for metastatic disease. Trodelvy has the potential to significantly improve overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes for patients. 
In the U.S., there's a population of 10,000 patients who may benefit from Trodelvy. We also received FDA accelerated approval for second-line metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on positive data from the Phase II TROPHY study. With almost 1/3 of patients responding to treatment and the 7.2-month median duration of response, Trodelvy offers a much needed new treatment option for the many patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, whose disease continues to progress despite receiving available first and second-line treatment. In the U.S. alone, we estimate there are roughly 8,000 addressable patients. 
2021 will continue to be an exciting year for Trodelvy, and there have been no changes to the 2021 time lines we shared previously. We submitted the MAA to the EMA for Trodelvy in second line plus metastatic TNBC in March, and it's now under accelerated review. We continue to target EU approval in the second half of the year. Later this year, we anticipate a Phase III to progression-free survival readout for hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we'll evaluate and determine the appropriate next steps from a regulatory standpoint. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the U.S. who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. We're now actively recruiting additional patients for the Phase II TROPiCS 3 basket study in solid tumors to expand eligibility to patients regardless of TROPiCS 2 expression. We've already decided to initiate a Phase III trial in non-small cell lung cancer in the second half of this year, and we'll share updates on additional plan studies later this year. 
Moving on to cell therapy on Slide 17. With FDA's accelerated approval of the Yescarta for patients with third line plus follicular lymphoma in March, we now have added a third indication for the Kite portfolio. Zuma 5 study data showed the 91% of patients responded to a single infusion with an estimated 74% of patients in continued remission at 18 months. We're working towards making this option available to patients outside the U.S. and continue to target an MAA filing in the next several months. There are no changes to the expected time lines for the Zuma 7 study, assessing Yescarta for the second line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL patients. We expect to announce the top line Phase III outcome later this quarter, followed by SBLA and MAA submissions in the second half of the year. Additionally, the FDA has approved the inclusion of the Zuma 1 cohort 4 updated safety data into Yescarta's label for third line DLBCL. Cohort 4 demonstrated that early use of corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab led to reductions in cytokine release syndrome or neurological events. 
Moving on to Tecartus. We submitted our SBLA for relapsed or refractory adult B-cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, just after the end of the first quarter. If approved, Tecartus would add a much needed treatment option for patients 18 and older. We plan to share the Zuma 3 data at ASCO this summer, and we continue to enroll patients for Zuma 4 to evaluate Tecartus for ALL in the pediatric population. Consistent with our ongoing diligence across both Gilead and Kite, we will continue to focus and streamline the Kite portfolio to align with our key strategic priorities and expertise in hematologic malignancies, specifically lymphoma and leukemia. 
Moving on to Slide 18. In addition to the previously mentioned milestones for virology, Trodelvy and Kite, we have several other notable upcoming events. First, I want to take a moment to highlight magrolimab's progress and outlook in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In MDS, we expect to see Phase Ib data in the second half of this year, pending results, those data could lead to a BLA submission before the end of the year. If approved, magrolimab will be the first-in-class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47, and Gilead's first frontline oncology indication. There's a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. We're also exploring pivotal studies in frontline AML. Additionally, we continue to evaluate multiple solid tumor indications for magrolimab, most recently initiating a Phase Ib/II second line plus solid tumor basket study and a randomized Phase II study for head and neck cancer in combination with chemotherapy and Merck's KEYTRUDA. 
Second, in virology, we're thrilled to officially add Hepcludex into our portfolio and look forward to Phase III data readout later this quarter, with the potential for a BLA filing in the second half of the year. As for potential opt-in programs, Arkansas Arc 7 non-small cell lung cancer study is expected to evaluate an interim data in the second quarter. We and the Arcus team have indicated that the interim analysis is targeting an ORR of 50% or greater and a clear separation in OR from the Zembla AB monotherapy arm when compared to the donanemab plus combination arm. 
Last, on Slide 19, you can see our robust and diversified pipeline across oncology, virology and inflammation. In addition to the readouts on the previous slide, we have multiple collaboration programs that we're monitoring closely, including study in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and ARC 6 study for castration-resistant prostate cancer, expect -- both of which expect initial readouts later this year. And the Galapagos 623 toledo proof-of-concept trials across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and RA are expected to have readouts later this year. 
In closing, we're pleased to see how our portfolio has grown from about 30 clinical stage programs 2 years ago to 47 today, while maintaining our focus on disciplined management of R&D expenses. We've also gone from 6 molecules approved, filed or in registrational studies to 15. Our teams have worked tirelessly to continuously evaluate and accelerate priority programs. We're thrilled to see how our portfolio is developing. And we look forward to accelerating innovation to help transform patient care. 
With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Andy."

As you can see, we are building momentum in our clinical pipeline, and we expect to have plenty of data to share as we move through the rest of 2021. Moving to Slide 21. The first quarter was a good start",900,"Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we are building momentum in our clinical pipeline, and we expect to have plenty of data to share as we move through the rest of 2021. 
Moving to Slide 21. The first quarter was a good start to the year, with total product sales in line with our internal expectations overall, as modestly higher Biktarvy sales offset a slower pandemic-related recovery than we had anticipated. In addition to pandemic impacts, our HIV business reflect the inventory seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Total product sales were $6.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by Biktarvy. The first quarter reflects continued growth from Biktarvy, our first full quarter of Trodelvy sales and strong growth in HBV as well as cell therapy. This growth was offset by ongoing COVID-related softness across our business in addition to the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. As also indicated by Johanna, there is the difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2020, given the pandemic-related HIV stocking observed last year. As a result, total product sales, excluding Biktarvy, were $4.9 billion, down 11% year-over-year. 
Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.5%, 60 basis points lower year-over-year, primarily associated with product mix and a small inventory charge, partially offset by favorable royalty adjustments. Non-GAAP R&D was $1 billion, up 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by investment in new pipeline products, including Trodelvy and magrolimab, offset by timing of certain clinical studies and lower Biktarvy-related expenses.  Non-GAAP SG&A was also $1 billion, down 4% from Q1 2020 due to timing of grants and sales and marketing activities. This was partially offset by higher commercialization investments associated with Biktarvy, Trodelvy, cell therapy and HBV and HIV in China. 
Moving to tax. We realized a lower rate of 18% for the quarter due to recognition of favorable settlements with tax authorities. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $1.68 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to Biktarvy revenues, flat operating expenses and a lower tax rate, offset in part by lower interest income. 
You can see on Slide 22, that there is no change to our full year non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic remains unpredictable, and as we realized a more substantial impact to our core business in the first quarter than we had anticipated, we are nonetheless encouraged by the lower hospitalization rates and increased vaccinations. We have modified our assumptions on the timing of pandemic recovery to allow a more gradual improvement starting in the second quarter. We continue to expect total product sales, excluding Biktarvy, of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses, each to be flat to down low single-digit percentages year-over-year. 
Given our first quarter results, you can see our R&D expenses are somewhat back-end loaded in 2021 based on the timing of clinical activities, which include the anticipated initiation of the solid tumor study with magrolimab, advancing internal long-acting combinations with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. Our work with Merck on a long-acting treatment regimen for people living with HIV is also underway, and will ramp up during 2021, although we are able to absorb this program into our current R&D expense guidance. 
In SG&A, we are ramping up sales and marketing to support efforts such as the ongoing and expected launches of Trodelvy in the U.S. for bladder cancer and in Europe for triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, we expect to start seeing higher travel and other cost scale up in the second half of the year as social distancing restrictions lighten up in some geographies. Despite the lighter expenses in the first quarter, we're leaving our operating expense guidance unchanged as we expect to catch up on this to some extent later in the year and for now, retain the flexibility to manage the timing of clinical and commercial investments. We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21% for the year. While we are carefully monitoring the discussions on a higher corporate tax rate here in the United States, we believe any impact is more likely in 2022 and beyond, although, of course, a more immediate change could alter our current tax guidance. 
Finally, with no changes to our revenue or operating expense guidance, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.75 to $7.45 for the year. We have updated our GAAP diluted EPS guidance and now expect to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.45, down from $5.25 to $5.95, reflecting fair value losses for our equity holdings in the first quarter, donation expenses and other pretax charges, including upfront payments related to collaboration. 
On Slide 23, you can see that we remain diligent in our capital allocation priorities. Already this year, we have repaid $1.25 billion in debt, and we're on track to pay down at least $4 billion in total by the end of the year. We have also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares. 
To close, we remain committed to delivering for patients and for shareholders as we look to invest in our business and R&D pipeline while paying close attention to our expenses. 
With that, I'll hand the call back to Dan for a few closing comments. Dan?"

It's really going to help us gain momentum, exactly what you said. We have strong awareness in academic centers above 80%. We haven't been able to break through. We're only at about 50% or so in the community. And as you well know, if 3 quarters of the patients sit in the community, that's an incredible opportunity for us to make sure that we make sure the messages come across. We haven't been in a position in the past to promote overall survival in light of the fact that we just had that conditional approval. And so now with the full approval, not only do we get to double the patient population that Trodelvy can actually help, but actually, we also get to promote the overall survival, which is the only agent with overall survival in this setting. So I think it's really going to help us ramp up. And the focus is still going to be despite the urothelial bladder indication. We -- the focus is really going to be more like a 90-10, 90% on second line plus triple-negative breast cancer and then 10% from a promotional standpoint on urothelial cancer. We believe that, that's going to work well because there's a high overlap. There's about 70% of physicians that overlap from bladder cancer and also treat TNBC.

We did see COVID impact and slowing of our ramp-up that we started doing well Q1 of last year, and there was a slowdown in Q3, Q4. We've seen that rebound in Q1. We do believe that, that has to do with less COVID impact, especially in the U.S. Europe, in spite of the COVID impact continued to grow over those quarters. Germany and Italy being the exceptions where the COVID impact has been greater on our business there. Overall, though, we're very pleased with what we're seeing from quarter 4 to quarter 1 of this year, significant growth and coming off a couple of down quarters for Yescarta, both the U.S. and Europe up quarter-over-quarter now with Yescarta. 
And on the second line DLBCL question. So the good news is the APCs are already set up, just like with Yescarta, we're able to launch quickly. So moving up to the second line doubles the market opportunity, double the number of patients that we can serve. We also have community reps in the field already, both in Europe and in the U.S. So this referral pattern will continue to be something that we work on. But the belief or my belief is that as we look at patients in the third line plus, those are typically patients that are going for palliative care and quality of life and short-term quantity of life is being managed, whereas with Zuma 7 in the second line versus stem cell transplant, physicians and patients are still looking for a cure. So if the study is positive, we're looking at replacing stem cell transplant as a standard of care in second-line for curative potential. Remember, stem cell only cures 20% of the patients that are sent there."

Yes, we're really quite pleased with Biktarvy's performance. It just continues. And obviously, there's been some ins and out because of dynamics around us from a market standpoint because of COVID and inventory, but the share growth, 8% year-over-year as well as the fact that we continue to grow share and even 2 points in the last quarter. We also grew 2 points, not only in the U.S., but we also grew just under 2 points in Europe and about 5 points year-over-year as well. So we are seeing solid growth in Europe, and we are seeing in other markets as well, like Japan and Canada, we're #1 with Biktarvy. So I think that as the data continues to show the benefits of the profile that  Biktarvy offers for patients. I think there's no stopping us, Geoff. I think we need to continue to grow this business, and we are well poised to get out of this COVID-19 pandemic and hopefully, the markets we set. The market already has reset in the naive patient population. We're almost back to pre-COVID levels, which is great, and that's where Biktarvy truly differentiates itself. And in the switch business, we're not there yet. We're about 30% under pre-COVID levels. But again, with a share of close to 50%, also well poised for that to come back on track. So I think we continue to expand and continue to gain share over older agents because of the benefits that Biktarvy offers, not just in the U.S. but really around the world."

In terms of assumptions, I think what's safe to say is we've been fairly conservative on our inputs to the assumptions in terms of looking at what the standard of care PFS looks like and using sort of that as our approach. And I'd say, actually, that's fairly our general approach. I think we try to take a fairly conservative approach in terms of designing our trials and balance what I would sort of a statistically significant benefit with a clinically meaningful benefit. And I think that's -- we keep both of those in mind when we're powering our studies to make sure that we are -- we're hitting not only statistical significance, but looking for clinical significance. In terms of prior CDK4 6, I mean, it's obviously something that's come up a fair bit appropriately. I think people are looking at some data -- there are a number of hypotheses that are going around, around what it could be there. We're trying to take a very data-driven approach on this. And I guess I would say a couple of things. One is that in our hands and what we've seen so far from the prior studies where we looked at those people who had gotten prior to CDK4/6 compared with standard of care, Trodelvy continues to bring benefit to those patients. And as a big caveat, that's a fairly small number of people in that from us when we look at it, but I think we're comfortable that, that continues to be the case. And secondly, we are going to look at the data from the upcoming trial, and we will look at that group of patients as a subgroup analysis to see if there is a difference in terms of how they respond compared to the overall population of patients that are going to be enrolled in that. So we'll make sure that we segregate those patients out to make sure we learn from that."

I think what we've seen with Biktarvy is a really directly proportional effect with hospitalization rates. And it's kind of what we've been saying for the last couple of quarters, and we're seeing it. I mean you could literally draw the line with the hospitalizations, both in the U.S. as well as outside of the U.S. Where we've seen sales as in the first quarter, and I think that's going to continue, although to a lesser degree, we've seen hospitalizations really come down in the month of March and kind of hold steady, unfortunately. And hopefully, they'll keep coming down as go by and vaccination rates increase. But what we have seen is sales are really coming out in the U.S., of course, also within our European region as well as Asia. There's a lot of markets in Asia that are also taking full advantage of the benefits of Biktarvy for their patients, their appropriate patients. And so we believe -- we've always said that we think the tail is longer. I know nobody wants to hear that, but I think we think the tail is longer than anybody thought originally. And I think that's what we're seeing as we go into Q2, and it will be a gradual recovery. So we do believe that Biktarvy still will have an important role to play within the next couple of quarters and potentially beyond into 2022. As for some of these -- for example, India or other countries that are served by our voluntary licenses. Obviously, those are royalty-free during the pandemic, and that is something at a much lower price level. So our price for Biktarvy hasn't moved as well below the value of Biktarvy for the developed countries. For the developing world up, it's obviously quite different. With that, Christy?"

So you heard a little bit in the beginning from both Merdad and Johanna and maybe Dan that we recently took a really hard look at our a portfolio review. A few things are evolving or transforming, if you will. Kite had such a success story in bringing the first potential cure for lymphoma. We've transformed now to a company that has multiple brands -- franchise, basically, 3 indications now and with a couple more to come in the next year. As we look at that, we know a lot more now about how to affect leukemia and lymphoma in this area. So really taking a focus on making sure that we double down on our life cycle management, improving the risk-benefit profile of what we have, trying to get patients with combination therapies for, et cetera, to ensure we increase the efficacy. That's really our main focus on our core. We also looking at disrupting what we have today, whether it's IPSC, allo. We do believe eventually, the market will be, and we'll be trying to drive that way, too, towards a lower cost off-the-shelf, more convenient for patients treatments. But today, unfortunately, from what we've seen at the recent congresses and publications and study results, it's a bit further out than we had anticipated just 12 to 18 months ago. So we really need to focus on improving autologous where we have it today, disrupting ourselves in the future. And lastly, to your question, beyond -- your question was IPSC, but even beyond that, as we look at solid tumor, we really are the partner of choice with our successful manufacturing process, our ability to deliver reliably in a short period of time. We are looking at transformations, really good transformations where we have proof-of-concept in solid tumors where the market will be the largest in the long term."

So of course, there was the filgotinib relationship, but then there was a separate relationship that we went into. As you know, a couple of years ago now. And that was really based on the research platform. And I would say that nothing has really changed in relation to that. I mean one of the reasons to do that was to diversify our approaches from a discovery research perspective across, if you like, the Gilead group. I listened hard to the scientists at that time. I continue to listen hard to the scientists today. They think they have a very discriminated platform for screening compounds for first-in-class. And I'll remind you, that's really the approach first-in-class, which, of course, comes with some risks, some of which we've seen in the later-stage programs. And of course, Toledo is the most advanced now of those programs. But having said that, there are many others within their discovery platform that we continue to be intrigued about. I think it's an important part of our overall inflammation strategy, albeit at an earlier stage for Gilead. But when we think about our strategic approach that really focuses on immunology and virology as our core scientific skills, we have now obviously leaders in virology built up a really presence in oncology with inflammatory disorders, really kind of the next step and the next stage of our platform where Galapagos presents, I think 1 aspect of that, but a very important aspect in terms of first-in-class approach. So we continue to be working very closely with our partners at Galapagos to determine what the next screens are and what the next targets are in the concept of our -- the entirety of our inflammation strategy.

I didn't hear the last part of that question originally. Yes. So for Descovy, the year-over-year, obviously, it does have to do with higher payer discounts.

So for Descovy, the year-over-year, obviously, it does have to do with higher payer discounts. And that was to ensure that patients and providers had choice. And make sure that we didn't have any step at it. And now we do have some step at it for some time. But for most time, access is very open to make sure that our patients and providers choose which therapeutics is best for them for prevention. And so I think that we will continue to be smart and we will continue to be disciplined in the way that we look at those discussions with our payers, but we're also looking at data that's been pretty clear, that shows that if you basically put a step at it, you don't actually get the patient on a Truvada generic, you actually just lose your patient. And I think as we think about ending the epidemic, prevention is a big piece of that. And so that's why choice is so important, and that we keep people at risk of HIV, making sure that we keep those folks on the medicines that they're on without creating any access restrictions. And so if that's what we need to do moving forward to ensure that, that might impact the price as we go. Our intent is obviously to keep the balance between what we do from a payer standpoint, but also what we do from a share standpoint. And that's why we're proud of the fact that we've been able to manage the payer dynamics and actually hold and even grow share in the last quarter."

You have 2 outstanding organizations that are deeply experienced formulation and drug development. Gilead, obviously, is one of the leading companies globally in terms of coformulating orals. For a single tablet regimen, especially in the HIV arena, and it made sense, I think, to both companies that have us take the lead there. And at the same time, we recognize that to keep both programs moving forward quickly, it probably made the most sense to have Merck also lead a program and the injectable formulation program is one that was in their sweet spot. So this is a win-win. Both companies will be involved in both programs. And we think by doing that, we're going to be able to advance these programs more quickly than we could individually. As far as the cost sharing, we took on more of the cost-sharing because we have more of the upside, right? So it was a relatively simple. I think we are both bringing great molecules to the collaboration. We're both very excited about what we think these combinations can do in the treatment market, both in oral and the subcu injectable formulations. And we recognize that when you looked at the patent life of the 2 products, for instance, was different. The franchise that we have in HIV, the impact of these on our existing franchise. When we put it all into the mix, I think there was a clear alignment between the 2 companies that it made sense at certain revenue levels for Gilead to share disproportionately and more of the revenue or the profits, I should say. But in exchange for that, fairly, we had to agree to take a little bit more of the R&D expense, which we are happy to do. So that should, I think, that should answer your question."

We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Before I hand it over to the team to go into the details of our commercial pipeline and financial results, I wanted to share our overall assessment of Gilead's first quarter. 2021 is a pivotal year for Gilead. And as you can see on Slide 4, we're off to a solid start. 
Our first quarter total product sales were in line with our internal expectations. While our core business was more impacted by COVID-19 than we anticipated, this was offset by higher Veklury sales. In the United States, 1 in 2 hospitalized patients are receiving Veklury, and worldwide Veklury continues to play a key role as a standard of care treatment for patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
Given the desperate situation in India, Gilead has been working with the Indian government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees to increase supply of remdesivir and provide donated medicine. As the trajectory of the pandemic evolves globally, we will continue to invest in multiple clinical studies of Veklury, including alternative formulations.
Earlier this month, we received 2 FDA approvals for Trodelvy, the full approval for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer extended the label to second-line plus patients. This means Trodelvy could help many more patients as there are more than double the number of patients in this category as there are in the third line setting. 
We also received accelerated approval in second-line plus metastatic urothelial cancer. In March, we announced a new partnership to combine investigational lenacapavir with Merck's investigational islatravir, for long-acting HIV treatment, accelerating the path to the next wave of therapies. While many people living with HIV may prefer a daily regimen like Biktarvy, we believe that broadening their options to include weekly oral therapies and infrequent injections every 3 months or longer, addresses a significant patient need and sets up strong, sustainable HIV leadership into the late 2030s.
Long-acting formulations such as lenacapavir as monotherapy are also likely to unlock further PrEP usage and reach many more people at risk of HIV. We are also pleased with our progress in advancing lenacapavir in both treatment and prevention settings as part of our internal clinical development. This past quarter, we reported compelling long-acting efficacy data for lenacapavir in heavily treatment-experienced people with multidrug-resistant HIV. 
We are fully confident that lenacapavir will be the foundation for our long-acting HIV treatment and prevention portfolio. And while we advanced lenacapavir, Biktarvy usage continues to grow with 1 in 2 people living with HIV, starting their treatment on Biktarvy in the U.S. In addition, Biktarvy is capturing 1 and 2 switches, and approximately half of those are switching from a regimen that includes a non-Gilead agent.
In addition to securing regulatory approvals in oncology, we have already achieved several other pipeline milestones, including EMA validation of the Trodelvy MAA for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and submission of the supplemental biologics license application to FDA for Tecartus in relapse or refractory ALL. 
Building on the work we did last year, we continue with the disciplined prioritization of our pipeline across Gilead. To share one example, Kite completed an optimization exercise this past quarter to ensure that resources are focused on the most promising opportunities to make a difference for patients.
Finally, we're looking forward to a full year of clinical news flow for Gilead. Our pipeline list for 2021 includes over 20 milestones across therapeutic areas. While they are all important steps in Gilead's journey to serve more patients and diversify our business, Slide 5 lists the most significant items so you can track our progress more clearly. 
These include the Phase III TROPiCS-02 PFS readout for Trodelvy in hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Yescarta's Phase III ZUMA-7 readout for second-line DLBCL, which could result in an sBLA submission later this year. The Phase III readout for Hepcludex that could lead to BLA filing. ARC-2 Domvanalimab Phase II or 7 interim readout in non-small cell lung cancer, which could inform an opt-in decision. Magrolimab's Phase Ib data readout in MDS, which could lead to a submission for accelerated approval later this year. And potential Phase II initiation of lenacapavir and islatravir as a long-acting oral HIV treatment in the second half of 2021.
Our aspirations for patients are bold and our pipeline offers diversity across indications and risk profiles. While execution will continue to be a focus, these milestones give us a great deal of optimism about the future and our ability to deliver therapies that make a meaningful difference for patients.
Before I hand off, I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Bill Lee, who is retiring from his role as Executive Vice President of Research after 30 years at Gilead. On behalf of all of us, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to Bill for his outstanding contributions that have helped to benefit millions of patients around the world. 
I would also like to welcome Dr. Flavius Martin, who joined Gilead as the new EVP of Research on April 12. Flavius has an impressive track record in overseeing industry-leading research and advancing new therapeutic candidates.
With that, I'll invite Johanna to update you on our commercial operations in the first quarter."

Starting on Slide 7, it was a solid quarter of execution for the commercial team, with total product revenue of $6.3 billion, up 16% from the first quarter of last year. This was in line with our internal expecta",1136,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 7, it was a solid quarter of execution for the commercial team, with total product revenue of $6.3 billion, up 16% from the first quarter of last year. This was in line with our internal expectations as Veklury sales offset a more substantial pandemic-related impact on our core business than we had anticipated. Excluding Veklury, total product revenue was $4.9 billion reflecting inventory and pricing seasonality, the anticipated HIV loss of exclusivity in the U.S. and ongoing pandemic related dynamics in HIV and HCV.
Moving to HIV on Slide 8. Revenue was down sequentially as expected, primarily due to seasonal trends. As a reminder, two things happen every year to our HIV business that contribute to a sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. 
First, the channel builds inventory in the fourth quarter then draws it down in Q1. In the first quarter of 2021, this inventory impact contributed an estimated $410 million to the sequential decline. 
Second, we've realized lower net HIV prices in the first quarter due to items such as increased co-pay support and Part D discounts, which tend to normalize throughout the rest of the year. This quarter, we had 2 additional impacts. A year-over-year decline of $335 million in Truvada [ NHF ] revenue associated with LOEs in the U.S. And a difficult comparison in the first quarter of 2020, given the pandemic-related HIV stocking we saw in March of 2020 as well as the impact of the pandemic on HIV market demand.
Our focus is on share-driven by demand. Overall, 3 and 4 people living with HIV initiate or switch to Gilead products, highlighting the strength in demand for our life-changing medicines. While the pandemic dampened market size and switched volumes, we maintain share, in line with prior quarters across our total HIV portfolio despite generic erosion.
In terms of product lines, Biktarvy was up 8% year-over-year but down sequentially as expected, driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Despite the pandemic impact on the new starts and switch volume in HIV, demand fundamental for Biktarvy remains strong with 5 share point growth compared to the same time last year and 2 share point growth just in the last quarter in the United States. 
As Dan mentioned earlier, 1 out of 2 people living with HIV, initiating or switching therapy is prescribed Biktarvy. Further, nearly half of Biktarvy switches come from incremental sources.
Descovy revenue was down sequentially and year-over-year, largely driven by seasonal inventory and pricing dynamics. Although PrEP volume continues to be impacted by the pandemic, Descovy share remains stable and strong at around 45% and positions us well as the PrEP market recovers post pandemic.
Moving to Slide 9. HCV's first quarter revenue was $510 million. We continue to maintain a leading share of about 60% in the U.S. and 50% in Europe. Despite COVID continuing to impact patient starts, we did see a very modest sequential improvement overall in-patient volumes, although it remains depressed versus pre-COVID level. HCV also benefited from a pricing adjustment in France.
As shown on Slide 10, in Q1, HBV and HCV sales totaled $220 million with HBV sales of $214 million, growing 15% year-over-year, driven by strong and ready demand, most notably in China and in the U.S. We continue to expect the HBV franchise sales to reach $1 billion by full year 2022.
With the completion of the mere acquisition during the first quarter, our portfolio now includes Hepcludex. There are currently no available treatments for HDV making Hepcludex, which has received conditional approval by the EMA, a first-in-class treatment. This innovative drug blocks viral entry into liver cell. And we're targeting a BLA submission later this year and are excited by the opportunity to make Hepcludex more broadly available and address the unmet need for people who are infected with HDV.
Moving to Slide 11. Trodelvy delivered $72 million in first full quarter as part of the Gilead portfolio. In a span of just 3 weeks this month, Trodelvy received FDA full approval for second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, received accelerated approval in second-line plus metastatic urothelial cancer, and had its ASCENT Phase III data published in the New England Journal of Medicine just a week ago. 
We can now leverage treatment efficacy data from the full trial population in our discussions with physicians and build even greater confidence to consider this potentially transformative therapy. This more than doubles the patient population, extending our reach to 6,000 second-line metastatic TNBC patients in the U.S., in addition to over 4,000 patients in the third line plus population.
Given the poor prognosis and difficulty in treating both second and third-line metastatic TNBC patients, Trodelvy could extend medium overall survival by almost a year, while also nearly tripling the median progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy. Outside the U.S., we submitted the TNBC marketing authorization application based on the ASCENT Phase III clinical study for an accelerated review process. We look forward to continuing discussions with the European Medicines Agency and anticipate approval as early as December of this year.
Additionally, Trodelvy TNBC is under review with the U.K., Canada, Switzerland, and Australia as part of Project Orbis.
On Slide 12, Christie, who is on the call to answer for your questions shortly, you can see that our cell therapy business had a strong quarter with revenue of $191 million, up 36% from the same quarter last year, driven by growing adoption of Yescarta in Europe with our industry-leading 4-year 44% overall survival. The recent approval for Yescarta in follicular lymphoma with broaden our addressable patient population and support our ongoing growth. Tecartus continues to see strong launch demand as physicians and patients adopt the first and only cell therapy approved for relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.
Moving to Veklury on Slide 13. First quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, with demand tracking to hospitalization rates. Although we saw lower hospitalization rates and increasing vaccination rates in certain parts of the world, overall progress was more gradual than expected over the first quarter. And as such, we are now assuming a slower pandemic recovery for the second quarter. 
As the pace of recovery builds momentum in the second half of the year, this should contribute to the modest recovery in patient starts for HCV as well as HIV franchises. We will continue to play our part to support broader access for eligible patients in need of remdesivir. We are working with our voluntary licensees to accelerate production capacity for India, while also donating over 450,000 vials of Veklury to help patients as the supply of licensed generics increases. Our thoughts are with those who continue to tackle the worst of this pandemic.
And so with that, I will hand over the call to Merdad."

As both Dan and Johanna mentioned, we're off to a solid start in a catalyst-heavy 2021, and my comments today will focus on near-term events and changes to our pipeline. A comprehensive update on our broader pipeline is included in the appendix of the slide deck available on our IR website.
I'll start with our virology pipeline. We remain as focused as ever on driving innovation in HIV therapies, and there are no changes to the expected timelines associated with our lenacapavir programs. In HIV prevention, we're activating sites for our first Phase III study of lenacapavir as monotherapy for the prevention of HIV and will begin screening patients later this quarter. 
This study will focus on preventing infection in cisgender men, transgender women and men, and gender non-binary people who have sex with men. In the second half of 2021, we plan to initiate a study looking at lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV infections in adolescent girls and young women. 
In treatment, we presented additional data from our Phase II/III CAPELLA trial for lenacapavir at CROI and we continue to expect our first lenacapavir filing for use with other anti-retrovirals and heavily treatment-experienced individuals in the second half of this year. 
We anticipate data later this year from the Phase II calibrate study in the treatment-naive population to support virologically suppressed indication. And we plan to launch a Phase II trial for a long-acting oral treatment combination of Gilead's lenacapavir and Merck's islatravir in the second half of this year. Both medicines have shown long half-lives and high potency at low doses. As such, we believe that the lenacapavir plus islatravir combination is promising, and we're excited by our new partnership and working with our colleagues at Merck to bring the maximum benefit possible to people living with HIV. 
Based on our commitment to HIV, we continue to work towards a potential cure. We have several early-stage programs evaluating combinations to understand the biology and identify path for this important mission. Leveraging our internal expertise as well as external partnerships, including Aelix and Gritstone.
On Slide 16, moving on to the oncology pipeline, which has over 20 internal clinical stage programs, including many built around Trodelvy. We're excited to have received full FDA approval of Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer based on the confirmatory basically ASCENT trial data. In the U.S. alone, this indication expands upon the accelerated approval for third line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to now include second-line patients who've had at least 1 prior treatment for metastatic disease. Trodelvy has the potential to significantly improve overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes for patients.
In the U.S., there's a population of 10,000 patients who may benefit from Trodelvy. We also received FDA accelerated approval for second-line metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on positive data from the Phase II TROPHY study. With almost 1/3 of patients responding to treatment and the 7.2-month median duration of response, Trodelvy offers a much-needed new treatment option for the many patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, whose disease continues to progress despite receiving available first and second-line treatment. In the U.S. alone, we estimate there are roughly 8,000 addressable patients.
2021 will continue to be an exciting year for Trodelvy, and there have been no changes to the 2021 timelines we shared previously. We submitted the MAA to the EMA for Trodelvy in second-line plus metastatic TNBC in March, and it's now under accelerated review. We continue to target EU approval in the second half of this year. 
Later this year, we anticipate a Phase III TROPiCS-02 progression-free survival readout for hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we'll evaluate and determine the appropriate next steps from a regulatory standpoint. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the U.S. who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. 
We're now actively recruiting additional patients for the Phase II TROPiCS-03 basket study in solid tumors to expand eligibility to patients regardless of TROPiCS-02 expression. We've already decided to initiate a Phase III trial in non-small cell lung cancer in the second half of this year, and we'll share updates on additional plan studies later this year.
Moving on to cell therapy on Slide 17. With FDA's accelerated approval of the Yescarta for patients with third-line plus follicular lymphoma in March, we now have added a third indication for the Kite portfolio. Zuma-5 study data showed the 91% of patients responded to a single infusion with an estimated 74% of patients in continued remission at 18 months. 
We're working towards making this option available to patients outside the U.S. and continue to target an MAA filing in the next several months. There are no changes to the expected timelines for the Zuma-7 study, assessing Yescarta for the second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or DLBCL patients. 
We expect to announce the top-line Phase III outcome later this quarter, followed by sBLA and MAA submissions in the second half of the year. Additionally, the FDA has approved the inclusion of the Zuma-1 Cohort 4s updated safety data into Yescarta's label for third-line DLBCL. Cohort 4 demonstrated that early use of corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab led to reductions in cytokine release syndrome or neurological events.
Moving on to Tecartus. We submitted our sBLA for relapsed or refractory adult B-cell precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, just after the end of the first quarter. If approved, Tecartus would add a much-needed treatment option for patients 18 and older. We plan to share the Zuma-3 data at ASCO this summer, and we continue to enroll patients for Zuma-4 to evaluate Tecartus for ALL in the pediatric population. Consistent with our ongoing diligence across both Gilead and Kite, we will continue to focus and streamline the Kite portfolio to align with our key strategic priorities and expertise in hematologic malignancies, specifically lymphoma and leukemia.
Moving on to Slide 18. In addition to the previously mentioned milestones for virology, Trodelvy and Kite, we have several other notable upcoming events. First, I want to take a moment to highlight magrolimab's progress and outlook in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. In MDS, we expect to see Phase Ib data in the second half of this year, pending results, those data could lead to a BLA submission before the end of the year. 
If approved, magrolimab will be the first-in-class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47, and Gilead's first run frontline oncology indication. 
There's a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. 
We're also exploring pivotal studies in frontline AML. Additionally, we continue to evaluate multiple solid tumor indications for magrolimab, most recently initiating a Phase Ib/II second-line plus solid tumor basket study and a randomized Phase II study for head and neck cancer in combination with chemotherapy and Merck's KEYTRUDA.
Second, in virology, we're thrilled to officially add Hepcludex into our portfolio and look forward to Phase III data readout later this quarter, with the potential for a BLA filing in the second half of the year. As for potential opt-in programs, Arcus' ARC-7 non-small cell lung cancer study is expected to evaluate an interim data in the second quarter.
We and the Arcus team have indicated that the interim analysis is targeting an ORR of 50% or greater and a clear separation in ORR from the Zimberelimab monotherapy arm when compared to the Domvanalimab plus Zimberelimab combination arm.
Last, on Slide 19, you can see our robust and diversified pipeline across oncology, virology, and inflammation. In addition to the readouts on the previous slide, we have multiple collaboration programs that we're monitoring closely, including Arcus' 8 -- ARC-8 study in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and ARC-6 study for castration-resistant prostate cancer, expect -- both of which expect initial readouts later this year. 
And the Galapagos 623 Toledo proof-of-concept trials across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and RA are expected to have readouts later this year.
In closing, we're pleased to see how our portfolio has grown from about 30 clinical stage programs 2 years ago to 47 today, while maintaining our focus on disciplined management of R&D expenses. 
We've also gone from 6 molecules approved, filed or in registrational studies to 15. Our teams have worked tirelessly to continuously evaluate and accelerate priority programs. We're thrilled to see how our portfolio is developing. And we look forward to accelerating innovation to help transform patient care.
With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Andy."

As you can see, we are building momentum in our clinical pipeline, and we expect to have plenty of data to share as we move through the rest of 2021.Moving to Slide 21. The first quarter was a good start",900,"Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we are building momentum in our clinical pipeline, and we expect to have plenty of data to share as we move through the rest of 2021.
Moving to Slide 21. The first quarter was a good start to the year, with total product sales in line with our internal expectations overall, as modestly higher Veklury sales offset a slower pandemic-related recovery than we had anticipated. In addition to pandemic impacts, our HIV business reflected the inventory seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Total product sales were $6.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven primarily by Veklury. 
The first quarter reflects continued growth from Biktarvy, our first full quarter of Trodelvy sales and strong growth in HBV as well as cell therapy. This growth was offset by ongoing COVID-related softness across our business in addition to the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. 
As also indicated by Johanna, there is the difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2020, given the pandemic-related HIV stocking observed last year. As a result, total product sales, excluding Veklury, were $4.9 billion, down 11% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.5%, 60 basis points lower year-over-year, primarily associated with product mix and a small inventory charge, partially offset by favorable royalty adjustments. 
Non-GAAP R&D was $1 billion, up 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by investment in new pipeline products, including Trodelvy and magrolimab, offset by timing of certain clinical studies and lower Veklury-related expenses. Non-GAAP SG&A was also $1 billion, down 4% from Q1 2020 due to timing of grants and sales and marketing activities. 
This was partially offset by higher commercialization investments associated with Veklury, Trodelvy, cell therapy, and HBV, and HIV in China.
Moving to tax. We realized a lower rate of 18% for the quarter due to recognition of favorable settlements with tax authorities. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.08 in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $1.68 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to Veklury revenues, flat operating expenses and a lower tax rate, offset in part by lower interest income.
You can see on Slide 22, that there is no change to our full year non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic remains unpredictable, and as we realized a more substantial impact to our core business in the first quarter than we had anticipated, we are nonetheless encouraged by the lower hospitalization rates and increased vaccinations. We have modified our assumptions on the timing of pandemic recovery to allow a more gradual improvement starting in the second quarter. 
We continue to expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses, each to be flat to down low single-digit percentages year-over-year.
Given our first quarter results, you can see our R&D expenses are somewhat back-end loaded in 2021 based on the timing of clinical activities, which include the anticipated initiation of the solid tumor study with magrolimab, advancing internal long-acting combinations with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. 
Our work with Merck on a long-acting treatment regimen for people living with HIV is also underway, and will ramp up during 2021, although we are able to absorb this program into our current R&D expense guidance.
In SG&A, we are ramping up sales and marketing to support efforts such as the ongoing and expected launches of Trodelvy in the U.S. for bladder cancer and in Europe for triple-negative breast cancer. 
Additionally, we expect to start seeing higher travel and other costs scale up in the second half of the year as social distancing restrictions lighten up in some geographies. Despite the lighter expenses in the first quarter, we're leaving our operating expense guidance unchanged as we expect to catch up on this to some extent later in the year and for now, retain the flexibility to manage the timing of clinical and commercial investments. 
We continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 21% for the year. While we are carefully monitoring the discussions on a higher corporate tax rate here in the United States, we believe any impact is more likely in 2022 and beyond, although, of course, a more immediate change could alter our current tax guidance.
Finally, with no changes to our revenue or operating expense guidance, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.75 to $7.45 for the year. We have updated our GAAP diluted EPS guidance and now expect to be in the range of $4.75 to $5.45, down from $5.25 to $5.95, reflecting fair value losses for our equity holdings in the first quarter, donation expenses and other pretax charges, including upfront payments related to collaboration.
On Slide 23, you can see that we remain diligent in our capital allocation priorities. Already this year, we have repaid $1.25 billion in debt, and we're on track to pay down at least $4 billion in total by the end of the year. We have also returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares.
To close, we remain committed to delivering for patients and for shareholders as we look to invest in our business and R&D pipeline while paying close attention to our expenses.
With that, I'll hand the call back to Dan for a few closing comments. Dan?"

It's really going to help us gain momentum, exactly what you said. We have strong awareness in academic centers above 80%. We haven't been able to break through. We're only at about 50% or so in the community. And as you well know, if 3 quarters of the patients sit in the community, that's an incredible opportunity for us to make sure that we make sure the messages come across. We haven't been in a position in the past to promote overall survival in light of the fact that we just had that conditional approval. And so now with the full approval, not only do we get to double the patient population that Trodelvy can actually help, but actually, we also get to promote the overall survival, which is the only agent with overall survival in this setting. 
So I think it's really going to help us ramp up. And the focus is still going to be despite the urothelial bladder indication. We -- the focus is really going to be more like a 90-10, 90% on second-line plus triple-negative breast cancer and then 10% from a promotional standpoint on urothelial cancer. We believe that that's going to work well because there's a high overlap. There's about 70% of physicians that overlap from bladder cancer and also treat TNBC. So we're going to be in good shape to ramp this up. This is really the opportunity for Trodelvy right now for this year."

We did see COVID impact and slowing of our ramp-up that we started doing well Q1 of last year, and there was a slowdown in Q3, Q4. We've seen that rebound in Q1. We do believe that that has to do with less COVID impact, especially in the U.S. Europe, in spite of the COVID impact continued to grow over those quarters. Germany and Italy being the exceptions where the COVID impact has been greater on our business there. Overall, though, we're very pleased with what we're seeing from quarter 4 to quarter 1 of this year, significant growth and coming off a couple of down quarters for Yescarta, both the U.S. and the -- and Europe up quarter-over-quarter now with Yescarta.
And on the second-line DLBCL question. So the good news is the APCs are already set up, just like with Yescarta's, we're able to launch quickly. So moving up to the second-line doubles the market opportunity, doubles the number of patients that we can serve. We also have community reps in the field already, both in Europe and in the U.S. So this referral pattern will continue to be something that we work on. But the belief or my belief is that as we look at patients in the third-line plus, those are typically patients that are going for palliative care and quality of life and short-term quantity of life is being managed, whereas with Zuma-7 in the second-line versus stem cell transplant, physicians and patients are still looking for a cure. 
So if the study is positive, we're looking at replacing stem cell transplant as a standard of care in second-line for curative potential. Remember, stem cell only cures 20% of the patients that are sent there."

So I think that as the data continues to show the benefits of the profile that Biktarvy offers for patients. I think there's no stopping us, Geoff. 
I think we need to continue to grow this business, and we are well poised to get out of this COVID-19 pandemic and hopefully, the markets reset. The market already has reset in the naive patient population. We're almost back to pre-COVID levels, which is great, and that's where Biktarvy truly differentiates itself. And in the switch business, we're not there yet. We're about 30% under pre-COVID levels. But again, with a share of close to 50%, also well poised for that to come back on track.

I think we try to take a fairly conservative approach in terms of designing our trials and balance what I would sort of a statistically significant benefit with a clinically meaningful benefit. And I think that that's -- we keep both of those in mind when we're powering our studies to make sure that we are -- we're hitting not only statistical significance but looking for clinical significance. 
In terms of prior CDK4/6, I mean, it's obviously something that's come up a fair bit appropriately. I think people are looking at some data -- there are a number of hypotheses that are going around, around what it could be there. We're trying to take a very data-driven approach on this. And I guess I would say a couple of things. One is that in our hands and what we've seen so far from the prior studies where we looked at those people who had gotten prior to CDK4/6 compared with standard of care, Trodelvy continues to bring benefit to those patients. 
And as a big caveat, that's a fairly small number of people in that from us when we look at it, but I think we're comfortable that that continues to be the case. 
And secondly, we are going to look at the data from the upcoming trial, and we will look at that that group of patients as a subgroup analysis to see if there is a difference in terms of how they respond compared to the overall population of patients that are going to be enrolled in that. So we'll make sure that we segregate those patients out to make sure we learn from that."

Can you give us some estimates on how do you think of -- general trends on pricing and thanks for what you're doing over there? And then this is a very simple question. You talked a lot upfront about cell therapy. There's still, there is also off-the-shelf iPSCs. We talked about that a lot.

I think what we've seen with Veklury is a really directly proportional effect with hospitalization rates. And it's kind of what we've been saying for the last couple of quarters, and we're seeing it. Yes. I mean you could literally draw the line with the hospitalizations, both in the U.S. as well as outside of the U.S. Where we've seen sales as in the first quarter, and I think that's going to continue, although to a lesser degree, we've seen hospitalizations really come down in the month of March and kind of hold steady, unfortunately. 
And hopefully, they'll keep coming down as months go by and vaccination rates increase. But what we have seen is sales are really coming out in the U.S., of course, also within our European region as well as Asia. There's a lot of markets in Asia that are also taking full advantage of the benefits of Veklury for their patients, their appropriate patients. 
And so we believe -- we've always said that we think the tail is longer. I know nobody wants to hear that, but I think we think the tail is longer than anybody thought originally. And I think that's what we're seeing as we go into Q2, and it will be a gradual recovery. So we do believe that Veklury still will have an important role to play within the next couple of quarters and potentially beyond into 2022. 
As for some of these -- for example, India or other countries that are served by our voluntary licenses. Obviously, those are royalty-free during the pandemic, and that is something at a much lower price level. So our price for Veklury hasn't moved. It's well below the value of Veklury for the developed countries. For the developing rolled up, it's obviously quite different. With that, Christi?"

So you heard a little bit in the beginning from both Merdad and Johanna and maybe Dan that we recently took a really hard look at our portfolio review. A few things are evolving or transforming, if you will. 
Kite had such a success story in bringing the first potential cure for lymphoma. We've transformed now to a company that has multiple brands -- franchise, basically, 3 indications now and with a couple more to come in the next year. As we look at that, we know a lot more now about how to affect leukemia and lymphoma in this area. 
So really taking a focus on making sure that we double down on our life cycle management, improving the risk-benefit profile of what we have, trying to get patients with combination therapies for, et cetera, to ensure we increase the efficacy. That's really our main focus on our core. We are also looking at disrupting what we have today, whether it's iPSC, allo. We do believe eventually, the market will be, and we'll be trying to drive that way, too, towards a lower cost off-the-shelf, more convenient for patients' treatments. 
But today, unfortunately, from what we've seen at the recent congresses and publications and study results, it's a bit further out than we had anticipated just 12 to 18 months ago. 
So we really need to focus on improving autologous where we have it today, disrupting ourselves in the future. And lastly, to your question, beyond iPSC -- your question was iPSC, but even beyond that, as we look at solid tumor, we really are the partner of choice with our successful manufacturing process, our ability to deliver reliably in a short period of time. We are looking at transformations, really good transformations where we have proof-of-concept in solid tumors where the market will be the largest in the long-term."

I think it's an early part of the longer journey, ranging from -- is there a particular indication that we want to pursue further to confirm and expand on the signal to -- do we have the right molecule for that.

So maybe just to you, Matthew, to just give a little bit of context of people that may not be completely familiar with our relationship with Galapagos. So of course, there was the filgotinib relationship, but then there was a separate relationship that we went into. As you know, a couple of years ago now. 
And that was really based on the research platform. And I would say that nothing has really changed in relation to that. I mean one of the reasons to do that was to diversify our approaches from a discovery research perspective across, if you like, the Gilead Group. I listened hard to the scientists at that time. I continue to listen hard to the scientists today. They think they have a very discriminated platform for screening compounds for first-in-class. And I'll remind you, that's really the approach first-in-class, which, of course, comes with some risks, some of which we've seen in the later-stage programs. 
And of course, Toledo is the most advanced now of those programs. But having said that, there are many others within their discovery platform that we continue to be intrigued about. I think it's an important part of our overall inflammation strategy, albeit at an earlier stage for Gilead. But when we think about our strategic approach that really focuses on immunology and virology as our core scientific skills, we have now obviously leaders in virology built up a really significant presence in oncology with inflammatory disorders, really kind of the next step and the next stage of our platform where Galapagos presents, I think 1 aspect of that, but a very important aspect in terms of first-in-class approach. 
So we continue to be working very closely with our partners at Galapagos to determine what the next screens are and what the next targets are in the concept of our -- the entirety of our inflammation strategy. So thanks, Matt."

And make sure that we didn't have any step at it. And now we do have some step at it for some plan. 
But for most plans, access is very open to make sure that our patients and providers choose which therapeutics is best for them for prevention. And so I think that we will continue to be smart and we will continue to be disciplined in the way that we look at those discussions with our payers, but we're also looking at data that's been pretty clear, that shows that if you basically put a step at it, you don't actually get the patient on a Truvada generic, you actually just lose your patient. 
And I think as we think about ending the epidemic, prevention is a big piece of that. And so that's why choice is so important, and that we keep people at risk of HIV, making sure that we keep those folks on the medicines that they're on without creating any access restrictions. And so if that's what we need to do moving forward to ensure that that might impact the price as we go. Our intent is obviously to keep the balance between what we do from a payer standpoint, but also what we do from a share standpoint.

You have 2 outstanding organizations that are deeply experienced at formulation and drug development. Gilead, obviously, is one of the leading companies globally in terms of coformulating orals. For a single tablet regimen, especially in the HIV arena, and it made sense, I think, to both companies that have us take the lead there. 
And at the same time, we recognize that to keep both programs moving forward quickly, it probably made the most sense to have Merck also lead a program and the injectable formulation program is one that was in their sweet spot. So this is a win-win. Both companies will be involved in both programs. 
And we think by doing that, we're going to be able to advance these programs more quickly than we could individually. As far as the cost sharing, we took on more of the cost-sharing because we have more of the upside, right? So it was a relatively simple. 
I think we are both bringing great molecules to the collaboration. We're both very excited about what we think these combinations can do in the treatment market, both in oral and the subcu injectable formulations. And we recognize that when you looked at the patent life of the 2 products, for instance, was different. The franchise that we have in HIV, the impact of these on our existing franchise. When we put it all into the mix, I think there was a clear alignment between the 2 companies that it made sense at certain revenue levels for Gilead to share disproportionately and more of the revenue or the profits, I should say. 
But in exchange for that, fairly, we had to agree to take a little bit more of the R&D expense, which we are happy to do. So that should, I think, Hartaj, that should answer your question."

We're pleased to provide you with an update on our second quarter, where we delivered solid financial performance and significant progress on our increasin",852,"Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us here today. We're pleased to provide you with an update on our second quarter, where we delivered solid financial performance and significant progress on our increasingly diverse pipeline. 2021 is an important year for our pipeline, and we're very encouraged by the milestones we've achieved for therapies that are potentially transformative for Gilead and for patients. All of this reinforces our confidence in our strategic direction. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank our global community of Gilead and Kite employees, who consistently go above and beyond to drive progress with resilience and dedication. Different parts of the world are riding the ebb and flow of COVID-19 cases at various times. And while the vaccines give us hope and optimism, we are still very much living with the pandemic. Remdesivir continues to play an important role in fighting the virus and has now been used to treat an estimated 7 million hospitalized patients worldwide. 
Turning to the main highlights of the quarter on Slide 4, the second quarter was a solid quarter overall Veklury sales of $829 million were once again higher than anticipated, offsetting the lingering impact of the pandemic, particularly on HIV treatment. In light of this pandemic impact, Biktarvy's performance is quite encouraging, revenue for the quarter was USD 2 billion, up 24% or $390 million from the same quarter last year. This more than offset the $322 million headwind associated with the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. Much of that headwind is now, of course, behind us. Overall, our share of the HIV treatment market held steady quarter-over-quarter, and our PrEP share remains steady even with generic entries. These dynamics give us confidence that the underlying demand for our HIV products remains strong and positions us well for growth as the overall HIV market recovery gains momentum. 
Moving to our clinical pipeline, 2021 is a catalyst-heavy year for Gilead, and we've delivered all of our key first half pipeline commitments. Among other milestones, we shared top line data from the highly anticipated ZUMA-7 trial, where Yescarta improved event-free survival for second-line large B-cell lymphoma or LBCL patients by 60% compared to the standard of care. This is truly a landmark trial, the first and largest reported Phase III trial readout that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of cell therapy, and we are excited by the opportunity to bring the potential benefits of cell therapy to patients in earlier lines. 
We shared positive Phase III data from MYR301, which will help support our anticipated BLA filing for Hepcludex for HDV in the U.S. later this year, and we submitted our NDA for use of lenacapavir in the heavily treatment-experienced population with multidrug resistance. This filing was based on data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study presented earlier this month. We also shared strong lenacapavir data from the Phase II CALIBRATE study in HIV treatment, which will be used to inform our broader lenacapavir efforts. Our partner, Arcus provided an interim update from ARC-7 that supports the continuation of both ARC-7 and ARC-10 trials for their anti-TIGIT candidate, Domvanalimab. 
Lastly, on Slide 4, we're beginning to see the positive impact of our strategy, which we introduced early last year. The business is diversified across indications and therapies. In particular, we are seeing cell therapy and Trodelvy contribute to growth and expect they will be key growth drivers for Gilead. While we build out the oncology business, we remain focused and committed on ensuring the long-term competitive positioning of our virology portfolio. 
Next, on Slide 5, we highlighted our pipeline execution so far this year. And I'd like to thank all those who helped us to deliver on this ambitious agenda, including our employees, the people who participated in the studies, our partners and the study investigators. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our target milestones include a progression-free survival or PFS readout in our event-driven Phase III TROPiCS-02 study evaluating Trodelvy in hormone receptor HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. A Phase Ib readout for magrolimab and myelodysplastic syndrome or MDS. Depending on the data, timing and results, this could result in a BLA submission for accelerated approval and initiation of the potential Phase III lenacapavir and islatravir long-acting oral combination. As you know, this is in collaboration with Merck and the development and formulation work remains on track. 
We look forward to updating you next quarter about the additional milestone progress. We understand the continued strong and consistent pipeline execution is critical to the extending the virology business and expanding further into oncology. We believe our current and pipeline therapies can address significant unmet medical needs. We are very encouraged by the progress Gilead and Kite are making. We are well on our way in our journey to expand and diversify into new therapeutic areas and we are already seeing the evolution of both our pipeline and commercial portfolio. 
With that, I'll hand over to Johanna, who will share an update on our commercial performance for the second quarter."

On Slide 8, Veklury secon",1460,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 7, total product sales of $6.2 billion were up 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting Veklury, which was not a contributor to revenue in the second quarter of 2020. 
On Slide 8, Veklury second quarter revenues of $829 million declined sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher vaccination rates and lower infection and hospitalization in many regions. While hospitalizations trended lower in the second quarter, Veklury remains the therapy of choice in 3 out of 5 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We estimate that since the launch in May 2020, roughly 7 million patients globally have been treated with remdesivir. It's truly remarkable and encouraging to see how remdesivir continues to play such a key role in fighting this global pandemic. 
Excluding Veklury, total product sales of $5.3 billion were up 5% year-over-year. We saw growth in Cell Therapy and HCV in addition to new revenue contributions from Trodelvy and more modestly Hepcludex for HDV. Additionally, other product revenues of $291 million grew 20% year-over-year, driven by increased demand for AmBisome outside of the U.S. to treat mucormycosis, which has seen a rise in incidents in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Sequentially, we saw 9% growth for total product sales, excluding Veklury, primarily driven by growth in Biktarvy. 
Moving to Slide 9, HIV product sales were $3.9 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total HIV revenue reflected strong Biktarvy growth that more than offset the $322 million lower revenue from Truvada and Atripla following their loss of exclusivity. Compared to last quarter, HIV grew $288 million, reflecting customary seasonal inventory dynamics and growing demand for treatment. 
Biktarvy revenue of $2 billion was up 24% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, with quarter-over-quarter growth, primarily driven by increased demand. Biktarvy remains the #1 prescribed therapy in the U.S. across naive, switch and continuing patients and remains #1 in naive across all EU5 countries. Approximately 70% of switches from both Gilead and non-Gilead regimens, result in incremental revenue. Overall, and despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, Biktarvy continues to gain market share with 1% share growth versus last quarter in both the U.S. as well as the EU5. 
Descovy revenues of $435 million grew 21% sequentially due to a modest improvement in the demand for prep and more favorable inventory and pricing dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. As we highlighted in prior quarters, we've been working with payers to ensure patients' community to have access to Descovy in light of entry of generic alternatives for Truvada. We're really pleased to see the strong sequential growth in Descovy, and we continue to maintain mid-40% share despite generic impacts. Year-over-year, Descovy grew 4%, largely due to higher demand for PrEP. And overall, PrEP demand is showing signs of recovery and is expected to continue to improve as pandemic restrictions phase out. Earlier this month, federal FAQs for the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force were released. It provided greater clarity as to the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic, and we're really encouraged by the recent development. We hope it will help to minimize the barriers of PrEP use going forward. 
Before I transition to other products, I just wanted to take a moment to share some perspective on the HIV treatment market, given the longer-than-expected pandemic impact. In regions outside of the U.S., such as Europe, we're beginning to see signs of recovery in the dynamic market with second quarter trends generally in line with our expectations. In the U.S., however, the pace of the pandemic recovery was slower than we expected in this last quarter. And while we're seeing signs of recovery in PrEP and some sequential growth in the treatment market, it's clear that it will take several quarters for treatment to return to pre-pandemic levels. 
In treatment, there are really 2 pandemic-related headwinds that we observed. First, lower HIV screening and diagnosis resulting in lower treatment initiation; and second, due to the limited support services available during the pandemic, we've seen a higher number of patients discontinue their HIV treatment. Taken together, these 2 factors have reduced the number of active patients on HIV therapy entering 2021, thereby reducing the overall volume of new and refill prescriptions we would expect to see in 2021. 
We did, however, see growth resume from this lower base in the second quarter. After prior quarter-over-quarter decline, second quarter U.S. HIV treatment prescriptions grew 2% and we expect the market to grow at historical rates once screening and diagnosis rates return to pre-pandemic levels. To continue our efforts to advance progress against the HIV epidemic, we are partnering with health care professionals, advocacy groups and policymakers to raise awareness of the unique challenges COVID-19 poses to HIV screening, diagnosis and adherence. Our goal is to help health care providers ensure that patients continue to be diagnosed and treated. 
Given the strength of the demand fundamentals for Biktarvy, Descovy for PrEP and other Gilead HIV products, we remain confident in our competitive positioning now that many communities are using social distancing requirements. In the meantime, we continue to see strength in underlying treatment demand with no material changes in the competitive landscape, with our total Gilead treatment market share holding steady at 75% in the U.S. and just under 50% in Europe despite competition and the entry of new generics. 
Next, on Slide 10, HCV product sales in the second quarter were $549 million, up 23% compared to last year, but patient starts remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The growth reflects a modest sequential recovery in HCV patient starts in the U.S. in Q2 '21, in addition to an artificially low Q2 of '20 that was impacted by unfavorable government rebate adjustments. We'll be watching for further signs of recovery in the third quarter. Both U.S. and EU Gilead market shares remained steady at around 60% and 50%, respectively. 
Moving to Slide 11, HBV and HDV product sales were $237 million, up 8% year-over-year with improving patient starts on Vemlidy, particularly in ex-U.S. markets. In its first full quarter as part of Gilead Hepcludex contributed $7 million and is currently available in France, Germany and Austria. We're excited to be working with the various reimbursement authorities to increase patient access and expect to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022.  
Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 12, product sales in the second quarter were $89 million, up 24% quarter-over-quarter, driven by demand for the 2 new indications approved in April, namely second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer. We continue to be encouraged by the positive feedback from physicians on the Phase III ASCENT data, which demonstrated a 1-year medium overall survival benefit for second-line metastatic TNBC patients treated with Trodelvy. To build on this growing interest, we're increasing community awareness, especially the expanded indication to second line in TNBC. And we expect to see growing demand as breast cancer screening ramps back up to pre-pandemic levels. IQVIA data suggests that breast cancer screening volumes were about 20% lower in the U.S. in 2020 compared to 2019. This suggests as many as 41,500 breast cancer patients have not been diagnosed during the pandemic. 
On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share a cell therapy commercial update on Slide 13. Total cell therapy product sales totaled $219 million in the second quarter, representing 39% growth year-over-year, driven by both Yescarta and Tecartus. Yescarta growth was driven by strong demand in Europe as well as successful follicular lymphoma launch in the U.S. Increased competition, particularly in third-line LBCL, continues to raise the profile of cell therapy and is positive to Kite overall. We remain confident in Yescarta's competitive profile and positioning, and are particularly proud of Kite's industry-leading manufacturing turnaround time and reliability. Our results also reflected strong momentum from the Tecartus mantle cell lymphoma launch, highlighting the unmet medical need for MCL patients. 
We continue to add new indications and geographies for our cell therapy products. For example, the [ Fosun-Kite ] joint venture recently received approval in China for Yescarta the first cell therapy to treat third-line LBCL. And we're excited to see the top line data for ZUMA-7, getting us a step closer to second-line LBCL cell therapy. Even as we prepare for discussions with regulatory agencies later this year, commercial and manufacturing preparations are ramping up to ensure sufficient capacity and support for second-line LBCL demand in both the U.S. and in Europe. Christi is here with the team to take your questions on cell therapy later in the call. But for now, I'll hand it over to Merdad to walk us through the pipeline updates."

As Dan mentioned, it's been a gratifying year so far, delivering on all our key pipeline commitments, supporting Gilead's ambitions to extend our leadership in HIV and creating a broader portfolio spanning urology and oncology and building our portfolio in inflammation. I'll spend our time today on the highlights of the quarter and pointed to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more complete view of our pipeline activities. 
First, in HIV, as you can see on Slide 15, programs for our investigational lenacapavir agent continued to progress. At the recent International Aid Society Meeting, we shared data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study that evaluated heavily treatment experienced individuals who've already developed resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs. CAPELLA demonstrated lenacapavir potency in this difficult-to-treat population. Despite significant prior resistance, antiviral activity was observed starting at day 15. By week 26, 81% of individuals had viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. Based on these data, we filed a new drug application. If approved, this would become the first 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection regimen available and deliver a welcome new option for people living with HIV, who have developed multidrug resistance to other antiretrovirals. 
Also with IAS, we presented strong interim results from the Phase II CALIBRATE study, evaluating lenacapavir in a treatment-naive population. In CALIBRATE, participants receive lenacapavir either as a subcutaneous injection or as a daily oral pill in combination with Descovy. At week 28, 94% of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA loads of less than 50 copies per ml. These findings will be used to help inform our broader efforts establishing lenacapavir as a foundational agent for our long-acting franchise. 
Late last month, we screened the first patient for the Phase III PURPOSE-II trial, studying lenacapavir for HIV prevention in CIS gender men, transgender women, transgender men and gender nonbinary people who have sex with men and are at risk of HIV infection. We expect to initiate the Phase III PURPOSE-I study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in adolescent girls and young women later this year. Finally, we're actively working on the co-formulation for the long-acting investigational oral and injectable combination of lenacapavir and islatravir and expect to initiate the oral Phase II trial by the end of the year. 
Moving on to HDV on Slide 16. Last month at the International Liver Congress, we presented data from the MYR301 and MYR204 programs. MYR301 is a Phase III registrational study evaluating bulevirtide as monotherapy for the treatment of HDV. Interim results demonstrated that bulevirtide was well tolerated in both cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients, with compensated chronic HDV infections. At week 24, bulevirtide treatment was associated with significantly greater HDV RNA declines and improvements in biochemical measures of disease activity compared to no treatment. Moreover, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events leading to discontinuation. These results continue to support the effectiveness of the 2-milligram dose, which has received conditional approval from the EMA and will form the basis of the BLA filing plan for later this year in the U.S. 
As part of our HCV cure efforts, we also presented interim data from the MYR204 Phase IIb study, investigating finite regimens of bulevirtide, both as monotherapy and in combination with PEG interferon alpha. Both monotherapy and combination treatments of bulevirtide were found to be generally well tolerated and more effective than PEG interferon alone through 24 weeks of therapy. The primary endpoint analysis occurs at 24 weeks after completion of therapy and includes virologic and biochemical response data. We look forward to sharing those data when available. 
Moving to Slide 17 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, as you know, we shared earlier the strong positive top line data from ZUMA-7, the landmark 359-patient Phase III study evaluating Yescarta in second-line LBCL. The study met the primary endpoint for event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398, representing a 60% improvement in event-free survival compared to standard of care stem cell transplant. Yescarta had a safety profile comparable to or better than what we have seen in the third-line setting. This is a clinically and statistically meaningful improvement in outcomes that, if approved in the U.S., could extend Yescarta's reach to a total unique population of 14,000 patients annually in the second and third-line LBCL setting. ZUMA-7 also met the key secondary endpoint of objective response rate. As expected, data for overall survival is immature at this time, but the interim analysis suggests a favorable trend in this critical milestone. 
In summary, we're very excited about the potential benefit to patients demonstrated in ZUMA-7 and look forward to beginning discussions with regulatory agencies later this year as we work towards potential SBLA and MAA filings for Yescarta in second-line LCL. And separately, we're on track for the Phase II readout for our first LBCL study before the end of the year. 
Beyond LBCL, we've completed filing Yescarta with the EMA for patients with follicular lymphoma after 3 or more lines of systemic therapy. We also have a PDUFA date of October 1 under accelerated review with the cap of our pipeline execution so far this year. 
In addition to the items we have discussed already, our partner ARC has provided an early interim update of their Phase II ARC-7 trial in late June, demonstrating clinical activity in the anti-TIGIT domvanalimab-based doublet and triplet combinations. Zimberelimab, our anti-PD-1 antibody, saw similar levels of activity in the monotherapy arm compared to marketed anti-PD-1s. Based on the interim analysis, we're pleased that ARC-7 and the confirmatory Phase III ARC-10 trial will continue to enroll as planned. We look forward to seeing how the data mature with additional patients and duration of follow-up to inform our opt-in decision. 
Separately, our partner, Galapagos, also shared data readouts from their Toledo SIK2/3 programs across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis and the plaque psoriasis data from their TYK2 program. Both studies were early and had small samples, and we look forward to additional data. 
We also remain focused on the following upcoming milestones. For Trodelvy, we continue to target a TROPiCS-02 PFS readout this year. The study is an event-driven Phase III trial in patients with hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we will evaluate and determine the appropriate regulatory next steps. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the U.S. who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. 
We continue to expect the Phase III non-small cell lung cancer for Trodelvy to initiate in the second half of this year. We plan to share an update from the TROPiCS-03 basket study on lung cancer later this year and will separately provide updates on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer as those data mature. We anticipate a Phase Ib readout from magrolimab in MDS later this year, and pending data will engage with regulators as we explore potential BLA filing for accelerated approval. If approved, magrolimab will be the first-in-class checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first frontline oncology indication. There's a significant unmet need for MDS, with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients being diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. We continue our development efforts in AML and have enrolled our first patient in the Phase III frontline AML magrolimab study. 
Before I wrap up the pipeline discussion, I wanted to share an update on remdesivir. We've decided not to move forward with an inhaled formulation of remdesivir based on the results of our initial proof-of-concept study, suggesting suboptimal lung deposition. To address patient needs in the evolving pandemic, we are continuing our efforts on advancing multiple novel antivirals. We expect to submit IND filings later this year or early next year for these agents. We remain committed to supporting patients through this pandemic and continuing our legacy of developing antiviral therapeutics for the treatment of emerging diseases. 
Finally, on Slide 19, I want to recognize the teams at Gilead and Kite. Compared to just 2 years ago, our pipeline has grown from 30 clinical stage programs to over 50 today, and resulted in a considerably more diverse set of assets that can be transformative, not only for patients but for Gilead. The Gilead and Kite teams have worked tirelessly to deliver on our pipeline programs during this time of dramatic growth despite the pandemic. It's a thrilling time to be part of the team, with tireless dedication and commitment to helping patients. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy to walk us through the financial results of the quarter."

Moving to Slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year-over-year, given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Exclu",867,"Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year-over-year, given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 5% year-over-year, with strong Biktarvy growth more than offsetting lower Truvada and Atripla revenues. In addition to impressive growth in cell therapy and, of course, the new revenue contribution associated with Trodelvy, which was not part of our portfolio in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving down the P&L, non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.4% in the second quarter, 210 basis points higher year-over-year and primarily associated with a lower royalty expense. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year, with lower remdesivir-related investments as compared to the same period last year, partly offset by higher investments across our pipeline, notably Trodelvy and magrolimab. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower legal expenses, offset in part by continued commercial investment in Trodelvy and Veklury outside the United States. 
Moving to tax, we realized a lower effective tax rate of 19.6% for the quarter or down 320 basis points year-over-year due to a shift in geographic earnings mix. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.87 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement primarily reflects higher product sales due to Veklury, higher gross margin as well as lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate, offset by lower interest income. Overall, we're encouraged by our first half results shown on Slide 22. 
Moving to Slide 23, you can see that we are updating our guidance for 2021. As always, the duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be uncertain and the rate and degree of these pandemic impacts as well as the corresponding recovery from the pandemic may vary across our business. With that said, we now expect full year total product sales in the range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. The new range increases the midpoint from $24.4 billion to $24.7 billion, and reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as our updated expectations for the second half of the year. 
With first half Veklury revenue of $2.3 billion, we now expect full year Veklury revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion compared to our previous $2 billion to $3 billion range. Our updated range reflects the ongoing role of Veklury in this pandemic and assumes we'll continue to see regional outbreaks. The situation continues to be dynamic, and we'll likely update our thinking again when we report our earnings after the third quarter. 
Back to our guidance, we now expect total product sales excluding Veklury for the year to be in the range of USD 21.7 billion to $21.9 billion compared to our previous range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. This tightening of the range reflects the longer-than-expected pandemic impact on our business, including the latest increase in COVID-19 cases. As Johanna discussed, the pandemic has most notably impacted our HIV treatment business, where we saw substantially fewer treatment initiations and a greater number of discontinuations than expected in 2020. It's taking longer than we expected for treated patient volumes to ramp back up to more normal levels, particularly in the United States. 
That said, we saw encouraging signs of recovery in the HIV market in the second quarter, our guidance assumes recovery will continue through the remainder of the year. Based on market share dynamics, we remain very confident in our competitive positioning, and we believe we're well positioned as the recovery continues. 
Looking at the rest of our P&L. We now expect non-GAAP product gross margin in the range of 86% to 87%, reflecting the lower mix of HIV revenue. We now expect non-GAAP R&D to decline low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels. This primarily reflects the timing of investments, and we remind you that the expenses in both R&D and SG&A are back-end loaded this year, increasing sequentially from Q2 into Q3 and then even more from Q3 into Q4. Our non-GAAP SG&A guidance remains unchanged at flat to low single-digit percentage decline over 2020. In R&D, we'll be ramping up additional studies with magrolimab, Trodelvy, long-acting combination work with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. And in SG&A, we will be ramping up marketing activities to support our growing portfolio of indications such as with Trodelvy and Tecartus. 
Finally, reflecting the updates to our revenue, gross margin and operating expense guidance, we now project non-GAAP diluted EPS between $6.97 per share and $7.25 per share for the year, and GAAP diluted EPS between $4.70 and $5.05. Additionally, our capital allocation priorities have not changed, and we remain committed to our dividend. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1 billion -- $1.25 billion in debt, and we're on track to repay at least $4 billion in debt by the end of the year. 
With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the question-and-answer session."

I think from a market dynamic standpoint, what we're seeing is we saw a little bit last year in Q2, most of the industry was actually slowing down pretty quickly in Q2. HIV took a little bit longer, and it's kind of that playing out in '21. It's taking a little bit longer to come back and bounce back. 
One of the major reasons for that has to do with your dynamic market being much smaller in this market. You have a very large pool of patients that are just continuing patients. And you're really playing in the dynamic market with your naive patients coming in and your switches and your restarts, really around 5% or so. And so that's why it's taking a little bit longer as we're going through this. 
From a different standpoint between U.S. and Europe, I think it has more to do with the fact that in Europe, there's diversity across some of the different countries as to the pandemics and the timing of kind of the recoveries or even some of the surges that happened. So it's a little bit more blended than what we've seen in the U.S. thus far. And so I think that's just what's playing out here. Obviously, the bigger impact being in the U.S. because that's where most of our business lies in HIV. 
And just to close out on that, the -- that's from a market standpoint, and it's very different than kind of the fundamentals of our HIV business. I think what we've seen with Biktarvy, we're really quite pleased with in light of the fact that not only it's grown quarter-over-quarter by 1 point, both in the U.S. as well as in the EU5, But also, if you think about it over the last 12 months, it's grown 6 point share over a very strong base. We're just under 40%, we're at 39% share at this point in time. So we're very pleased with the continued growth of Biktarvy, and you can appreciate that because it's such a larger base, that's going to get more challenging as we move forward. 
And that's why I think we're excited about the market coming back a little bit. We've seen it come back in Q2. Where the market goes, obviously, our HIV business goes because we own 75% of the market. And so therefore, we're watching that very closely, but we would expect that recovery to continue, although at a slower pace than we had originally expected."

We talked a little bit in -- earlier about the adherence piece of the puzzle, because you have less patient support groups around, you have less surround sound around those HIV patients.

And we've seen those drop-offs come back to normal to pre-COVID levels just most recently. And so that's another positive sign to that recovery of the market."

It's also related to the fact that because now we have the full approval, we have the opportunity to promote the incredible overall survival data that we have with the ASCENT data. And so that's been a big piece of the puzzle. 
If you're asking me to split the sales per line of therapy, that's very challenging in light of the claims data that we have. But what I would say is it's more about bladder cancer versus triple-negative breast cancer, I would say most of that is triple-negative breast cancer, probably about a 90-10 ratio as our bladder cancer is much smaller, although we've done some nice inroads there already and are looking at about just under 10% share in bladder right now with Trodelvy.

From an ongoing event standpoint, I think we are where thought we would be at this point, and it's really around just letting the events come in, make sure they get adjudicated, we clean the data in time to do the analysis properly. So that's where we are with that. 
And then in terms of the lung data on efficacy, yes, I mean, I think -- as I think we've said before, we're really proceeding somewhat at risk and pretty aggressively, partly based on our belief in the drug, partly because of what we've seen with other agents in lung and partly based on our early data that you're familiar with in lung that we've seen. Of course, we want to make those data more robust while we go into the Phase III world. So we are going to augment our existing data to make sure that we are mitigating our risk somewhat. But thus far, I think what we are hoping for is efficacy that certainly is comparable to what the benchmark might be, even though I think it's too early to say what that benchmark is with the direct competitor. But we are, again, I think, confident about our ability to bring safety profile that hopefully, will be better for patients."

That's actually a program that's really in line with our commitment to help end the HIV epidemic. To date, the program has actually provided free drug to more than 250,000 individuals. And really, that's what it is. It's a free program that was always intended and we'll continue to provide free Gilead medication to eligible individuals to treat and prevent HIV. Unfortunately, it was not intended to be a source of funding for organizations to deliver services, and that's what we're trying to reset a little bit. So the changes to our program model will protect our ability to be able to do this in the longer term and make it a sustainable program for us and more importantly, for patients. So that's the patient assistance program on that front. 
The question you're asking me about PrEP, we're actually quite encouraged with the FAQs that came out from the U.S. PSTF. The -- and here's why. In the FAQ, they provide a lot more clarity than they had in the past, right? This isn't new. The recommendation actually came out, the Federal Care Act recommendation came out 2 years ago. But what this provided was actually more details to it and clarity on the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic and minimizing the barriers of use. And there's a couple of things in the FAQ that pop out for me. One is it truly supports physician and patient choice. And that's the piece where generics or nongenerics, right? So Truvada generics or Descovy would then need to be really -- the physicians and the patients get to decide together what is the right medicine for which patient. And of course, with the bone and renal safety benefits that Descovy brings, I think this is a great addition to the FAQs. 
In addition to that, there's also some guidance around timely management of the request for this by payers, so to turn it around within 24 hours, which is quite different. than what's happening today. And then the last piece is $0 of out-of-pocket costs. So I think for patients, this is great news. And I also think for patient choice and physician choice, this is quite promising as well."

Thanks for taking the time to join us here today. We're pleased to provide you with an update on our second quarter, where we delivered solid financial performance and significant progress on our increasingly diverse pipeline. 2021 is an important year for our pipeline, and we're very encouraged by the milestones we've achieved for therapies that are potentially transformative for Gilead and for patients. All of this reinforces our confidence in our strategic direction. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank our global community of Gilead and Kite employees, who consistently go above and beyond to drive progress with resilience and dedication. Different parts of the world are riding the ebb and flow of COVID-19 cases at various times. And while the vaccines give us hope and optimism, we are still very much living with the pandemic. Remdesivir continues to play an important role in fighting the virus and has now been used to treat an estimated 7 million hospitalized patients worldwide. 
Turning to the main highlights of the quarter on Slide 4, the second quarter was a solid quarter overall. Veklury sales of $829 million were once again higher than anticipated, offsetting the lingering impact of the pandemic, particularly on HIV treatment. In light of this pandemic impact, Biktarvy's performance is quite encouraging, revenue for the quarter was USD 2 billion, up 24% or $390 million from the same quarter last year. This more than offset the $322 million headwind associated with the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. 
Much of that headwind is now, of course, behind us. Overall, our share of the HIV treatment market held steady quarter-over-quarter, and our PrEP share remains steady even with generic entries. These dynamics give us confidence that the underlying demand for our HIV products remains strong and positions us well for growth as the overall HIV market recovery gains momentum. 
Moving to our clinical pipeline, 2021 is a catalyst-heavy year for Gilead, and we've delivered all of our key first half pipeline commitments. Among other milestones, we shared top line data from the highly anticipated ZUMA-7 trial, where Yescarta improved event-free survival for second-line large B-cell lymphoma or LBCL patients by 60% compared to the standard of care. This is truly a landmark trial, the first and largest reported Phase III trial readout that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of cell therapy, and we are excited by the opportunity to bring the potential benefits of cell therapy to patients in earlier lines. 
We shared positive Phase III data from MYR301, which will help support our anticipated BLA filing for Hepcludex for HDV in the U.S. later this year, and we submitted our NDA for use of lenacapavir in the heavily treatment-experienced population with multidrug resistance. This filing was based on data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study presented earlier this month. We also shared strong lenacapavir data from the Phase II CALIBRATE study in HIV treatment, which will be used to inform our broader lenacapavir efforts. Our partner, Arcus provided an interim update from ARC-7 that supports the continuation of both ARC-7 and ARC-10 trials for their anti-TIGIT candidate, domvanalimab. 
Lastly, on Slide 4, we're beginning to see the positive impact of our strategy, which we introduced early last year. The business is diversified across indications and therapies. In particular, we are seeing Cell Therapy and Trodelvy contribute to growth and expect they will be key growth drivers for Gilead. While we build out the oncology business, we remain focused and committed on ensuring the long-term competitive positioning of our virology portfolio. 
Next, on Slide 5, we highlighted our pipeline execution so far this year. And I'd like to thank all those who helped us to deliver on this ambitious agenda, including our employees, the people who participated in the studies, our partners and the study investigators. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our target milestones include a progression-free survival or PFS readout in our event-driven Phase III TROPiCS-02 study evaluating Trodelvy in hormone receptor HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. A Phase Ib readout for magrolimab and myelodysplastic syndrome or MDS. Depending on the data, timing and results, this could result in a BLA submission for accelerated approval and initiation of the potential Phase III lenacapavir and islatravir long-acting oral combination. As you know, this is in collaboration with Merck and the development and formulation work remains on track. 
We look forward to updating you next quarter about the additional milestone progress. We understand the continued strong and consistent pipeline execution is critical to the extending the virology business and expanding further into oncology. We believe our current and pipeline therapies can address significant unmet medical needs. We are very encouraged by the progress Gilead and Kite are making. We are well on our way in our journey to expand and diversify into new therapeutic areas and we are already seeing the evolution of both our pipeline and commercial portfolio. 
With that, I'll hand over to Johanna, who will share an update on our commercial performance for the second quarter."

On Slide 8, Veklury secon",1462,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 7, total product sales of $6.2 billion were up 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting Veklury, which was not a contributor to revenue in the second quarter of 2020. 
On Slide 8, Veklury second quarter revenues of $829 million declined sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher vaccination rates and lower infection and hospitalization in many regions. While hospitalizations trended lower in the second quarter, Veklury remains the therapy of choice in 3 out of 5 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We estimate that since the launch in May 2020, roughly 7 million patients globally have been treated with remdesivir. It's truly remarkable and encouraging to see how remdesivir continues to play such a key role in fighting this global pandemic. 
Excluding Veklury, total product sales of $5.3 billion were up 5% year-over-year. We saw growth in Cell Therapy and HCV in addition to new revenue contributions from Trodelvy and more modestly Hepcludex for HDV. Additionally, other product revenues of $291 million grew 20% year-over-year, driven by increased demand for AmBisome outside of the U.S. to treat mucormycosis, which has seen a rise in incidents in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Sequentially, we saw 9% growth for total product sales, excluding Veklury, primarily driven by growth in Biktarvy. 
Moving to Slide 9, HIV product sales were $3.9 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total HIV revenue reflected strong Biktarvy growth that more than offset the $322 million lower revenue from Truvada and Atripla following their loss of exclusivity. Compared to last quarter, HIV grew $288 million, reflecting customary seasonal inventory dynamics and growing demand for treatment. 
Biktarvy revenue of $2 billion was up 24% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, with quarter-over-quarter growth, primarily driven by increased demand. Biktarvy remains the #1 prescribed therapy in the U.S. across naive, switch and continuing patients and remains #1 in naive across all EU5 countries. Approximately 70% of switches from both Gilead and non-Gilead regimens, result in incremental revenue. Overall, and despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, Biktarvy continues to gain market share with 1% share growth versus last quarter in both the U.S. as well as the EU5. 
Descovy revenues of $435 million grew 21% sequentially due to a modest improvement in the demand for prep and more favorable inventory and pricing dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. As we highlighted in prior quarters, we've been working with payers to ensure patients' community to have access to Descovy in light of entry of generic alternatives for Truvada. We're really pleased to see the strong sequential growth in Descovy, and we continue to maintain mid-40% share despite generic impacts. Year-over-year, Descovy grew 4%, largely due to higher demand for PrEP. 
And overall, PrEP demand is showing signs of recovery and is expected to continue to improve as pandemic restrictions phase out. Earlier this month, federal FAQs for the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force were released. It provided greater clarity as to the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic, and we're really encouraged by this recent development. We hope it will help to minimize the barriers of PrEP use going forward. 
Before I transition to other products, I just wanted to take a moment to share some perspective on the HIV treatment market, given the longer-than-expected pandemic impact. In regions outside of the U.S., such as Europe, we're beginning to see signs of recovery in the dynamic market with second quarter trends generally in line with our expectations. In the U.S., however, the pace of the pandemic recovery was slower than we expected in this last quarter. And while we're seeing signs of recovery in PrEP and some sequential growth in the treatment market, it's clear that it will take several quarters for treatment to return to pre-pandemic levels. 
In treatment, there are really 2 pandemic-related headwinds that we observed. First, lower HIV screening and diagnosis resulting in lower treatment initiation; and second, due to the limited support services available during the pandemic, we've seen a higher number of patients discontinue their HIV treatments. Taken together, these 2 factors have reduced the number of active patients on HIV therapy entering 2021, thereby reducing the overall volume of new and refill prescriptions we would expect to see in 2021. 
We did, however, see growth resume from this lower base in the second quarter. After prior quarter-over-quarter decline, second quarter U.S. HIV treatment prescriptions grew 2% and we expect the market to grow at historical rates once screening and diagnosis rates return to pre-pandemic levels. To continue our efforts to advance progress against the HIV epidemic, we are partnering with health care professionals, advocacy groups and policymakers to raise awareness of the unique challenges COVID-19 poses to HIV screening, diagnosis and [ adherence ]. Our goal is to help health care providers ensure that patients continue to be diagnosed and treated. 
Given the strength of the demand fundamentals for Biktarvy, Descovy for PrEP and other Gilead HIV products, we remain confident in our competitive positioning now that many communities aren't using social distancing requirements. In the meantime, we continue to see strength in underlying treatment demand with no material changes in the competitive landscape, with our total Gilead treatment market share holding steady at 75% in the U.S. and just under 50% in Europe despite competition and the entry of new generics. 
Next, on Slide 10, HCV product sales in the second quarter were $549 million, up 23% compared to last year, but patient starts remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The growth reflects a modest sequential recovery in HCV patient starts in the U.S. in Q2 '21, in addition to an artificially low Q2 of '20 that was impacted by unfavorable government rebate adjustments. We'll be watching for further signs of recovery in the third quarter. Both U.S. and EU Gilead market shares remain steady at around 60% and 50%, respectively. 
Moving to Slide 11, HBV and HDV product sales were $237 million, up 8% year-over-year with improving patient starts on Vemlidy, particularly in ex U.S. markets. In its first full quarter as part of Gilead Hepcludex contributed $7 million and is currently available in France, Germany and Austria. We're excited to be working with the various reimbursement authorities to increase patient access and expect to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022.  
Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 12, product sales in the second quarter were $89 million, up 24% quarter-over-quarter, driven by demand for the 2 new indications approved in April, namely second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer. We continue to be encouraged by the positive feedback from physicians on the Phase III ASCENT data, which demonstrated a 1-year medium overall survival benefit for second-line metastatic TNBC patients treated with Trodelvy. 
To build on this growing interest, we're increasing community awareness, especially the expanded indication to second line in TNBC. And we expect to see growing demand as breast cancer screening ramps back up to pre-pandemic levels. IQVIA data suggests that breast cancer screening volumes were about 20% lower in the U.S. in 2020 compared to 2019. This suggests as many as 41,500 breast cancer patients have not been diagnosed during the pandemic. 
On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share a Cell Therapy commercial update on Slide 13. Total cell therapy product sales totaled $219 million in the second quarter, representing 39% growth year-over-year, driven by both Yescarta and Tecartus. Yescarta growth was driven by strong demand in Europe as well as successful follicular lymphoma launch in the U.S. Increased competition, particularly in third-line LBCL, continues to raise the profile of cell therapy and is positive to Kite overall. We remain confident in Yescarta's competitive profile and positioning, and are particularly proud of Kite's industry-leading manufacturing turnaround time and reliability. Our results also reflected strong momentum from the Tecartus mantle cell lymphoma launch, highlighting the unmet medical need for MCL patients. 
We continue to add new indications and geographies for our cell therapy products. For example, the Fosun-Kite joint venture recently received approval in China for Yescarta as the first cell therapy to treat third-line LBCL. And we're excited to see the top line data for ZUMA-7, getting us a step closer to second-line LBCL cell therapy. Even as we prepare for discussions with regulatory agencies later this year, commercial and manufacturing preparations are ramping up to ensure sufficient capacity and support for second-line LBCL demand in both the U.S. and in Europe. Christi is here with the team to take your questions on cell therapy later in the call. But for now, I'll hand it over to Merdad to walk us through the pipeline updates."

As Dan mentioned, it's been a gratifying year so far, delivering on all our key pipeline commitments, supporting Gilead's ambitions to extend our leadership in HIV and creating a broader portfolio spanning virology and oncology and building our portfolio in inflammation. I'll spend our time today on the highlights of the quarter and pointed to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more complete view of our pipeline activities. 
First, in HIV, as you can see on Slide 15, programs for our investigational lenacapavir agent continued to progress. At the recent International Aid Society Meeting, we shared data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study that evaluated heavily treatment experienced individuals who've already developed resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs. CAPELLA demonstrated lenacapavir's potency in this difficult-to-treat population. Despite significant prior resistance, antiviral activity was observed starting at day 15. 
By week 26, 81% of individuals had viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. Based on these data, we filed a new drug application. If approved, this would become the first 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection regimen available and deliver a welcome new option for people living with HIV, who have developed multidrug resistance to other antiretrovirals. 
Also with IAS, we presented strong interim results from the Phase II CALIBRATE study, evaluating lenacapavir in a treatment-naive population. In CALIBRATE, participants receive lenacapavir either as a subcutaneous injection or as a daily oral pill in combination with Descovy. At week 28, 94% of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA loads of less than 50 copies per ml. These findings will be used to help inform our broader efforts establishing lenacapavir as a foundational agent for our long-acting franchise. 
Late last month, we screened the first patient for the Phase III PURPOSE-II trial, studying lenacapavir for HIV prevention in cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men and gender nonbinary people who have sex with men and are at risk of HIV infection. We expect to initiate the Phase III PURPOSE-I study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in adolescent girls and young women later this year. Finally, we're actively working on the co-formulation for the long-acting investigational oral and injectable combination of lenacapavir and islatravir and expect to initiate the oral Phase II trial by the end of the year. 
Moving on to HDV on Slide 16. Last month at the International Liver Congress, we presented data from the MYR301 and MYR204 programs. MYR301 is a Phase III registrational study evaluating bulevirtide as monotherapy for the treatment of HDV. Interim results demonstrated that bulevirtide was well tolerated in both cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients, with compensated chronic HDV infections. At week 24, bulevirtide treatment was associated with significantly greater HDV RNA declines and improvements in biochemical measures of disease activity compared to no treatment. 
Moreover, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events leading to discontinuation. These results continue to support the effectiveness of the 2-milligram dose, which has received conditional approval from the EMA and will form the basis of the BLA filing plan for later this year in the U.S. 
As part of our HDV cure efforts, we also presented interim data from the MYR204 Phase IIb study, investigating finite regimens of bulevirtide, both as monotherapy and in combination with PEG interferon alpha. Both monotherapy and combination treatments of bulevirtide were found to be generally well tolerated and more effective than PEG interferon alone through 24 weeks of therapy. The primary endpoint analysis occurs at 24 weeks after completion of therapy and includes virologic and biochemical response data. We look forward to sharing those data when available. 
Moving to Slide 17 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, as you know, we shared earlier the strong positive top line data from ZUMA-7, the landmark 359-patient Phase III study evaluating Yescarta in second-line LBCL. The study met the primary endpoint for event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398, representing a 60% improvement in event-free survival compared to standard of care stem cell transplant. Yescarta had a safety profile comparable to or better than what we have seen in the third-line setting. 
This is a clinically and statistically meaningful improvement in outcomes that, if approved in the U.S., could extend Yescarta's reach to a total unique population of 14,000 patients annually in the second and third-line LBCL setting. ZUMA-7 also met the key secondary endpoint of objective response rate. As expected, data for overall survival is immature at this time, but the interim analysis suggests a favorable trend in this critical milestone. 
In summary, we're very excited about the potential benefit to patients demonstrated in ZUMA-7 and look forward to beginning discussions with regulatory agencies later this year as we work towards potential SBLA and MAA filings for Yescarta in second-line LBCL. And separately, we're on track for the Phase II readout for our first line LBCL study before the end of the year. 
Beyond LBCL, we've completed filing Yescarta with the EMA for patients with follicular lymphoma after 3 or more lines of systemic therapy. We also have a PDUFA date of October 1 under accelerated review with the FDA [ for Yescarta's MALL ].  And of course, while our internal focus remains on ontologist cell therapies, we continue our engagement in alternative approaches. Most recently partnering with Shoreline Biosciences to develop novel off the shelf allogeneic  cell therapies based on natural killer targets for hematologic cancers. 
Slide 18 is a recap of our pipeline execution so far this year.  In addition to the items we have discussed already, our partner Arcus has provided an early interim update of their Phase II ARC-7 trial in late June, demonstrating clinical activity in the anti-TIGIT domvanalimab-based doublet and triplet combinations. Zimberelimab, our anti-PD-1 antibody, saw similar levels of activity in the monotherapy arm compared to marketed anti-PD-1s. Based on the interim analysis, we're pleased that ARC-7 and the confirmatory Phase III ARC-10 trial will continue to enroll as planned. We look forward to seeing how the data mature with additional patients and duration of follow-up to inform our opt-in decision. 
Separately, our partner, Galapagos, also shared data readouts from their Toledo SIK2/3 programs across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis and the plaque psoriasis data from their TYK2 program. Both studies were early and had small samples, and we look forward to additional data. 
We also remain focused on the following upcoming milestones. For Trodelvy, we continue to target a TROPiCS-02 PFS readout this year. The study is an event-driven Phase III trial in patients with hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we will evaluate and then determine the appropriate regulatory next steps. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the U.S. who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. 
We continue to expect the Phase III non-small cell lung cancer for Trodelvy to initiate in the second half of this year. We plan to share an update from the TROPiCS-03 basket study on lung cancer later this year and will separately provide updates on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer as those data mature. We anticipate a Phase Ib readout from magrolimab in MDS later this year, and pending data will engage with regulators as we explore potential BLA filing for accelerated approval. 
If approved, magrolimab will be the first-in-class checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first frontline oncology indication. There's a significant unmet need for MDS, with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients being diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. We continue our development efforts in AML and have enrolled our first patient in the Phase III frontline AML magrolimab study. 
Before I wrap up the pipeline discussion, I wanted to share an update on remdesivir. We've decided not to move forward with an inhaled formulation of remdesivir based on the results of our initial proof-of-concept study, suggesting suboptimal lung deposition. To address patient needs in the evolving pandemic, we are continuing our efforts on advancing multiple novel antivirals. We expect to submit IND filings later this year or early next year for these agents. We remain committed to supporting patients through this pandemic and continuing our legacy of developing antiviral therapeutics for the treatment of emerging diseases. 
Finally, on Slide 19, I want to recognize the teams at Gilead and Kite. Compared to just 2 years ago, our pipeline has grown from 30 clinical stage programs to over 50 today, and resulted in a considerably more diverse set of assets that can be transformative, not only for patients but for Gilead. The Gilead and Kite teams have worked tirelessly to deliver on our pipeline programs during this time of dramatic growth despite the pandemic. It's a thrilling time to be part of the team, with tireless dedication and commitment to helping patients. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy to walk us through the financial results of the quarter."

Moving to Slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year-over-year, given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Exclu",868,"Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year-over-year, given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 5% year-over-year, with strong Biktarvy growth more than offsetting lower Truvada and Atripla revenues. In addition to impressive growth in cell therapy and, of course, the new revenue contribution associated with Trodelvy, which was not part of our portfolio in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving down the P&L, non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.4% in the second quarter, 210 basis points higher year-over-year and primarily associated with a lower royalty expense. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year, with lower remdesivir-related investments as compared to the same period last year, partly offset by higher investments across our pipeline, notably Trodelvy and magrolimab. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower legal expenses, offset in part by continued commercial investment in Trodelvy and Veklury outside the United States. 
Moving to tax, we realized a lower effective tax rate of 19.6% for the quarter or down 320 basis points year-over-year due to a shift in geographic earnings mix. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.87 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement primarily reflects higher product sales due to Veklury, higher gross margin as well as lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate, offset by lower interest income. Overall, we're encouraged by our first half results shown on Slide 22. 
Moving to Slide 23, you can see that we are updating our guidance for 2021. As always, the duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be uncertain and the rate and degree of these pandemic impacts as well as the corresponding recovery from the pandemic may vary across our business. With that said, we now expect full year total product sales in the range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. The new range increases the midpoint from $24.4 billion to $24.7 billion, and reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as our updated expectations for the second half of the year. 
With first half Veklury revenue of $2.3 billion, we now expect full year Veklury revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion compared to our previous $2 billion to $3 billion range. Our updated range reflects the ongoing role of Veklury in this pandemic and assumes we'll continue to see regional outbreaks. The situation continues to be dynamic, and we'll likely update our thinking again when we report our earnings after the third quarter. 
Back to our guidance, we now expect total product sales excluding Veklury for the year to be in the range of USD 21.7 billion to $21.9 billion compared to our previous range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. This tightening of the range reflects the longer-than-expected pandemic impact on our business, including the latest increase in COVID-19 cases. As Johanna discussed, the pandemic has most notably impacted our HIV treatment business, where we saw substantially fewer treatment initiations and a greater number of discontinuations than expected in 2020. It's taking longer than we expected for treated patient volumes to ramp back up to more normal levels, particularly in the United States. 
That said, we saw encouraging signs of recovery in the HIV market in the second quarter, and our guidance assumes recovery will continue through the remainder of the year. Based on market share dynamics, we remain very confident in our competitive positioning, and we believe we're well positioned as the recovery continues. 
Looking at the rest of our P&L. We now expect non-GAAP product gross margin in the range of 86% to 87%, reflecting the lower mix of HIV revenue. We now expect non-GAAP R&D to decline low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels. This primarily reflects the timing of investments, and we remind you that the expenses in both R&D and SG&A are back-end loaded this year, increasing sequentially from Q2 into Q3 and then even more from Q3 into Q4. Our non-GAAP SG&A guidance remains unchanged at flat to low single-digit percentage decline over 2020. 
In R&D, we'll be ramping up additional studies with magrolimab, Trodelvy, long-acting combination work with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. And in SG&A, we will be ramping up marketing activities to support our growing portfolio of indications such as with Trodelvy and Tecartus. 
Finally, reflecting the updates to our revenue, gross margin and operating expense guidance, we now project non-GAAP diluted EPS between $6.90 per share and $7.25 per share for the year, and GAAP diluted EPS between $4.70 and $5.05. Additionally, our capital allocation priorities have not changed, and we remain committed to our dividend. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1 billion -- $1.25 billion in debt, and we're on track to repay at least $4 billion in debt by the end of the year. 
With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the question-and-answer session."

I think from a market dynamic standpoint, what we're seeing is we saw a little bit last year in Q2, most of the industry was actually slowing down pretty quickly in Q2. HIV took a little bit longer, and it's kind of that playing out in '21. It's taking a little bit longer to come back and bounce back. 
One of the major reasons for that has to do with your dynamic market being much smaller in this market. You have a very large pool of patients that are just continuing patients. And you're really playing in the dynamic market with your naive patients coming in and your switches and your restarts, really around 5% or so. And so that's why it's taking a little bit longer as we're going through this. 
From a different standpoint between U.S. and Europe, I think it has more to do with the fact that in Europe, there's diversity across some of the different countries as to the pandemics and the timing of kind of the recoveries or even some of the surges that happened. So it's a little bit more blended than what we've seen in the U.S. thus far. And so I think that's just what's playing out here. Obviously, the bigger impact being in the U.S. because that's where most of our business lies in HIV. 
And just to close out on that, the -- that's from a market standpoint, and it's very different than kind of the fundamentals of our HIV business. I think what we've seen with Biktarvy, we're really quite pleased with in light of the fact that not only it's grown quarter-over-quarter by 1 point, both in the U.S. as well as in the EU5. But also, if you think about it over the last 12 months, it's grown 6 point share over a very strong base. We're just under 40%, we're at 39% share at this point in time. So we're very pleased with the continued growth of Biktarvy, and you can appreciate that because it's such a larger base, that's going to get more challenging as we move forward. 
And that's why I think we're excited about the market coming back a little bit. We've seen it come back in Q2. Where the market goes, obviously, our HIV business goes because we own 75% of the market. And so therefore, we're watching that very closely, but we would expect that recovery to continue, although at a slower pace than we had originally expected."

We talked a little bit in -- earlier about the adherence piece of the puzzle, because you have less patient support groups around, you have less surround sound around those HIV patients. 
You have a lot of those case managers and physicians that have moved over to treat COVID-19 and so for impacting HIV, a little bit disproportionately. And so we're also looking at those drop-offs. And we've seen those drop-offs come back to normal to pre-COVID levels just most recently. And so that's another positive sign to that recovery of the market."

If you're asking me to split the sales per line of therapy, that's very challenging in light of the claims data that we have. But what I would say if it's more about bladder cancer versus triple-negative breast cancer, I would say most of that is triple-negative breast cancer, probably about a 90-10 ratio as our bladder cancer is much smaller.

And I'll start a little bit and then ask Merdad and Andy, if he wants to add anything as well. 
So I think, first and foremost, I think we're -- we believe deeply in partnerships. We have a robust internal portfolio. And we also, as you know, have designed these opt-ins as a way to expand our portfolio in different therapeutic areas. Starting with Galapagos, as you know, which was predominantly focused on inflammation. 
At this stage, we don't have any opt-in milestones right now with Galapagos. We're working closely with them on their science and their discovery platform and some of their preclinical to clinical molecules to support them in their efforts. But at this stage, we don't have anything more to report other than like Galapagos has reported on the, for instance, Geoff, to your question on the Toledo program. But rest assured that as those programs evolve and mature and develop, we'll keep you informed. 
Perhaps, Merdad, if you want to say anything else in Galapagos and bridge to Arcus?"

So our R&D spend and all of our expense guidance does not include the opt-ins on any of the programs that we have options to, including the 3 programs that you mentioned at Arcus. 
You also asked about the opt-in windows. The opt-in window for the first TIGIT antibody should be coming most likely at the end of this year. It could be early next year, but it's most likely at the end of this year, we'll have enough patient data to trigger the opt-in or our desire to opt in potentially early. On the other 2 programs, the adenosine programs at Arcus, that's most likely next year. And again, there may be additional data that comes this year that if it looks really strong. We want to move as quickly as we can, and we can opt in early, Geoff, on those programs. 
And then on Toledo, it's relatively simple. And all of the Galapagos programs that opt-in comes after Phase II enabling studies. So the Toledo programs are a long ways away from a potential opt-in decision."

So to your point, Geoff, I think we're all learning about this pandemic as it rolls out. And it's certainly going through different phases, and we think will continue to go through different phases. And therefore, we are, if you like, kind of doubling down on an ability to think about antivirals outside the hospital setting, where remdesivir plays such an important role.

People will continue to get infected and some proportion of those patients will end up in the hospital. So we do believe that Veklury in the hospitalized setting is  going to be -- continue to be really important for treating those patients. And as Dan alluded to, we continue to believe and are committed to treatments -- making treatments available in the outpatient setting. 
So I wouldn't -- the inhaled nebulized approach didn't give us the results we were hoping for, the consistency we were looking for. But because we have other agents in our pipeline based on our virology expertise, we will be bringing those forward and really focusing on the outpatient setting there. So we continue to believe that having a treatment available for people, whether they're vaccinated or not, is going to be important for the foreseeable future."

And in particular, since we expanded the sample size to make sure that we are able to hit the PFS endpoint. Of course, the relevant issue is more the duration of PFS that we get. But from a powering standpoint, we're comfortable. And it's just a matter of seeing those data. From an ongoing event standpoint, I think we are where we thought we would be at this point, and it's really around just letting the events come in, make sure they get adjudicated, we clean the data in time to do the analysis properly. So that's where we are with that. 
And then in terms of the lung data on efficacy, yes, I mean, I think -- as I think we've said before, we're really proceeding somewhat at risk and pretty aggressively, partly based on our belief in the drug, partly because of what we've seen with other agents in lung and partly based on our early data that you're familiar with in lung that we've seen. Of course, we want to make those data more robust while we go into the Phase III world. So we are going to augment our existing data to make sure that we are mitigating our risk somewhat. 
But thus far, I think what we are hoping for is efficacy that certainly is comparable to what the benchmark might be, even though I think it's too early to say what that benchmark is with the direct competitor. But we are, again, I think, confident about our ability to bring safety profile that hopefully, will be better for patients."

Unfortunately, it was not intended to be a source of funding for organizations to deliver services, and that's what we're trying to reset a little bit. So the changes to our program model will protect our ability to be able to do this in the longer term and make it a sustainable program for us and more importantly, for patients. So that's the patient assistance program on that front. 
The question you're asking me about PrEP, we're actually quite encouraged with the FAQs that came out from the U.S. PSTF. The -- and here's why. In the FAQ, they provide a lot more clarity than they had in the past, right? This isn't new. The recommendation actually came out, the Affordable Care Act recommendation came out 2 years ago. But what this provided was actually more details to it and clarity on the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic and minimizing the barriers of use. 
And there's a couple of things in the FAQ that pop out for me. One is it truly supports physician and patient choice. And that's the piece where generics or nongenerics, right? So Truvada generics or Descovy would then need to be really -- the physicians and the patients get to decide together what is the right medicine for which patient. And of course, with the bone and renal safety benefits that Descovy brings, I think this is a great addition to the FAQs. 
In addition to that, there's also some guidance around timely management of the request for this by payers, so to turn it around within 24 hours, which is quite different. than what's happening today. And then the last piece is $0 of out-of-pocket costs. So I think for patients, this is great news. And I also think for patient choice and physician choice, this is quite promising as well."

Thanks for taking the time to join us here today. We're pleased to provide you with an update on our second quarter, where we delivered solid financial performance and significant progress on our increasingly diverse pipeline. 2021 is an important year for our pipeline, and we're very encouraged by the milestones we've achieved for therapies that are potentially transformative for Gilead and for patients. All of this reinforces our confidence in our strategic direction. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank our global community of Gilead and Kite employees, who consistently go above and beyond to drive progress with resilience and dedication. Different parts of the world are riding the ebb and flow of COVID-19 cases at various times. And while the vaccines give us hope and optimism, we are still very much living with the pandemic. Remdesivir continues to play an important role in fighting the virus and has now been used to treat an estimated 7 million hospitalized patients worldwide. 
Turning to the main highlights of the quarter on Slide 4, the second quarter was a solid quarter overall. Veklury sales of $829 million were once again higher than anticipated, offsetting the lingering impact of the pandemic, particularly on HIV treatment. In light of this pandemic impact, Biktarvy's performance is quite encouraging, revenue for the quarter was USD 2 billion, up 24% or $390 million from the same quarter last year. This more than offset the $322 million headwind associated with the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. 
Much of that headwind is now, of course, behind us. Overall, our share of the HIV treatment market held steady quarter-over-quarter, and our PrEP share remains steady even with generic entries. These dynamics give us confidence that the underlying demand for our HIV products remains strong and positions us well for growth as the overall HIV market recovery gains momentum. 
Moving to our clinical pipeline, 2021 is a catalyst-heavy year for Gilead, and we've delivered all of our key first half pipeline commitments. Among other milestones, we shared top line data from the highly anticipated ZUMA-7 trial, where Yescarta improved event-free survival for second-line large B-cell lymphoma or LBCL patients by 60% compared to the standard of care. This is truly a landmark trial, the first and largest reported Phase III trial readout that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of cell therapy, and we are excited by the opportunity to bring the potential benefits of cell therapy to patients in earlier lines. 
We shared positive Phase III data from MYR301, which will help support our anticipated BLA filing for Hepcludex for HDV in the U.S. later this year, and we submitted our NDA for use of lenacapavir in the heavily treatment-experienced population with multidrug resistance. This filing was based on data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study presented earlier this month. We also shared strong lenacapavir data from the Phase II CALIBRATE study in HIV treatment, which will be used to inform our broader lenacapavir efforts. Our partner, Arcus provided an interim update from ARC-7 that supports the continuation of both ARC-7 and ARC-10 trials for their anti-TIGIT candidate, domvanalimab. 
Lastly, on Slide 4, we're beginning to see the positive impact of our strategy, which we introduced early last year. The business is diversified across indications and therapies. In particular, we are seeing Cell Therapy and Trodelvy contribute to growth and expect they will be key growth drivers for Gilead. While we build out the oncology business, we remain focused and committed on ensuring the long-term competitive positioning of our virology portfolio. 
Next, on Slide 5, we highlighted our pipeline execution so far this year. And I'd like to thank all those who helped us to deliver on this ambitious agenda, including our employees, the people who participated in the studies, our partners and the study investigators. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our target milestones include a progression-free survival or PFS readout in our event-driven Phase III TROPiCS-02 study evaluating Trodelvy in hormone receptor HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. A Phase Ib readout for magrolimab and myelodysplastic syndrome or MDS. Depending on the data, timing and results, this could result in a BLA submission for accelerated approval and initiation of the potential Phase III lenacapavir and islatravir long-acting oral combination. As you know, this is in collaboration with Merck and the development and formulation work remains on track. 
We look forward to updating you next quarter about the additional milestone progress. We understand the continued strong and consistent pipeline execution is critical to the extending the virology business and expanding further into oncology. We believe our current and pipeline therapies can address significant unmet medical needs. We are very encouraged by the progress Gilead and Kite are making. We are well on our way in our journey to expand and diversify into new therapeutic areas and we are already seeing the evolution of both our pipeline and commercial portfolio. 
With that, I'll hand over to Johanna, who will share an update on our commercial performance for the second quarter."
29002,1674151580,2355784,"Gilead Sciences, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 7, total product sales of $6.2 billion were up 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting Veklury, which was not a contributor to revenue in the second quarter of 2020. On Slide 8, Veklury secon",1462,"Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting on Slide 7, total product sales of $6.2 billion were up 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting Veklury, which was not a contributor to revenue in the second quarter of 2020. 
On Slide 8, Veklury second quarter revenues of $829 million declined sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher vaccination rates and lower infection and hospitalization in many regions. While hospitalizations trended lower in the second quarter, Veklury remains the therapy of choice in 3 out of 5 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We estimate that since the launch in May 2020, roughly 7 million patients globally have been treated with remdesivir. It's truly remarkable and encouraging to see how remdesivir continues to play such a key role in fighting this global pandemic. 
Excluding Veklury, total product sales of $5.3 billion were up 5% year-over-year. We saw growth in Cell Therapy and HCV in addition to new revenue contributions from Trodelvy and more modestly Hepcludex for HDV. Additionally, other product revenues of $291 million grew 20% year-over-year, driven by increased demand for AmBisome outside of the U.S. to treat mucormycosis, which has seen a rise in incidents in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Sequentially, we saw 9% growth for total product sales, excluding Veklury, primarily driven by growth in Biktarvy. 
Moving to Slide 9, HIV product sales were $3.9 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total HIV revenue reflected strong Biktarvy growth that more than offset the $322 million lower revenue from Truvada and Atripla following their loss of exclusivity. Compared to last quarter, HIV grew $288 million, reflecting customary seasonal inventory dynamics and growing demand for treatment. 
Biktarvy revenue of $2 billion was up 24% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, with quarter-over-quarter growth, primarily driven by increased demand. Biktarvy remains the #1 prescribed therapy in the U.S. across naive, switch and continuing patients and remains #1 in naive across all EU5 countries. Approximately 70% of switches from both Gilead and non-Gilead regimens, result in incremental revenue. Overall, and despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, Biktarvy continues to gain market share with 1% share growth versus last quarter in both the U.S. as well as the EU5. 
Descovy revenues of $435 million grew 21% sequentially due to a modest improvement in the demand for prep and more favorable inventory and pricing dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. As we highlighted in prior quarters, we've been working with payers to ensure patients' community to have access to Descovy in light of entry of generic alternatives for Truvada. We're really pleased to see the strong sequential growth in Descovy, and we continue to maintain mid-40% share despite generic impacts. Year-over-year, Descovy grew 4%, largely due to higher demand for PrEP. 
And overall, PrEP demand is showing signs of recovery and is expected to continue to improve as pandemic restrictions phase out. Earlier this month, federal FAQs for the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force were released. It provided greater clarity as to the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic, and we're really encouraged by this recent development. We hope it will help to minimize the barriers of PrEP use going forward. 
Before I transition to other products, I just wanted to take a moment to share some perspective on the HIV treatment market, given the longer-than-expected pandemic impact. In regions outside of the U.S., such as Europe, we're beginning to see signs of recovery in the dynamic market with second quarter trends generally in line with our expectations. In the U.S., however, the pace of the pandemic recovery was slower than we expected in this last quarter. And while we're seeing signs of recovery in PrEP and some sequential growth in the treatment market, it's clear that it will take several quarters for treatment to return to pre-pandemic levels. 
In treatment, there are really 2 pandemic-related headwinds that we observed. First, lower HIV screening and diagnosis resulting in lower treatment initiation; and second, due to the limited support services available during the pandemic, we've seen a higher number of patients discontinue their HIV treatments. Taken together, these 2 factors have reduced the number of active patients on HIV therapy entering 2021, thereby reducing the overall volume of new and refill prescriptions we would expect to see in 2021. 
We did, however, see growth resume from this lower base in the second quarter. After prior quarter-over-quarter decline, second quarter U.S. HIV treatment prescriptions grew 2% and we expect the market to grow at historical rates once screening and diagnosis rates return to pre-pandemic levels. To continue our efforts to advance progress against the HIV epidemic, we are partnering with health care professionals, advocacy groups and policymakers to raise awareness of the unique challenges COVID-19 poses to HIV screening, diagnosis and [ adherence ]. Our goal is to help health care providers ensure that patients continue to be diagnosed and treated. 
Given the strength of the demand fundamentals for Biktarvy, Descovy for PrEP and other Gilead HIV products, we remain confident in our competitive positioning now that many communities aren't using social distancing requirements. In the meantime, we continue to see strength in underlying treatment demand with no material changes in the competitive landscape, with our total Gilead treatment market share holding steady at 75% in the U.S. and just under 50% in Europe despite competition and the entry of new generics. 
Next, on Slide 10, HCV product sales in the second quarter were $549 million, up 23% compared to last year, but patient starts remain well below pre-pandemic levels. The growth reflects a modest sequential recovery in HCV patient starts in the U.S. in Q2 '21, in addition to an artificially low Q2 of '20 that was impacted by unfavorable government rebate adjustments. We'll be watching for further signs of recovery in the third quarter. Both U.S. and EU Gilead market shares remain steady at around 60% and 50%, respectively. 
Moving to Slide 11, HBV and HDV product sales were $237 million, up 8% year-over-year with improving patient starts on Vemlidy, particularly in ex U.S. markets. In its first full quarter as part of Gilead Hepcludex contributed $7 million and is currently available in France, Germany and Austria. We're excited to be working with the various reimbursement authorities to increase patient access and expect to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022.  
Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 12, product sales in the second quarter were $89 million, up 24% quarter-over-quarter, driven by demand for the 2 new indications approved in April, namely second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer. We continue to be encouraged by the positive feedback from physicians on the Phase III ASCENT data, which demonstrated a 1-year medium overall survival benefit for second-line metastatic TNBC patients treated with Trodelvy. 
To build on this growing interest, we're increasing community awareness, especially the expanded indication to second line in TNBC. And we expect to see growing demand as breast cancer screening ramps back up to pre-pandemic levels. IQVIA data suggests that breast cancer screening volumes were about 20% lower in the U.S. in 2020 compared to 2019. This suggests as many as 41,500 breast cancer patients have not been diagnosed during the pandemic. 
On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share a Cell Therapy commercial update on Slide 13. Total cell therapy product sales totaled $219 million in the second quarter, representing 39% growth year-over-year, driven by both Yescarta and Tecartus. Yescarta growth was driven by strong demand in Europe as well as successful follicular lymphoma launch in the U.S. Increased competition, particularly in third-line LBCL, continues to raise the profile of cell therapy and is positive to Kite overall. We remain confident in Yescarta's competitive profile and positioning, and are particularly proud of Kite's industry-leading manufacturing turnaround time and reliability. Our results also reflected strong momentum from the Tecartus mantle cell lymphoma launch, highlighting the unmet medical need for MCL patients. 
We continue to add new indications and geographies for our cell therapy products. For example, the Fosun-Kite joint venture recently received approval in China for Yescarta as the first cell therapy to treat third-line LBCL. And we're excited to see the top line data for ZUMA-7, getting us a step closer to second-line LBCL cell therapy. Even as we prepare for discussions with regulatory agencies later this year, commercial and manufacturing preparations are ramping up to ensure sufficient capacity and support for second-line LBCL demand in both the U.S. and in Europe. Christi is here with the team to take your questions on cell therapy later in the call. But for now, I'll hand it over to Merdad to walk us through the pipeline updates."

As Dan mentioned, it's been a gratifying year so far, delivering on all our key pipeline commitments, supporting Gilead's ambitions to extend our leadership in HIV and creating a broader portfolio spanning virology and oncology and building our portfolio in inflammation. I'll spend our time today on the highlights of the quarter and pointed to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more complete view of our pipeline activities. 
First, in HIV, as you can see on Slide 15, programs for our investigational lenacapavir agent continued to progress. At the recent International Aid Society Meeting, we shared data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study that evaluated heavily treatment experienced individuals who've already developed resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs. CAPELLA demonstrated lenacapavir's potency in this difficult-to-treat population. Despite significant prior resistance, antiviral activity was observed starting at day 15. 
By week 26, 81% of individuals had viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. Based on these data, we filed a new drug application. If approved, this would become the first 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection regimen available and deliver a welcome new option for people living with HIV, who have developed multidrug resistance to other antiretrovirals. 
Also with IAS, we presented strong interim results from the Phase II CALIBRATE study, evaluating lenacapavir in a treatment-naive population. In CALIBRATE, participants receive lenacapavir either as a subcutaneous injection or as a daily oral pill in combination with Descovy. At week 28, 94% of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA loads of less than 50 copies per ml. These findings will be used to help inform our broader efforts establishing lenacapavir as a foundational agent for our long-acting franchise. 
Late last month, we screened the first patient for the Phase III PURPOSE-II trial, studying lenacapavir for HIV prevention in cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men and gender nonbinary people who have sex with men and are at risk of HIV infection. We expect to initiate the Phase III PURPOSE-I study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in adolescent girls and young women later this year. Finally, we're actively working on the co-formulation for the long-acting investigational oral and injectable combination of lenacapavir and islatravir and expect to initiate the oral Phase II trial by the end of the year. 
Moving on to HDV on Slide 16. Last month at the International Liver Congress, we presented data from the MYR301 and MYR204 programs. MYR301 is a Phase III registrational study evaluating bulevirtide as monotherapy for the treatment of HDV. Interim results demonstrated that bulevirtide was well tolerated in both cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients, with compensated chronic HDV infections. At week 24, bulevirtide treatment was associated with significantly greater HDV RNA declines and improvements in biochemical measures of disease activity compared to no treatment. 
Moreover, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events leading to discontinuation. These results continue to support the effectiveness of the 2-milligram dose, which has received conditional approval from the EMA and will form the basis of the BLA filing plan for later this year in the U.S. 
As part of our HDV cure efforts, we also presented interim data from the MYR204 Phase IIb study, investigating finite regimens of bulevirtide, both as monotherapy and in combination with PEG interferon alpha. Both monotherapy and combination treatments of bulevirtide were found to be generally well tolerated and more effective than PEG interferon alone through 24 weeks of therapy. The primary endpoint analysis occurs at 24 weeks after completion of therapy and includes virologic and biochemical response data. We look forward to sharing those data when available. 
Moving to Slide 17 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, as you know, we shared earlier the strong positive top line data from ZUMA-7, the landmark 359-patient Phase III study evaluating Yescarta in second-line LBCL. The study met the primary endpoint for event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398, representing a 60% improvement in event-free survival compared to standard of care stem cell transplant. Yescarta had a safety profile comparable to or better than what we have seen in the third-line setting. 
This is a clinically and statistically meaningful improvement in outcomes that, if approved in the U.S., could extend Yescarta's reach to a total unique population of 14,000 patients annually in the second and third-line LBCL setting. ZUMA-7 also met the key secondary endpoint of objective response rate. As expected, data for overall survival is immature at this time, but the interim analysis suggests a favorable trend in this critical milestone. 
In summary, we're very excited about the potential benefit to patients demonstrated in ZUMA-7 and look forward to beginning discussions with regulatory agencies later this year as we work towards potential SBLA and MAA filings for Yescarta in second-line LBCL. And separately, we're on track for the Phase II readout for our first line LBCL study before the end of the year. 
Beyond LBCL, we've completed filing Yescarta with the EMA for patients with follicular lymphoma after 3 or more lines of systemic therapy. We also have a PDUFA date of October 1 under accelerated review with the FDA [ for Yescarta's MALL ].  And of course, while our internal focus remains on ontologist cell therapies, we continue our engagement in alternative approaches. Most recently partnering with Shoreline Biosciences to develop novel off the shelf allogeneic  cell therapies based on natural killer targets for hematologic cancers. 
Slide 18 is a recap of our pipeline execution so far this year.  In addition to the items we have discussed already, our partner Arcus has provided an early interim update of their Phase II ARC-7 trial in late June, demonstrating clinical activity in the anti-TIGIT domvanalimab-based doublet and triplet combinations. Zimberelimab, our anti-PD-1 antibody, saw similar levels of activity in the monotherapy arm compared to marketed anti-PD-1s. Based on the interim analysis, we're pleased that ARC-7 and the confirmatory Phase III ARC-10 trial will continue to enroll as planned. We look forward to seeing how the data mature with additional patients and duration of follow-up to inform our opt-in decision. 
Separately, our partner, Galapagos, also shared data readouts from their Toledo SIK2/3 programs across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis and the plaque psoriasis data from their TYK2 program. Both studies were early and had small samples, and we look forward to additional data. 
We also remain focused on the following upcoming milestones. For Trodelvy, we continue to target a TROPiCS-02 PFS readout this year. The study is an event-driven Phase III trial in patients with hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we will evaluate and then determine the appropriate regulatory next steps. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the U.S. who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. 
We continue to expect the Phase III non-small cell lung cancer for Trodelvy to initiate in the second half of this year. We plan to share an update from the TROPiCS-03 basket study on lung cancer later this year and will separately provide updates on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer as those data mature. We anticipate a Phase Ib readout from magrolimab in MDS later this year, and pending data will engage with regulators as we explore potential BLA filing for accelerated approval. 
If approved, magrolimab will be the first-in-class checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first frontline oncology indication. There's a significant unmet need for MDS, with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients being diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. We continue our development efforts in AML and have enrolled our first patient in the Phase III frontline AML magrolimab study. 
Before I wrap up the pipeline discussion, I wanted to share an update on remdesivir. We've decided not to move forward with an inhaled formulation of remdesivir based on the results of our initial proof-of-concept study, suggesting suboptimal lung deposition. To address patient needs in the evolving pandemic, we are continuing our efforts on advancing multiple novel antivirals. We expect to submit IND filings later this year or early next year for these agents. We remain committed to supporting patients through this pandemic and continuing our legacy of developing antiviral therapeutics for the treatment of emerging diseases. 
Finally, on Slide 19, I want to recognize the teams at Gilead and Kite. Compared to just 2 years ago, our pipeline has grown from 30 clinical stage programs to over 50 today, and resulted in a considerably more diverse set of assets that can be transformative, not only for patients but for Gilead. The Gilead and Kite teams have worked tirelessly to deliver on our pipeline programs during this time of dramatic growth despite the pandemic. It's a thrilling time to be part of the team, with tireless dedication and commitment to helping patients. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy to walk us through the financial results of the quarter."
29002,1674151580,2355784,"Gilead Sciences, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year-over-year, given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Exclu",868,"Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 21, our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall, with total product sales up 21% year-over-year, given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 5% year-over-year, with strong Biktarvy growth more than offsetting lower Truvada and Atripla revenues. In addition to impressive growth in cell therapy and, of course, the new revenue contribution associated with Trodelvy, which was not part of our portfolio in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving down the P&L, non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.4% in the second quarter, 210 basis points higher year-over-year and primarily associated with a lower royalty expense. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year, with lower remdesivir-related investments as compared to the same period last year, partly offset by higher investments across our pipeline, notably Trodelvy and magrolimab. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower legal expenses, offset in part by continued commercial investment in Trodelvy and Veklury outside the United States. 
Moving to tax, we realized a lower effective tax rate of 19.6% for the quarter or down 320 basis points year-over-year due to a shift in geographic earnings mix. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.87 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement primarily reflects higher product sales due to Veklury, higher gross margin as well as lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate, offset by lower interest income. Overall, we're encouraged by our first half results shown on Slide 22. 
Moving to Slide 23, you can see that we are updating our guidance for 2021. As always, the duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be uncertain and the rate and degree of these pandemic impacts as well as the corresponding recovery from the pandemic may vary across our business. With that said, we now expect full year total product sales in the range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. The new range increases the midpoint from $24.4 billion to $24.7 billion, and reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as our updated expectations for the second half of the year. 
With first half Veklury revenue of $2.3 billion, we now expect full year Veklury revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion compared to our previous $2 billion to $3 billion range. Our updated range reflects the ongoing role of Veklury in this pandemic and assumes we'll continue to see regional outbreaks. The situation continues to be dynamic, and we'll likely update our thinking again when we report our earnings after the third quarter. 
Back to our guidance, we now expect total product sales excluding Veklury for the year to be in the range of USD 21.7 billion to $21.9 billion compared to our previous range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. This tightening of the range reflects the longer-than-expected pandemic impact on our business, including the latest increase in COVID-19 cases. As Johanna discussed, the pandemic has most notably impacted our HIV treatment business, where we saw substantially fewer treatment initiations and a greater number of discontinuations than expected in 2020. It's taking longer than we expected for treated patient volumes to ramp back up to more normal levels, particularly in the United States. 
That said, we saw encouraging signs of recovery in the HIV market in the second quarter, and our guidance assumes recovery will continue through the remainder of the year. Based on market share dynamics, we remain very confident in our competitive positioning, and we believe we're well positioned as the recovery continues. 
Looking at the rest of our P&L. We now expect non-GAAP product gross margin in the range of 86% to 87%, reflecting the lower mix of HIV revenue. We now expect non-GAAP R&D to decline low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels. This primarily reflects the timing of investments, and we remind you that the expenses in both R&D and SG&A are back-end loaded this year, increasing sequentially from Q2 into Q3 and then even more from Q3 into Q4. Our non-GAAP SG&A guidance remains unchanged at flat to low single-digit percentage decline over 2020. 
In R&D, we'll be ramping up additional studies with magrolimab, Trodelvy, long-acting combination work with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. And in SG&A, we will be ramping up marketing activities to support our growing portfolio of indications such as with Trodelvy and Tecartus. 
Finally, reflecting the updates to our revenue, gross margin and operating expense guidance, we now project non-GAAP diluted EPS between $6.90 per share and $7.25 per share for the year, and GAAP diluted EPS between $4.70 and $5.05. Additionally, our capital allocation priorities have not changed, and we remain committed to our dividend. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1 billion -- $1.25 billion in debt, and we're on track to repay at least $4 billion in debt by the end of the year.

I think from a market dynamic standpoint, what we're seeing is we saw a little bit last year in Q2, most of the industry was actually slowing down pretty quickly in Q2. HIV took a little bit longer, and it's kind of that playing out in '21. It's taking a little bit longer to come back and bounce back. 
One of the major reasons for that has to do with your dynamic market being much smaller in this market. You have a very large pool of patients that are just continuing patients. And you're really playing in the dynamic market with your naive patients coming in and your switches and your restarts, really around 5% or so. And so that's why it's taking a little bit longer as we're going through this. 
From a different standpoint between U.S. and Europe, I think it has more to do with the fact that in Europe, there's diversity across some of the different countries as to the pandemics and the timing of kind of the recoveries or even some of the surges that happened. So it's a little bit more blended than what we've seen in the U.S. thus far. And so I think that's just what's playing out here. Obviously, the bigger impact being in the U.S. because that's where most of our business lies in HIV. 
And just to close out on that, the -- that's from a market standpoint, and it's very different than kind of the fundamentals of our HIV business. I think what we've seen with Biktarvy, we're really quite pleased with in light of the fact that not only it's grown quarter-over-quarter by 1 point, both in the U.S. as well as in the EU5. But also, if you think about it over the last 12 months, it's grown 6 point share over a very strong base. We're just under 40%, we're at 39% share at this point in time. So we're very pleased with the continued growth of Biktarvy, and you can appreciate that because it's such a larger base, that's going to get more challenging as we move forward. 
And that's why I think we're excited about the market coming back a little bit. We've seen it come back in Q2. Where the market goes, obviously, our HIV business goes because we own 75% of the market. And so therefore, we're watching that very closely, but we would expect that recovery to continue, although at a slower pace than we had originally expected."

We talked a little bit in -- earlier about the adherence piece of the puzzle, because you have less patient support groups around, you have less surround sound around those HIV patients. 
You have a lot of those case managers and physicians that have moved over to treat COVID-19 and so for impacting HIV, a little bit disproportionately. And so we're also looking at those drop-offs. And we've seen those drop-offs come back to normal to pre-COVID levels just most recently. And so that's another positive sign to that recovery of the market."

And so that's been a big piece of the puzzle. 
If you're asking me to split the sales per line of therapy, that's very challenging in light of the claims data that we have. But what I would say if it's more about bladder cancer versus triple-negative breast cancer, I would say most of that is triple-negative breast cancer, probably about a 90-10 ratio as our bladder cancer is much smaller.

It could be early next year, but it's most likely at the end of this year, we'll have enough patient data to trigger the opt-in or our desire to opt in potentially early. On the other 2 programs, the adenosine programs at Arcus, that's most likely next year. And again, there may be additional data that comes this year that if it looks really strong. We want to move as quickly as we can, and we can opt in early, Geoff, on those programs.

And in particular, since we expanded the sample size to make sure that we are able to hit the PFS endpoint. Of course, the relevant issue is more the duration of PFS that we get. But from a powering standpoint, we're comfortable. And it's just a matter of seeing those data. From an ongoing event standpoint, I think we are where we thought we would be at this point, and it's really around just letting the events come in, make sure they get adjudicated, we clean the data in time to do the analysis properly. So that's where we are with that. 
And then in terms of the lung data on efficacy, yes, I mean, I think -- as I think we've said before, we're really proceeding somewhat at risk and pretty aggressively, partly based on our belief in the drug, partly because of what we've seen with other agents in lung and partly based on our early data that you're familiar with in lung that we've seen. Of course, we want to make those data more robust while we go into the Phase III world. So we are going to augment our existing data to make sure that we are mitigating our risk somewhat. 
But thus far, I think what we are hoping for is efficacy that certainly is comparable to what the benchmark might be, even though I think it's too early to say what that benchmark is with the direct competitor. But we are, again, I think, confident about our ability to bring safety profile that hopefully, will be better for patients."

Unfortunately, it was not intended to be a source of funding for organizations to deliver services, and that's what we're trying to reset a little bit. So the changes to our program model will protect our ability to be able to do this in the longer term and make it a sustainable program for us and more importantly, for patients. So that's the patient assistance program on that front. 
The question you're asking me about PrEP, we're actually quite encouraged with the FAQs that came out from the U.S. PSTF. The -- and here's why. In the FAQ, they provide a lot more clarity than they had in the past, right? This isn't new. The recommendation actually came out, the Affordable Care Act recommendation came out 2 years ago. But what this provided was actually more details to it and clarity on the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic and minimizing the barriers of use. 
And there's a couple of things in the FAQ that pop out for me. One is it truly supports physician and patient choice. And that's the piece where generics or nongenerics, right? So Truvada generics or Descovy would then need to be really -- the physicians and the patients get to decide together what is the right medicine for which patient. And of course, with the bone and renal safety benefits that Descovy brings, I think this is a great addition to the FAQs. 
In addition to that, there's also some guidance around timely management of the request for this by payers, so to turn it around within 24 hours, which is quite different. than what's happening today. And then the last piece is $0 of out-of-pocket costs. So I think for patients, this is great news. And I also think for patient choice and physician choice, this is quite promising as well."

Thanks for taking the time to join us here today. 
We're pleased to provide you with an update on our second quarter where we delivered solid financial performance and significant progress on our increasingly diverse pipeline. 2021 is an important year for our pipeline, and we're very encouraged by the milestones we've achieved for therapies that are potentially transformative for Gilead and for patients. All of this reinforces our confidence in our strategic direction. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank our global community of Gilead and Kite employees who consistently go above and beyond to drive progress with resilience and dedication. Different parts of the world are riding the ebb and flow of COVID-19 cases at various times. And while the vaccines give us hope and optimism, we are still very much living with the pandemic. Remdesivir continues to play an important role in fighting the virus and has now been used to treat an estimated 7 million hospitalized patients worldwide. 
Turning to the main highlights of the quarter on Slide 4. The second quarter was a solid quarter overall. Veklury sales of $829 million were once again higher than anticipated, offsetting the lingering impact of the pandemic, particularly on HIV treatment. 
In light of this pandemic impact, Biktarvy's performance is quite encouraging. Revenue for the quarter was USD 2 billion, up 24% or $390 million from the same quarter last year. This more than offset the $322 million headwind associated with the impact of the Truvada and Atripla LOEs. Much of that headwind is now, of course, behind us. 
Overall, our share of the HIV treatment market held steady quarter-over-quarter, and our PrEP share remained steady even with generic entries. These dynamics give us confidence that the underlying demand for our HIV products remains strong and positions us well for growth as the overall HIV market recovery gains momentum. 
Moving to our clinical pipeline. 2021 is a catalyst-heavy year for Gilead, and we've delivered all of our key first half pipeline commitments. Among other milestones, we shared top line data from the highly anticipated ZUMA-7 trial where Yescarta improved event-free survival for second-line large B-cell lymphoma, or LBCL, patients by 60% compared to the standard of care. This is truly a landmark trial, the first and largest reported Phase III trial readout that demonstrates the efficacy and safety of cell therapy, and we are excited by the opportunity to bring the potential benefits of cell therapy to patients in earlier lines. 
We shared positive Phase III data from MYR301, which will help support our anticipated BLA filing for Hepcludex for HDV in the U.S. later this year, and we submitted our NDA for use of lenacapavir in the heavily treatment-experienced population with multidrug resistance. This filing was based on data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study presented earlier this month. We also shared strong lenacapavir data from the Phase II CALIBRATE study in HIV treatment, which will be used to inform our broader lenacapavir efforts. Our partner, Arcus, provided an interim update from ARC-7 that supports the continuation of both ARC-7 and ARC-10 trials for their anti-TIGIT candidate, domvanalimab. 
Lastly, on Slide 4. We're beginning to see the positive impact of our strategy, which we introduced early last year. The business is diversifying across indications and therapies. In particular, we are seeing cell therapy and Trodelvy contribute to growth and expect they will be key growth drivers for Gilead. While we build out the oncology business, we remain focused and committed on ensuring the long-term competitive positioning of our virology portfolio. 
Next, on Slide 5. We highlighted our pipeline execution so far this year. And I'd like to thank all those who helped us to deliver on this ambitious agenda, including our employees, the people who participated in the studies, our partners and the study investigators. 
As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our target milestones include a progression-free survival, or PFS, readout in our event-driven Phase III TROPiCS-02 study evaluating Trodelvy in hormone receptor HER2-positive -- negative metastatic breast cancer. A Phase Ib readout for magrolimab in myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. Depending on the data, timing and results, this could result in a BLA submission for accelerated approval. And initiation of the potential Phase III lenacapavir and islatravir long-acting oral combination. As you know, this is in collaboration with Merck and the development and formulation work remains on track. We look forward to updating you next quarter about the additional milestone progress. 
We understand that continued strong and consistent pipeline execution is critical to extending the virology business and expanding further into oncology. We believe our current and pipeline therapies can address significant unmet medical needs. 
We are very encouraged by the progress Gilead and Kite are making. We are well on our way in our journey to expand and diversify into new therapeutic areas, and we are already seeing the evolution of both our pipeline and commercial portfolio. 
With that, I'll hand over to Johanna who will share an update on our commercial performance for the second quarter."

Starting on Slide 7. Total product sales of $6.2 billion were up 21% year-over-year primarily reflecting Veklury, which was not a contributor to revenue in the second quarter of 2020. 
On Slide 8. Veklury second quarter revenues of $829 million declined sequentially, reflecting the impact of higher vaccination rates and lower infection and hospitalization in many regions. While hospitalizations trended lower in the second quarter, Veklury remained the therapy of choice in 3 out of 5 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We estimate that since the launch in May 2020, roughly 7 million patients globally have been treated with remdesivir. It's truly remarkable and encouraging to see how remdesivir continues to play such a key role in fighting this global pandemic. 
Excluding Veklury, total product sales of $5.3 billion were up 5% year-over-year. We saw growth in cell therapy and HCV in addition to new revenue contributions from Trodelvy and more modestly, Hepcludex for HDV. Additionally, other product revenues of $291 million grew 20% year-over-year driven by increased demand for AmBisome outside of the U.S. to treat mucormycosis, which has seen a rising incidence in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Sequentially, we saw 9% growth for total product sales, excluding Veklury, primarily driven by growth in Biktarvy. 
Moving to Slide 9. HIV product sales were $3.9 billion, up 8% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total HIV revenue reflected strong Biktarvy growth that more than offset the $322 million lower revenue from Truvada and Atripla following their loss of exclusivity. Compared to last quarter, HIV grew $288 million, reflecting customary seasonal inventory dynamics and growing demand for treatment. 
Biktarvy revenue of $2 billion was up 24% year-over-year and 9% sequentially with quarter-over-quarter growth primarily driven by increased demand. Biktarvy remains the #1 prescribed therapy in the U.S. across naive, switch and continuing patients and remains #1 in naive across all EU5 countries. Approximately 70% of switches from both Gilead and non-Gilead regimens result in incremental revenue. Overall, and despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic, Biktarvy continues to gain market share with 1% share growth versus last quarter in both the U.S. as well as the EU5. 
Descovy revenues of $435 million grew 21% sequentially due to a modest improvement in the demand for PrEP and more favorable inventory and pricing dynamics that we typically see in the second quarter relative to the first. As we highlighted in prior quarters, we've been working with payers to ensure patients continue to have access to Descovy in light of entry of generic alternatives for Truvada. 
We're really pleased to see the strong sequential growth in Descovy, and we continue to maintain mid-40% share despite generic impacts. Year-over-year, Descovy grew 4% largely due to higher demand for PrEP. And overall, PrEP demand is showing signs of recovery and is expected to continue to improve as pandemic restrictions phase out. 
Earlier this month, federal FAQs for the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force were released. It provided greater clarity as to the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic, and we're really encouraged by this recent development. We hope it will help to minimize the barriers of PrEP use going forward. 
Before I transition to other products, I just want to take a moment to share some perspective on the HIV treatment market given the longer-than-expected pandemic impact. 
In regions outside of the U.S., such as Europe, we're beginning to see signs of recovery in the dynamic market with second quarter trends generally in line with our expectations. In the U.S., however, the pace of the pandemic recovery was slower than we expected in this last quarter. And while we're seeing signs of recovery in PrEP and some sequential growth in the treatment market, it's clear that it will take several quarters for treatment to return to prepandemic levels. 
In treatment, there are really 2 pandemic-related headwinds that we observed. First, lower HIV screening and diagnosis resulting in lower treatment initiation; and second, due to the limited support services available during the pandemic, we've seen a higher number of patients discontinue their HIV treatments. 
Taken together, these 2 factors have reduced the number of active patients on HIV therapy entering 2021, thereby reducing the overall volume of new and refill prescriptions we would expect to see in 2021. We did, however, see growth resume from this lower base in the second quarter. After prior quarter-over-quarter declines, second quarter U.S. HIV treatment prescriptions grew 2%, and we expect the market to grow at historical rates once screening and diagnosis rates return to prepandemic levels. 
To continue our efforts to advance progress against the HIV epidemic, we are partnering with health care professionals, advocacy groups and policymakers to raise awareness of the unique challenges COVID-19 poses to HIV screening, diagnosis and adherence. Our goal is to help health care providers ensure that patients continue to be diagnosed and treated. 
Given the strength of the demand fundamentals for Biktarvy, Descovy for PrEP and other Gilead HIV products, we remain confident in our competitive positioning now that many communities are easing social distancing requirements. In the meantime, we continue to see strength in underlying treatment demand with no material changes in the competitive landscape with our total Gilead treatment market share holding steady at 75% in the U.S. and just under 50% in Europe despite competition and the entry of new generics. 
Next, on Slide 10. HCV product sales in the second quarter were $549 million, up 23% compared to last year, but patient starts remain well below prepandemic levels. The growth reflects a modest sequential recovery in HCV patient starts in the U.S. in Q2 '21 in addition to an artificially low Q2 of '20 that was impacted by unfavorable government rebate adjustments. We'll be watching for further signs of recovery in the third quarter. Both U.S. and EU Gilead market shares remain steady at around 60% and 50%, respectively. 
Moving to Slide 11. HBV and HDV product sales were $237 million, up 8% year-over-year with improving patient starts on Vemlidy, particularly in ex U.S. markets. In its first full quarter as part of Gilead, Hepcludex contributed $7 million and is currently available in France, Germany and Austria. We're excited to be working with the various reimbursement authorities to increase patient access and expect to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022.  
Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 12. Product sales in the second quarter were $89 million, up 24% quarter-over-quarter driven by demand for the 2 new indications approved in April, namely second-line plus metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer. 
We continue to be encouraged by the positive feedback from physicians on the Phase III ASCENT data, which demonstrated a 1-year median overall survival benefit for second-line metastatic TNBC patients treated with Trodelvy. To build on this growing interest, we're increasing community awareness, especially of the expanded indication to second line in TNBC, and we expect to see growing demand as breast cancer screening ramps back up to prepandemic levels. IQVIA data suggests that breast cancer screening volumes were about 20% lower in the U.S. in 2020 compared to 2019. This suggests as many as 41,500 breast cancer patients have not been diagnosed during the pandemic. 
On behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I'm pleased to share our cell therapy commercial update on Slide 13. Total cell therapy product sales totaled $219 million in the second quarter, representing 39% growth year-over-year driven by both Yescarta and Tecartus. Yescarta growth was driven by strong demand in Europe as well as successful follicular lymphoma launch in the U.S. 
Increased competition, particularly in third-line LBCL, continues to raise the profile of cell therapy and is positive to Kite overall. We remain confident in Yescarta's competitive profile and positioning and are particularly proud of Kite's industry-leading manufacturing turnaround time and reliability. Our results also reflected strong momentum from the Tecartus mantle cell lymphoma launch, highlighting the unmet medical need for MCL patients. 
We continue to add new indications and geographies for our cell therapy products. For example, the Fosun-Kite joint venture recently received approval in China for Yescarta as the first cell therapy to treat third-line LBCL. And we're excited to see the top line data for ZUMA-7, getting us a step closer to second-line LBCL cell therapy. Even as we prepare for discussions with regulatory agencies later this year, commercial and manufacturing preparations are ramping up to ensure sufficient capacity and support for second-line LBCL demand in both the U.S. and in Europe. 
Christi is here with the team to take your questions on cell therapy later in the call. But for now, I'll hand it over to Merdad to walk us through the pipeline updates."

As Dan mentioned, it's been a gratifying year so far, delivering on all our key pipeline commitments, supporting Gilead's ambitions to extend our leadership in HIV and creating a broader portfolio spanning virology and oncology, building our portfolio in inflammation. 
I'll spend our time today on the highlights of the quarter and point you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more complete view of our pipeline activities. 
First, in HIV, as you can see on Slide 15, programs for our investigational lenacapavir agent continue to progress. At the recent International AIDS Society Meeting, we shared data from the Phase II/III CAPELLA study that evaluated heavily treatment-experienced individuals who've already developed resistance to multiple antiretroviral drugs. 
CAPELLA demonstrated lenacapavir's potency in this difficult-to-treat population. Despite significant prior resistance, antiviral activity was observed starting at day 15. By week 26, 81% of individuals had viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. Based on these data, we filed a new drug application. If approved, this would become the first 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection regimen available and deliver a welcome new option for people living with HIV who have developed multidrug resistance to other antiretrovirals. 
Also at IAS, we presented strong interim results from the Phase II CALIBRATE study, evaluating lenacapavir in a treatment-naive population. In CALIBRATE, participants receive lenacapavir either as a subcutaneous injection or as a daily oral pill in combination with Descovy. At week 28, 94% of subjects achieved HIV-1 RNA loads of less than 50 copies per ml. These findings will be used to help inform our broader efforts establishing lenacapavir as a foundational agent for our long-acting franchise. 
Late last month, we screened the first patient for the Phase III PURPOSE-II trial, studying lenacapavir for HIV prevention in cisgender men, transgender women, transgender men and gender nonbinary people who have sex with men and are at risk of HIV infection. We expect to initiate the Phase III PURPOSE-I study of lenacapavir for HIV prevention in adolescent girls and young women later this year. Finally, we're actively working on a co-formulation for the long-acting investigational oral and injectable combination of lenacapavir and islatravir and expect to initiate the oral Phase II trial by the end of the year. 
Moving on to HDV on Slide 16. Last month at the International Liver Congress, we presented data from the MYR301 and MYR204 programs. MYR301 is a Phase III registrational study evaluating bulevirtide as monotherapy for the treatment of HDV. Interim results demonstrated that bulevirtide was well tolerated in both cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients with compensated chronic HDV infections. 
At week 24, bulevirtide treatment was associated with significantly greater HDV RNA declines and improvements in biochemical measures of disease activity compared to no treatment. Moreover, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events leading to discontinuation. These results continue to support the effectiveness of the 2-milligram dose, which has received conditional approval from the EMA and will form the basis of the BLA filing planned for later this year in the U.S. 
As part of our HDV cure efforts, we also presented interim data from the MYR204 Phase IIb study, investigating finite regimens of bulevirtide both as monotherapy and in combination with PEG-interferon alpha. Both monotherapy and combination treatments of bulevirtide were found to be generally well tolerated and more effective than PEG-interferon alone through 24 weeks of therapy. The primary end point analysis occurs at 24 weeks after completion of therapy and includes virologic and biochemical response data. We look forward to sharing those data when available. 
Moving to Slide 17. On -- and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, as you know, we shared earlier the strong positive top line data from ZUMA-7, the landmark 359-patient Phase III study evaluating Yescarta in second-line LBCL. The study met the primary end point for event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398, representing a 60% improvement in event-free survival compared to standard of care stem cell transplant. Yescarta had a safety profile comparable to or better than what we have seen in the third-line setting. 
This is a clinically and statistically meaningful improvement in outcomes that, if approved in the U.S., could extend Yescarta's reach to a total unique population of 14,000 patients annually in the second and third-line LBCL setting. ZUMA-7 also met the key secondary end point of objective response rate. As expected, data for overall survival is immature at this time, but the interim analysis suggests a favorable trend in this critical milestone. 
In summary, we're very excited about the potential benefit to patients demonstrated in ZUMA-7 and look forward to beginning discussions with regulatory agencies later this year as we work towards potential sBLA and MAA filings for Yescarta in second-line LBCL. And separately, we're on track for the Phase II readout for our first-line LBCL study before the end of the year. 
Beyond LBCL, we've completed filing Yescarta with the EMA for patients with follicular lymphoma after 3 or more lines of systemic therapy. We also have a PDUFA date of October 1 under accelerated review with the FDA for Tecartus in ALL. 
And of course, while our internal focus remains on autologous cell therapies, we continue our engagement in alternative approaches, most recently partnering with Shoreline Biosciences to develop novel, off-the-shelf, allogeneic cell therapies based on natural killer targets for hematologic cancers. 
Slide 18 is a recap of our pipeline execution so far this year.  In addition to the items we have discussed already, our partner, Arcus, provided an early interim update of their Phase II ARC-7 trial in late June, demonstrating clinical activity in the anti-TIGIT domvanalimab-based doublet and triplet combinations. Zimberelimab, our anti-PD-1 antibody, saw similar levels of activity in the monotherapy arm compared to marketed anti-PD-1s. 
Based on the interim analysis, we're pleased that ARC-7 and the confirmatory Phase III ARC-10 trial will continue to enroll as planned. We look forward to seeing how the data mature with additional patients and duration of follow-up to inform our opt-in decision. 
Separately, our partner, Galapagos, also shared data readouts from their Toledo SIK2/3 programs across psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis and the plaque psoriasis data from their TYK2 program. Both studies were early and had small samples, and we look forward to additional data. 
We also remain focused on the following upcoming milestones. For Trodelvy, we continue to target a TROPiCS-02 PFS readout this year. The study is an event-driven Phase III trial in patients with hormone receptor positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pending data, we will evaluate and then determine the appropriate regulatory next steps. We estimate there are roughly 17,000 patients in the U.S. who could benefit from Trodelvy in this setting. 
We continue to expect the Phase III non-small cell lung cancer for Trodelvy to initiate in the second half of this year. We plan to share an update from the TROPiCS-03 basket study on lung cancer later this year and will separately provide updates on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer as those data mature. 
We anticipate a Phase Ib readout from magrolimab in MDS later this year, and pending data, will engage with regulators as we explore potential BLA filing for accelerated approval. If approved, magrolimab would be the first-in-class macrophage checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47 and Gilead's first frontline oncology indication. There's a significant unmet need for MDS with no new treatments approved in 14 years despite 15,000 new patients being diagnosed each year in the U.S. alone. We continue our development efforts in AML and have enrolled our first patient in the Phase III frontline AML magrolimab study. 
Before I wrap up the pipeline discussion, I wanted to share an update on remdesivir. We've decided not to move forward with an inhaled formulation of remdesivir based on the results of our initial proof-of-concept study, suggesting suboptimal lung deposition. To address patient needs in the evolving pandemic, we are continuing our efforts on advancing multiple novel antivirals. We expect to submit IND filings later this year or early next year for these agents. We remain committed to supporting patients through this pandemic and continuing our legacy of developing antiviral therapeutics for the treatment of emerging diseases. 
Finally, on Slide 19, I want to recognize the teams at Gilead and Kite. Compared to just 2 years ago, our pipeline has grown from 30 clinical-stage programs to over 50 today and resulted in a considerably more diverse set of assets that can be transformative not only for patients, but for Gilead. The Gilead and Kite teams have worked tirelessly to deliver on our pipeline programs during this time of dramatic growth despite the pandemic. It's a thrilling time to be part of the team with tireless dedication and commitment to helping patients. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters ahead. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Andy to walk us through the financial results of the quarter."

Moving to Slide 21. Our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall with total product sales up 21% year-over-year given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Exclu",868,"Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Moving to Slide 21. Our financial results in the second quarter were solid overall with total product sales up 21% year-over-year given the important role Veklury continues to play in this pandemic. Excluding Veklury, total product sales grew 5% year-over-year with strong Biktarvy growth more than offsetting lower Truvada and Atripla revenues. In addition to impressive growth in cell therapy and, of course, the new revenue contribution associated with Trodelvy, which was not part of our portfolio in the second quarter of last year. 
Moving down the P&L, non-GAAP product gross margin was 86.4% in the second quarter, 210 basis points higher year-over-year and primarily associated with a lower royalty expense. 
Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year with lower remdesivir-related investments as compared to the same period last year, partly offset by higher investments across our pipeline, notably Trodelvy and magrolimab. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year primarily due to lower legal expenses, offset in part by continued commercial investment in Trodelvy and Veklury outside the United States. Moving to tax, we realized a lower effective tax rate of 19.6% for the quarter or down 320 basis points year-over-year due to a shift in geographic earnings mix. 
Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.87 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year improvement primarily reflects higher product sales due to Veklury, higher gross margin as well as lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate, offset by lower interest income. 
Overall, we're encouraged by our first half results shown on Slide 22. 
Moving to Slide 23. You can see that we are updating our guidance for 2021. As always, the duration and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be uncertain, and the rate and degree of these pandemic impacts as well as the corresponding recovery from the pandemic may vary across our business. 
With that said, we now expect full year total product sales in the range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion compared to our previous range of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion. The new range increases the midpoint from $24.4 billion to $24.7 billion and reflects our solid results year-to-date as well as our updated expectations for the second half of the year. 
With first half Veklury revenue of $2.3 billion, we now expect full year Veklury revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion compared to our previous $2 billion to $3 billion range. Our updated range reflects the ongoing role of Veklury in this pandemic and assumes we'll continue to see regional outbreaks. The situation continues to be dynamic, and we'll likely update our thinking again when we report our earnings after the third quarter. 
Back to our guidance. We now expect total product sales, excluding Veklury, for the year to be in the range of USD 21.7 billion to $21.9 billion compared to our previous range of $21.7 billion to $22.1 billion. This tightening of the range reflects the longer-than-expected pandemic impact on our business, including the latest increase in COVID-19 cases. 
As Johanna discussed, the pandemic has most notably impacted our HIV treatment business where we saw substantially fewer treatment initiations and a greater number of discontinuations than expected in 2020. It's taking longer than we expected for treated patient volumes to ramp back up to more normal levels, particularly in the United States. That said, we saw encouraging signs of recovery in the HIV market in the second quarter, and our guidance assumes recovery will continue through the remainder of the year. 
Based on market share dynamics, we remain very confident in our competitive positioning, and we believe we're well positioned as the recovery continues. 
Looking at the rest of our P&L. We now expect non-GAAP product gross margin in the range of 86% to 87%, reflecting the lower mix of HIV revenue. We now expect non-GAAP R&D to decline low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels. This primarily reflects the timing of investments. And we remind you that the expenses in both R&D and SG&A are back-end loaded this year, increasing sequentially from Q2 into Q3 and then even more from Q3 into Q4. Our non-GAAP SG&A guidance remains unchanged at flat to low single-digit percentage decline over 2020. 
In R&D, we'll be ramping up additional studies with magrolimab, Trodelvy, long-acting combination work with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV and other pipeline activities. And in SG&A, we will be ramping up marketing activities to support our growing portfolio of indications such as with Trodelvy and Tecartus. 
Finally, reflecting the updates to our revenue, gross margin and operating expense guidance, we now project non-GAAP diluted EPS between $6.90 per share and $7.25 per share for the year and GAAP diluted EPS between $4.70 and $5.05. 
Additionally, our capital allocation priorities have not changed, and we remain committed to our dividend. Year-to-date, we've paid down $1 billion -- $1.25 billion in debt, and we're on track to repay at least $4 billion in debt by the end of the year. 
With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the question-and-answer session."

I think from a market dynamic standpoint, what we're seeing is, we saw a little bit last year in Q2, most of the industry was actually slowing down pretty quickly. In Q2, HIV took a little bit longer. And it's kind of that playing out. In '21, it's taking a little bit longer to come back and bounce back. 
One of the major reasons for that has to do with your dynamic market being much smaller in this market. You have a very large pool of patients that are just continuing patients. And you're really playing in the dynamic market with your naive patients coming in and your switches and your restarts, really around 5% or so. And so that's why it's taking a little bit longer as we're going through this. 
From a different standpoint between U.S. and Europe, I think it has more to do with the fact that in Europe, there's diversity across some of the different countries as to the pandemics and the timing of kind of the recoveries or even some of the surges that happened. So it's a little bit more blended than what we've seen in the U.S. thus far. And so I think that's just what's playing out here. Obviously, the bigger impact being in the U.S. because that's where most of our business lies in HIV. 
And just to close out on that, the -- that's from a market standpoint, and it's very different than kind of the fundamentals of our HIV business. I think what we've seen with Biktarvy, we're really quite pleased with it in light of the fact that not only it's grown quarter-over-quarter by 1 point both in the U.S. as well as in the EU5. But also, if you think about it over the last 12 months, it's grown 6 point share over a very strong base. We're just under 40%, we're at 39% share at this point in time. 
So we're very pleased with the continued growth of Biktarvy, and you can appreciate that because it's such a larger base, that's going to get more challenging as we move forward. And that's why I think we're excited about the market coming back a little bit. We've seen it come back in Q2. Where the market goes, obviously, our HIV business goes because we own 75% of the market. 
And so therefore, we're watching that very closely, but we would expect that recovery to continue, although at a slower pace than we had originally expected."

And also the drop-off rates. We talked a little bit in -- earlier about the adherence piece of the puzzle because you have less patient support groups around, you have less [ surround sound ] around those HIV patients. You have a lot of those case managers and physicians that have moved over to treat COVID-19 and so for impacting HIV a little bit disproportionately. 
And so we're also looking at those drop-offs. And we've seen those drop-offs come back to normal to pre-COVID levels just most recently. And so that's another positive sign to that recovery of the market."

If you're asking me to split the sales per line of therapy, that's very challenging in light of the claims data that we have. But what I would say if it's more about bladder cancer versus triple-negative breast cancer, I would say most of that is triple-negative breast cancer, probably about a 90-10 ratio as our bladder cancer is much smaller.

It could be early next year, but it's most likely at the end of this year, we'll have enough patient data to trigger the opt-in or our desire to opt in potentially early. 
On the other 2 programs, the adenosine programs at Arcus, that's most likely next year. And again, there may be additional data that comes this year that if it looks really strong, we want to move as quickly as we can, and we can opt in early, Geoff, on those programs.

So to your point, Geoff, I think we're all learning about this pandemic as it rolls out. And it's certainly going through different phases and we think will continue to go through different phases.

So I wouldn't -- the inhaled, nebulized approach didn't give us the results we were hoping for, the consistency we were looking for. But because we have other agents in our pipeline based on our virology expertise, we will be bringing those forward and really focusing on the outpatient setting there.

But from a powering standpoint, we're comfortable. And it's just a matter of seeing those data. 
From an ongoing event standpoint, I think we are where we thought we would be at this point, and it's really around just letting the events come in, make sure they get adjudicated, we clean the data in time to do the analysis properly. So that's where we are with that. 
And then in terms of the lung data on efficacy, yes, I mean I think -- as I think we've said before, we're really proceeding somewhat at risk and pretty aggressively partly based on our belief in the drug, partly because of what we've seen with other agents in lung, our -- and partly based on our early data that you're familiar with in lung that we've seen. Of course, we want to make those data more robust while we go into the Phase III world. So we are going to augment our existing data to make sure that we are mitigating our risk somewhat. 
But thus far, I think what we are hoping for is efficacy that certainly is comparable to what the benchmark might be, even though I think it's too early to say what that benchmark is with the direct competitor.

That's actually a program that's really in line with our commitment to help end the HIV epidemic. To date, the program has actually provided free drug to more than 250,000 individuals. And really, that's what it is. It's a free program that was always intended and will continue to provide free Gilead medication to eligible individuals to treat and prevent HIV. 
Unfortunately, it was not intended to be a source of funding for organizations to deliver services, and that's what we're trying to reset a little bit. So the changes to our program model will protect our ability to be able to do this in the longer term and make it a sustainable program for us and more importantly, for patients. So that's the patient assistance program on that front. 
The question you're asking me about PrEP, we're actually quite encouraged with the FAQ that came out from the U.S. PSTF. The -- and here's why. In the FAQ, they provide a lot more clarity than they had in the past, right? This isn't new. The recommendation actually came out -- the Affordable Care Act recommendation came out 2 years ago. But what this provided was actually more details to it and clarity on the importance of PrEP in ending the epidemic and minimizing the barriers of use. 
And there's a couple of things in the FAQ that pop out for me. One is it truly supports physician and patient choice. And that's the piece where generics or nongenerics, right? So Truvada generics or Descovy would then need to be really -- the physicians and the patients get to decide together what is the right medicine for which patient. And of course, with the bone and renal safety benefits that Descovy brings, I think this is a great addition to the FAQs. 
In addition to that, there's also some guidance around timely management of the request for this by payers. So to turn it around within 24 hours, which is quite different than what's happening today. And then the last piece is $0 of out-of-pocket costs. So I think for patients, this is great news. And I also think for patient choice and physician choice, this is quite promising as well."

for oral programs to develop a novel, best-in-class therapy. 
Turning to HIV performance, we saw positive gains in the treatment market for the second quarter in a row, and reported record revenue for Biktarvy. While treatment prescription volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels, we maintained total U.S. and EU treatment market share, and we grew Biktarvy shares sequentially in both geographies. The prep market continues to recover and our prep market share is holding steady despite generic entry. Overall, our third quarter results give us confidence that the HIV market is recovering from the pandemic and our market share clearly highlights Gilead's strong market position. 
As a result of the strong quarter, we have increased our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. Biktarvy now looks set to deliver close to twice the revenue we expected at the start of the year. While our base business has clearly been affected by COVID, it has also shown resilience. At the guidance midpoint, we are now expecting full year total revenue to be $1.75 billion higher than we expected at the start of the year. 
Our confidence in the longevity of our HIV business is in part based on our progress in developing the next generation of HIV therapy in prevention.  Lenacapavir is the cornerstone of that work, and we have 4 clinical trials evaluating lenacapavir across treatment and prevention, highlighting our efforts to extend the options available to people living with or at risk of HIV. This quarter, lenacapavir was granted FDA priority review for the heavily treatment-experienced population. As a reminder, lenacapavir has breakthrough therapy designation and if approved, would be the first long-acting treatment for people living with HIV who have multidrug resistance as well as the first available 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV. 
Separately, as you know, we signed an agreement with Merck earlier this year to explore combinations of lenacapavir and islatravir in long-acting treatment. Earlier this week, we announced the start of a Phase II study with Merck, evaluating lenacapavir and islatravir long-acting oral combination treatment. Our approach to long-acting is very much shaped by people living with HIV. We've heard that they would welcome weekly oral or infrequent subcutaneous injections that could coincide with routine office visits or even be taken at home. The advantages of these options include greater convenience, the potential for stronger adherence and privacy. Lenacapavir has shown promising potential in both oral and subcutaneous injections and we'll continue to advance both options while updating you on our progress throughout. 
While extending our leadership IV, we are also executing on the significant potential in our broad and diverse oncology portfolio. This is potential that could bring transformational benefits for people with cancer and value for our stakeholders. 
Third quarter highlights include the initiation of 2 solid tumor trials for magrolimab, head and neck cancer and a multi-tumor basket study. We plan to initiate an additional Phase III study in first-line unfit acute myeloid leukemia or AML in early 2022. 
The FDA approval of Tecartus for adult relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is our fourth approved indication in cell therapy. Additionally, the Kite team has filed an sBLA for Yescarta in second-line LBCL which, if approved, would be the first CAR T therapy in an earlier line setting. And a positive CHMP opinion for Trodelvy in second line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer earlier this month. We expect an approval decision from the European Commission later this year, and this could potentially be our sixth approval for Trodelvy in triple-negative breast cancer in 2021. 
Additionally, we've just announced a new clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the combination of Gilead's Trop-2 antibody drug conjugate Trodelvy with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA for the treatment of first-line metastatic triple active breast cancer. When we acquired Immunomedics last year, we said that we would explore the use of Trodelvy across a wide range of tumor types, and then we would pursue combinations with both internal and external molecules. You can see this start to play out now with this Merck partnership as an early example of our approach. 
Next, on Slide 5, I'm pleased to note that we delivered on 3 of our target milestones for the quarter. You will also note that the time lines for TROPiCS-02 and the Phase Ib magrolimab have shifted now expects to have the PFS readout for TROPiCS-02 in late January or early February, and the top line readout for the Phase Ib magrolimab in the first quarter of 2022. 
Merdad will also touch on this later in the call. But as you know, these modest time line adjustments are quite normal in oncology, especially event-driven trials like TROPiCS-02. We look forward to sharing these updates in the first quarter of 2022. 
Taken as a whole, our oncology portfolio now spans some of the most promising targets in the field today. In addition to Trodelvy for Trop-2, CD47 and cell therapy, these include TIGIT, adenosine and many others. We are very encouraged by across these programs and look forward to sharing much more in the coming quarters. 
The positive momentum overall in the third quarter gives us great confidence in the direction we are taking and the pace of our progress. We are well on our way with the plans to sustain our leadership in HIV. And while there is much more to come in oncology, we've already begun to execute on the potential in our highly promising portfolio. Veklury is making a significant impact as the pandemic continues to evolve, and we are well placed for when the AD market bounces back. 
I want to thank all the Gilead and kind employees around the world who are making all this possible with their passion for scientific excellence and their commitment to global public health. With that, I'll hand over to Johanna, who will share an update on the commercial performance in the third quarter."

Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $5.4 billion, down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the Truvada and Triple LOEs, offset by continued growth in Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as
On Slide 8, Veklury sales of $1.9 billion were up 132% and reflected strong U.S. demand consistent with the recent surge in COVID cases, including the Delta variant. Over 60% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the U.S. with see Veklury, and we continue to expect the quarry sales to track hospitalizations, which you can see peaked at the end of August and have been declining ever since. 
Moving to HIV on Slide 9. Revenue of $4.2 billion grew 6% sequentially, driven by favorable net pricing and strong demand for Biktarvy, partially offset by a continuation of the trends towards a less favorable payer mix. While sequential trends were strong, total HIV revenues were down 8% year-over-year, given the impact of the Truvada Triple LOEs and lower channel inventory, primarily driven by paneled stocking in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV revenues were up 4% year-over-year.
Overall, we're encouraged by the improving trends in HIV treatment. The USAID treatment market grew about 3% sequentially, suggesting a modest pickup from the recovery that started in Q2. Our share of the overall U.S. HIV treatment market continues to hold steady at approximately 75%. And reflecting the modest pandemic recovery and strong share gains, Biktarvy revenues grew 20% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. 
revenue of $433 million was flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased demand in inventory offset by lower net price. We continue to see recovery year-to-date with the Pratt market growing 12% quarter-over-quarter and our encouraged  shareholding study around 45% despite the availability of multisource generics of 
Next, on Slide 10. Biktarvy continues to gain market share sequentially and year-over-year, both in the U.S. and the EU5. We are particularly pleased to see sequential quarterly growth of 1.5% in the U.S. and 1% in the EU5, especially given Biktarvy's leading market share. We're proud to see continued uptake of Biktarvy now capturing 41% of the total treatment market in the U.S., with more than 57% of people living with HIV starting treatment on Biktarvy. 
On Slide 11, HCV revenue of $429 million was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable settlement in the third quarter of 2020 that did not repeat, fewer patient starts outside of the U.S. and the timing of the Department of Corrections purchases on a relative basis. Sequentially, HCV revenue declined 22% due to inventory dynamics, including a sizable purchase by the Department of Corrections in the prior quarter and fewer patient starts. Although starts improved in some geographies year-over-year, with sequential declines in the U.S. and Europe, driven by continued pandemic-related impact on patient visits and lower testing volumes in additional -- in addition to normal seasonality. However, we continue to be pleased that Gilead HCV market share is holding steady around 60% in the U.S. and just above 50% in the EU5. 
Moving to Slide 12. HBV and HDV revenues of $247 million were up 17% year-over-year, driven by Vemlidy demand in the international markets and the addition of Hepcludex to our portfolio. Q3 revenue for Hepcludex was $12 million, reflecting sales now in Germany, France, Austria and Greece. We are actively working with government authorities to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022. 
Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 13. Third quarter revenue of $101 million grew 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased share in metastatic TNBC in part due to the expansion to second line. Trodelvy was approved for second-line metastatic TNBC in the U.S. in April, and we already estimate that approximately 15% of second-line patients are receiving Trodelvy. In the third line or later setting, we estimate that about 1/3 of patients with metastatic TNBC are received in Trodelvy. In urothelial cancer, at least 1 in 4 bladder cancer patients in the third line or later setting start treatment on Trodelvy. And with adoption in second line still early, there is continued opportunity for growth across both settings. 
We're pleased with the uptake so far and remain focused on broadening physician awareness in community settings. Following recent NCCN breast cancer and ESMO clinical guideline updates, Trodelvy is now included as a preferred regimen in second-line metastatic TNBC in both guidelines, and we expect this will drive further adoption. We are preparing the first commercial launches of Trodelvy for metastatic TNBC in Great Britain, Australia, Canada and Switzerland. And later this year, we are expecting a decision from the European Commission following the recent positive opinion from the CHMP. 
Next, on Slide 14 and on behalf of Christy and the Kite team, our cell therapy products grew 51% year-over-year to $222 million. This was driven by LBCL demand and strong launches in both mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, more than offsetting the expected impact of new U.S. entrants in LBCL. With the addition of our new MCL and FL indications, we are particularly proud that we have maintained our best-in-class manufacturing operations with a 97% reliability rate. 
To support our expected growth, we are working to bring our new Maryland facility online in mid-2022, which will automate many of our manual processes and reduce costs. 
We also wanted to highlight the recent FDA approval of Tecartus in adult ALL. This makes Tecartus the first and only CAR T therapy now available to these eligible patients in the U.S. The Kite team has also filed a supplemental BLA for Yescarta in second-line LBCL which would bring us one step closer to potentially curing even more patients. Christi is here with the team and available to take questions on cell therapy during the Q&A. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Merdad for pipeline update."

As always, I'll focus today on the most important updates and refer you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more comprehensive view of our pipeline programs. 
First, on Slide 16, in HIV prevention. We've initiated the 5,000-plus participant Phase III purpose I file siding lenacapavir for the prevention in adolescent girls and young for our risk of HIV infection. We're also in the initial stages of recruiting for purpose 2 to evaluate lenacapavir for prevention in over 3,000 is gender men, transgender and gender non-binary -- with men. We will provide updated time lines once enrollment is further along. 
In HIV treatment, the FDA granted priority review in August for lenacapavir for the treatment of people living with HIV who have developed multidrug resistance to other antiretrovirals. This is based on compelling Capella data that demonstrated 81% of heavily treatment-experienced individuals, achieved viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. 
The PDUFA action date has been set for February 28, 2022, and if approved, lenacapavir would become the first available 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV. 
Earlier this week, we announced that enrollment had started for the Phase II trial for the long-acting oral combination of lenacapavir and islatravir. This is part of our collaborative work with Merck to develop more flexible options for people living with HIV with a once-weekly old pill. Gilead is leading the development and clinical work for this oral combination and Merck is leading the clinical work for the injectable combination that is expected to enter Phase I clinical trials next year. 
Veklury on Slide 17. We presented a late breaker at the IDWeek 2021 conference last month based on the Phase III Pinetree study, evaluating Veklury an outpatient intravenous COVID-19 treatment. The results demonstrated that a 3-day course of Veklury significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for high-risk patients with COVID-19. In particular, Veklury demonstrated a statistically significant 87% reduction in risk for the composite primary endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or all-cause mortality by day 28 compared with placebo. There were no deaths in either arm of the study by day 28. 
We stopped Pinetree enrollment at the halfway mark of 584 patients in April due to the COVID-19 landscape at the time, but the study remained blinded and collected outcome data in the enrolled patients. Upon analysis of those data, results were highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful, again, demonstrating the efficacy of Veklury. It also emphasizes the importance of early treatment with antiviral therapies. 
We have submitted these data to the FDA as an sNDA filing and are in discussions with other regulatory agencies to explore approval for IV Veklury in an outpatient setting. We're also continuing our work to develop novel oral antivirals for the COVID-19. 
Moving to Slide 18. We continue to view Trodelvy as a pipeline in a product. Trodelvy targets Trop-2, which is overexpressed in many solid tumor cells. So we believe that Trodelvy can have a meaningful impact on a wide range of cancers in addition to the second-line metastatic TNBC and second-line bladder indications that are approved today. 
We're all eagerly anticipating the readout from the Phase III TROPiCS-02 study, our randomized Phase III trial in HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. As a reminder, this is an event-driven trial, evaluating disease progression, and we have not yet achieved the target number of events. As such, we now expect to have the top line data readout in late January or early February. To be clear, data analysis will only begin once we achieve the required number of events. We remain confident for the potential of Trodelvy to deliver a clinically meaningful benefit to patients with HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. 
We also continue to do advanced Trodelvy into registrational studies for other indications. For example, as recently posted on clinicaltrials.gov, we plan to initiate the Phase III trial in second to third line non-small cell lung cancer at risk and look forward to sharing updates for other solid tumors as we expand the program. As Dan mentioned, we'll also start to work with Merck on a new clinical study looking at Trodelvy in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA for first-line metastatic TNBC and plan to initiate the trial in the first half of 2022. 
Moving on to Slide 19. We continue to believe that with its synergistic potential and the safety profile observed to date, magrolimab could benefit patients with a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. As you know, our initial focus has been MDS and AML. While our commitment to these patients remains unchanged, we continue to evolve our clinical programs in the context of the recent developments in the MDS therapeutic landscape. The ongoing Phase III ENHANCE trial evaluating magrolimab in higher-risk MDS is on track and enrolling well. We will the development plans and regulatory path forward with the FDA before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the data from our Phase Ib trial continues to mature, and we now expect to share top line data in the first quarter of 2022. 
Looking beyond MDS, our ENHANCE III trial from magrolimab in first-line TP53 mutant AML is ongoing, targeting a new therapeutic of nearly 2,000 patients in the U.S. In addition, an estimated 6,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated annually with unfit AML. So we're expanding our development efforts to initiate a Phase III trial for first-line unfit AML by early next year. 
Over the past few months, we've initiated 2 solid tumor trials for magrolimab, one in head and neck cancer in a separate solid tumor basket study for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer. We also plan to initiate a third study in metastatic TNBC. Based on broad CD47 expression, we're excited by magrolimab's potential to be an effective therapy for solid tumors and look forward to sharing more updates as they become available. 
Next, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I also wanted to highlight the most recent approval for Tecartus in adults with relapsed or refractory ALL on Slide 20. We there's an incredibly high unmet need for these patients with 50% of adult patients relapsing on currently available treatment. The approval was based on data from ZUMA-3, which demonstrated 65% of patients achieved complete remission. Additionally, as Johanna mentioned earlier, Kite has filed the SBLA for Yescarta in second-line LCL. With a median follow-up of 2 years, the study met the primary endpoint of event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398 and a p-value of less than 0.0001, representing a potential significant advance in the standard of care for LBCL patients. We look forward to reviewing the entire data set at ASH and expect an update next year on approval status. 
Lastly, moving to Slide 21. We remain very excited about our oncology partners, whose work spans many promising new pathways in oncology. For example, our partners at Arcus has a pipeline that includes not only anti-TIGIT candidates, but also CD73 and adenosine receptor inhibitors to promote immune responses and inhibit tumor growth. We continue to expect to trigger the opt-in review period for Arcus' Domvanalimab, likely later this year or early next year, pending the review of more mature data. Additionally, through our partnerships, we have access to several candidates that could help modulate immunosuppressive and tumor permissive cell types and pathways, including TOZONA's-HLAG checkpoint inhibitor, which recently expanded to a Phase Ib study; and Jones' CCR inhibitor, which received IND clearance last quarter. 
Other potential opt-in programs from partners include pioneers TREM1 and TREM2 antibodies, which are in Phase I trials in actively enrolling patients; and agenesis CD137 agonist, which is expected to be evaluated in the combination trial that will be initiated later this year. 
In closing, on Slide 22, our teams are focused on executing across our oncology, virology and inflammation pipeline. And while early days for our inflammation portfolio, remain committed and invested in continuing to advance our pipeline across various mechanisms of action, such as IRAK4, AP4 beta 7 and  In combination with our opt-in partners, our pipeline portfolio spans many of the most promising targets across our 3 therapeutic focus areas. We're excited and committed to build out our best-in-class and industry-leading franchises. 
I'll now hand it over to Andy."

Moving to Slide 24. As you've heard from Johanna, our financial performance in the third quarter overall was strong, with total product sales up 13-point year-over-year, driven by Veklury's continued role i",786,"Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 24. As you've heard from Johanna, our financial performance in the third quarter overall was strong, with total product sales up 13-point year-over-year, driven by Veklury's continued role in the pandemic. Year-over-year total product sales, excluding Veklury, fell 3% and due to lower Truvada and Atripla sales following their loss of exclusivity late last year, offset in part by the continued demand for Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy. 
Sequentially, total product sales, excluding Veklury were up 2%, highlighting the ongoing pandemic recovery in HIV treatment and prep. This was partially offset by HCV, where new starts in both the U.S. and Europe continue to be impacted by the pandemic. 
Turning to the rest of the P&L. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 90%, 350 basis points higher year-over-year, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded $175 million litigation reserve as well as lower royalty expense and a change in product mix. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower remdesivir and inflammation-related expenses offset in part by increased clinical investment in Trodelvy and magrolimab. 
Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by increased promotional and marketing activities across all of our geographies, primarily Trodelvy. On tax, we realized a higher effective tax rate of 18.9% for the third quarter were up 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a prior year net discrete benefit. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.65 for the quarter compared to $2.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher Veklury sales and product gross margin offset by higher SG&A, lower interest income and higher effective tax rate. 
On Slide 25, you can see that Veklury has already exceeded our prior guidance for the year, with total revenues of $4.2 billion in the first 9 months. As a result, and with modestly updated expectations for the rest of our business, we are increasing our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the full year by 6% and 13% at the midpoint, respectively, as shown on Slide 26. 
After the wave of infections and hospitalizations in recent months, we believe we have moved past the peak of the pandemic for the year. We continue to expect that Veklury will play an important role in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 globally. However, assuming we do not experience another surge, we expect Veklury revenue to step down significantly in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are raising our full year total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.3 billion, compared to our previous range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion, reflecting results year-to-date and Veklury performance. We now expect full year Veklury revenues to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion up from our prior outlook of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. We continue to expect that sales of Veklury will track COVID-19-related hospitalizations. 
We now expect full year total product sales, excluding Veklury to be approximately $21.5 billion compared to the prior range of $21.7 billion to $21.9 billion, reflecting our performance year-to-date and continued pandemic-related impact. 
As for the rest of our P&L, we expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 87% compared to 86% to 87% previously, primarily reflecting the strong gross margin in the third quarter. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect R&D to decline mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels as compared to our prior expectations of low to mid-single-digit percentage decline. We expect SG&A to be flat on a dollar basis compared to 2020 versus prior expectations of flat to low single-digit percentage decline. On our non-GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21% this year. 
Finally, with the updates to our revenue, product gross margin and operating expenses, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $7.90 and $8.10 for the full year and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.70. 
On capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continue to invest in our business and at the same time, we've returned over $1 billion in the third quarter and $3.2 billion year-to-date to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. We have also repaid $3.75 billion in debt this year. And earlier today, we notified our 3 non-call 1 bondholders that we would exercise our ability to repay [ $1 ] million of the notes early. Taken together, we now expect to pay down $4.75 billion of debt this year, significantly exceeding our prior guidance to pay down at least $4 billion. 
With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the Q&A."

When you think about Biktarvy and you think about our growth year-on-year at about 20% and then, of course, double-digit growth on a quarterly basis as well, we have different dynamics going on. Obviously, demand is still strong. So we're quite pleased with that. We grew about 1.5% share over the last quarter, over 6% in a full year. So we're on a much larger base because we are a market leader. But we've also had some different pricing dynamics as well going on that are related to, obviously, the mix that we're looking at.

So from an HCV standpoint, we talked about being about 8% under year-over-year. A lot of that has to do with timing and pricing adjustments. So it's not patient per se. We're actually flat pretty much year-over-year, about 2% positive. What we did see though is market starts declined in Q3, and that's directly related to the pandemic because less screening diagnosis were down again in Q3. And so we believe that will pick back up. I wouldn't go so much to say that it will be an increase, right? But I would say that we should be able to hold flat because you typically see HCV patient starts decline over time just because there's less patients that need the cure, but not as quickly as what we're seeing in the quarter. So we do think that will pick back up. It's -- and so we would assume a little bit more tempered decline in 2022. 
The HIV piece of the puzzle, we still are seeing screenings and diagnosis less than pre-COVID-19. So we're seeing about screening 10% down versus 2019, and diagnosis are still 20% below of 2019 levels. So as much as we're seeing recovery quarter-over-quarter, and we're excited about that because that's in line with what we had assumed. We're still not back to the levels that we need to be. And so I would say that you're now growing from a lower base, and it's kind of what we talked about in the last quarter, where the assumption was it would come right back. But the dynamic market in HIV is very small, and it's going to take a little bit longer and therefore, we're just growing from a lower base. And we do believe we'll get back to typical levels of a couple of single-digit growth from a market standpoint in 2022, it's just going to take us a couple of quarters to get there. So hopefully, that helps a little bit, give you perspective."

So if we just step back, when you think about loan growth, there's been a number of questions. So just to paint the picture again. There are a number of growth drivers that we see driving. We don't provide specific long-term guidance. What we've said and we'll continue to say is that the HIV business, including the long-acting collaboration that you mentioned, Trodelvy, magrolimab, cell therapy and a number of the other programs, essentially the ARCUS programs are expected to drive our long-term growth. 
In the short run, we see a much more promising growth profile than we did historically. So we think that we've done a lot to turn the company around. And now the growth profile is improving significantly from our perspective. When you get to '24 or '25, again, we've said we see an expected inflection in our growth profile as a lot of these programs that are currently in the clinic, hopefully reach the commercialization, including a number of the Trodelvy programs. 
On Trodelvy, specifically, I think we continue to be very bullish on the prospects for Trodelvy overall, similar to where we were when we did the transaction. So you'll remember, we highlighted that there are a number of ways to win with Trodelvy when we acquired Immunomedics the hormone receptor positive study was just one of those studies. Obviously, we're excited about the work that we're doing in lung cancer and other areas. So there is a much broader clinical development plan for Trodelvy, and then the market probably fully appreciates today the announcement with Merck earlier today is a good example of that, that will give you a sense of where we're going, and we expect to give you a much greater sense of that overall. 
So I think at a macro level, before I ask Johanna to comment, I'd say our expectations for Trodelvy have not changed. We continue to be very enthusiastic about where we are and where we're going. And there's lots of different ways for us to get there over time."

We appreciate you taking the time to join us here today.Starting on Slide 4, this was a very strong third quarter with significantly higher than expected demand for Veklury and positive HIV share gains a",1225,"Thank you, Jacquie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us here today.
Starting on Slide 4, this was a very strong third quarter with significantly higher than expected demand for Veklury and positive HIV share gains as the market continues to recover. The high demand for Veklury was associated with the latest surge in cases of COVID-19. The therapy has now been provided to more than 9 million people worldwide, including 6.5 million people in 127 middle- and low-income countries through our voluntary licensing program.
All of us at Gilead are proud of the important role that Veklury continues to play. I wanted to acknowledge the way our teams have navigated the unpredictable path of the pandemic, flexing our own operations and supporting our partners' efforts to ensure Veklury and remdesivir are available to meet patient demand.
At the same time, we're applying our 3 decades of expertise in virology to advance new options that can be taken outside the hospital and earlier in the disease. We recently filed an sNDA for IV outpatient use of Veklury. This is based on data from our Phase III PINETREE study that demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalizations after a 3-day IV treatment of Veklury in the outpatient setting. In order to meet additional treatment needs, we also continue to advance our oral programs to develop a novel, best-in-class therapy. 
Turning to HIV performance, we saw positive gains in the treatment market for the second quarter in a row, and reported record revenue for Biktarvy. While treatment prescription volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels, we maintained total U.S. and EU treatment market share, and we grew Biktarvy shares sequentially in both geographies. The prep market continues to recover and our prep market share is holding steady despite generic entry. Overall, our third quarter results give us confidence that the HIV market is recovering from the pandemic and our market share clearly highlights Gilead's strong market position. 
As a result of the strong quarter, we have increased our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance. Veklury now looks set to deliver close to twice the revenue we expected at the start of the year. While our base business has clearly been affected by COVID, it has also shown resilience. At the guidance midpoint, we are now expecting full year total revenue to be $1.75 billion higher than we expected at the start of the year. 
Our confidence in the longevity of our HIV business is in part based on our progress in developing the next generation of HIV therapy and prevention. Lenacapavir is the cornerstone of that work, and we have 4 clinical trials evaluating lenacapavir across treatment and prevention, highlighting our efforts to extend the options available to people living with or at risk of HIV. This quarter, lenacapavir was granted FDA priority review for the heavily treatment-experienced population. As a reminder, lenacapavir has breakthrough therapy designation and if approved, would be the first long-acting treatment for people living with HIV who have multidrug resistance as well as the first available 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV. 
Separately, as you know, we signed an agreement with Merck earlier this year to explore combinations of lenacapavir and islatravir in long-acting treatment. Earlier this week, we announced the start of a Phase II study with Merck, evaluating a lenacapavir and islatravir long-acting oral combination treatment. Our approach to long-acting is very much shaped by people living with HIV. We've heard that they would welcome weekly oral or infrequent subcutaneous injections that could coincide with routine office visits or even be taken at home. The advantages of these options include greater convenience, the potential for stronger adherence and privacy. Lenacapavir has shown promising potential in both oral and subcutaneous injections and we'll continue to advance both options while updating you on our progress throughout. 
While extending our leadership in HIV, we are also executing on the significant potential in our broad and diverse oncology portfolio. This is potential that could bring transformational benefits for people with cancer and value for our stakeholders. 
Third quarter highlights include the initiation of 2 solid tumor trials for magrolimab, head and neck cancer and a multi-tumor basket study. We plan to initiate an additional Phase III study in first-line unfit acute myeloid leukemia or AML in early 2022. 
The FDA approval of Tecartus for adult relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is our fourth approved indication in cell therapy. Additionally, the Kite team has filed an sBLA for Yescarta in second-line LBCL which, if approved, would be the first CAR T therapy in an earlier line setting and a positive CHMP opinion for Trodelvy in second line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer earlier this month. We expect an approval decision from the European Commission later this year, and this could potentially be our sixth approval for Trodelvy in triple-negative breast cancer in 2021. 
Additionally, we've just announced a new clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the combination of Gilead's Trop-2 antibody drug conjugate Trodelvy with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA for the treatment of first-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. When we acquired Immunomedics last year, we said that we would explore the use of Trodelvy across a wide range of tumor types, and then we would pursue combinations with both internal and external molecules. You can see this start to play out now with this Merck partnership as an early example of our approach. 
Next, on Slide 5, I'm pleased to note that we delivered on 3 of our target milestones for the quarter. You will also note that the time lines for TROPiCS-02 and the Phase Ib magrolimab have shifted as we now expect to have the PFS readout for TROPiCS-02 in late January or early February, and the top line readout for the Phase Ib magrolimab in the first quarter of 2022. 
Merdad will also touch on this later in the call. But as you know, these modest time line adjustments are quite normal in oncology, especially event-driven trials like TROPiCS-02. We look forward to sharing these updates in the first quarter of 2022. 
Taken as a whole, our oncology portfolio now spans some of the most promising targets in the field today. In addition to Trodelvy for Trop-2, CD47 and cell therapy, these include TIGIT, adenosine and many others. We are very encouraged by the momentum across these programs and look forward to sharing much more in the coming quarters. 
The positive momentum overall in the third quarter gives us great confidence in the direction we are taking and the pace of our progress. We are well on our way with the plans to sustain our leadership in HIV. And while there is much more to come in oncology, we've already begun to execute on the potential in our highly promising portfolio. Veklury is making a significant impact as the pandemic continues to evolve, and we are well placed for when the HIV market bounces back. 
I want to thank all the Gilead and Kite employees around the world who are making all this possible with their passion for scientific excellence and their commitment to global public health. 
With that, I'll hand over to Johanna, who will share an update on the commercial performance in the third quarter."

As you can see on Slide 7, total product sales of $7.4 billion grew 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by Veklury. Excluding Veklury, total product sales were $5.4 billion, down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the Truvada and Triple LOEs, offset by continued growth in Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy.
On Slide 8, Veklury sales of $1.9 billion were up 132% sequentially and reflected strong U.S. demand consistent with the recent surge in COVID cases, including the Delta variant. Over 60% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the U.S. received Veklury, and we continue to expect Veklury sales to track hospitalizations, which you can see peaked at the end of August and have been declining ever since. 
Moving to HIV on Slide 9. Revenue of $4.2 billion grew 6% sequentially, driven by favorable net pricing and strong demand for Biktarvy, partially offset by a continuation of the trends towards a less favorable payer mix. While sequential trends were strong, total HIV revenues were down 8% year-over-year, given the impact of the Truvada and Triple LOEs and lower channel inventory, primarily driven by pandemic-related stocking in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the LOEs, HIV revenues were up 4% year-over-year.
Overall, we're encouraged by the improving trends in HIV treatment. The USA study treatment market grew about 3% sequentially, suggesting a modest pickup from the recovery that started in Q2. Our share of the overall U.S. HIV treatment market continues to hold steady at approximately 75%. And reflecting the modest pandemic recovery and strong share gains, Biktarvy revenues grew 20% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. 
DESCOVY revenue of $433 million was flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased demand in inventory offset by lower net price. We continue to see recovery year-to-date with the PrEP market growing 12% quarter-over-quarter and are encouraged to see DESCOVY shareholding steady around 45% despite the availability of multisource generic versions of Truvada.
Next, on Slide 10. Biktarvy continues to gain market share sequentially and year-over-year, both in the U.S. and the EU5. We are particularly pleased to see sequential quarterly growth of 1.5% in the U.S. and 1% in the EU5, especially given Biktarvy's leading market share. We're proud to see continued uptake of Biktarvy now capturing 41% of the total treatment market in the U.S., with more than 57% of people living with HIV starting treatment on Biktarvy. 
On Slide 11, HCV revenue of $429 million was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable settlement in the third quarter of 2020 that did not repeat, fewer patient starts outside of the U.S. and the timing of the Department of Corrections purchases on a relative basis. Sequentially, HCV revenue declined 22% due to inventory dynamics, including a sizable purchase by the Department of Corrections in the prior quarter and fewer patient starts. Although starts improved in some geographies year-over-year, we saw sequential declines in the U.S. and Europe, driven by continued pandemic-related impact on patient visits and lower testing volumes in additional -- in addition to normal seasonality. However, we continue to be pleased that Gilead HCV market share is holding steady around 60% in the U.S. and just above 50% in the EU5. 
Moving to Slide 12. HBV and HDV revenues of $247 million were up 17% year-over-year, driven by Vemlidy demand in the international markets and the addition of Hepcludex to our portfolio. Q3 revenue for Hepcludex was $12 million, reflecting sales now in Germany, France, Austria and Greece. We are actively working with government authorities to secure full reimbursement in the major European markets in 2022. 
Moving to Trodelvy on Slide 13. Third quarter revenue of $101 million grew 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increased share in metastatic TNBC in part due to the expansion to second line. Trodelvy was approved for second-line metastatic TNBC in the U.S. in April, and we already estimate that approximately 15% of second-line patients are receiving Trodelvy. In the third line or later setting, we estimate that about 1/3 of patients with metastatic TNBC are receiving Trodelvy. In urothelial cancer, at least 1 in 4 bladder cancer patients in the third line or later setting start treatment on Trodelvy. And with adoption in second line still early, there is continued opportunity for growth across both settings. 
We're pleased with the uptake so far and remain focused on broadening physician awareness in community settings. Following recent NCCN breast cancer and ESMO clinical guideline updates, Trodelvy is now included as a preferred regimen in second-line metastatic TNBC in both guidelines, and we expect this will drive further adoption. We are preparing the first commercial launches of Trodelvy for metastatic TNBC in Great Britain, Australia, Canada and Switzerland. And later this year, we are expecting a decision from the European Commission following the recent positive opinion from the CHMP. 
Next, on Slide 14 and on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, our cell therapy products grew 51% year-over-year to $222 million. This was driven by LBCL demand and strong launches in both mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, more than offsetting the expected impact of new U.S. entrants in LBCL. With the addition of our new MCL and FL indications, we are particularly proud that we have maintained our best-in-class manufacturing operations with a 97% reliability rate. 
To support our expected growth, we are working to bring our new Maryland facility online in mid-2022, which will automate many of our manual processes and reduce costs. 
We also wanted to highlight the recent FDA approval of Tecartus in adult ALL. This makes Tecartus the first and only CAR T therapy now available to these eligible patients in the U.S. The Kite team has also filed a supplemental BLA for Yescarta in second-line LBCL which would bring us one step closer to potentially curing even more patients. Christi is here with the team and available to take questions on cell therapy during the Q&A. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Merdad for pipeline update."
29002,1685194658,2417087,"Gilead Sciences, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Johanna. As always, I'll focus today on the most important updates and refer you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more comprehensive view of our pipeline programs. First, on Slide 16, in HIV prevention. We've initiated the 5",1405,"Thank you, Johanna. As always, I'll focus today on the most important updates and refer you to the appendix of the earnings presentation for a more comprehensive view of our pipeline programs. 
First, on Slide 16, in HIV prevention. We've initiated the 5,000-plus participant Phase III purpose I trial setting lenacapavir for the prevention in adolescent girls and young women who are at risk of HIV infection. We're also in the initial stages of recruiting for purpose 2 to evaluate lenacapavir for prevention in over 3,000 cis-gender men, transgender and gender non-binary who have sex with men. We will provide updated time lines once enrollment is further along. 
In HIV treatment, the FDA granted priority review in August for lenacapavir for the treatment of people living with HIV who have developed multidrug resistance to other antiretrovirals. This is based on compelling CAPELLA data that demonstrated 81% of heavily treatment-experienced individuals achieved viral suppression when lenacapavir was combined with an optimized background regimen. 
The PDUFA action date has been set for February 28, 2022, and if approved, lenacapavir would become the first available 6-month long-acting subcutaneous injection treatment for HIV. 
Earlier this week, we announced that enrollment had started for the Phase II trial for the long-acting oral combination of lenacapavir and islatravir. This is part of our collaborative work with Merck to develop more flexible options for people living with HIV with a once-weekly oral pill. Gilead is leading the development and clinical work for this oral combination and Merck is leading the clinical work for the injectable combination that is expected to enter Phase I clinical trials next year. 
Moving to Veklury on Slide 17. We presented a late breaker at the IDWeek 2021 conference last month based on the Phase III PINETREE study, evaluating Veklury an outpatient intravenous COVID-19 treatment. The results demonstrated that a 3-day course of Veklury significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization for high-risk patients with COVID-19. In particular, Veklury demonstrated a statistically significant 87% reduction in risk for the composite primary endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or all-cause mortality by day 28 compared with placebo. There were no deaths in either arm of the study by day 28. 
We stopped PINETREE enrollment at the halfway mark of 584 patients in April due to the COVID-19 landscape at the time, but the study remained blinded in collected outcome data in the enrolled patients. Upon analysis of those data, results were highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful, again, demonstrating the efficacy of Veklury. It also emphasizes the importance of early treatment with antiviral therapies. 
We have submitted these data to the FDA as an sNDA filing and are in discussions with other regulatory agencies to explore approval for IV Veklury in an outpatient setting. We're also continuing our work to develop novel oral antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. 
Moving to Slide 18. We continue to view Trodelvy as a pipeline and a product. Trodelvy targets Trop-2, which is overexpressed in many solid tumor cells. So we believe that Trodelvy can have a meaningful impact on a wide range of cancers in addition to the second-line metastatic TNBC and second-line bladder indications that are approved today. 
We're all eagerly anticipating the readout from the Phase III TROPiCS-02 study, our randomized Phase III trial in HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. As a reminder, this is an event-driven trial, evaluating disease progression, and we have not yet achieved the target number of events. As such, we now expect to have the top line data readout in late January or early February. To be clear, data analysis will only begin once we achieve the required number of events. We remain confident for the potential of Trodelvy to deliver a clinically meaningful benefit to patients with HR-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. 
We also continue to do advanced Trodelvy into registrational studies for other indications. For example, as recently posted on clinicaltrials.gov, we plan to initiate the Phase III trial in second to third line non-small cell lung cancer at risk and look forward to sharing updates for other solid tumors as we expand the program. As Dan mentioned, we'll also start to work with Merck on a new clinical study looking at Trodelvy in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA for first-line metastatic TNBC and plan to initiate the trial in the first half of 2022. 
Moving on to Slide 19. We continue to believe that with its synergistic potential and the safety profile observed to date, magrolimab could benefit patients with a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. As you know, our initial focus has been MDS and AML. While our commitment to these patients remains unchanged, we continue to evolve our clinical programs in the context of the recent developments in the MDS therapeutic landscape. The ongoing Phase III ENHANCE trial evaluating magrolimab in higher-risk MDS is on track and enrolling well. We will discuss our development plans and regulatory path forward with the FDA before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the data from our Phase Ib trial continues to mature, and we now expect to share top line data in the first quarter of 2022. 
Looking beyond MDS, our ENHANCE II trial from magrolimab in first-line TP53 mutant AML is ongoing, targeting a new therapeutic option for nearly 2,000 patients in the U.S. In addition, an estimated 6,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated annually with unfit AML. So we're expanding our development efforts to initiate a Phase III trial for first-line unfit AML by early next year. 
Over the past few months, we've initiated 2 solid tumor trials for magrolimab, one in head and neck cancer and a separate solid tumor basket study for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer. We also plan to initiate a third study in metastatic TNBC. Based on broad CD47 expression, we're excited by magrolimab's potential to be an effective therapy for solid tumors and look forward to sharing more updates as they become available. 
Next, on behalf of Christi and the Kite team, I also wanted to highlight the most recent approval for Tecartus in adults with relapsed or refractory ALL on Slide 20. There's an incredibly high unmet need for these patients with 50% of adult patients relapsing on currently available treatment. The approval was based on data from ZUMA-3, which demonstrated 65% of patients achieved complete remission. Additionally, as Johanna mentioned earlier, Kite has filed the sBLA for Yescarta in second-line LBCL. With a median follow-up of 2 years, the study met the primary endpoint of event-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.398 and a p-value of less than 0.0001, representing a potential significant advance in the standard of care for LBCL patients. We look forward to reviewing the entire data set at ASH and expect an update next year on approval status. 
Lastly, moving to Slide 21. We remain very excited about our oncology partners, whose work spans many promising new pathways in oncology. For example, our partners at Arcus has a pipeline that includes not only anti-TIGIT candidates, but also CD73 and adenosine receptor inhibitors to promote immune responses and inhibit tumor growth. We continue to expect to trigger the opt-in review period for Arcus' Domvanalimab, likely later this year or early next year, pending the review of more mature data. Additionally, through our partnerships, we have access to several candidates that could help modulate immunosuppressive and tumor permissive cell types and pathways, including Tizona's HLAG checkpoint inhibitor, which recently expanded to a Phase Ib study; and Johnson's CCR inhibitor, which received IND clearance last quarter. 
Other potential opt-in programs from partners include pioneers TREM1 and TREM2 antibodies, which are in Phase I trials in actively enrolling patients; and agenesis CD137 agonist, which is expected to be evaluated in the combination trial that will be initiated later this year. 
In closing, on Slide 22, our teams are focused on executing across our oncology, virology and inflammation pipeline. And while it's still early days for our inflammation portfolio, remain committed and invested in continuing to advance our pipeline across various mechanisms of action, such as IRAK4, alpha 4 beta 7 and TPL2. In combination with our opt-in partners, our pipeline portfolio spans many of the most promising targets across our 3 therapeutic focus areas. We're very excited and committed to build out our best-in-class and industry-leading franchises. 
I'll now hand it over to Andy."
29002,1685194658,2417087,"Gilead Sciences, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 24. As you've heard from Johanna, our financial performance in the third quarter overall was strong, with total product sales up 13% year-over-year, driven by Veklury's continued role in the",785,"Thank you, Merdad, and good afternoon, everyone. Moving to Slide 24. As you've heard from Johanna, our financial performance in the third quarter overall was strong, with total product sales up 13% year-over-year, driven by Veklury's continued role in the pandemic. Year-over-year total product sales, excluding Veklury, fell 3% due to lower Truvada and Atripla sales following their loss of exclusivity late last year, offset in part by the continued demand for Biktarvy and contributions from our new medicines such as Trodelvy. 
Sequentially, total product sales excluding Veklury were up 2%, highlighting the ongoing pandemic recovery in HIV treatment and prep. This was partially offset by HCV, where new starts in both the U.S. and Europe continue to be impacted by the pandemic. 
Turning to the rest of the P&L. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 90%, 350 basis points higher year-over-year, reflecting the reversal of a previously recorded $175 million litigation reserve as well as lower royalty expense and a change in product mix. Non-GAAP R&D was $1.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower remdesivir and inflammation-related expenses offset in part by increased clinical investment in Trodelvy and magrolimab. 
Non-GAAP SG&A was $1.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by increased promotional and marketing activities across all of our geographies, primarily for Trodelvy. On tax, we realized a higher effective tax rate of 18.9% for the third quarter were up 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a prior year net discrete tax benefit. Overall, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.65 for the quarter compared to $2.11 for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher Veklury sales and product gross margin offset by higher SG&A, lower interest income and higher effective tax rate. 
On Slide 25, you can see that Veklury has already exceeded our prior guidance for the year, with total revenues of $4.2 billion in the first 9 months. As a result, and with modestly updated expectations for the rest of our business, we are increasing our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the full year by 6% and 13% at the midpoint, respectively, as shown on Slide 26. 
After the wave of infections and hospitalizations in recent months, we believe we have moved past the peak of the pandemic for the year. We continue to expect that Veklury will play an important role in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 globally. However, assuming we do not experience another surge, we expect Veklury revenue to step down significantly in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are raising our full year total product sales in the range of $26 billion to $26.3 billion, compared to our previous range of $24.4 billion to $25 billion, reflecting results year-to-date and Veklury performance. We now expect full year Veklury revenues to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion up from our prior outlook of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. We continue to expect that sales of Veklury will track COVID-19-related hospitalizations.
We now expect full year total product sales excluding Veklury to be approximately $21.5 billion compared to the prior range of $21.7 billion to $21.9 billion, reflecting our performance year-to-date and continued pandemic-related impact. 
As for the rest of our P&L, we expect our non-GAAP product gross margin to be approximately 87% compared to 86% to 87% previously, primarily reflecting the strong gross margin in the third quarter. For non-GAAP operating expenses, we now expect R&D to decline mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2020 levels as compared to our prior expectations of low to mid-single-digit percentage decline. We expect SG&A to be flat on a dollar basis compared to 2020 versus prior expectations of flat to low single-digit percentage decline. On our non-GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21% this year. 
Finally, with the updates to our revenue, product gross margin and operating expenses, we now expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $7.90 and $8.10 for the full year and GAAP diluted EPS to be between $5.50 and $5.70. 
On capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. We continue to invest in our business and at the same time, we've returned over $1 billion in the third quarter and $3.2 billion year-to-date to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. We have also repaid $3.75 billion in debt this year. And earlier today, we notified our 3 non-call 1 bondholders that we would exercise our ability to repay $1 billion of the notes early. Taken together, we now expect to pay down $4.75 billion of debt this year, significantly exceeding our prior guidance to pay down at least $4 billion. 
With that, I'll invite the operator to begin the Q&A."

So that's a little bit different than what you're referring to. The $1.5 billion in the U.S., most of the sales actually of the total $1.9 billion, obviously, coming out of the U.S. and the patient population. So I can't track your math per se. But what I would say is that the U.S. patient population was the greatest. And if you just do the math on about a 5-day therapy on an average price for remdesivir that you would get to less than year 750, just doing it off the top of my head. So I think it's probably a little bit lower than that and higher in other parts of the world just because of price points."

What we're assuming at this point is actually, we are going to get back from a market standpoint back to where we were prior to COVID. We're just starting from a much lower base. So it's going to take a little bit of time. So I think the assumption is that as we get to 2022, you'll see that kind of play out, assuming no other major surges come through. So that's from a market standpoint, which obviously will help from a -- from a product standpoint. 
When you think about Biktarvy and you think about our growth year-on-year at about 20% and then, of course, double-digit growth on a quarterly basis as well, we have different dynamics going on. Obviously, demand is still strong. So we're quite pleased with that. We grew about 1.5% share over the last quarter, over 6% in a full year. So we're on a much larger base because we are a market leader. But we've also had some different pricing dynamics as well going on that are related to, obviously, the mix that we're looking at. So that's something that is impacted directly by the pandemic, right, as you think about your government versus commercial mix. And we've seen PHS channels specifically kind of grow a little bit more rapidly than any other segment over the last couple of quarters. So those are kind of the dynamics that we're dealing with.

So from an HCV standpoint, we talked about being about 8% under year-over-year. A lot of that has to do with timing and pricing adjustments. So it's not patient per se. We're actually flat pretty much year-over-year, about 2% positive. What we did see though is market starts declined in Q3, and that's directly related to the pandemic because less screening diagnosis they were down again in Q3. And so we believe that will pick back up. I wouldn't go so much to say that it will be an increase, right? But I would say that we should be able to hold flat because you typically see HCV patient starts decline over time just because there's less patients that need the cure, but not as quickly as what we're seeing in the quarter. So we do think that will pick back up. It's -- and so we would assume a little bit more tempered decline in 2022. 
The HIV piece of the puzzle, we still are seeing screenings and diagnosis less than pre-COVID-19. So we're seeing about screening 10% down versus 2019, and diagnosis are still 20% below 2019 levels. So as much as we're seeing recovery quarter-over-quarter, and we're excited about that because that's in line with what we had assumed, we're still not back to the levels that we need to be. And so I would say that you're now growing from a lower base, and it's kind of what we talked about in the last quarter, where the assumption was it would come right back. But the dynamic market in HIV is very small, and it's going to take a little bit longer and therefore, we're just growing from a lower base. And we do believe we'll get back to typical levels of a couple of single-digit growth from a market standpoint in 2022, it's just going to take us a couple of quarters to get there.

So if we just step back, when you think about long-term growth, there's been a number of questions. So just to paint the picture again. There are a number of growth drivers that we see driving. We don't provide specific long-term guidance. What we've said and we'll continue to say is that the HIV business, including the long-acting collaboration that you mentioned, Trodelvy, magrolimab, cell therapy and a number of the other programs, essentially the Arcus programs are expected to drive our long-term growth. 
In the short run, we see a much more promising growth profile than we did historically. So we think that we've done a lot to turn the company around. And now the growth profile is improving significantly from our perspective. When you get to '24 or '25, again, we've said we see an expected inflection in our growth profile as a lot of these programs that are currently in the clinic, hopefully reach the commercialization, including a number of the Trodelvy programs. 
On Trodelvy, specifically, I think we continue to be very bullish on the prospects for Trodelvy overall, similar to where we were when we did the transaction. So you'll remember, we highlighted there are a number of ways to win with Trodelvy when we acquired Immunomedics. The hormone receptor positive study was just one of those studies. Obviously, we're excited about the work that we're doing in lung cancer and other areas. So there is a much broader clinical development plan for Trodelvy, and then the market probably fully appreciates today. The announcement with Merck earlier today is a good example of that. That will give you a sense of where we're going, and we expect to give you a much greater sense of that overall. 
So I think at a macro level, before I ask Johanna to comment, I'd say our expectations for Trodelvy have not changed. We continue to be very enthusiastic about where we are and where we're going. And there's lots of different ways for us to get there over time."

I would just add, I think we are pleased with where we're going with Trodelvy today in the short term. We still believe that there's a lot of growth opportunities, specifically in the earlier line setting, both across triple-negative breast cancer as well as bladder cancer. And so we're seeing those opportunities play out. I think the guidelines are going to help us set up for success, let alone set up for future pipeline studies such as HR positive coming through, hopefully, in a positive way, as you mentioned, and that should just expand our market opportunity in more so. The only thing I would add to what Andy was saying is also on the HIV front, so not looking just at the oncology opportunities but also from an HIV standpoint, we still believe Biktarvy is foundational to our HIV opportunities in addition to, of course, lenacapavir that Merdad spoke to earlier. So we're excited about what we have going on there as well."

This is a straightforward, simple clinical collaboration. Merck is providing Trodelvy. They obviously had input on the study design -- KEYTRUDA, I'm sorry, KEYTRUDA to the study. Thank you. They do not have any economics on Trodelvy as a result of the study, but they will enjoy, hopefully, the added benefits to KEYTRUDA on their end. And these studies are not exclusive. So they have the ability to do other studies in the same area with other agents, including other Trop-2 antibodies, and we have the ability to do studies with other PD-1 inhibitors as well. And of course, we started in triple-negative breast cancer. You're highlighting that there's another study that they will do with another Trop-2 inhibitor in lung cancer. That, of course, is an area that we're going to look at as well. So I expect that there's more to come. But these are relatively straightforward, simple plain vanilla clinical collaborations."

So yes, we're very excited about our submission at the end of September for second line and expect to hear back on the status from FDA first half of next year. But we will be presenting the data at ASH, as you said. And CAR-T is really the only potential cure we're seeing right now. So when you look at the out-of-class second-line agents and moving to front line, it typically has been a delay to CAR-T. And now with this new study coming out, we'll have to see what that exact duration will be for those patients. We hope it will be successful, but we don't see a huge impact to our projections in the cell therapy marketplace. Second line actually allows us to basically double the market that we can play in, which is about 14,000 patients in the U.S. That, combined with you'll also see our frontline data ZUMA-12, which was completed, we'll be presenting that at ASH as well. So you'll see on our front line, second line and see how kind of it may stack up, although they're not head-to-head trial. So we're pretty confident in where we are and it doesn't really change our projections for the future of cell therapy or for our specific brands."
