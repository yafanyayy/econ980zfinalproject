The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe. The energy business was among those confronted by unprecedented demand contraction, which began in t",801,"Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe. The energy business was among those confronted by unprecedented demand contraction, which began in the first quarter of 2020 as COVID-19 cases accelerated globally, resulting in an increase in crude oil and product inventories to record high levels. 
In response, we lowered our refinery utilization rates to more closely match product supply with demand. And as the pandemic-related restrictions were eased in some regions and mobility increased, product demand increased substantially, steadily reducing crude oil and product inventories. We ended the year with U.S. crude oil and product inventories within the normal 5-year inventory band. 
Throughout the pandemic, our team has been thorough and decisive in its operational and financial response, while maintaining focus on safety and reliability. In fact, we set several operational records in 2020, recording our best ever year on employee safety performance, achieving the milestone 2 years in a row and the best ever year for process safety and environmental performance. And applying our refining expertise to optimize our Renewable Diesel segment, we set records for sales volumes and margin in 2020. 
We also made significant progress on our international strategy to expand our product supply chain into higher-growth markets, with the start of waterborne product shipments to our new Veracruz terminal, making Valero one of the largest fuel importers into Mexico. 
On the financial side, we improved our liquidity by raising $4 billion of debt at attractive rates, and we reduced our capital budget by over $500 million while keeping our high-return projects moving forward. And in spite of all the challenges this past year, we continue to honor our commitment to our shareholders by maintaining the dividend and ending the year with $3.3 billion of cash and $9.2 billion of total available liquidity. 
Despite the pandemic-imposed challenges and several hurricanes, we completed and continued to make progress on several strategic growth projects, including the St. Charles Alkylation unit, which was brought online in the fourth quarter, on schedule and under budget. The project further increases the competitiveness of the St. Charles Refinery and is a testament to the talent and efforts of the refining organization. The Pembroke Cogen project and the Diamond Pipeline expansion are on track to be completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. 
The Diamond Green Diesel expansion project at St. Charles, which we refer to as DGD 2 is designed to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of continuous process improvement and optimization, the capacity of the existing St. Charles Renewable Diesel Plant, DGD 1, has increased from 275 million gallons per year to 290 million gallons per year. With the completion of DGD 2, the total capacity at St. Charles is expected to be 690 million gallons per year. 
In 2020, we laid out our comprehensive road map to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2025. As part of this goal, we continue to reinvest capital into higher growth, higher return, low carbon renewable fuels projects. To that end, we are pleased to announce that the Board has approved DGD 3, a new 470 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas refinery. We're moving forward with the project immediately, and we now expect the new plant to be operational in the second half of 2023. Once DGD 3 is completed, DGD's combined annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. 
Looking ahead, we expect to see continued improvement in refining margins as COVID-19 vaccines are widely distributed in the coming months, allowing people and businesses to get back to normalcy. We're already seeing encouraging signs with strong diesel demand and with U.S. total light product inventories now in the normal range. In addition, many uncompetitive refineries around the world announced shutdowns or conversions in 2020, and we expect further capacity rationalizations to be announced this year. 
In closing, we remain steadfast in the execution of our strategy, pursuing excellence in operations, investing for earnings growth with lower volatility and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. We expect low carbon fuel policies to continue to expand globally and drive demand for renewable fuels. And with that view, we're leveraging our global liquid fuels platform and expertise that comes with being the largest renewable diesel producer in North America to steadily expand our competitive advantage in economic low carbon projects for a higher return on invested capital. 
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

For the fourth quarter of 2020, we incurred a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $359 million or $0.88 per share compared to net income of $1.1 billion or $2.58 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The  fourth quarter 2020 a",1197,"Thanks, Joe. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we incurred a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $359 million or $0.88 per share compared to net income of $1.1 billion or $2.58 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The  fourth quarter 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $429 million or $1.06 per share compared to adjusted net income of $873 million or $2.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. 
For 2020, the net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.4 billion or $3.50 per share compared to net income of $2.4 billion or $5.84 per share in 2019. The 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.3 billion or $3.12 per share compared to adjusted net income of $2.4 billion or $5.70 per share in 2019. Fourth quarter and full year 2019 and 2020 adjusted results exclude items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables. 
The refining segment reported an operating loss of $377 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, and compared to operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the LIFO liquidation adjustment and other operating expenses, the fourth quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $476 million. Fourth quarter 2020 results were impacted by narrow crude oil differentials, lower product demand and lower prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.6 million barrels per day, which was lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to lower product demand. Throughput capacity utilization was 81% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.40 per barrel were in line with guidance but $0.47 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the effect of lower throughput rates. 
Operating income for the Renewable Diesel segment was $127 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive blenders tax credit in 2019, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Renewable Diesel sales volumes averaged 618,000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 226,000 gallons per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the effect of plant maintenance. The segment set annual records for sales volumes of 787,000 gallons per day and margin of $2.66 per gallon. 
Operating income for the Ethanol segment was $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ethanol production volumes averaged 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was 197,000 gallons per day lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease in operating income from the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher corn prices and lower ethanol prices. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, G&A expenses were $224 million and net interest expense was $153 million. G&A expenses in 2020 of $756 million were $112 million lower than 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $577 million and income tax benefit was $289 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annual effective tax rate was 45% for 2020, which was primarily the result of the carryback of our U.S. federal tax net operating loss to 2015, when the statutory tax rate was 35%. And we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately $1 billion in the second quarter of this year. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the unfavorable impact from the changes in working capital of $113 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $140 million; and adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $955 million for the full year. 
With regard to investing activities, we made $622 million of total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which $214 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance; and $408 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $458 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $2 billion for the full year. 
Moving to financing activities, we returned $400 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2020 through our dividend and $1.8 billion through dividends and buybacks in the year, resulting in a total 2020 payout ratio of 184% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. And our Board of Directors just approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share, demonstrating our sound financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors. 
With regard to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion. The debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 37%. And at the end of December, we had $5.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
Turning to guidance, we expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Almost half of our growth CapEx in 2021 is allocated to expanding our Renewable Diesel business. 
For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.49 million to 1.54 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 170,000 to 190,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.75 per barrel, which is impacted by lower throughput volumes due to plant maintenance activity. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 790,000 gallons per day in 2021. 
Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.7 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $155 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $575 million. For 2021, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate. 
That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. [Operator Instructions]"

I think on an absolute basis, but they look like they're going to the same range adjusted for demand for both gasoline and distillate, which is a good thing. Margins are near year ago levels in most U.S. markets, and we're starting to see feedstock differentials widen, too. 
So my question is, have you been surprised by the pace of the recovery that we've seen? Do you think there's reason to believe that it's sustainable? And either way, what's your overall view for the recovery in refined products market for 2021? What's your outlook at this point?"

But I mean, we've been pleased with the pace of the recovery so far. And frankly, I think you're going to see it accelerate as the vaccine rolls out more aggressively. That's kind of an obvious statement. But I think sometimes we do take it for granted. If we can really get the government functioning appropriately on the distribution, I think we're going to be in much better shape, perhaps quicker than we all realized. And we've got a member of our Board of Directors, who thinks that there's such pent-up demand certainly in the East Coast where he is and other parts of the country, that when we do get the vaccine rolled out and we get a herd immunity in place, you're going to see this look a little bit like the roaring '20s, and that's his point of view. And I would tend to agree with that. 
So with that, I'll let Gary and Lane provide a little more color specifically regarding the inventories and demand."

We built a significant surplus, especially early on in the pandemic. So seeing that surplus essentially gone and getting back into the 5-year average range is very encouraging. As you know, as demand starts to pick up, it will allow margins to recover much quicker. 
I think encouraging -- another encouraging sign is the fact, despite the fact that we've had a surge in COVID cases, gasoline demand for the DOE is still a little bit above 90% year-over-year where it was last year at this time. Our wholesale volumes are showing to be pretty close to that. And so the combination of reasonable gasoline demand and relatively low gasoline inventories has caused the front market to be a little stronger. I think one of the key things there is the stronger prop market has really flattened the curve on gasoline. And so it's taking away a lot of that incentive to store summer grade gasoline, and that certainly sets up for a stronger driving season in terms of gasoline margins. 
As Joe said, I think we view that we'll see gradual recovery. Second quarter, you'll start to see things pick up and then we expect things to be fairly normal by the third quarter, with the exception that we do see that there could be a lot of pent-up demand and people that are spending disposable income largely buying things that they're ordering are going to spend that disposable income getting out and on experiences, family vacations, which could cause a surge in gasoline demand. 
On the diesel side, as you kind of mentioned, diesel demand is really hung in there pretty strong. So DOE is showing over 98% year-over-year diesel demand. Actually, at the 7-day average in our system, we were at 111% year-over-year. So actually showing diesel demand growth in our system. I think some of that heating oil demand has been strong, a little bit colder winter this year, starting to see some drilling activity pick up, which, of course, helps diesel demand. And then, of course, with people spending disposable income ordering things, freight, on-road freight, trucking and rail has been strong as well. As we move throughout the year, we expect to see some incremental diesel demand coming from Ag as you start to plant crops. And then moving throughout the year, we also see that as jet demand begins to recover, it will lower diesel yields and help bring supply and demand into balance, which will set diesel up nicely longer term."

I think that's further supported by if you look at the high sulfur fuel oil forward curve, where high sulfur fuel have been trading around 90% of Brent.

Particularly outside of BTC, outside of the [ 4 RINS ], which I expect other people are going to ask about. But I'm curious about the LCFS market in California and some of the other provincial and regional opportunities that we've talked about. I wanted to get your thoughts, specifically in California. It seems like there's a lot competing sources of capital. This pandemic has progressed capital towards sort of emerging energy. And while they're small now, there's a possibility for a little bit more electrification, more renewable gas. The other competing sources for that credit or for diesel substitutes in California. 
I was just wondering, given the supply coming online with Port Arthur and your longer-term plans, how do you see that playing out in California? Is it fair to say that by the time DGD 3 is up online, there might be a more meaningful opportunity outside of the California LCFS? And how do you see the pace of that over the next few years? The other part of that also being, do you expect that California could reduce -- they could increase the emissions reduction target, which would just move the goalpost and create a greater opportunity? 
So there's a lot of pieces moving there, but the market's changed quite a bit since we were talking about this pre-COVID. So I just wanted to get an update on how you see those moving parts playing out?"

And then the renewable diesel is the largest carbon generator. You step outside California, I'll answer that part first. What we expect to happen in the next few years is the clean fuel standard to be in place in Canada by the end of 2022. That will bring incremental demand in 2023. We've also got legislation in New York State and Washington state for LCFS programs. We think those states will implement an LCFS over the next few years. Timing of that is hard or impossible to predict, but we expect that's going to happen. Today, we sell to California, but we also sell to Canada and Europe. So I mean, you're right, there's some electricity penetration, there's renewable natural gas, but still renewable diesel is the largest carbon credit generator. We don't expect that to change in the foreseeable future. 
And as far as the trucking, that's going to continue. Renewable diesel, obviously, is huge in that. California, if you look at their projections, they're heading for 2030, their internal projections are like a 40% blend rate for renewable diesel. We honestly think it might even be higher than that. So there's really -- there's no blend wall. There's nothing to stop this. So we're optimistic about demand in California, and we're optimistic about demand in other parts of the globe."

Can you talk about how you were able to achieve that? Is that sustainable? If there were any onetime factors that might have benefited the quarter? And going forward, as you think over the long-term about feedstock costs, just given the onslaught of projects that are under development, but to Manav's point now, even if not all of them will meet the time frame and capacity as originally planned, the absolute supply of renewable diesel will likely increase. And thus increasing competition for feedstocks. And as such, do you see a shift in the type of feedstocks versus what you're currently using?"

But as you noted, our EBITDA per gallon margins were flat quarter-on-quarter. If you look back in the past 3 years on renewable diesel, we've experienced wide swings and feedstock costs, RINs enterprises, [ D4 RINs ], ULSD prices, obviously, a huge swing there. However, our annual margins have been very consistent, ranging from $2.19 a gallon in 2018 as a low to a high of $2.37 a gallon in 2020. So you can see that the earnings power is there and consistent kind of regardless. And that's because the market works to compensate, [ PAT ] prices go up, the RIN goes up anyway. So it all kind of works in concert there. 
So long-term in the next foreseeable future, let's say, we're not concerned with sourcing feedstocks. We believe our margin history is a good indicator of what to expect over time. Any one quarter can be plus or minus, but over time, we feel good about this margin indicator. Then if you look to what happened with the soybean price, well, soybean price is driven by global supply and demand of veg oils. Palm oil prices were first to move up because production growth slowed in Indonesia and Malaysia, due to a drought and COVID-19, lack of labor to harvest the palm. Now you've got soybean production is pretty tight this year. I worry about a lower crop down in Brazil. Soybean oil production is going to be impacted. You've got the kind of the whole Ag commodity index moving up, so that's moving up soybean oil too. 
And then finally, veg oil pricing was low as compared to ULSD in 2018 and '19. So we expected some upward movement relative to ULSD in response to this, more vegetable oil be produced in response to higher prices. And we don't see a long-term sustainable shift in vegetable oil pricing relative to low [indiscernible] diesel."

And everyone takes that into consideration when they're looking at the long-term outlook for oil demand going forward. And we just need to continue to look at the facts and keep it in perspective. 
EV sales last year made up slightly less than 2% of domestic car sales, just around 4% globally. And I think if you look forward to developing countries, their focus is a whole lot less on climate change and EVs than it is in feeding their people and providing safe and affordable housing for them. So there's a lot going on politically, but the reality is that cleaner fuels are going to be part of the future, EVs will be part of the future. But it's far from the internal combustion engine, is far from being extinct. And so that's one thing that we have to all keep in mind, I think, as we go forward, we're still selling a tremendous amount of internal combustion engines that are more efficient. And our industry has done a fine job of working projects and adjusting operations to reduce the carbon intensity of the products that we're producing. 
And frankly, Valero, as you know, is doing a lot of that with the renewable diesel projects that we've undertaken. We're also doing it with carbon sequestration around our ethanol business. We're looking at hydrogen and so on. So anyway, there's a lot going on here, and I think we'll continue to see overall the carbon intensity of traditional fuels, liquid fuels go down. And honestly, you can tell from our IR deck that already, we're very competitive from a renewable diesel perspective with an EV. And I think you'll see that continue to increase. So I'll stop there.

And it's a lot more difficult than you think to do that. 
The other thing that I would really like to emphasize is our renewable diesel can drop in today. And on a life cycle basis, outperforms an equivalent diesel electric truck. So we can help the administration address this climate issue straight away is order did call for clean and zero-emission vehicles, and ours are certainly clean. The other thing I'd point out, even in that order, you have to read the fine print, it requires that it'd be made in America and meet the federal procurement standards. And I'm not sure there's a lot of electric vehicles that can meet those requirements, but our renewable diesel is 100% American made, and it's ready to go now. 
So we actually think that a lot of this will be, in the end, the economics are overwhelming for our products. And they're ready to go now. So we think we can work with the administration.

We're gating projects in that, that will also affect the carbon intensity of our transportation fuels. 
Some of which we've done, smaller ones, but we are certainly getting some larger ones that will make our transportation fuels.

The -- and that comes with [indiscernible] plus established rendering operations and everything else. So we feel good about that into the future. 
If you look in the U.S. is the place to be, the installed base of renewable diesel is still pretty small, especially the guys that are running the waste feedstock and pretreatment unit. And there's plenty of waste feedstuff just to procure. As you look further down the road, you get past 2025 out to 2030, we expect to see quite a bit of growth  in used cooking oil production and the animal [indiscernible] . And a lot of that's going to come from Asia at that point because that's where the population growth is. But historically, this waste feedstock growth has been pretty significant. And we expect that to continue. So line of sight up through DGD 2 and 3, we don't see a problem."

And second question that at some point, the pandemic will over, you will generate free cash again. And at that point, when we're looking at your financial strategy, you have add several billion-dollar debt for this pandemic. We assume that you're going to first trying to pay it down. But after the pandemic, if we're looking forward, will the company take a more conservative approach and even drive down the debt ratio much below the pandemic level?"

So we do export out of Pembroke, we bring fuels to Canada when we need them out of Pembroke and so on. 
And so it's one thing for politicians to come out and lay down a hard line and say that they're going to do something. But there's human beings in that country as there are in our country, who have purchased internal combustion engine vehicles, and they have an opportunity to weigh in on these issues and these decisions going forward. So Paul, I think we all get very concerned when we hear these things. But if you just go back historically and look at how things play out, they don't always turn out exactly the way that we fear, okay? It's usually never as bad as we think and never as good as we think. And I think that's certainly the case here. But we have a clear focus on Pembroke.

However, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we were down about 10%. The mobility data we see in Mexico is mobility was down about 20%. So still indicates we're continuing to gain market share, but we did see a big hit in mobility in Mexico, and we saw that reflected in our volumes. 
Moving forward, I mean, our -- we anticipate that the inland terminals associated with the Veracruz Marine terminal, probably come online early second quarter, one at [ Pueblo ] and one in Mexico City. And that's really where you'll start to see our volumes ramp up as those inland terminals come on. Our goal is to get to about 80,000 barrels a day in that central system.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe. The energy business was among those confronted by unprecedented demand contraction, which began in the first quarter of 2020 as COVID-19 cases accelerated globally, resulting in an increase in crude oil and product inventories to record high levels.  
In response, we lowered our refinery utilization rates to more closely match product supply with demand. And as the pandemic-related restrictions were eased in some regions and mobility increased, product demand increased substantially, steadily reducing crude oil and product inventories. We ended the year with U.S. crude oil and product inventories within the normal 5-year inventory band.  
Throughout the pandemic, our team has been thorough and decisive in its operational and financial response, while maintaining focus on safety and reliability. In fact, we set several operational records in 2020, recording our best ever year on employee safety performance, achieving the milestone 2 years in a row and the best ever year for process safety and environmental performance. In applying our refining expertise to optimize our renewable diesel segment, we set records for sales volumes and margin in 2020.  
We also made significant progress on our international strategy to expand our product supply chain into higher-growth markets, with the start of waterborne product shipments to our new Veracruz terminal, making Valero one of the largest fuel importers into Mexico. On the financial side, we improved our liquidity by raising $4 billion of debt at attractive rates, and we reduced our capital budget by over $500 million while keeping our high-return projects moving forward. And in spite of all the challenges this past year, we continue to honor our commitment to our shareholders by maintaining the dividend and ending the year with $3.3 billion of cash and $9.2 billion of total available liquidity.  
Despite the pandemic-imposed challenges and several hurricanes, we completed and continued to make progress on several strategic growth projects, including the St. Charles Alkylation Unit, which was brought online in the fourth quarter, on schedule and under budget. The project further increases the competitiveness of the St. Charles refinery and is a testament to the talent and efforts of the refining organization.  
The Pembroke Cogen project and the Diamond Pipeline expansion are on track to be completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion project at St. Charles, which we refer to as DGD 2, is designed to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of continuous process improvement and optimization, the capacity of the existing St. Charles renewable diesel plant, DGD 1, has increased from 275 million gallons per year to 290 million gallons per year. With the completion of DGD 2, the total capacity at St. Charles is expected to be 690 million gallons per year.  
In 2020, we laid out our comprehensive road map to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2025. As part of this goal, we continue to reinvest capital into higher growth, higher return, low carbon renewable fuels projects. To that end, we are pleased to announce that the Board has approved DGD 3, a new 470 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas refinery. We're moving forward with the project immediately, and we now expect the new plant to be operational in the second half of 2023. Once DGD 3 is completed, DGD's combined annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha.  
Looking ahead, we expect to see continued improvement in refining margins as COVID-19 vaccines are widely distributed in the coming months, allowing people and businesses to get back to normalcy. We're already seeing encouraging signs with strong diesel demand and with U.S. total light product inventories now in the normal range. In addition, many uncompetitive refineries around the world announced shutdowns or conversions in 2020, and we expect further capacity rationalizations to be announced this year.  
In closing, we remain steadfast in the execution of our strategy, pursuing excellence in operations, investing for earnings growth with lower volatility and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. We expect low-carbon fuel policies to continue to expand globally and drive demand for renewable fuels. And with that view, we're leveraging our global liquid fuels platform and expertise that comes with being the largest renewable diesel producer in North America to steadily expand our competitive advantage in economic low-carbon projects for a higher return on invested capital.  
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

For the fourth quarter of 2020, we incurred a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $359 million or $0.88 per share compared to net income of $1.1 billion or $2.58 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The  fourth quarter 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $429 million or $1.06 per share compared to adjusted net income of $873 million or $2.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019.  
For 2020, the net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.4 billion or $3.50 per share compared to net income of $2.4 billion or $5.84 per share in 2019. The 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.3 billion or $3.12 per share compared to adjusted net income of $2.4 billion or $5.70 per share in 2019.  
Fourth quarter and full year 2019 and 2020 adjusted results exclude items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables.  
The refining segment reported an operating loss of $377 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the LIFO liquidation adjustment and other operating expenses, the fourth quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $476 million. Fourth quarter 2020 results were impacted by narrow crude oil differentials, lower product demand and lower prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.6 million barrels per day, which was lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to lower product demand. Throughput capacity utilization was 81% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.40 per barrel were in line with guidance but $0.47 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the effect of lower throughput rates.  
Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $127 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive Blender’s Tax Credit in 2019, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 618,000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 226,000 gallons per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the effect of planned maintenance. The segment set annual records for sales volumes of 787,000 gallons per day and margin of $2.66 per gallon.  
Operating income for the ethanol segment was $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ethanol production volumes averaged 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was 197,000 gallons per day lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease in operating income from the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher corn prices and lower ethanol prices. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, G&A expenses were $224 million and net interest expense was $153 million. G&A expenses in 2020 of $756 million were $112 million lower than 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $577 million and income tax benefit was $289 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annual effective tax rate was 45% for 2020, which was primarily the result of the carryback of our U.S. federal tax net operating loss to 2015, when the statutory tax rate was 35%. And we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately $1 billion in the second quarter of this year.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the unfavorable impact from the changes in working capital of $113 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $140 million. And adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $955 million for the full year.  
With regard to investing activities, we made $622 million of total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which $214 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance; and $408 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $458 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $2 billion for the full year. 
Moving to financing activities, we returned $400 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2020 through our dividend and $1.8 billion through dividends and buybacks in the year, resulting in a total 2020 payout ratio of 184% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. And our Board of Directors just approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share, demonstrating our sound financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors. 
With regard to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 37%. And at the end of December, we had $5.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Almost half of our growth CapEx in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. 
For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.49 million to 1.54 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 170,000 to 190,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.75 per barrel, which is impacted by lower throughput volumes due to planned maintenance activity. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 790,000 gallons per day in 2021. 
Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.7 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $155 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $575 million. For 2021, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate.

But they look like they're going to the same range adjusted for demand for both gasoline and distillate, which is a good thing. Margins are near year ago levels in most U.S. markets, and we're starting to see feedstock differentials widen, too. 
So my question is, have you been surprised by the pace of the recovery that we've seen? Do you think there's reason to believe that it's sustainable? And either way, what's your overall view for the recovery in refined products market for 2021? What's your outlook at this point?"

That's kind of an obvious statement. But I think sometimes, we do take it for granted. If we can really get the government functioning appropriately on the distribution, I think we're going to be in much better shape, perhaps quicker than we all realized. And we've got a member of our Board of Directors who thinks that there's such pent-up demand certainly in the East Coast where he is and other parts of the country that when we do get the vaccine rolled out and we get a herd immunity in place, you're going to see this look a little bit like the roaring '20s, and that's his point of view. And I would tend to agree with that. 
So with that, I'll let Gary and Lane provide a little more color specifically regarding the inventories and demand."

Certainly, getting total light product inventory, we built a significant surplus, especially early on in the pandemic. So seeing that surplus essentially gone and getting back into the 5-year average range is very encouraging. As you know, as demand starts to pick up, it will allow margins to recover much quicker. 
I think encouraging -- another encouraging sign is the fact, despite the fact that we've had a surge in COVID cases, gasoline demand per the DOEs is still a little bit above 90% year-over-year where it was last year at this time. Our wholesale volumes are showing to be pretty close to that. And so the combination of reasonable gasoline demand and relatively low gasoline inventories has caused the prop market to be a little stronger. I think one of the key things there is the stronger prop market has really flattened the curve on gasoline. And so it's taking away a lot of that incentive to store summer-grade gasoline, and that certainly sets up for a stronger driving season in terms of gasoline margins. 
As Joe said, I think we view that we'll see gradual recovery. Second quarter, you'll start to see things pick up and then we expect things to be fairly normal by the third quarter, with the exception that we do see that there could be a lot of pent-up demand and people that are spending disposable income largely buying things that they're ordering are going to spend that disposable income getting out and on experiences, family vacations, which could cause a surge in gasoline demand. 
On the diesel side, as you kind of mentioned, diesel demand has really hung in there pretty strong. So the OEs are showing over 98% year-over-year diesel demand. Actually, at the 7-day average on our system, we were at 111% year-over-year, so actually showing diesel demand growth in our system. I think some of that heating oil demand has been strong, a little bit colder winter this year, starting to see some drilling activity pick up, which, of course, helps diesel demand. And then, of course, with people spending disposable income ordering things, freight, on-road freight, trucking and rail has been strong as well. As we move throughout the year, we expect to see some incremental diesel demand coming from ag as you start to plant crops. And then moving throughout the year, we also see that as jet demand begins to recover, it will lower diesel yields and help bring supply and demand into balance, which will set diesel up nicely longer term."

I think that's further supported by if you look at the high-sulfur fuel oil forward curve, where high-sulfur fuel have been trading around 90% of Brent, you look to the back half of the year, and it gets more to 80% of Brent, which is more indicative that we'll see those quality differentials widen out again, kind of the second half of the year."

But I'm curious about the LCFS market in California and some of the other provincial and regional opportunities that we've talked about. I wanted to get your thoughts, specifically in California. It seems like there's a lot of competing sources of capital. This pandemic has progressed capital towards sort of emerging energy. And while they're small now, there's a possibility for a little bit more electrification, more renewable gas, other competing sources for that credit or for diesel substitutes in California. 
I was just wondering, given the supply coming online with Port Arthur and your longer-term plans, how do you see that playing out in California? Is it fair to say that by the time DGD 3 is up online, there might be a more meaningful opportunity outside of the California LCFS? And how do you see the pace of that over the next few years? The other part of that also being, do you expect that California could reduce -- they could increase the emissions reduction target, which would just move the goalpost and create a greater opportunity?

And then the renewable diesel is the largest carbon generator. You step outside California, I'll answer that part first. What we expect to happen in the next few years is the clean fuel standard to be in place in Canada by the end of 2022. That will bring incremental demand in 2023. We've also got legislation in New York State and Washington State for LCFS programs. And we think those states will implement an LCFS over the next few years. Timing of that is hard or impossible to predict, but we expect that's going to happen. Today, we sell to California, but we also sell to Canada and Europe. So I mean, you're right, there's some electricity penetration, there's renewable natural gas. But still, renewable diesel is the largest carbon credit generator. We don't expect that to change in the foreseeable future. 
And as far as the trucking, that's going to continue. Renewable diesel, obviously, is huge in that. California, if you look at their projections, they're heading for -- in 2030, their internal projections are like a 40% blend rate for renewable diesel. We honestly think it might even be higher than that. So there's really -- there's no blend wall. There's nothing to stop this. So we're optimistic about demand in California, and we're optimistic about demand in other parts of the globe."

Can you talk about how you were able to achieve that? Is that sustainable? If there were any onetime factors that might have benefited the quarter? And going forward, as you think over the long-term about feedstock costs, just given the onslaught of projects that are under development, but to Manav's point now, even if not all of them will meet the time frame and capacity as originally planned, the absolute supply of renewable diesel will likely increase. And thus increasing competition for feedstocks. And as such, do you see a shift in the type of feedstocks versus what you're currently using?"

But as you noted, our EBITDA per gallon margins were flat quarter-on-quarter. If you look back in the past 3 years on renewable diesel, we've experienced wide swings in feedstock costs, RINs prices, D4 RINs, ULSD prices, obviously, a huge swing there. However, our annual margins have been very consistent, ranging from $2.19 a gallon in 2018 as a low to a high of $2.37 a gallon in 2020. So you can see that the earnings power is there and consistent kind of regardless. And that's because the market works to compensate. If that prices go up, the RIN goes up anyway. So it all kind of works in concert there. 
So long-term in the next foreseeable future, let's say, we're not concerned with sourcing feedstocks. We believe our margin history is a good indicator of what to expect over time. Any one quarter can be plus or minus, but over time, we feel good about this margin indicator. Then if you look to what happened with the soybean price, well, soybean price is driven by global supply and demand of veg oils. Palm oil prices were first to move up because production growth slowed in Indonesia and Malaysia due to a drought and COVID-19, a lack of labor to harvest the palm. Now you've got soybean production is pretty tight this year. So I worry about a lower crop down in Brazil. Soybean oil production is going to be impacted. You've got the kind of the whole ag commodity index moving up, so that's moving up soybean oil too. 
And then finally, veg oil pricing was low as compared to ULSD in 2018 and '19. So we expected some upward movement relative to ULSD. In response to this, more vegetable oil will be produced in response to higher prices. And we don't see a long-term sustainable shift in vegetable oil pricing relative to low-sulfur diesel."

But I mean, we have seen -- and we've seen it for sometime now. The headlines are all focused on EVs, right? And everyone takes that into consideration when they're looking at the long-term outlook for oil demand going forward. And we just need to continue to look at the facts and keep it in perspective. 
EV sales last year made up slightly less than 2% of domestic car sales and just around 4% globally. And I think if you look forward to developing countries, their focus is a whole lot less on climate change and EVs than it is in feeding their people and providing safe and affordable housing for them. So there's a lot going on politically, but the reality is that cleaner fuels are going to be part of the future, EVs will be part of the future. But it's far from -- the internal combustion engine is far from being extinct. And so that's one thing that we have to all keep in mind, I think, as we go forward. We're still selling a tremendous amount of internal combustion engines that are more efficient. And our industry has done a fine job of working projects and adjusting operations to reduce the carbon intensity of the products that we're producing. 
And frankly, Valero, as you know, is doing a lot of that with the renewable diesel projects that we've undertaken. We're also doing it with carbon sequestration around our ethanol business. We're looking at hydrogen and so on. So anyway, there's a lot going on here, and I think we'll continue to see overall the carbon intensity of traditional fuels, liquid fuels go down. And honestly, you can tell from our IR deck that already, we're very competitive from a renewable diesel perspective with an EV. And I think you'll see that continue to increase. So I'll stop there.

And we didn't see a lot of movement in the federal fleet to EVs under that order. And it's a lot more difficult than you think to do that. 
The other thing that I would really like to emphasize is our renewable diesel can drop in today and, on a life cycle basis, outperforms an equivalent diesel electric truck. So we can help the administration address this climate issue straight away. This order did call for clean and zero-emission vehicles, and ours are certainly clean. The other thing I'd point out, even in that order, you have to read the fine print. It requires that it be made in America and meet the federal procurement standards. And I'm not sure there's a lot of electric vehicles that can meet those requirements, but our renewable diesel is 100% American made, and it's ready to go now. 
So we actually think that a lot of this will be, in the end, the economics are overwhelming for our products. And they're ready to go now. So we think we can work with the administration.

We're gating projects in that, that will also affect the carbon intensity of our transportation fuels. 
Some of which we've done, smaller ones, but we are certainly getting some larger ones that will make our transportation fuels. Depending on what market we can target them in, we'll obviously be helped with the overall -- our competitiveness from a carbon intensity perspective will help us.

Relative to Pembroke -- and Lane, you can chime in on this too, and Rich Walsh. But when you look at Pembroke, it supplies domestic demands within the U.K., and it also supplies Ireland and other countries. So we do export out of Pembroke. We bring fuels to Canada when we need them out of Pembroke and so on. 
And so it's one thing for politicians to come out and lay down a hard line and say that they're going to do something. But there's human beings in that country as there are in our country who have purchased internal combustion engine vehicles, and they have an opportunity to weigh in on these issues and these decisions going forward. So Paul, I think we all get very concerned when we hear these things. But if you just go back historically and look at how things play out, they don't always turn out exactly the way that we fear, okay? It's usually never as bad as we think and never as good as we think. And I think that's certainly the case here. But we have a clear focus on Pembroke. And Lane and his team are working on different options and different projects that are going to continue to make that a more efficient operation.

Overall, our volumes for the quarter in Mexico were a little over 40,000 barrels a day. That's an increase of about -- year-over-year, 145%. So good growth in the country. However, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we were down about 10%. The mobility data we see in Mexico is mobility was down about 20%. So still indicates we're continuing to gain market share, but we did see a big hit in mobility in Mexico, and we saw that reflected in our volumes. 
Moving forward, I mean, our -- we anticipate that the inland terminals associated with the Veracruz marine terminal probably come online early second quarter, one at Puebla and one in Mexico City. And that's really where you'll start to see our volumes ramp up as those inland terminals come on. Our goal is to get to about 80,000 barrels a day in that central system. The other thing that the Veracruz terminal does is it takes a lot of cost out of our supply chain.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe. The energy business was among those confronted by unprecedented demand contraction, which began in t",799,"Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe. The energy business was among those confronted by unprecedented demand contraction, which began in the first quarter of 2020 as COVID-19 cases accelerated globally, resulting in an increase in crude oil and product inventories to record high levels.  
In response, we lowered our refinery utilization rates to more closely match product supply with demand. And as the pandemic-related restrictions were eased in some regions and mobility increased, product demand increased substantially, steadily reducing crude oil and product inventories. We ended the year with U.S. crude oil and product inventories within the normal 5-year inventory band.  
Throughout the pandemic, our team has been thorough and decisive in its operational and financial response, while maintaining focus on safety and reliability. In fact, we set several operational records in 2020, recording our best ever year on employee safety performance, achieving the milestone 2 years in a row and the best ever year for process safety and environmental performance. In applying our refining expertise to optimize our renewable diesel segment, we set records for sales volumes and margin in 2020.  
We also made significant progress on our international strategy to expand our product supply chain into higher-growth markets, with the start of waterborne product shipments to our new Veracruz terminal, making Valero one of the largest fuel importers into Mexico. On the financial side, we improved our liquidity by raising $4 billion of debt at attractive rates, and we reduced our capital budget by over $500 million while keeping our high-return projects moving forward. And in spite of all the challenges this past year, we continue to honor our commitment to our shareholders by maintaining the dividend and ending the year with $3.3 billion of cash and $9.2 billion of total available liquidity.  
Despite the pandemic-imposed challenges and several hurricanes, we completed and continued to make progress on several strategic growth projects, including the St. Charles Alkylation Unit, which was brought online in the fourth quarter, on schedule and under budget. The project further increases the competitiveness of the St. Charles refinery and is a testament to the talent and efforts of the refining organization.  
The Pembroke Cogen project and the Diamond Pipeline expansion are on track to be completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion project at St. Charles, which we refer to as DGD 2, is designed to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of continuous process improvement and optimization, the capacity of the existing St. Charles renewable diesel plant, DGD 1, has increased from 275 million gallons per year to 290 million gallons per year. With the completion of DGD 2, the total capacity at St. Charles is expected to be 690 million gallons per year.  
In 2020, we laid out our comprehensive road map to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2025. As part of this goal, we continue to reinvest capital into higher growth, higher return, low carbon renewable fuels projects. To that end, we are pleased to announce that the Board has approved DGD 3, a new 470 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas refinery. We're moving forward with the project immediately, and we now expect the new plant to be operational in the second half of 2023. Once DGD 3 is completed, DGD's combined annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha.  
Looking ahead, we expect to see continued improvement in refining margins as COVID-19 vaccines are widely distributed in the coming months, allowing people and businesses to get back to normalcy. We're already seeing encouraging signs with strong diesel demand and with U.S. total light product inventories now in the normal range. In addition, many uncompetitive refineries around the world announced shutdowns or conversions in 2020, and we expect further capacity rationalizations to be announced this year.  
In closing, we remain steadfast in the execution of our strategy, pursuing excellence in operations, investing for earnings growth with lower volatility and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. We expect low-carbon fuel policies to continue to expand globally and drive demand for renewable fuels. And with that view, we're leveraging our global liquid fuels platform and expertise that comes with being the largest renewable diesel producer in North America to steadily expand our competitive advantage in economic low-carbon projects for a higher return on invested capital.  
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

Fourth quarter and full year 2019 and 2020 adjusted results exclude items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables.  
The refining segment reported an operating loss of $377 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the LIFO liquidation adjustment and other operating expenses, the fourth quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $476 million. Fourth quarter 2020 results were impacted by narrow crude oil differentials, lower product demand and lower prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.6 million barrels per day, which was lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to lower product demand. Throughput capacity utilization was 81% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.40 per barrel were in line with guidance but $0.47 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the effect of lower throughput rates.  
Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $127 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive Blender’s Tax Credit in 2019, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 618,000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 226,000 gallons per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the effect of planned maintenance. The segment set annual records for sales volumes of 787,000 gallons per day and margin of $2.66 per gallon.  
Operating income for the ethanol segment was $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ethanol production volumes averaged 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was 197,000 gallons per day lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease in operating income from the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher corn prices and lower ethanol prices. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, G&A expenses were $224 million and net interest expense was $153 million. G&A expenses in 2020 of $756 million were $112 million lower than 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $577 million and income tax benefit was $289 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annual effective tax rate was 45% for 2020, which was primarily the result of the carryback of our U.S. federal tax net operating loss to 2015, when the statutory tax rate was 35%. And we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately $1 billion in the second quarter of this year.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the unfavorable impact from the changes in working capital of $113 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $140 million. And adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $955 million for the full year.  
With regard to investing activities, we made $622 million of total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which $214 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance; and $408 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $458 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $2 billion for the full year. 
Moving to financing activities, we returned $400 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2020 through our dividend and $1.8 billion through dividends and buybacks in the year, resulting in a total 2020 payout ratio of 184% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. And our Board of Directors just approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share, demonstrating our sound financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors. 
With regard to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 37%. And at the end of December, we had $5.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Almost half of our growth CapEx in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. 
For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.49 million to 1.54 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 170,000 to 190,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.75 per barrel, which is impacted by lower throughput volumes due to planned maintenance activity. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 790,000 gallons per day in 2021. 
Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.7 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $155 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $575 million. For 2021, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate.

But they look like they're going to the same range adjusted for demand for both gasoline and distillate, which is a good thing. Margins are near year ago levels in most U.S. markets, and we're starting to see feedstock differentials widen, too. 
So my question is, have you been surprised by the pace of the recovery that we've seen? Do you think there's reason to believe that it's sustainable? And either way, what's your overall view for the recovery in refined products market for 2021? What's your outlook at this point?"

That's kind of an obvious statement. But I think sometimes, we do take it for granted. If we can really get the government functioning appropriately on the distribution, I think we're going to be in much better shape, perhaps quicker than we all realized. And we've got a member of our Board of Directors who thinks that there's such pent-up demand certainly in the East Coast where he is and other parts of the country that when we do get the vaccine rolled out and we get a herd immunity in place, you're going to see this look a little bit like the roaring '20s, and that's his point of view. And I would tend to agree with that. 
So with that, I'll let Gary and Lane provide a little more color specifically regarding the inventories and demand."

Certainly, getting total light product inventory, we built a significant surplus, especially early on in the pandemic. So seeing that surplus essentially gone and getting back into the 5-year average range is very encouraging. As you know, as demand starts to pick up, it will allow margins to recover much quicker. 
I think encouraging -- another encouraging sign is the fact, despite the fact that we've had a surge in COVID cases, gasoline demand per the DOEs is still a little bit above 90% year-over-year where it was last year at this time. Our wholesale volumes are showing to be pretty close to that. And so the combination of reasonable gasoline demand and relatively low gasoline inventories has caused the prop market to be a little stronger. I think one of the key things there is the stronger prop market has really flattened the curve on gasoline. And so it's taking away a lot of that incentive to store summer-grade gasoline, and that certainly sets up for a stronger driving season in terms of gasoline margins. 
As Joe said, I think we view that we'll see gradual recovery. Second quarter, you'll start to see things pick up and then we expect things to be fairly normal by the third quarter, with the exception that we do see that there could be a lot of pent-up demand and people that are spending disposable income largely buying things that they're ordering are going to spend that disposable income getting out and on experiences, family vacations, which could cause a surge in gasoline demand. 
On the diesel side, as you kind of mentioned, diesel demand has really hung in there pretty strong. So the OEs are showing over 98% year-over-year diesel demand. Actually, at the 7-day average on our system, we were at 111% year-over-year, so actually showing diesel demand growth in our system. I think some of that heating oil demand has been strong, a little bit colder winter this year, starting to see some drilling activity pick up, which, of course, helps diesel demand. And then, of course, with people spending disposable income ordering things, freight, on-road freight, trucking and rail has been strong as well. As we move throughout the year, we expect to see some incremental diesel demand coming from ag as you start to plant crops. And then moving throughout the year, we also see that as jet demand begins to recover, it will lower diesel yields and help bring supply and demand into balance, which will set diesel up nicely longer term."

I think that's further supported by if you look at the high-sulfur fuel oil forward curve, where high-sulfur fuel have been trading around 90% of Brent, you look to the back half of the year, and it gets more to 80% of Brent, which is more indicative that we'll see those quality differentials widen out again, kind of the second half of the year."

But I'm curious about the LCFS market in California and some of the other provincial and regional opportunities that we've talked about. I wanted to get your thoughts, specifically in California. It seems like there's a lot of competing sources of capital. This pandemic has progressed capital towards sort of emerging energy. And while they're small now, there's a possibility for a little bit more electrification, more renewable gas, other competing sources for that credit or for diesel substitutes in California. 
I was just wondering, given the supply coming online with Port Arthur and your longer-term plans, how do you see that playing out in California? Is it fair to say that by the time DGD 3 is up online, there might be a more meaningful opportunity outside of the California LCFS? And how do you see the pace of that over the next few years? The other part of that also being, do you expect that California could reduce -- they could increase the emissions reduction target, which would just move the goalpost and create a greater opportunity?

And then the renewable diesel is the largest carbon generator. You step outside California, I'll answer that part first. What we expect to happen in the next few years is the clean fuel standard to be in place in Canada by the end of 2022. That will bring incremental demand in 2023. We've also got legislation in New York State and Washington State for LCFS programs. And we think those states will implement an LCFS over the next few years. Timing of that is hard or impossible to predict, but we expect that's going to happen. Today, we sell to California, but we also sell to Canada and Europe. So I mean, you're right, there's some electricity penetration, there's renewable natural gas. But still, renewable diesel is the largest carbon credit generator. We don't expect that to change in the foreseeable future. 
And as far as the trucking, that's going to continue. Renewable diesel, obviously, is huge in that. California, if you look at their projections, they're heading for -- in 2030, their internal projections are like a 40% blend rate for renewable diesel. We honestly think it might even be higher than that. So there's really -- there's no blend wall. There's nothing to stop this. So we're optimistic about demand in California, and we're optimistic about demand in other parts of the globe."

So in terms of feedstocks, in a quarter where feedstock costs seem to have risen sharply and with planned maintenance at the facility, your capture was still very high. Can you talk about how you were able to achieve that? Is that sustainable? If there were any onetime factors that might have benefited the quarter? And going forward, as you think over the long-term about feedstock costs, just given the onslaught of projects that are under development, but to Manav's point now, even if not all of them will meet the time frame and capacity as originally planned, the absolute supply of renewable diesel will likely increase. And thus increasing competition for feedstocks. And as such, do you see a shift in the type of feedstocks versus what you're currently using?"

But as you noted, our EBITDA per gallon margins were flat quarter-on-quarter. If you look back in the past 3 years on renewable diesel, we've experienced wide swings in feedstock costs, RINs prices, D4 RINs, ULSD prices, obviously, a huge swing there. However, our annual margins have been very consistent, ranging from $2.19 a gallon in 2018 as a low to a high of $2.37 a gallon in 2020. So you can see that the earnings power is there and consistent kind of regardless. And that's because the market works to compensate. If that prices go up, the RIN goes up anyway. So it all kind of works in concert there. 
So long-term in the next foreseeable future, let's say, we're not concerned with sourcing feedstocks. We believe our margin history is a good indicator of what to expect over time. Any one quarter can be plus or minus, but over time, we feel good about this margin indicator. Then if you look to what happened with the soybean price, well, soybean price is driven by global supply and demand of veg oils. Palm oil prices were first to move up because production growth slowed in Indonesia and Malaysia due to a drought and COVID-19, a lack of labor to harvest the palm. Now you've got soybean production is pretty tight this year. So I worry about a lower crop down in Brazil. Soybean oil production is going to be impacted. You've got the kind of the whole ag commodity index moving up, so that's moving up soybean oil too. 
And then finally, veg oil pricing was low as compared to ULSD in 2018 and '19. So we expected some upward movement relative to ULSD. In response to this, more vegetable oil will be produced in response to higher prices. And we don't see a long-term sustainable shift in vegetable oil pricing relative to low-sulfur diesel."

But I mean, we have seen -- and we've seen it for some time now. The headlines are all focused on EVs, right? And everyone takes that into consideration when they're looking at the long-term outlook for oil demand going forward. And we just need to continue to look at the facts and keep it in perspective. 
EV sales last year made up slightly less than 2% of domestic car sales and just around 4% globally. And I think if you look forward to developing countries, their focus is a whole lot less on climate change and EVs than it is in feeding their people and providing safe and affordable housing for them. So there's a lot going on politically, but the reality is that cleaner fuels are going to be part of the future, EVs will be part of the future. But it's far from -- the internal combustion engine is far from being extinct. And so that's one thing that we have to all keep in mind, I think, as we go forward. We're still selling a tremendous amount of internal combustion engines that are more efficient. And our industry has done a fine job of working projects and adjusting operations to reduce the carbon intensity of the products that we're producing. 
And frankly, Valero, as you know, is doing a lot of that with the renewable diesel projects that we've undertaken. We're also doing it with carbon sequestration around our ethanol business. We're looking at hydrogen and so on. So anyway, there's a lot going on here, and I think we'll continue to see overall the carbon intensity of traditional fuels, liquid fuels go down. And honestly, you can tell from our IR deck that already, we're very competitive from a renewable diesel perspective with an EV. And I think you'll see that continue to increase. So I'll stop there. Rich, on the policy side?"

And we didn't see a lot of movement in the federal fleet to EVs under that order. And it's a lot more difficult than you think to do that. 
The other thing that I would really like to emphasize is our renewable diesel can drop in today and, on a life cycle basis, outperforms an equivalent diesel electric truck. So we can help the administration address this climate issue straight away. This order did call for clean and zero-emission vehicles, and ours are certainly clean. The other thing I'd point out, even in that order, you have to read the fine print. It requires that it be made in America and meet the federal procurement standards. And I'm not sure there's a lot of electric vehicles that can meet those requirements, but our renewable diesel is 100% American made, and it's ready to go now. 
So we actually think that a lot of this will be, in the end, the economics are overwhelming for our products. And they're ready to go now. So we think we can work with the administration.

So it's a good place for us to really start and develop projects. The other way that we can do this is with our blue and green hydrogen. We're gating projects in that, that will also affect the carbon intensity of our transportation fuels. 
Some of which we've done, smaller ones, but we are certainly getting some larger ones that will make our transportation fuels. Depending on what market we can target them in, we'll obviously be helped with the overall -- our competitiveness from a carbon intensity perspective will help us. So those are all -- those are the things that we're looking at. But I think, again, we're trying to hit from a carbon sequestration perspective, we're trying to hit the streams that we see that are lower in carbon dioxide on that gas and maybe just in that, when something has been combusted, it has a lot of other stuff in it like basically nitrogen and some other things."

I think if we look at trade flow though, where the closures -- you could look for the closures going forward is primarily Europe, particularly Southern Europe. It has -- they don't really have access to an advantaged crude. They're more aggressive on -- with respect to their transition away from transportation fossil fuels.

And there's plenty of waste feedstock just to procure. As you look further down the road, you get past 2025 out to 2030, we expect to see quite a bit of growth in used cooking oil production and then the animal rendering.

We have both gasoline and diesel and tankage in Veracruz today. We're still doing some commissioning activity. So we expect to have the truck rack operational in the next couple of weeks. Overall, our volumes for the quarter in Mexico were a little over 40,000 barrels a day. That's an increase of about -- year-over-year, 145%. So good growth in the country. However, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we were down about 10%. The mobility data we see in Mexico is mobility was down about 20%. So still indicates we're continuing to gain market share, but we did see a big hit in mobility in Mexico, and we saw that reflected in our volumes. 
Moving forward, I mean, our -- we anticipate that the inland terminals associated with the Veracruz marine terminal probably come online early second quarter, one at Puebla and one in Mexico City. And that's really where you'll start to see our volumes ramp up as those inland terminals come on. Our goal is to get to about 80,000 barrels a day in that central system. The other thing that the Veracruz terminal does is it takes a lot of cost out of our supply chain. So in addition to the ramp-up in volumes, we would also expect to see wider margins on the volume that we're selling in country."

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe. The energy business was among those confronted by unprecedented demand contraction, which began in the first quarter of 2020 as COVID-19 cases accelerated globally, resulting in an increase in crude oil and product inventories to record high levels.  
In response, we lowered our refinery utilization rates to more closely match product supply with demand. And as the pandemic-related restrictions were eased in some regions and mobility increased, product demand increased substantially, steadily reducing crude oil and product inventories. We ended the year with U.S. crude oil and product inventories within the normal 5-year inventory band.  
Throughout the pandemic, our team has been thorough and decisive in its operational and financial response, while maintaining focus on safety and reliability. In fact, we set several operational records in 2020, recording our best ever year on employee safety performance, achieving the milestone 2 years in a row and the best ever year for process safety and environmental performance. In applying our refining expertise to optimize our renewable diesel segment, we set records for sales volumes and margin in 2020.  
We also made significant progress on our international strategy to expand our product supply chain into higher-growth markets, with the start of waterborne product shipments to our new Veracruz terminal, making Valero one of the largest fuel importers into Mexico. On the financial side, we improved our liquidity by raising $4 billion of debt at attractive rates, and we reduced our capital budget by over $500 million while keeping our high-return projects moving forward. And in spite of all the challenges this past year, we continue to honor our commitment to our shareholders by maintaining the dividend and ending the year with $3.3 billion of cash and $9.2 billion of total available liquidity.  
Despite the pandemic-imposed challenges and several hurricanes, we completed and continued to make progress on several strategic growth projects, including the St. Charles Alkylation Unit, which was brought online in the fourth quarter, on schedule and under budget. The project further increases the competitiveness of the St. Charles refinery and is a testament to the talent and efforts of the refining organization.  
The Pembroke Cogen project and the Diamond Pipeline expansion are on track to be completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion project at St. Charles, which we refer to as DGD 2, is designed to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result of continuous process improvement and optimization, the capacity of the existing St. Charles renewable diesel plant, DGD 1, has increased from 275 million gallons per year to 290 million gallons per year. With the completion of DGD 2, the total capacity at St. Charles is expected to be 690 million gallons per year.  
In 2020, we laid out our comprehensive road map to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 63% by 2025. As part of this goal, we continue to reinvest capital into higher growth, higher return, low carbon renewable fuels projects. To that end, we are pleased to announce that the Board has approved DGD 3, a new 470 million gallons per year renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas refinery. We're moving forward with the project immediately, and we now expect the new plant to be operational in the second half of 2023. Once DGD 3 is completed, DGD's combined annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha.  
Looking ahead, we expect to see continued improvement in refining margins as COVID-19 vaccines are widely distributed in the coming months, allowing people and businesses to get back to normalcy. We're already seeing encouraging signs with strong diesel demand and with U.S. total light product inventories now in the normal range. In addition, many uncompetitive refineries around the world announced shutdowns or conversions in 2020, and we expect further capacity rationalizations to be announced this year.  
In closing, we remain steadfast in the execution of our strategy, pursuing excellence in operations, investing for earnings growth with lower volatility and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. We expect low-carbon fuel policies to continue to expand globally and drive demand for renewable fuels. And with that view, we're leveraging our global liquid fuels platform and expertise that comes with being the largest renewable diesel producer in North America to steadily expand our competitive advantage in economic low-carbon projects for a higher return on invested capital.  
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

For the fourth quarter of 2020, we incurred a net loss attributable to Valero stockholders of $359 million or $0.88 per share compared to net income of $1.1 billion or $2.58 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. The  fourth quarter 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $429 million or $1.06 per share compared to adjusted net income of $873 million or $2.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019.  
For 2020, the net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.4 billion or $3.50 per share compared to net income of $2.4 billion or $5.84 per share in 2019. The 2020 adjusted net loss attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.3 billion or $3.12 per share compared to adjusted net income of $2.4 billion or $5.70 per share in 2019.  
Fourth quarter and full year 2019 and 2020 adjusted results exclude items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables.  
The refining segment reported an operating loss of $377 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the LIFO liquidation adjustment and other operating expenses, the fourth quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $476 million. Fourth quarter 2020 results were impacted by narrow crude oil differentials, lower product demand and lower prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.6 million barrels per day, which was lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to lower product demand. Throughput capacity utilization was 81% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.40 per barrel were in line with guidance but $0.47 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the effect of lower throughput rates.  
Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $127 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. After adjusting for the retroactive Blender’s Tax Credit in 2019, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 618,000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 226,000 gallons per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the effect of planned maintenance. The segment set annual records for sales volumes of 787,000 gallons per day and margin of $2.66 per gallon.  
Operating income for the ethanol segment was $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ethanol production volumes averaged 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was 197,000 gallons per day lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease in operating income from the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher corn prices and lower ethanol prices. 
For the fourth quarter of 2020, G&A expenses were $224 million and net interest expense was $153 million. G&A expenses in 2020 of $756 million were $112 million lower than 2019. Depreciation and amortization expense was $577 million and income tax benefit was $289 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annual effective tax rate was 45% for 2020, which was primarily the result of the carryback of our U.S. federal tax net operating loss to 2015, when the statutory tax rate was 35%. And we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately $1 billion in the second quarter of this year.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the unfavorable impact from the changes in working capital of $113 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $140 million. And adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $955 million for the full year.  
With regard to investing activities, we made $622 million of total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which $214 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance; and $408 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $458 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $2 billion for the full year. 
Moving to financing activities, we returned $400 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2020 through our dividend and $1.8 billion through dividends and buybacks in the year, resulting in a total 2020 payout ratio of 184% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. And our Board of Directors just approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share, demonstrating our sound financial position and commitment to return cash to our investors. 
With regard to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 37%. And at the end of December, we had $5.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Almost half of our growth CapEx in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. 
For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.49 million to 1.54 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 170,000 to 190,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.75 per barrel, which is impacted by lower throughput volumes due to planned maintenance activity. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 790,000 gallons per day in 2021. 
Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.7 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $155 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $575 million. For 2021, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate. 
That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. [Operator Instructions]"

But they look like they're going to the same range adjusted for demand for both gasoline and distillate, which is a good thing. Margins are near year ago levels in most U.S. markets, and we're starting to see feedstock differentials widen, too. 
So my question is, have you been surprised by the pace of the recovery that we've seen? Do you think there's reason to believe that it's sustainable? And either way, what's your overall view for the recovery in refined products market for 2021? What's your outlook at this point?"

But I mean, we've been pleased with the pace of the recovery so far. And frankly, I think you're going to see it accelerate as the vaccine rolls out more aggressively. That's kind of an obvious statement. But I think sometimes, we do take it for granted. If we can really get the government functioning appropriately on the distribution, I think we're going to be in much better shape, perhaps quicker than we all realized. And we've got a member of our Board of Directors who thinks that there's such pent-up demand certainly in the East Coast where he is and other parts of the country that when we do get the vaccine rolled out and we get a herd immunity in place, you're going to see this look a little bit like the roaring '20s, and that's his point of view. And I would tend to agree with that. 
So with that, I'll let Gary and Lane provide a little more color specifically regarding the inventories and demand."

Certainly, getting total light product inventory, we built a significant surplus, especially early on in the pandemic. So seeing that surplus essentially gone and getting back into the 5-year average range is very encouraging. As you know, as demand starts to pick up, it will allow margins to recover much quicker. 
I think encouraging -- another encouraging sign is the fact, despite the fact that we've had a surge in COVID cases, gasoline demand per the DOEs is still a little bit above 90% year-over-year where it was last year at this time. Our wholesale volumes are showing to be pretty close to that. And so the combination of reasonable gasoline demand and relatively low gasoline inventories has caused the prop market to be a little stronger. I think one of the key things there is the stronger prop market has really flattened the curve on gasoline. And so it's taking away a lot of that incentive to store summer-grade gasoline, and that certainly sets up for a stronger driving season in terms of gasoline margins. 
As Joe said, I think we view that we'll see gradual recovery. Second quarter, you'll start to see things pick up and then we expect things to be fairly normal by the third quarter, with the exception that we do see that there could be a lot of pent-up demand and people that are spending disposable income largely buying things that they're ordering are going to spend that disposable income getting out and on experiences, family vacations, which could cause a surge in gasoline demand. 
On the diesel side, as you kind of mentioned, diesel demand has really hung in there pretty strong. So the OEs are showing over 98% year-over-year diesel demand. Actually, at the 7-day average on our system, we were at 111% year-over-year, so actually showing diesel demand growth in our system. I think some of that heating oil demand has been strong, a little bit colder winter this year, starting to see some drilling activity pick up, which, of course, helps diesel demand. And then, of course, with people spending disposable income ordering things, freight, on-road freight, trucking and rail has been strong as well. As we move throughout the year, we expect to see some incremental diesel demand coming from ag as you start to plant crops. And then moving throughout the year, we also see that as jet demand begins to recover, it will lower diesel yields and help bring supply and demand into balance, which will set diesel up nicely longer term."

And so I think our view is probably the back half of the year is where you'll see quality differentials begin to widen out. I think that's further supported by if you look at the high-sulfur fuel oil forward curve, where high-sulfur fuel have been trading around 90% of Brent, you look to the back half of the year, and it gets more to 80% of Brent, which is more indicative that we'll see those quality differentials widen out again, kind of the second half of the year."

But I'm curious about the LCFS market in California and some of the other provincial and regional opportunities that we've talked about. I wanted to get your thoughts, specifically in California. It seems like there's a lot of competing sources of capital. This pandemic has progressed capital towards sort of emerging energy. And while they're small now, there's a possibility for a little bit more electrification, more renewable gas, other competing sources for that credit or for diesel substitutes in California. 
I was just wondering, given the supply coming online with Port Arthur and your longer-term plans, how do you see that playing out in California? Is it fair to say that by the time DGD 3 is up online, there might be a more meaningful opportunity outside of the California LCFS? And how do you see the pace of that over the next few years? The other part of that also being, do you expect that California could reduce -- they could increase the emissions reduction target, which would just move the goalpost and create a greater opportunity? 
So there's a lot of pieces moving there, but the market's changed quite a bit since we were talking about this pre-COVID. So I just wanted to get an update on how you see those moving parts playing out."

And then the renewable diesel is the largest carbon generator. You step outside California, I'll answer that part first. What we expect to happen in the next few years is the clean fuel standard to be in place in Canada by the end of 2022. That will bring incremental demand in 2023. We've also got legislation in New York State and Washington State for LCFS programs. And we think those states will implement an LCFS over the next few years. Timing of that is hard or impossible to predict, but we expect that's going to happen. Today, we sell to California, but we also sell to Canada and Europe. So I mean, you're right, there's some electricity penetration, there's renewable natural gas. But still, renewable diesel is the largest carbon credit generator. We don't expect that to change in the foreseeable future. 
And as far as the trucking, that's going to continue. Renewable diesel, obviously, is huge in that. California, if you look at their projections, they're heading for -- in 2030, their internal projections are like a 40% blend rate for renewable diesel. We honestly think it might even be higher than that. So there's really -- there's no blend wall. There's nothing to stop this. So we're optimistic about demand in California, and we're optimistic about demand in other parts of the globe."

But as you noted, our EBITDA per gallon margins were flat quarter-on-quarter. If you look back in the past 3 years on renewable diesel, we've experienced wide swings in feedstock costs, RINs prices, D4 RINs, ULSD prices, obviously, a huge swing there. However, our annual margins have been very consistent, ranging from $2.19 a gallon in 2018 as a low to a high of $2.37 a gallon in 2020. So you can see that the earnings power is there and consistent kind of regardless. And that's because the market works to compensate. If that prices go up, the RIN goes up anyway. So it all kind of works in concert there. 
So long-term in the next foreseeable future, let's say, we're not concerned with sourcing feedstocks. We believe our margin history is a good indicator of what to expect over time. Any one quarter can be plus or minus, but over time, we feel good about this margin indicator. Then if you look to what happened with the soybean price, well, soybean price is driven by global supply and demand of veg oils. Palm oil prices were first to move up because production growth slowed in Indonesia and Malaysia due to a drought and COVID-19, a lack of labor to harvest the palm. Now you've got soybean production is pretty tight this year. So I worry about a lower crop down in Brazil. Soybean oil production is going to be impacted. You've got the kind of the whole ag commodity index moving up, so that's moving up soybean oil too. 
And then finally, veg oil pricing was low as compared to ULSD in 2018 and '19. So we expected some upward movement relative to ULSD. In response to this, more vegetable oil will be produced in response to higher prices. And we don't see a long-term sustainable shift in vegetable oil pricing relative to low-sulfur diesel."

But I mean, we have seen -- and we've seen it for some time now. The headlines are all focused on EVs, right? And everyone takes that into consideration when they're looking at the long-term outlook for oil demand going forward. And we just need to continue to look at the facts and keep it in perspective. 
EV sales last year made up slightly less than 2% of domestic car sales and just around 4% globally. And I think if you look forward to developing countries, their focus is a whole lot less on climate change and EVs than it is in feeding their people and providing safe and affordable housing for them. So there's a lot going on politically, but the reality is that cleaner fuels are going to be part of the future, EVs will be part of the future. But it's far from -- the internal combustion engine is far from being extinct. And so that's one thing that we have to all keep in mind, I think, as we go forward. We're still selling a tremendous amount of internal combustion engines that are more efficient. And our industry has done a fine job of working projects and adjusting operations to reduce the carbon intensity of the products that we're producing. 
And frankly, Valero, as you know, is doing a lot of that with the renewable diesel projects that we've undertaken. We're also doing it with carbon sequestration around our ethanol business. We're looking at hydrogen and so on. So anyway, there's a lot going on here, and I think we'll continue to see overall the carbon intensity of traditional fuels, liquid fuels go down. And honestly, you can tell from our IR deck that already, we're very competitive from a renewable diesel perspective with an EV. And I think you'll see that continue to increase. So I'll stop there. Rich, on the policy side?"

But we point out, that's very similar to the order that -- the executive order Obama issued in 2015, mandating that half of the fleet become EVs. And we didn't see a lot of movement in the federal fleet to EVs under that order. And it's a lot more difficult than you think to do that. 
The other thing that I would really like to emphasize is our renewable diesel can drop in today and, on a life cycle basis, outperforms an equivalent diesel electric truck. So we can help the administration address this climate issue straight away. This order did call for clean and zero-emission vehicles, and ours are certainly clean. The other thing I'd point out, even in that order, you have to read the fine print. It requires that it be made in America and meet the federal procurement standards. And I'm not sure there's a lot of electric vehicles that can meet those requirements, but our renewable diesel is 100% American made, and it's ready to go now. 
So we actually think that a lot of this will be, in the end, the economics are overwhelming for our products. And they're ready to go now. So we think we can work with the administration. We think there is going to be demand and policy drivers for lower carbon fuels, but we think that's a good thing for us. So..."

So it's a good place for us to really start and develop projects. The other way that we can do this is with our blue and green hydrogen. We're gating projects in that, that will also affect the carbon intensity of our transportation fuels. 
Some of which we've done, smaller ones, but we are certainly getting some larger ones that will make our transportation fuels. Depending on what market we can target them in, we'll obviously be helped with the overall -- our competitiveness from a carbon intensity perspective will help us. So those are all -- those are the things that we're looking at. But I think, again, we're trying to hit from a carbon sequestration perspective, we're trying to hit the streams that we see that are lower in carbon dioxide on that gas and maybe just in that, when something has been combusted, it has a lot of other stuff in it like basically nitrogen and some other things."

It has -- they don't really have access to an advantaged crude. They're more aggressive on -- with respect to their transition away from transportation fossil fuels.

If you look, we think the U.S. is the place to be. The installed base of renewable diesel is still pretty small, especially the guys that are running the waste feedstock and pretreatment unit. And there's plenty of waste feedstock just to procure. As you look further down the road, you get past 2025 out to 2030, we expect to see quite a bit of growth in used cooking oil production and then the animal rendering.

We'll obviously keep paying close attention to that and doing engineering on options, but it's really about getting some mandated volume out there."

We have both gasoline and diesel and tankage in Veracruz today. We're still doing some commissioning activity. So we expect to have the truck rack operational in the next couple of weeks. Overall, our volumes for the quarter in Mexico were a little over 40,000 barrels a day. That's an increase of about -- year-over-year, 145%. So good growth in the country. However, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we were down about 10%. The mobility data we see in Mexico is mobility was down about 20%. So still indicates we're continuing to gain market share, but we did see a big hit in mobility in Mexico, and we saw that reflected in our volumes. 
Moving forward, I mean, our -- we anticipate that the inland terminals associated with the Veracruz marine terminal probably come online early second quarter, one at Puebla and one in Mexico City. And that's really where you'll start to see our volumes ramp up as those inland terminals come on. Our goal is to get to about 80,000 barrels a day in that central system. The other thing that the Veracruz terminal does is it takes a lot of cost out of our supply chain. So in addition to the ramp-up in volumes, we would also expect to see wider margins on the volume that we're selling in country."

The refining business saw a strong recovery in the first quarter as various pandemic-imposed restrictions were eased or withdrawn and as more and more people receive vaccinations. However, Winter Storm Uri disrupted many U.S. Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent facilities in February due to the freeze and utilities curtailments. Although our refineries and plants in those regions were also impacted, they did not suffer any significant mechanical damage and were restarted within a short period after the storm. While we did incur extremely high energy costs, I'm very proud of the Valero team for safely managing the crisis by idling or shutting down the affected facilities and resuming operations without incident.
With many of the country's Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent refineries offline due to the storm, there was a significant 60 million barrel drawdown of surplus product inventories in the U.S., bringing product inventories to normal levels. Lower product inventories, coupled with increasing product demand, improved refining margins significantly from the prior quarter. Crude oil discounts were also wider for Canadian heavy and WTI in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter of last year, providing additional support to refining margins. In addition, our renewable diesel segment continues to provide solid earnings and set records for operating income and renewable diesel product margin in the first quarter of 2021.
Our wholesale operations also continue to see positive trends in U.S. demand, and we expanded our supply into Mexico with current sales of over 60,000 barrels per day, which should continue to increase with the ramp-up of supply through the Vera Cruz terminal.
On the strategic front, we continue to evaluate and pursue economic projects that lower the carbon intensity of all of our products. In March, we announced that we were partnering with BlackRock and Navigator to develop a carbon capture system in the Midwest, allowing for connectivity of 8 of our ethanol plants to the system. In addition to the tax credit benefit for CO2 capture and storage, Valero will also capture higher value for the lower-carbon intensity ethanol product in low carbon fuel standard markets such as California. The system is expected to be capable of storing 5 million metric tons of CO2 per year.
In our Diamond Green Diesel 2 project at St. Charles remains on budget and is now expected to be operational in the middle of the fourth quarter of this year. The expansion is expected to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, bringing the total capacity at St. Charles to 690 million gallons per year. The expansion will also allow us to market 30 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha from DGD 1 and DGD 2 into low-carbon fuel markets.
The renewable diesel project at Port Arthur or DGD 3 continues to move forward as well and is expected to be operational in the second half of 2023. With the completion of this 470 million gallons per year capacity plant, DGD's combined annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. 
With respect to our refinery optimization projects, we remain on track to complete the Pembroke Cogen project in the third quarter of this year, and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. As we head into summer, we believe that there's a pent-up desire among much of the population to travel and take vacations, which should drive incremental demand for transportation fuels. We're already seeing a strong recovery in gasoline and diesel demand at 93% and 100% of pre-pandemic levels, respectively. Since March, air travel has also increased, as reflected in TSA data, which shows that passenger count is now nearly double of what it was in January. We're also seeing positive signs in the crude market with wider discounts for sour crude oils and residual feedstocks relative to Brent as incremental crude oil from the Middle East comes to market. All these positive data points, coupled with less refining capacity as a result of refinery rationalizations, should lead to continued improvement in refining margins in the coming months.
We've already seen the impacts of these improving market indicators, with Valero having positive operating income and operating cash flow in March. In closing, we're encouraged by the outlook on refining as product demand steadily improves towards pre-pandemic levels, which should continue to have a positive impact on refining margins. We believe these improvements, coupled with our growth strategy and low-carbon renewable fuels, will further strengthen our long-term competitive advantage.
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

The first quarter 2021 operating loss includes estimated excess energy costs of $579 million or $1.15 per share. For the first quarter of 2020, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $140 million or $0.34 per share. The adjusted results exclude an after-tax lower of cost or market, or LCM, inventory valuation adjustment of approximately $2 billion. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the earnings release.
The refining segment reported an operating loss of $592 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an operating loss of $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter 2021 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $554 million, compared to adjusted operating income of $329 million for the first quarter of 2020, which excludes the LCM inventory valuation adjustment. The refining segment operating loss for the first quarter of 2021 includes estimated excess energy cost of $525 million related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri. Refining throughput volumes in the first quarter of 2021 averaged 2.4 million barrels per day, which was 414,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter of 2020 due to scheduled maintenance and disruptions resulting from Winter Storm Uri. Throughput capacity utilization was 77% in the first quarter of 2021. Refining cash operating expenses of $6.78 per barrel were higher than guidance of $4.75 per barrel, primarily due to estimated excess energy costs related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri of $2.21 per barrel.
Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was a record $203 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $198 million for the first quarter of 2020. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 867,000 gallons per day in the first quarter of 2021.
The ethanol segment reported an operating loss of $56 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to an operating loss of $197 million for the first quarter of 2020. The operating loss for the first quarter of 2021 includes estimated excess energy costs of $54 million related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri. First quarter of 2020 adjusted operating loss, which excludes the LCM inventory valuation adjustment, was $69 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2021, which was 541,000 gallons per day lower than the first quarter of 2020.
For the first quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $208 million and net interest expense was $149 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $578 million, and the income tax benefit was $148 million for the first quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate was 19%.
Net cash used in operating activities was $52 million in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $184 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash used in operating activities was $344 million. 
With regard to investing activities, we made $582 million of total capital investments in the first quarter of 2021, of which $333 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance, and $249 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $479 million in the first quarter of 2021. 
On April 19, we've sold a partial membership interest in the Pasadena marine terminal joint venture for $270 million.
Moving to financing activities. We returned $400 million to our stockholders in the first quarter of 2021 through our dividend. And as you saw earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 40%. At the end of March, we had $5.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.
Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Over half of our growth CapEx in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.65 million to 1.7 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 340,000 to 360,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4.20 per barrel.
With respect to the renewable diesel segment, with the start-up of DGD 2 in the fourth quarter, we now expect sales volumes to average 1 million gallons per day in 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.1 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the second quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $590 million. For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate. Lastly, as we reported last quarter, we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately $1 billion later this year.
That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to 2 questions. [Operator Instructions]"

But as global oil demand picked up, a great percentage of that would be filled with additional OPEC production, which would cause the quality differentials to widen back out. I think, by and large, that view is still holding. Most forecasts show about 4 million barrels a day of additional OPEC production coming on the market the second half of the year. In fact, at the last OPEC meeting, they're saying we could see as much as 2.1 million barrels of that as early as July.
I think the only thing that's different is the quality differentials have widened a little bit faster than what we thought. And it's for a number of reasons. The winter storm brought down a lot of high-complexity refining capacity that pushed medium and heavy sour crudes back to the market and helped widen those quality differentials. After the winter storm, we had the release from the strategic petroleum reserve, put 10 million barrels of medium sour on the market, which again pressured that ask differential. We're seeing more Iranian and Venezuelan barrels on the market, not flowing to the U.S., but flowing to the Far East. And it's taken some of the pressure off the medium sours in the U.S. Gulf Coast. And then recently, we had the refinery fire in Mexico, which has put more Maya out in the market. So we think the combination of the events have happened recently, additional OPEC barrels on the market. We also think you'll see more heavy Canadian, with the recovery in flat price and production quota is being lifted there that the differentials will continue to widen.
To your question, we have seen a switch in economic signals. Of course, it's very dependent on location and refinery configuration. But some of our refineries today, the economic signals are pointing us to run more heavy sour, and we're seeing fairly equal economics between medium sour grades and light sweet."

They've launched their nonbinding open season, which is basically to kind of determine what kind of demand will be for this project so that they can rightsize the project and also kind of optimize on the routing. The open season is going very well, and we're seeing strong interest from ethanol producers and other industry players, but we're especially surprised by the strong interest from the fertilizer plants.

And it's just -- it's up. And why it's up, first of all, it was really low in 2018 and 2019. So we had some periods where it was low versus history. And by that, I mean, relative to ULSD. So soybean oil price is driven by the global supply and demand of veg oils. Soybean oil, palm oil and rapeseed oil are all up 60% to 95% year-on-year. Palm oil production in Indonesia was off because of a drought in 2020 and labor shortages due to COVID-19. You also had U.S. soybean oil production in the '19/'20 crop year was -- or just soybean production was like 80% of the previous year. So you also have to remember, you had the trade sanctions. So China wasn't in. China pulled down stocks a lot. They weren't in the market for the soybean oil. So prices dropped, not as much was produced. Well, now China is back in the market. The world is recovering. So you've got a big demand now out there for veg oils. So we kind of got into this place because of low prices, and we'll get out of it because of high prices. So all these can be grown on demand. So the cure for high prices is high prices. So we'll eventually work our way out of it, but it's going to take a little while. 
Obviously, DGD's advantages were -- we're not running the veg oils other than the distillers corn oil, which is an inedible veg oil. So we expect to continue to see those feedstocks price at a discount to soybean oil. But the biggest advantage is the CI score of those oils, those waste oils, compared to a veg oil or compared to the soybean oil in most jurisdictions. So that's really what drives DGD. And by having our robust pretreatment system, our location, our ability to run anything is just a huge advantage."

But it's also critical that, when we're on that path that we do it in a way that continues to deliver financial returns for our investors. And so while we continue to look at not only the projects that are listed here.

You've got the EU now with Red 2 out to 2030, California out to 2030. So while there's a lot of projects announced, there's also a lot of incremental demand announced. And if you look at generation to date, what's carrying the load for California is renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol, that 70% of the credits generated is that. So when we look at the time line for the economics and what we're looking at for the Diamond Green projects, it -- they pay out pretty quick, right? So -- but we're not -- and we don't see anything changing materially. And certainly, through 2025 type time frame and even beyond that, we don't see this is changing that much. So we feel pretty good about that. I think CARB, if you have a carbon price go down, they're going to adjust that up. I mean I think they've pretty well signaled that this $200 a ton is kind of the sweet spot for them and 200, 200-plus. And so we feel pretty good about demand. And I think the flip side is a lot of these projects that are announced, if you go back in history, they just don't happen. And we don't see anything that's going to change that trend."

The -- it will be -- generally speaking, in terms of best ways to reduce carbon emissions, the most efficient way to do that in the economy is with a tax. We would say the key components of this is the tax has to be applied broadly across the entire economy. You need to make sure it doesn't result in exporting the emissions outside the country. So you're going to have to have some kind of border adjustment process around it. But yes, I think a carbon tax is an efficient way to address some of these issues and to help lower carbon. I'd point out that we do quite well in this low-carbon fuel environment. And so we think we would be advantaged under that regime as well."

So I think when we look at our margin structure, there's probably no need. I mean we think that -- with the RIN, if you step back and look at this, the price of the D4 RIN is based on the spread between biodiesel and ULSD. And then the driver for the biodiesel price is almost entirely soybean oil because that's the marginal feed for the biodiesel producer. So then, therefore, if you have at a given ULSD price, the D4 RIN is high, if soybean oil is high and the D4 RIN is low of soybean oil is low. So as renewable diesel feedstock prices move with soybean oil, renewable diesel margin is not necessarily higher with D4 RINs as they appreciate. 
Now D6 RINs are a whole different story. They're dependent on the renewable volume obligation and whether D4 RINs are needed to satisfy the total renewable fuels obligation. If D4 RINs are needed, then that D6 price is going to approach the D4 price, and that's the case we're in today. The D4 is right up against the D6. So D4s are tied to the production cost of biodiesel. We don't see that fundamentally changing. And then the D6 just depends on the total renewable fuel obligation and whether additional biodiesel is needed to balance that equation. So a D6 can be about anywhere, a ceiling of D4 down to 0, but a D4 has got some fundamentals behind it. So we don't really see the need to protect that."

A combination of the vaccine rollout and economic stimulus has driven a rapid recovery and demand for our products. Our wholesale numbers are pretty consistent with the DOE data. I think our 7-day average is about 95% of pre-pandemic level, which is where Wednesday stats came out on the DOE as well. So a little bit below the 5-year average, but well within the 5-year average range. We're pretty bullish on gasoline going forward, not only due to the pace of recovery, but we think there's a number of factors that could be very supportive for gasoline demand. As people return to a normal style of life, we're seeing that people are driving more and kind of avoiding mass transit. For the summer season, we believe that a lot of people that want to go on vacation will again maybe avoid travel on an airplane and taking more driving vacations. And then just as Joe alluded to, because people felt trapped in their home for a year now, they'll spend more of the discretionary income on experiences like vacation rather than things. So everything domestically on the gasoline front looks very good. And even though we've seen spikes of COVID cases around the world, our domestic market -- our domestic export markets are starting to pick up as well. Mexico gasoline demand in March was up 11% from February. So the gasoline side looks very good. 
On the diesel side, we've really been in this mode where diesel demand is almost fully recovered. We're starting to see very strong diesel demand, especially in our Mid-Continent system today as agricultural demand is starting to kick in. And the combination of the economic stimulus and infrastructure build, we think, drives economic growth and will cause sustained strong diesel demand moving forward.
You also talked about jet. And certainly, we felt like jet would lag in terms of demand recovery. And it has. But if you look at the DOE stats this week, we're at 76% pre-pandemic levels. And I think if you look at a lot of the leading indicators, the TSA passenger counts look very strong, and that's not fully showing up in the DOE data yet. So far, the airlines have chosen just to put more passengers on a plane, but we're getting to an inflection point where now they're starting to add flights. You can see that in jet fuel nominations and also the fact that airlines are calling their pilots and their crews back and starting to add flights.
So I think if you look at where jet demand could go, pre pandemic, about 81% of flights in the U.S. were domestic flights. I think we could get that demand back. That last 20% in terms of international travel will probably take a little longer to recover there."

But you're already starting to see those ARs close and the volumes of product flowing from Northwest Europe and the New York are slow. In addition to the slowing of imports, we're starting to see exports pick back up. So certainly, for us, we had exports down in the first quarter as we replenished inventories, but already in April. Our exports are starting to normalize as well. So I do think that was a short-term dynamic that will reverse as we move forward."

And being from my opinion on it, you've got -- you just generated less deficits out there. So you would have -- you would think that the Credit Bank is going to grow marginally in this environment.

Today, we -- we're not configured to make it directly. We -- there's ways that we could make it at a big yield penalty loss. And again, that's back to the cost structure. In terms of the way we think the most economic way to produce it would require a pretty relatively expensive investment. It's essentially adding a reactor into our -- into this -- into the process and so -- and the fractionation. So there's some costs there. And those are the things that -- these are the projects we're trying to develop.

However, Winter Storm Uri disrup",774,"Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. The refining business saw a strong recovery in the first quarter as various pandemic-imposed restrictions were eased or withdrawn and as more and more people receive vaccinations. However, Winter Storm Uri disrupted many U.S. Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent facilities in February due to the freeze and utilities curtailments. Although our refineries and plants in those regions were also impacted, they did not suffer any significant mechanical damage and were restarted within a short period after the storm. While we did incur extremely high energy costs, I'm very proud of the Valero team for safely managing the crisis by idling or shutting down the affected facilities and resuming operations without incident.
With many of the country's Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent refineries offline due to the storm, there was a significant 60 million barrel drawdown of surplus product inventories in the U.S., bringing product inventories to normal levels. Lower product inventories, coupled with increasing product demand, improved refining margins significantly from the prior quarter. Crude oil discounts were also wider for Canadian heavy and WTI in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter of last year, providing additional support to refining margins. In addition, our renewable diesel segment continues to provide solid earnings and set records for operating income and renewable diesel product margin in the first quarter of 2021.
Our wholesale operations also continue to see positive trends in U.S. demand, and we expanded our supply into Mexico with current sales of over 60,000 barrels per day, which should continue to increase with the ramp-up of supply through the Veracruz terminal.
On the strategic front, we continue to evaluate and pursue economic projects that lower the carbon intensity of all of our products. In March, we announced that we were partnering with BlackRock and Navigator to develop a carbon capture system in the Midwest, allowing for connectivity of 8 of our ethanol plants to the system. In addition to the tax credit benefit for CO2 capture and storage, Valero will also capture higher value for the lower carbon intensity ethanol product in low carbon fuel standard markets such as California. The system is expected to be capable of storing 5 million metric tons of CO2 per year.
In our Diamond Green Diesel 2 project at St. Charles remains on budget and is now expected to be operational in the middle of the fourth quarter of this year. The expansion is expected to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, bringing the total capacity at St. Charles to 690 million gallons per year. The expansion will also allow us to market 30 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha from DGD 1 and DGD 2 into low-carbon fuel markets.
The renewable diesel project at Port Arthur or DGD 3 continues to move forward as well and is expected to be operational in the second half of 2023. With the completion of this 470 million gallons per year capacity plant, DGD's combined annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. 
With respect to our refinery optimization projects, we remain on track to complete the Pembroke Cogen project in the third quarter of this year, and the Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in 2023. 
As we head into summer, we believe that there's a pent-up desire among much of the population to travel and take vacations, which should drive incremental demand for transportation fuels. We're already seeing a strong recovery in gasoline and diesel demand at 93% and 100% of pre-pandemic levels, respectively. Since March, air travel has also increased, as reflected in TSA data, which shows that passenger count is now nearly double of what it was in January. 
We're also seeing positive signs in the crude market with wider discounts for sour crude oils and residual feedstocks relative to Brent as incremental crude oil from the Middle East comes to market. All these positive data points, coupled with less refining capacity as a result of refinery rationalizations, should lead to continued improvement in refining margins in the coming months.
We've already seen the impacts of these improving market indicators, with Valero having positive operating income and operating cash flow in March. 
In closing, we're encouraged by the outlook on refining as product demand steadily improves towards pre-pandemic levels, which should continue to have a positive impact on refining margins. We believe these improvements, coupled with our growth strategy and low-carbon renewable fuels, will further strengthen our long-term competitive advantage.
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

The first quarter 2021 operating loss includes estimated excess energy costs of $579 million or $1.15 per share. .
For the first quarter of 2020, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $140 million or $0.34 per share. The adjusted results exclude an after-tax lower of cost or market, or LCM, inventory valuation adjustment of approximately $2 billion. 
For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the earnings release.
The refining segment reported an operating loss of $592 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an operating loss of $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020. The first quarter 2021 adjusted operating loss for the refining segment was $554 million, compared to adjusted operating income of $329 million for the first quarter of 2020, which excludes the LCM inventory valuation adjustment. The refining segment operating loss for the first quarter of 2021 includes estimated excess energy costs of $525 million related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri. 
Refining throughput volumes in the first quarter of 2021 averaged 2.4 million barrels per day, which was 414,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter of 2020 due to scheduled maintenance and disruptions resulting from Winter Storm Uri. 
Throughput capacity utilization was 77% in the first quarter of 2021. Refining cash operating expenses of $6.78 per barrel were higher than guidance of $4.75 per barrel, primarily due to estimated excess energy costs related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri of $2.21 per barrel.
Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was a record $203 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $198 million for the first quarter of 2020. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 867,000 gallons per day in the first quarter of 2021.
The ethanol segment reported an operating loss of $56 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to an operating loss of $197 million for the first quarter of 2020. The operating loss for the first quarter of 2021 includes estimated excess energy costs of $54 million related to impacts from Winter Storm Uri. 
First quarter of 2020 adjusted operating loss, which excludes the LCM inventory valuation adjustment, was $69 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2021, which was 541,000 gallons per day lower than the first quarter of 2020.
For the first quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $208 million and net interest expense was $149 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $578 million, and the income tax benefit was $148 million for the first quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate was 19%.
Net cash used in operating activities was $52 million in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $184 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash used in operating activities was $344 million. 
With regard to investing activities, we made $582 million of total capital investments in the first quarter of 2021, of which $333 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance, and $249 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $479 million in the first quarter of 2021. 
On April 19, we've sold a partial membership interest in the Pasadena marine terminal joint venture for $270 million.
Moving to financing activities. We returned $400 million to our stockholders in the first quarter of 2021 through our dividend. And as you saw earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share. 
With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio net of cash and cash equivalents was 40%. At the end of March, we had $5.9 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.
Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. Over half of our growth CapEx in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. 
For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.65 million to 1.7 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 340,000 to 360,000 barrels per day. 
We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4.20 per barrel.
With respect to the renewable diesel segment, with the start-up of DGD 2 in the fourth quarter, we now expect sales volumes to average 1 million gallons per day in 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.1 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
For the second quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $590 million. 
For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate. 
Lastly, as we reported last quarter, we expect to receive a cash tax refund of approximately $1 billion later this year.
That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. [Operator Instructions]"

But as global oil demand picked up, a great percentage of that would be filled with additional OPEC production, which would cause the quality differentials to widen back out. I think, by and large, that view is still holding. Most forecasts show about 4 million barrels a day of additional OPEC production coming on the market the second half of the year. In fact, at the last OPEC meeting, they're saying we could see as much as 2.1 million barrels of that as early as July.
I think the only thing that's different is the quality differentials have widened a little bit faster than what we thought. And it's for a number of reasons. The winter storm brought down a lot of high-complexity refining capacity that pushed medium and heavy sour crudes back to the market and helped widen those quality differentials. After the winter storm, we had the release from the strategic petroleum reserve, put 10 million barrels of medium sour on the market, which again pressured that ask differential. We're seeing more Iranian and Venezuelan barrels on the market, not flowing to the U.S., but flowing to the Far East. And it's taken some of the pressure off the medium sours in the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
And then recently, we had the refinery fire in Mexico, which has put more Maya out in the market. So we think the combination of the events have happened. Recently, additional OPEC barrels on the market. We also think you'll see more heavy Canadian, with the recovery in flat price and production quota is being lifted there that the differentials will continue to widen.
To your question, we have seen a switch in economic signals. Of course, it's very dependent on location and refinery configuration. But some of our refineries today, the economic signals are pointing us to run more heavy sour, and we're seeing fairly equal economics between medium sour grades and light sweet."

And I'll let Martin kind of talk about the value creation there. But today, the CI ethanol carries a premium into the California market, and the economics are supported by the California market and the 45Q tax credit. 
And we expect that further markets will develop for the low-carbon fuels, so increasing demand for this premium product. Today, Navigator is out there. They've launched their nonbinding open season, which is basically to kind of determine what kind of demand will be for this project so that they can rightsize the project and also kind of optimize on the routing. 
The open season is going very well, and we're seeing strong interest from ethanol producers and other industry players, but we're especially surprised by the strong interest from the fertilizer plants. And given the strong interest in the project, they will be moving forward with the binding open season this summer. And if you wanted more information, they've got a website out there.

So I think what you have to do is if you kind of step back and look what's really -- soybean oil gets the attention in United States. But what's really going on is the worldwide veg oil price. And it's just -- it's up. And why it's up, first of all, it was really low in 2018 and 2019. So we had some periods where it was low versus history. And by that, I mean, relative to ULSD. So soybean oil price is driven by the global supply and demand of veg oils. Soybean oil, palm oil and rapeseed oil are all up 60% to 95% year-on-year. Palm oil production in Indonesia was off because of a drought in 2020 and labor shortages due to COVID-19. You also had U.S. soybean oil production in the '19/'20 crop year was -- or just soybean production was like 80% of the previous year. So you also have to remember, you had the trade sanctions. 
So China wasn't in. China pulled down stocks a lot. They weren't in the market for the soybean oil. So prices dropped, not as much was produced. Well, now China is back in the market. The world is recovering. So you've got a big demand now out there for veg oils. So we kind of got into this place because of low prices, and we'll get out of it because of high prices. So all these can be grown on demand. So the cure for high prices is high prices. So we'll eventually work our way out of it, but it's going to take a little while. 
Now obviously, DGD's advantages were -- we're not running the veg oils other than the distillers corn oil, which is an inedible veg oil. So we expect to continue to see those feedstocks price at a discount to soybean oil. But the biggest advantage is the CI score of those oils, those waste oils, compared to a veg oil or compared to the soybean oil in most jurisdictions. So that's really what drives DGD. And by having our robust pretreatment system, our location, our ability to run anything is just a huge advantage."

And obviously, I mean, you can tell from the chart and you can tell from where we're spending our capital that we have a clear recognition here that low-carbon fuels are going to be in much greater demand going forward. The interesting thing here from our perspective is that we've been able to come up with low-carbon fuel projects and projects that have enabled us to reduce the carbon intensity of some of our other fuels with projects that have significant returns also. I mean it's one thing to try to have that drive to find compliance with Paris to go to carbon neutrality and so on. That's all fine and good. But it's also critical that, when we're on that path that we do it in a way that continues to deliver financial returns for our investors. And so while we continue to look at not only the projects that are listed here. I mean, obviously, the carbon sequestration pipeline is the next extension after we were ethanol first and then renewable diesel and now this. And there's other projects that we're taking a look at, too, that are going to help us on this path going forward. The targets we've set for ourselves to hit by 2025, we think, are very achievable. And I don't think that you should expect that our goals are going to continue to be pushed forward from there. So we want to be viable for the long term. We believe that liquid fuels are going to be part of the energy mix going forward. It's infeasible to think that they wouldn't. And we just want to do our part and continue to provide low-carbon products."

And if you look at generation to date, what's carrying the load for California is renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol, that 70% of the credits generated is that. So when we look at the time line for the economics and what we're looking at for the Diamond Green projects, it -- they pay out pretty quick, right? So -- but we're not -- and we don't see anything changing materially. And certainly, through 2025 type time frame and even beyond that, we don't see this is changing that much. So we feel pretty good about that. I think CARB, if you have a carbon price go down, they're going to adjust that up. I mean I think they've pretty well signaled that this $200 a ton is kind of the sweet spot for them and $200, $200-plus. And so we feel pretty good about demand.

The -- it will be -- if generally speaking, in terms of best ways to reduce carbon emissions, the most efficient way to do that in the economy is with a tax. We would say the key components of this is the tax has to be applied broadly across the entire economy. You need to make sure it doesn't result in exporting the emissions outside the country. So you're going to have to have some kind of border adjustment process around it. But yes, I think a carbon tax is an efficient way to address some of these issues and to help lower carbon.

So I think when we look at our margin structure, there's probably no need. I mean we think that -- with the RIN, if you step back and look at this, the price of the D4 RIN is based on the spread between biodiesel and ULSD. And then the driver for the biodiesel price is almost entirely soybean oil because that's the marginal feed for the biodiesel producer. So then, therefore, if you have at a given ULSD price, the D4 RIN is high, if soybean oil is high and the D4 RIN is low of soybean oil is low. So as renewable diesel feedstock prices move with soybean oil, renewable diesel margin is not necessarily higher with D4 RINs as they appreciate. 
Now D6 RINs are a whole different story. They're dependent on the renewable volume obligation and whether D4 RINs are needed to satisfy the total renewable fuels obligation. If D4 RINs are needed, then that D6 price is going to approach the D4 price, and that's the case we're in today. The D4 is right up against the D6. So D4s are tied to the production cost of biodiesel. We don't see that fundamentally changing. And then the D6 just depends on the total renewable fuel obligation and whether additional biodiesel is needed to balance that equation. So a D6 can be about anywhere, a ceiling of D4 down to 0, but a D4 has got some fundamentals behind it. So we don't really see the need to protect that."

A combination of the vaccine rollout and economic stimulus has now driven a rapid recovery and demand for our products. Our wholesale numbers are pretty consistent with the DOE data. I think our 7-day average is about 95% of pre-pandemic level, which is where Wednesday stats came out on the DOE as well. So a little bit below the 5-year average, but well within the 5-year average range. We're pretty bullish on gasoline going forward, not only due to the pace of recovery, but we think there's a number of factors that could be very supportive for gasoline demand. As people return to a normal style of life, we're seeing that people are driving more and kind of avoiding mass transit. For the summer season, we believe that a lot of people that want to go on vacation will again maybe avoid travel on an airplane and taking more driving vacations. And then just as Joe alluded to, because people felt trapped in their home for a year now, they'll spend more of the discretionary income on experiences like vacation rather than things. So everything domestically on the gasoline front looks very good. And even though we've seen spikes of COVID cases around the world, our domestic market -- our domestic export markets are starting to pick up as well. Mexico gasoline demand in March was up 11% from February. So the gasoline side looks very good. 
On the diesel side, we've really been in this mode where diesel demand is almost fully recovered. We're starting to see very strong diesel demand, especially in our Mid-Continent system today as agricultural demand is starting to kick in. And the combination of the economic stimulus and infrastructure build, we think, drives economic growth and will cause sustained strong diesel demand moving forward.
You also talked about jet. And certainly, we felt like jet would lag in terms of demand recovery. And it has. But if you look at the DOE stats this week, we're at 76% pre-pandemic levels. And I think if you look at a lot of the leading indicators, the TSA passenger counts look very strong, and that's not fully showing up in the DOE data yet. So far, the airlines have chosen just to put more passengers on a plane, but we're getting to an inflection point where now they're starting to add flights. You can see that in jet fuel nominations and also the fact that airlines are calling their pilots and their crews back and starting to add flights.
So I think if you look at where jet demand could go, pre pandemic, about 81% of flights in the U.S. were domestic flights. I think we could get that demand back. That last 20% in terms of international travel probably will take a little longer to recover there."

On LCFS, it's off, as you stated. I think a lot of that has to do with this -- with the lockdown in California. And being from my opinion on it, you've got -- you just generated less deficits out there. So you would have -- you would think that the Credit Bank is going to grow marginally in this environment.

Today, we -- we're not configured to make it directly. We -- there's ways that we could make it at a big yield penalty loss. And again, that's back to the cost structure. In terms of the way we think the most economic way to produce it would require a pretty relatively expensive investment. It's essentially adding a reactor into our -- into this -- into the process and so -- and the fractionation. So there's some costs there. And those are the things that -- these are the projects we're trying to develop. You certainly need just -- you do need some -- there's people interested in small amounts here and there, and you could probably get to that with fractionation.

Our system's flexibility and the team's relentless focus on optimization in a week, but, otherwise, improving margin environment, enabled us to deliver positive earnings in the second quarter. More importantly, cash provided by operating activities more than covered our cash used in investing and financing activities for the quarter, even without the cash benefits from our 2020 income tax refund and the proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in the Pasadena terminal. 
There was a significant increase in mobility in the second quarter, driving higher demand for refined products, particularly in the U.S. In fact, we're seeing demand for gasoline and diesel in excess of prepandemic levels in our U.S. Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions. 
Jet demand continues to ramp up as well and is around 80% of 2019's level. We responded with higher refinery utilization to match product demand in our system. In addition, product exports have been picking up, particularly to Latin America with the easing of lockdowns in the region. We exported 410,000 barrels per day of products from our system in June, which is the highest volume since 2018. 
Our Renewable Diesel segment continues to perform exceptionally well and once again set records for renewable diesel margin and sales volumes. Highlighting Diamond Green Diesel's ability to process a wide range of discounted feedstocks and Valero's operational and technical expertise. 
Our ethanol segment also performed well and provided solid operating income in the second quarter as demand for ethanol increased along with higher gasoline production. 
Carbon sequestration project with BlackRock and Navigator is moving ahead and has garnered strong interest from additional parties in the binding open season. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with 8 ethanol plants connected to this system. 
This project serves to help achieve our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our products, while providing solid economic returns. Our Diamond Green Diesel 2 project at St. Charles remains on budget and is scheduled to be operational in the middle of the fourth quarter of this year. 
This expansion project is expected to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, bringing the total capacity at St. Charles to 690 million gallons per year of renewable diesel and 30 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha. 
And our Diamond Green Diesel 3 project at Port Arthur is also progressing well and is now expected to be operational in the first half of 2023. With the completion of this 470 million gallons per year plant, DGD's total annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. 
Our refinery optimization projects remain on track with the Pembroke Cogen project expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year, and the Port Arthur Coker project expected to be completed in 2023. 
Looking ahead, we have a favorable outlook for refining margins, as product demand continues to improve with increasing global vaccinations and mobility. In addition, there has been significant refinery capacity rationalization in the U.S. in the last couple of years, and we expect further closures of uncompetitive refineries, particularly in Europe. 
We believe that product demand recovery, coupled with significant refinery rationalization should be supportive of strong refining margins. We also expect to see wider medium and heavy crude oil differentials as OPEC+ increases crude supply, which should further provide support to refining margins. 
And as low carbon fuel policies continue to expand globally, we remain well positioned. With the current projects in progress, we expect to quadruple our renewable diesel production in the next couple of years. In addition, we continue to explore and develop opportunities in carbon sequestration, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen and other innovative projects to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage. 
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

Before I provide our second quarter financial results summary, I'm pleased to inform you that we recently published an updated stewardship and responsibility report which now includes our sustainability accounting standards or SASB disclosure",1132,"Thanks, Joe. Before I provide our second quarter financial results summary, I'm pleased to inform you that we recently published an updated stewardship and responsibility report which now includes our sustainability accounting standards or SASB disclosures. 
In addition to being on track to achieve our previously announced target to reduce and offset 63% of our global refining greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 through investments in Board-approved projects, the report includes a new target to reduce and offset 100% of our global refining greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. 
These targets are consistent with our strategy as we continue to innovate and leverage our global liquid fuels platform to expand our long-term competitive advantage with investments in economic low-carbon projects. 
And now turning to our quarterly summary. Net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $162 million or $0.39 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.3 billion or $3.07 per share for the second quarter of 2020. 
Second quarter 2021 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $197 million or $0.48 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $504 million or $1.25 per share for the second quarter of 2020. 
For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. 
The Refining segment reported $349 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.8 billion for the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 adjusted operating income for the Refining segment was $361 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $383 million for the second quarter of 2020. 
Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2021 averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was 514,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2020. Throughput capacity utilization was 90% in the second quarter of 2021. 
Refining cash operating expenses of $4.13 per barrel were $0.26 per barrel lower than the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher throughput in the second quarter of 2021. The renewable diesel segment operating income was $248 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $129 million for the second quarter of 2020. 
Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 923,000 gallons per day in the second quarter of 2021, which was 128,000 gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2020. The segment set another record for operating income and sales volumes. 
The Ethanol segment reported operating income of $99 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $91 million for the second quarter of 2020. The second quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss was $20 million. 
Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.2 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2021, which was 1.9 million gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2020. 
For the second quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $176 million and net interest expense was $150 million. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was $588 million, and income tax expense was $169 million for the second quarter of 2021. 
The effective tax rate was 37%, which was higher than our second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate that will be effective in 2023. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $1.1 billion and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $809 million. 
With regard to investing activities, we made $548 million of total capital investments in the second quarter of 2021, of which $252 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $296 million was for growing the business. 
Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $417 million in the second quarter of 2021.
Moving to financing activities. We returned $401 million to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2021 through our dividend, resulting in a payout ratio of 50% of adjusted net cash provided by the operating activities for the quarter. 
Earlier this month, our Board of Directors also approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share payable in the third quarter. And as Joe noted, we were able to cover all of our investing and financing activities, which includes our dividend and capital investments in the second quarter with cash provided by operating activities even without the benefit from the cash tax refund and the proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in the Pasadena terminal. 
With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.6 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 37%. 
At the end of June, we had $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. 
About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. And over half of our growth capital in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. 
For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.6 million to 1.65 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 435,000 to 455,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. 
We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.45 per barrel. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, with the anticipated start-up of DGD 2 in the middle of the fourth quarter, we expect sales volumes to average 1 million gallons per day in 2021. 
Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.7 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.43 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
For the third quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $590 million. 
For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate. 
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

As you talked about, Joe talked about mobility increasing in the second quarter. We saw good recovery in mobility in the domestic markets. And with the recovery in mobility, we saw on road transportation fuel demand basically recovered to prepandemic levels. 
The issue we really had in the second quarter was the pace of recovery in the U.S. was just much faster than what we saw in most of the other major demand centers throughout the world. And so where our margins started to track up as demand improved, eventually, our market began to dislocate from the global markets, and we incentivized imports. And so we saw very high levels of imports later in the quarter, caused inventory to build. 
And as inventory built, we eventually saw margin destruction. I think the good news for us, as we go into the third quarter, is that at least the markets we have good visibility into. We're seeing mobility increase in those markets like we did in the U.S. in the second quarter. With the increase in mobility, we're seeing demand take off quite nicely. 
We certainly see that in our Canadian markets in the U.K. and the markets we go to in Latin America. And I think that's what you really need to have sustained margin recovery is the global market -- global demand to pick up. 
So thus far, in July, we've seen margins that are better than we saw in the second quarter. And so that's certainly encouraging. And then on the crude side, you talked a little bit about the differentials. I think you know to see a meaningful move in the differentials we need OPEC barrels back on the market. 
Of course, it was good to hear OPEC plans to put 400,000 barrels a day back out on the market sometime post August. And I think to some degree, the markets are already reflecting that. If you look at the heavy Canadian differentials in the Gulf today, on the fourth quarter has about $0.75 wider discounts than what we see in the market. 
Again, that $0.75 wider discounts in the face of backwardation in the Brent market. So if you look at that discount as a percent of Brent, it's a fairly meaningful move that we would see as we get later in the year."

I think if you step back and just think about our renewable diesel segment, right, our refining expertise has been a critical component to the development and operations and renewable diesel and ultimately, the success of that business. 
You have to also keep in mind that we were an early mover in the space and have accumulated decades worth of knowledge, which is a lot more than almost all of our peers. Our operating reliability has been very good, and that's helped differentiate Diamond Green. 
We also use the same reliability process at renewable diesel that we have applied to our refining system. And then finally, structurally on the pricing, Diamond Green as well as other producers, you would expect them to have stronger results when prices are going up, the price, ULSD price going up. Because that value you see immediately in your there's going to be a lag in the cost of sales on the feedstock. So with this increasing price environment helped us somewhat."

As Joe said, this quarter was a big big step change for us in a couple of ways. We've made money for the first time, we had enough cash to cover all of our needs. 
So that's a great place to be in or we're glad to be back there again. We did put on the $4 billion of debt last year. And we have said, as things normalize, we will initially focus on 2 things: first, building our cash balance back up to $3 billion-plus in that range. And then second, starting to work to get our leverage down. 
So our June 30 cash balance was about $3.6 billion. So we're in line there. We're in a pretty good spot, and we're starting working on the second call, which is looking at our debt repayment. 
We said a few times before, we would look at redeeming this tranche of 3-year floaters that are callable as early as this fall. So that would likely be our first step. And that's still true. That's definitely something we're looking at. 
And then as we move forward further into this year and beyond that, we'll continue to look at other liability management opportunities. And as earnings and cash generation continue to normalize, as you said, which is way we hope things continue to move, we'll have increased optionality the more cash we have. 
But maintaining our credit ratings was also a priority for us, and we're targeting to have a net debt to cap around 3x in a normalized environment, which is consistent with where we were in the past. And we still have our long-term net debt to cap target of 20% to 30%. 
But to get more to your question, we also still remain committed to our capital allocation framework. Our shareholder payout ratio was 50% this quarter, and we continue to target this 40% to 50% ratio on an annual basis. 
We do expect to be able to meet that as we move forward through the recovery and beyond, even as we work on our deleveraging strategy. So we think we're going to be able to do both of them. I think would be your answer. We're not -- certainly not going to have to sacrifice the dividend, and I don't think we'll have to sacrifice the target, the 45% to 50% target either."

Obviously, when we have operations in those areas stress tests, and we try to understand the cash flow that we -- that our assets generate through an entire economic cycle. And as you alluded to and we've said before, the things that drive assets are these big -- you start with -- you have an issue, whether it's trade flow or reliability or whatever, and you layer in chunky capital, whether it's regulatory capital or a big turnaround that's when these assets really fall that operators start to think about what they're going to do.

But as things have picked up in Europe, they're not only not sending barrels to the U.S., but but we're seeing our exports ramp up into Latin America. So what I would say is more normalization of trade flows, which will help inventories continue to draw and support better crack spreads."

And then that once your yield pattern changes a little bit where you make some more light ends. So at the end of the day, to get back to equal to renewable diesel, you're going to have to get some help on the side with some additional pricing mechanism and additional green premium there. 
So right now, we don't see the economic incentive to make That being said, obviously, we're studying it, we're looking at everything, we're looking how the landscape changes once going through in all parts of the world and legislative processes or regulatory processes.

And if you look at the weekly inventory debt in the second quarter, what was happening through most of the quarter is the inventories just kept drawing. And typically, when inventories draw, you're going to get a better margin, and it's pretty good correlation there in the U.S. ethanol industry. 
So when we -- but the weekly data now in June, starting into May and through June, we've seen that turn the other way. So margins now are lower than they were in the second quarter. How long is this going to last? I'm not sure. We're starting to see some cuts in the industry now. We've signaled some lower guidance for third quarter on versus what we did in the second quarter. 
So we'll see where it turns. I mean, really, what we're looking at long term though in ethanol is carbon sequestration. And we feel like that is going to differentiate us from the industry between the 45Q tax credit, that's worth about $0.15 a gallon, getting into LCFS markets, that's more like $0.50 a gallon gross. 
So we're well positioned there with what we're doing with Navigator and BlackRock, and then we're also looking at some stand-alone projects that are Eastern ethanol plants for carbon sequestration. 
So that's really our endgame is to lower the carbon intensity of a product and stay competitive there and differentiate ourselves."

What really happened, and Gary talked about it earlier, is it was just a bug right? I mean the U.S. have recovered. We were out -- our mobility had gone way up and it attracted imports from areas that were still essentially in lockdown. 
So you had surplus capacity in Europe and some of these other places that attracted imports. I wouldn't say that the United States was refining industries have gotten lack of discipline. It was our operating per the signals. 
It was really the issue that we have -- we had there's capacity out there that essentially could get pointed to the U.S. and some earlier caller mentioned, the European fundamentals look better.

They're clearly are kicking them out to get past a lot of the infrastructure discussion and not to have this issue rear up in the middle of their efforts to try to push forward the infrastructure deal. 
So we would expect that once you kind of clear those EPA is going to have to issue an RVO, we're almost all the way through 2021 and by the time they could get a rule posed and out, the year is almost going to almost certainly be passed it. So you're looking at maybe 2021-2022 combined rule or at least the coming out at the same time. 
And I think that will -- and the other reality is they recognize that they need to set an RVO that's achievable and obtainable. So we expect them to do that. On the SREs, the Supreme Court ruling really focused on only 1 issue was appealed up and that was on these continuity of the SRE ruling. 
The other aspects of the Tenth Circuit ruling that kick those SREs back to EPA are still there, and EPA has got them back under them. And they haven't issued an SRE since 2018. So I think the prospect for SREs probably doesn't really change with the Supreme Court ruling and the EPA still got a whole host of other issues that they have to sort through that came out of the Tenth Circuit ruling that was -- that still stands.

Our system's flexibility and the team's relentless focus on optimization in a week, but, otherwise, improving margin environment, enabled us to deliver positive earnings in the second quarter. More importantly, cash provided by operating activities more than covered our cash used in investing and financing activities for the quarter, even without the cash benefits from our 2020 income tax refund and the proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in the Pasadena terminal.  
There was a significant increase in mobility in the second quarter, driving higher demand for refined products, particularly in the U.S. In fact, we're seeing demand for gasoline and diesel in excess of prepandemic levels in our U.S. Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions. Jet demand continues to ramp up as well and is around 80% of 2019's level. We responded with higher refinery utilization to match product demand in our system. 
In addition, product exports have been picking up, particularly to Latin America with the easing of lockdowns in the region. We exported 410,000 barrels per day of products from our system in June, which is the highest volume since 2018.  
Our Renewable Diesel segment continues to perform exceptionally well and once again set records for renewable diesel margin and sales volumes. Highlighting Diamond Green Diesel's ability to process a wide range of discounted feedstocks and Valero's operational and technical expertise.  
Our ethanol segment also performed well and provided solid operating income in the second quarter as demand for ethanol increased along with higher gasoline production.  
Carbon sequestration project with BlackRock and Navigator is moving ahead and has garnered strong interest from additional parties in the binding open season. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with 8 ethanol plants connected to this system. This project serves to help achieve our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our products, while providing solid economic returns. 
Our Diamond Green Diesel 2 project at St. Charles remains on budget and is scheduled to be operational in the middle of the fourth quarter of this year. This expansion project is expected to increase renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, bringing the total capacity at St. Charles to 690 million gallons per year of renewable diesel and 30 million gallons per year of renewable naphtha.  
And our Diamond Green Diesel 3 project at Port Arthur is also progressing well and is now expected to be operational in the first half of 2023. With the completion of this 470 million gallons per year plant, DGD's total annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha.  
Our refinery optimization projects remain on track with the Pembroke Cogen project expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year, and the Port Arthur Coker project expected to be completed in 2023. Looking ahead, we have a favorable outlook for refining margins, as product demand continues to improve with increasing global vaccinations and mobility. 
In addition, there has been significant refinery capacity rationalization in the U.S. in the last couple of years, and we expect further closures of uncompetitive refineries, particularly in Europe.  
We believe that product demand recovery, coupled with significant refinery rationalization should be supportive of strong refining margins. We also expect to see wider medium and heavy crude oil differentials as OPEC+ increases crude supply, which should further provide support to refining margins.  
And as low carbon fuel policies continue to expand globally, we remain well positioned. With the current projects in progress, we expect to quadruple our renewable diesel production in the next couple of years. 
In addition, we continue to explore and develop opportunities in carbon sequestration, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen and other innovative projects to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage.  
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

Before I provide our second quarter financial results summary, I'm pleased to inform you that we recently published an updated stewardship and responsibility report which now includes our sustainability accounting standards or SASB disclosure",1159,"Thanks, Joe. Before I provide our second quarter financial results summary, I'm pleased to inform you that we recently published an updated stewardship and responsibility report which now includes our sustainability accounting standards or SASB disclosures.  
In addition to being on track to achieve our previously announced target to reduce and offset 63% of our global refining greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 through investments in Board-approved projects, the report includes a new target to reduce and offset 100% of our global refining greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. These targets are consistent with our strategy as we continue to innovate and leverage our global liquid fuels platform to expand our long-term competitive advantage with investments in economic low-carbon projects.  
And now turning to our quarterly summary. Net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $162 million or $0.39 per share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.3 billion or $3.07 per share for the second quarter of 2020.  
Second quarter 2021 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $197 million or $0.48 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $504 million or $1.25 per share for the second quarter of 2020. For reconciliations to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany the earnings release.  
The Refining segment reported $349 million of operating income for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.8 billion for the second quarter of 2020. Second quarter 2021 adjusted operating income for the Refining segment was $361 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $383 million for the second quarter of 2020.  
Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2021 averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was 514,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2020. Throughput capacity utilization was 90% in the second quarter of 2021.  
Refining cash operating expenses of $4.13 per barrel were $0.26 per barrel lower than the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher throughput in the second quarter of 2021. 
The renewable diesel segment operating income was $248 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $129 million for the second quarter of 2020. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 923,000 gallons per day in the second quarter of 2021, which was 128,000 gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2020. The segment set another record for operating income and sales volumes.  
The ethanol segment reported operating income of $99 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $91 million for the second quarter of 2020. The second quarter 2020 adjusted operating loss was $20 million. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.2 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2021, which was 1.9 million gallons per day higher than the second quarter of 2020.  
For the second quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $176 million and net interest expense was $150 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $588 million, and income tax expense was $169 million for the second quarter of 2021.  
The effective tax rate was 37%, which was higher than our second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities, primarily as a result of an increase in the U.K. statutory tax rate that will be effective in 2023.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $1.1 billion and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $809 million.  
With regard to investing activities, we made $548 million of total capital investments in the second quarter of 2021, of which $252 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $296 million was for growing the business.  
Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $417 million in the second quarter of 2021. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $401 million to our stockholders in the second quarter of 2021 through our dividend, resulting in a payout ratio of 50% of adjusted net cash provided by the operating activities for the quarter.  
Earlier this month, our Board of Directors also approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share payable in the third quarter. And as Joe noted, we were able to cover all of our investing and financing activities, which includes our dividend and capital investments in the second quarter with cash provided by operating activities even without the benefit from the cash tax refund and the proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in the Pasadena terminal.  
With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.6 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 37%. At the end of June, we had $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. And over half of our growth capital in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business.  
For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.6 million to 1.65 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 435,000 to 455,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.45 per barrel. 
With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, with the anticipated start-up of DGD 2 in the middle of the fourth quarter, we expect sales volumes to average 1 million gallons per day in 2021.  
Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.  
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 3.7 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.43 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.  
For the third quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $590 million.  
For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million, and the annual effective tax rate should approximate the U.S. statutory rate.  
That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request the callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions.  [Operator Instructions]"

As you talked about -- Joe talked about mobility increasing in the second quarter. We saw good recovery in mobility in the domestic markets.

As you talked about -- Joe talked about mobility increasing in the second quarter. We saw good recovery in mobility in the domestic markets. And with the recovery in mobility, we saw on-road transportation fuel demand basically recovered to prepandemic levels.  
The issue we really had in the second quarter was the pace of recovery in the U.S. was just much faster than what we saw in most of the other major demand centers throughout the world. And so where our margins started to track up as demand improved, eventually, our market began to dislocate from the global markets, and we incentivized imports. And so we saw very high levels of imports later in the quarter, caused inventory to build.  
And as inventory built, we eventually saw margin destruction. I think the good news for us, as we go into the third quarter, is that at least the markets we have good visibility into, we're seeing mobility increase in those markets like we did in the U.S. in the second quarter. With the increase in mobility, we're seeing demand take off quite nicely.  
We certainly see that in our Canadian markets in the U.K. and the markets we go to in Latin America. And I think that's what you really need to have sustained margin recovery is the global market -- global demand to pick up.  
So thus far, in July, we've seen margins that are better than we saw in the second quarter. And so that's certainly encouraging. Then on the crude side, you talked a little bit about the differentials. I think you noticed -- see meaningful moves and the differentials we need OPEC barrels back on the market.  
Of course, it was good to hear OPEC plans to put 400,000 barrels a day back out on the market sometime post-August. And I think to some degree, the markets are already reflecting that. If you look at the heavy Canadian differentials in the Gulf today, on the fourth quarter has about $0.75 wider discounts than what we see in the problem market.  
Again, that $0.75 wider discounts in the face of backwardation in the Brent market. So if you look at that discount as a percent of Brent, it's a fairly meaningful move that we would see as we get later in the year."

I think if you step back and just think about our renewable diesel segment, right, our refining expertise has been a critical component to the development and operations of renewable diesel and ultimately, the success of that business.  
You have to also keep in mind that we were an early mover in the space and have accumulated decades worth of knowledge, which is a lot more than almost all of our peers. Our operating reliability has been very good, and that's helped differentiate Diamond Green. We also use the same reliability process at renewable diesel that we have applied to our refining system. 
And then finally, structurally on the pricing, Diamond Green as well as other producers, you would expect them to have stronger results when prices are going up, the RIN price, ULSD price going up. Because that value, you see immediately and it is going to be a lag in the cost of sales on the feedstock. So with this increasing price environment helped us somewhat."

So our June 30 cash balance was about $3.6 billion. So we're in line there. We're in a pretty good spot, and we're starting to working on the second problem, which is looking at our debt repayment. 
We said a few times before, we would look at redeeming this tranche of 3-year floaters that are callable as early as this fall. So that would likely be our first step. And that's still true. That's definitely something we're looking at. 
And then as we move forward, further into this year and beyond that, we'll continue to look at other liability management opportunities. And as earnings and cash generation continue to normalize, as you said, which is the way we hope things continue to move, we'll have increased optionality the more cash we have. 
But maintaining our credit ratings is also a priority for us. And we're targeting to have a net debt to cap around 3x in a normalized environment, which is consistent with where we were in the past. And we still have our long-term net debt to cap target of 20% to 30%. 
But to get more to your question, we also still remain committed to our capital allocation framework. Our shareholder payout ratio was 50% this quarter, and we continue to target this 40% to 50% ratio on an annual basis. 
We do expect to be able to meet that as we move forward through the recovery and beyond, even as we work on our deleveraging strategy. So we think we're going to be able to do both of them. I think it would be your answer. We're not in -- certainly not going to have to sacrifice the dividend, and I don't think we'll have to sacrifice the target, the 40% to 50% target either."

But it really has more of an impact than just the imports because we've also seen that we're, again, much more competitive in the Latin American markets. Not only was Europe export in the United States, but they were pushing into Latin America and causing us to lose some of the exports we typically send to that market. 
But as things have picked up in Europe, they're not only not sending barrels to the U.S., but we're seeing our exports ramp up in the Latin America. So what I would say is more normalization of trade flows, which will help inventories continue to draw and support better crack spreads."

So when we -- but the weekly data now in June, starting into May and through June, we've seen that turn the other way. So margins now are lower than they were in the second quarter. How long is this going to last? I'm not sure. We're starting to see some run cuts in the industry now. We've signaled some lower guidance for third quarter on runs versus what we did in second quarter. 
So we'll see where it turns. I mean, really, what we're looking at long term though in ethanol is carbon sequestration. And we feel like that is going to differentiate us from the industry between the 45Q tax credit, that's worth about $0.15 a gallon, getting into LCFS markets, that's more like $0.50 a gallon gross. 
So we're well positioned there with what we're doing with Navigator and BlackRock, and then we're also looking at some stand-alone projects that are Eastern ethanol plants for carbon sequestration.

I mean the U.S. recovered with the -- we were out -- our mobility had gone way up and it attracted imports from areas that were still essentially in lockdown.

They wanted to see investment in infrastructure in their country. and a lot of others are really not doing. They've kind of taking advantage of the legislation. We are investing in the country. And I think what we are doing in Mexico is exactly what was intended with the change in the regulation. So our strategy is still very much intact. Veracruz is fully operational now. 
We have our terminal in Mexico City, it was commissioned during the second quarter. We will commission our terminal in Puebla in the third quarter. We've also started to bring jet fuel into Veracruz and we'll start jet fuel sales in the third quarter as well. So things are going very well for us in Mexico. And Rich, I don't know, if you want to add anything?"

I think in terms of margin capture, what you'll see is, you -- coming out of it is going into it, we had contango, right? So as you -- there was structural contango in the crude markets, and as we're coming out of it, we've gone flat to slight backwardation. 
So I think what you'll see kind of moving ahead, you have a combination of slight backwardation and obviously, high flat price will cause some of the byproducts to -- maybe have some margin capture -- will affect margin capture. It doesn't really affect so much our ability to generate EBITDA as much as when you think of in terms of market capture. 
In terms of anything that's happened post pandemic, if anything, we just learned a lot more about how to manage our business even more carefully than we had before."

So we had placed orders before that happened. The delivery is good. I mean the shop space is there and the labor situation is really good on the Gulf Coast where we're building. So all those things and then just having an experience, we moved over experienced contractors from DGD 2 that had just built one of these units. So all the work, the structural work, the concrete work, structural steel is already going up. So we just got a really quick start out of the gates, and we expect to be able to maintain that.

There is a lot of noise on this, but when you really sort it all out, it comes down to EPA is going to have to issue these RVOs. They're clearly are kicking them out to get past a lot of the infrastructure discussion and not to have this issue rear up in the middle of their efforts to try to push forward the infrastructure deal. 
So we would expect that once you kind of clear this, EPA is going to have to issue an RVO. We're almost all the way through 2021. By the time they could get a rule posed and out, the year is almost going to -- almost certainly be passed it. So you're looking at maybe 2021-2022 combined rule or at least them coming out at the same time. 
And I think that will -- and the other reality is, they recognize that they need to set an RVO that's achievable and obtainable. So we expect them to do that. On the SREs, the Supreme Court ruling really focused on only one issue, was appealed up and that was on these continuity of the SRE ruling. 
The other aspects of the Tenth Circuit ruling that kick those SREs back to EPA are still there, and EPA has got them back under. And they haven't issued an SRE since 2018. So I think the prospect for SREs probably doesn't really change with the Supreme Court ruling and the EPA still got a whole host of other issues that they have to sort through that came out of the Tenth Circuit ruling that was -- that still stands. 
And so how do you guess what's going to happen on this. I mean the reality is they've just got a set attainable and achievable mandate, and that's what they'll have to do."

We saw significant improvement in refining margins globally in the third quarter as economic activity and mobility continued to recover in key markets. Refining margins were supported by strong recovery in product demand coupled with product inventories falling to low levels during the quarter. In fact, total U.S. light product inventories are now at 5-year lows and total light product demand is over 95% of the 2019 level. Across our system, current gasoline sales are at 95% of the 2019 level and diesel sales are 10% higher than in 2019. 
And on the crude oil side, medium and heavy sour crude oil differentials widened during the quarter as OPEC+ increased supply. Hurricane Ike resulted in some downtime at our St. Charles and Mero refineries and the Diamond Green Diesel plant. We immediately deployed emergency teams and supplies after the storm to help our employees, their families and the surrounding communities in the restoration and recovery effort. The affected facilities did not sustain significant damage from the storm. And once power and utilities were restored, the plants were successfully restarted. I'm very proud of our team's efforts and the ability to safely shut down and restart our operations. 
Despite the impacts of the hurricane, we also completed the Diamond Green Diesel expansion project, DGD 2, in the third quarter ahead of schedule and on budget and are in the process of starting up the new unit. DGD 2 increases renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year bringing DGD's total renewable diesel capacity to 690 million gallons per year. 
In addition, we successfully completed and started up the new Pembroke cogeneration unit in the third quarter, which is expected to provide an efficient and reliable source of electricity and steam and further enhance the refinery's competitiveness. 
Looking ahead, the DGD 3 project at our Port Arthur refinery continues to progress and is still expected to be operational in the first half of 2023. 
With the completion of this 470 million gallons per year plan, DGD's total annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. The large-scale carbon sequestration project with BlackRock and Navigator is also progressing on schedule. Navigator has received the necessary board approvals to proceed with the carbon capture pipeline system as a result of a successful binding open season. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with 8 ethanol plants connected to this system, which should provide a higher ethanol product margin uplift. 
The Port Arthur Coker project, which is expected to increase the refinery's utilization rate and improved turnaround efficiency is still expected to be completed in 2023. 
On the financial side, we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, which prioritizes a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. We redeemed the entire outstanding principal amount of our $575 million floating rate senior notes due in 2023 in the third quarter and we ended the quarter well capitalized with $3.5 billion of cash and $5.2 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
Looking ahead, we continue to have a favorable outlook on refining margins as a result of low global product inventories continued demand recovery and global balances supported by the significant refinery capacity rationalization seen over the last 1.5 years. 
In addition, the expected high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia through the winter should report liquid fuels demand as power generation facilities, industrial consumers and petrochemical producers see incentives to switch from natural gas to refinery oil products for feedstock and energy needs. 
Continued improvement in earnings of our core refining business, coupled with the ongoing expansion of our renewables businesses should strengthen our competitive advantage and drive long-term shareholder returns. 
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

Refining throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2021 averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 338,000 barrels per day higher than the third quarter of 2020. Throughput capacity utilization 91% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 80% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Refining cash operating expenses of $4.53 per barrel were $0.27 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. 
The renewable diesel segment operating income was $108 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $184 million for the third quarter of 2020. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 671,000 gallons per day in the third quarter of 2021, which was 199,000 gallons per day lower than the third quarter of 2020.
The lower operating income and sales volumes in the third quarter of 2021 are primarily attributed to plant downtime due to Hurricane Ida. 
The Ethanol segment reported a $44 million operating loss for the third quarter of '21 compared to $22 million of operating income for the third quarter of 2020. Excluding the adjustments shown in the accompanying earnings release tables, third quarter 2021 adjusted operating income was $4 million compared to $36 million for the third quarter of 2020. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2021, which was 175,000 gallons per day lower than the third quarter of 2020. 
For the third quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $195 million and net interest expense was $152 million. The Depreciation and amortization expense was $641 million and income tax expense was $65 million for the third quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate was 11%, which reflects the benefit from the portion of DGD's net income that is not taxable to us. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021.-- Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $379 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1 billion. 
With regard to investing activities, we made $585 million of total capital investments in the third quarter of 2021. Of which $191 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $394 million was for growing the business. 
Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $392 million in the third quarter of 2021. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $400 million to our stockholders in the third quarter of 2021 through our dividend resulting in a payout ratio of 40% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter. 
With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.2 billion, and cash equivalents were $3.5 billion. 
And as Joe mentioned earlier, we redeemed the entire outstanding principal amount of our $575 million floating rate senior notes due in 2023 in the third quarter. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 37%. And at the end of September, we had $5.2 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
Turning to guidance. We still expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. And over 60% of our growth capital in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. 
For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.67 million to 1.72 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 455,000 to 475,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 230,000 to 250,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 435,000 to 455,000 barrels per day. 
We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $4.70 per barrel. 
With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to average 1 million gallons per day in 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.2 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.43 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
For the fourth quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $600 million. 
For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million. 
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

We see gasoline and diesel demand returning to pre-pandemic levels. Our view is jet is probably is the latter part of the year before jet demand recovers to pre-pandemic levels. The real change on 2022 has come from the fact that inventories are just so low. Inventories domestically are low, but globally, they're low as well. And when you look at the fourth quarter turnaround activity, it's difficult for us to see that we're going to replenish clean product inventories before next year. And so going into next year with inventory is low. We're starting to move to a view that we could see some fairly strong crack spreads. I think in addition to that, the high-cost natural gas also comes into play. When you look at places around the world that are paying $30 million Btu for natural gas, it pressures that refining capacity and kind of raises the incremental crack spreads needed for them to run, which also pushes margins higher. So I would tell you that we probably came in looking at 2022, slightly below mid-cycle, and it's trending now more above mid-cycle type levels."

I think, yes, we've seen the LCFS prices rebound to $1.75 a metric ton now. I think some of that is due to the expectation again the second half data out second quarter of '21 data will be published at the end of the month. But if you go back and look, it's really obvious that deficits after 2019 just stopped increasing. And at that time, the carbon reduction goal was moving from 6.25% to 7.5% to 8.75%. So historically, each year, you'd see a step change in deficits. We've seen nothing happen since 2019, and credits are keeping up with deficits and the credit banks flat. So that kind of explains why the pricing went away. It's not an over-generation of credits. It's a lack of deficits. It's clear. And I think with the Delta variant now, hopefully in the rearview mirror and mobility improving we would expect to see some pretty big changes in the deficit picture in California going forward. And I think that's what the market is beginning to expect. 
As far as the renewable diesel economics of DGD, as we signaled, we expected the margins to moderate versus the record margins in the first half of 2021. Part of this is DGD 2 getting into the marketplace. We're impacting the waste feedstock market at this point because we're changing the flows. And any time you change the flows and change the inertia of the market, you're going to see a temporary increase in price. 
Once the new flows work through the market, we expect those prices to moderate. And I go back to what we always talk about the annual margins. We've been very consistent in the past 3 years. Our annual margins only moved from $2.18 a gallon to $2.37 a gallon in that 3-year period. And we believe that margin history is a good indication of what to expect in the future."

The -- I know you've got the cogen plant that helps you sort of mitigate things a little bit over in Europe As you step back and look at both your operations and think about it, you were somebody else, what are the options for mitigation of higher natural gas costs? I mean do you hedge, do you think others hedge? Another way to come at it is mentioned in the intro, Joe, I think you said was probably demand for some other liquid products. So what are the -- some of the ratios we should think about there as to how that could pull additional product demand?

One is, yes, we do -- we have completed our [indiscernible] project over in Pembrook so you'd sort of ask yourself, hey, at $30 gas, does it still work? And it does. I mean our fund -- FID economics on that unit was about $105,000 a day of benefit. And today, we're somewhere between $130,000 to $150,000 a day. And it just has to do with the who the marginal supplier of electricity in that market versus sort of an efficient cogen. So that's sort of the -- we have that margin that we have running it and it does help. Now a lot of the -- particularly in the U.K., a lot of those guys whether have cogent as Well. I don't know how efficient they are because that's where these relative economics lie is how efficient your Cogent is versus the marginal guy in that market. as Gary alluded to you earlier, what you're seeing is you need margin in the Atlantic Basin because there's a call on their capacity to essentially run oil and satisfy the market. So what that means is Europe and the U.K. are going to be very marginal in their economics, but that gives a -- gives a substantially larger market into people on this side of the Atlantic. 
In terms of ways to mitigate it through hedging, there's a few ways. One is you can just minimize gas, right? You can start burning propane, you can do other things, most of our refiners because of complexity were long gas. So we can always get into a place where we're just essentially deriving our natural gas requirements from oil. 
And so we play that arbitrage and signal around to try to see where that is. And the other thing is to use option strategies, you can go out and buy call options for gas and various ways of using options to mitigate your exposure? And then obviously, you can go out and buy the forward contract. I don't know how many people do that. It's an interesting question. We look at it all the time and we compare -- we look at it a little bit of insurance because it's not free, right? 
And so you have to take a view of my try and lower my exposure from a cost perspective, am I trying to prevent a shock. And so then, in other words, something like we saw during winter storm Uri or something like that. So you have to sort of frame what are you trying to do here? Because it isn't free. It doesn't translate into something that cost for somebody our size, ends up being just additional operating costs that we essentially paid to insurance. And so you have other ways to do. You can decide to fix or float as you're getting closer into the month. So there's a lot of tools in our tool back to mitigate this. But at the end of the day, to try to lock in lower prices going forward, there's almost always structural contango. If you look at the curve right now, it's kind of crazy looking. And so everybody's staring at this because you can see the futures activity in the first quarter. And so it's difficult, but there -- we do have tools to do that."

A lot of it depends on the fourth quarter, what happens in weather. But specifically on the trucking side, still a lot of companies struggling to find drivers to drive the trucks and get products moved around. So I think as we work through that and get drivers back to work, there is a chance that you see more highway demand for diesel, which is encouraging. 
On the jet side, we saw a nice step change in the third quarter. We were trending 71%, 72% of 2019 levels, and that jumped into the 80s. So that's nice to see. 
At that level, your kind of overall total light product demand is about 300,000 barrels a day below where it was in 2019, but you've got 675,000 barrels a day less refining capacity. So already, your really tighter supply-demand balances, at least domestically than we were pre-pandemic. And then we are seeing encouraging signs on the jet side. You look -- we don't have a lot of transparency there, but the nominations that we're seeing from the airlines that we supply seem to show that they're anticipating a pretty heavy holiday travel season. And so we would expect the uptick there with jet demand."

But the geology on the eastern side of the U.S. So this is Indiana and Ohio, is the Eastern side of the corn belt, I should say, is good for CCUS. So we're planning to do sequestration at the -- actually on site. 
So now that's going through our gated process and still hurdles to get through there, but that's the plan. So that's where we're headed on that. And we're excited about CCUS. It's a -- as you stated, the 45 Qs, an uplift of about $0.15 a gallon. And just on a gross basis, the low carbon getting to a 40 CI versus 70s worth almost $0.50 a gallon on a gross basis. 
So as far as -- if we look at demand for ethanol, we're feeling, I think, pretty good about maybe something happening with the fuel spec in the U.S. to get to a 95 [indiscernible] on higher efficiency engine, good for the autos, good for ethanol, good for oil. So we're kind of more optimistic about that than we probably have been in the past. That would increase the ethanol blending. The ethanol is definitely in the fuel mix to stay in the United States. And we're seeing now we're getting into the situation, too, with pretty good export demand again that's kind of picking back up post the big impacts of COVID. So we're pretty optimistic about the future there. But it's really what's driving our optimism is the low carbon. We're deep into corn fiber ethanol at this point, producing that at several sites and the outlook for the carbon sequestration."

The thing about SAP as it does require additional investment a fractionator at a minimum and maybe additional equipment beyond that. So the price of staff needs to be such to justify that incremental investment. So we're not waiting engineering-wise for the final outcome on the SaaS blenders tax credit, but we do think a favorable tax credit compared to the $1 a gallon that you get on the blenders tax credit. So a favorable one to that is likely needed to proceed beyond engineering. And as you say, it's not a question of if we're going to produce and sell SAP. it's a question of when.

But what you have to remember about that indication is it's based on the corn price and does not include the corn basis. In most years, that's a fine approximation to our corn cost. But due to the low corn stock ratio, the use of the stocks-to-use ratio this year basis was extremely high. If you look at some of the USDA reports, basis was $1, $1.20 a bushel. So that takes $0.30 to $0.40 out of the indicator. So at the end of the day, the indicator was just artificially high, and that kind of EBITDA was not achievable. So the good news is now with the new corn crop, while the [indiscernible] price is still high, the basis has broken. So those indicator margins you're seeing now, which are over $1 a gallon or pretty indicative of where the industry would be. So that's -- so it's not an ongoing issue. But this corn price is going to stay high. And we're going to go through this period probably again next year were basis as you get to the end of the corn crop really gets high. But right now, kind of the basis is broken. 
On DGD, the indicator was down to like $2.84 in the third quarter, pretty flat to second quarter. But on DGD. There's quite a few things moving. The first thing I would tell you, we signaled that we would have lower margins in the third quarter. Some of that was we expected this price -- as prices are going up, the product prices, fat prices, all that's going up. The RIN goes up immediately, but we've got a lag in our cost of goods with the fact. So when you break over and that price quits increasing or starts decreasing, then your RIN falls immediately and you're still consuming a higher priced feedstock. So we had some of that in the third quarter. 
The other thing that's happened in the third quarter is we were out buying for DGD 2. We're entering the market, and I went through that earlier. Anytime you go into the market in a big way and change these flows, you've got [indiscernible] the market, it's going to take a while for us to get back down.

I guess we're like somewhere around 37% total debt to cap. We'd like to push it back down closer to that 30% number we had. And you can do that in a multitude of ways. But anyway, that's 1 of our top priorities. And then we haven't given up on buybacks by any stretch of the imagination. We see them as playing a part in this capital allocation framework going forward. It's funny because you guys love us when we do it and then sometimes we do it and the price is high and the stock comes up and you say, ""Oh, why do you do buybacks, right?

I mean when you look at that, if you look at bean oil prices, soybean oil just look at any veg oil price and vet oil price, whether it's palm oil, bean oil or canola oil. That's the big 3 globally. They're -- they have doubled since the fall -- And all that was led by a shortage of palm oil. The palm oil stocks got low in Malaysia. So to put it in perspective, if you look at Malaysia and Indonesia palm oil, that production is 6x as large as soybean oil in United States. So palm oil drives veg oil pricing. So anytime you see soybean oil, just crude degum soybean oil move, it's a lot more about palm oil lately than anything else. 
So now that said, the waste feedstock price relative to soybean oil, as I said earlier, I think DGD has had an impact on that. It gets complicated because you get into all kinds of tallow and slaughter rates and the weight of animals and all this information, but we do expect that to come back out. Certainly, you've got a situation now where the waste feedstock prices are on an energy content or way above the value of corn on an energy content. So the people feeding waste oils are trying to figure out ways, not to feed waste oils. So we're still optimistic about waste feedstock in the future, and I'm really glad we have all this pretreatment capacity to handle it."

But what you have to remember that for Diamond Green Diesel, for our renewable diesel business, a high veg prices met with a higher DRAM. And the absolute veg oil pricing doesn't dictate margin for us and also the spread between RBD soybean oil and crude degum soybean oil does not impact EGD. So being in this waste position with robust pretreatment, just puts us in a lot better position and the guys that are coming in and running veg oils and not. So that position, I think, is going to be a little tough, but we feel pretty good about our position."

I'll take the question on the tax rate and then hand it over to Martin for your second question. Yes, the tax rate for the quarter does look low, it was 11%. It's a little challenging to tell you kind of what to expect in the future. But in the near future, I would say it would be somewhat under 21%. Just as a reminder, and as we said in the earnings release, you have to remember the impact that the DGD earnings have on the effective tax rate. So our consolidated pretax income includes 100% of DGD's income. And while tax expense only reflects taxes on a portion of that income, there's no tax expense on our share of the blenders tax credits included in DGD's income nor is there any tax on our partners half of DGD's income. So that impact is pretty -- has an out weighted impact on our overall effective rate. And I just also want to remind you that our partner share of DGD's income is excluded from our net income by backing it out of noncontrolling interest. So if you look at it just from a purely EPS or cash standpoint, the only benefit Valero getting is not being taxed on our share of the blenders tax credit, which is quite a bit lower than I think some of the analysts are thinking that it does. So what it tells you is that our results are not driven as much by the perceived tax benefit as they were by underlying recovery in margins. And so I'll hand it over to Martin."

We saw significant improvement in refining margins globally in the third quarter as economic activity and mobility continued to recover in key markets. Refining margins were supported by strong recovery in product demand, coupled with product inventories falling to low levels during the quarter. In fact, total U.S. light product inventories are now at 5-year lows and total light product demand is over 95% of the 2019 level. 
Across our system, current gasoline sales are at 95% of the 2019 level, and diesel sales are 10% higher than in 2019. And on the crude oil side, medium and heavy sour crude oil differentials widened during the quarter as OPEC+ increased supply. 
Hurricane Ida resulted in some downtime at our St. Charles and Meraux refineries and the Diamond Green Diesel plant. We immediately deployed emergency teams and supplies after the storm to help our employees, their families and the surrounding communities in the restoration and recovery effort. The affected facilities did not sustain significant damage from the storm. And once power and utilities were restored, the plants were successfully restarted. I'm very proud of our team's efforts and the ability to safely shut down and restart our operations.  
Despite the impacts of the hurricane, we also completed the Diamond Green Diesel expansion project, DGD 2, in the third quarter ahead of schedule and on budget and are in the process of starting up the new unit. DGD 2 increases renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year bringing DGD's total renewable diesel capacity to 690 million gallons per year.
In addition, we successfully completed and started up the new Pembroke Cogeneration Unit in the third quarter, which is expected to provide an efficient and reliable source of electricity and steam and further enhance the refinery's competitiveness. 
Looking ahead, the DGD 3 project at our Port Arthur refinery continues to progress and is still expected to be operational in the first half of 2023. With the completion of this 470 million gallons per year plan, DGD's total annual capacity is expected to be 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. 
The large-scale carbon sequestration project with BlackRock and Navigator is also progressing on schedule. Navigator has received the necessary board approvals to proceed with the carbon capture pipeline system as a result of a successful binding open season. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with 8 ethanol plants connected to this system, which should provide a higher ethanol product margin uplift.  
The Port Arthur Coker project, which is expected to increase the refinery's utilization rate and improve turnaround efficiency, is still expected to be completed in 2023.  
On the financial side, we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, which prioritizes a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. We redeemed the entire outstanding principal amount of our $575 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due in 2023 in the third quarter, and we ended the quarter well capitalized with $3.5 billion of cash and $5.2 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.  
Looking ahead, we continue to have a favorable outlook on refining margins as a result of low global product inventories, continued demand recovery and global balances supported by the significant refinery capacity rationalization seen over the last 1.5 years.
In addition, the expected high natural gas prices in Europe and Asia through the winter should further support liquid fuels demand as power generation facilities, industrial consumers and petrochemical producers see incentives to switch from natural gas to refinery oil products for feedstock and energy needs.  
Continued improvement in earnings of our core refining business, coupled with the ongoing expansion of our renewables businesses should strengthen our competitive advantage and drive long-term shareholder returns.  
So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you."

Throughput capacity utilization 91% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 80% in the third quarter of 2020. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.53 per barrel were $0.27 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. 
The renewable diesel segment operating income was $108 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $184 million for the third quarter of 2020. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 671,000 gallons per day in the third quarter of 2021, which was 199,000 gallons per day lower than the third quarter of 2020. The lower operating income and sales volumes in the third quarter of 2021 are primarily attributed to plant downtime due to Hurricane Ida. 
The ethanol segment reported a $44 million operating loss for the third quarter of '21 compared to $22 million of operating income for the third quarter of 2020. Excluding the adjustments shown in the accompanying earnings release tables, third quarter 2021 adjusted operating income was $4 million compared to $36 million for the third quarter of 2020. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2021, which was 175,000 gallons per day lower than the third quarter of 2020. 
For the third quarter of 2021, G&A expenses were $195 million and net interest expense was $152 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $641 million and income tax expense was $65 million for the third quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate was 11%, which reflects the benefit from the portion of DGD's net income that is not taxable to us. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the favorable impact from the change in working capital of $379 million and our joint venture partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1 billion. 
With regard to investing activities, we made $585 million of total capital investments in the third quarter of 2021, of which $191 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $394 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to our partner's 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $392 million in the third quarter of 2021. 
Moving to financing activities. We returned $400 million to our stockholders in the third quarter of 2021 through our dividend, resulting in a payout ratio of 40% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter. 
With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt and finance lease obligations were $14.2 billion, and cash equivalents were $3.5 billion. And as Joe mentioned earlier, we redeemed the entire outstanding principal amount of our $575 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due in 2023 in the third quarter. The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was 37%. And at the end of September, we had $5.2 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. 
Turning to guidance. We still expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2021 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About 60% of our capital investments is allocated to sustaining the business and 40% to growth. And over 60% of our growth capital in 2021 is allocated to expanding our renewable diesel business. 
For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.67 million to 1.72 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 455,000 to 475,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 230,000 to 250,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 435,000 to 455,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $4.70 per barrel. 
With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to average 1 million gallons per day in 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.15 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. 
Our ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.2 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.43 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense should be about $150 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $600 million. For 2021, we still expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $850 million. 
That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions]"

We see gasoline and diesel demand returning to pre-pandemic levels. Our view is jet is -- probably it's the latter part of the year before jet demand recovers to pre-pandemic levels. 
The real change on 2022 has come from the fact that inventories are just so low. Inventories domestically are low, but globally, they're low as well. And when you look at the fourth quarter turnaround activity, it's difficult for us to see that we're going to replenish clean product inventories before next year. And so going into next year with inventories low, we're starting to move to a view that we could see some fairly strong crack spreads. 
I think in addition to that, the high-cost natural gas also comes into play. When you look at places around the world that are paying $30 a million Btu for natural gas, it pressures that refining capacity and kind of raises the incremental crack spreads needed for them to run, which also pushes margins higher. So I would tell you that we probably came in looking at 2022 slightly below mid-cycle, and it's trending now more above mid-cycle type levels."

I would love to get an update on your outlook on renewable diesel economics as DGD 2 is now starting up.

I think, yes, we've seen the LCFS prices rebound to $1.75 a metric ton now. I think some of that is due to the expectation again the second half data out -- second quarter of '21 data will be published at the end of the month. But if you go back and look, it's really obvious that deficits after 2019 just stopped increasing. And at that time, the carbon reduction goal was moving from 6.25% to 7.5% to 8.75%. So historically, each year, you'd see a step change in deficits. 
We've seen nothing happen since 2019, and credits are keeping up with deficits and the credit banks flat, so that kind of explains why the pricing went away. It's not an over-generation of credits, it's a lack of deficits. It's clear. And I think with the Delta variant now hopefully in the rearview mirror and mobility improving, we would expect to see some pretty big changes in the deficit picture in California going forward. And I think that's what the market is beginning to expect. 
As far as the renewable diesel economics of DGD, as we had signaled, we expected the margins to moderate versus the record margins in the first half of 2021. Part of this is DGD 2 getting into the marketplace. We're impacting the waste feedstock market at this point because we're changing the flows. And any time you change the flows and change the inertia of the market, you're going to see a temporary increase in price. 
Once the new flows work through the market, we expect those prices to moderate. And I'd go back to what we always talk about, the annual margins. We've been very consistent in the past 3 years. Our annual margins only moved from $2.18 a gallon to $2.37 a gallon in that 3-year period. And we believe that margin history is a good indication of what to expect in the future."

The -- I know you've got the cogen plant that helps you sort of mitigate things a little bit over in Europe. As you step back and look at both your operations and think about it, you were somebody else, what are the options for mitigation of higher natural gas costs? I mean, do you hedge? Do you think others hedge? 
Another way to come at it is, mentioned in the intro, Joe, I think you said was probably demand for some other liquid products. So what are the -- some of the ratios we should think about there as to how that could pull additional product demand? And what are maybe trigger points for why you would do that over natural gas?"

So I'll take a shot at some of this. One is, yes, we do -- we have completed our cogen project over in Pembroke and so you'd sort of ask yourself, hey, at $30 gas, does it still even work?

One is, yes, we do -- we have completed our cogen project over in Pembroke and so you'd sort of ask yourself, hey, at $30 gas, does it still even work? And it does. I mean our fund -- our FID economics on that unit was about $105,000 a day of benefit. And today, we're somewhere between $130,000 to $150,000 a day. And it just has to do with the -- who the marginal supplier of electricity in that market versus sort of an efficient cogen. So that's sort of the -- we have that margin that we have running it and it does help. 
Now a lot of the -- particularly in the U.K., a lot of those guys who have cogent as well, I don't know how efficient they are, because that's where these relative economics lie, is how efficient your cogen is versus the marginal guy in that market. But as Gary alluded to you earlier, what you're seeing is you need margin in the Atlantic Basin because there's a call on their capacity to essentially run oil and satisfy the market. So what that means is Europe and the U.K. are going to be very marginal in their economics, but that give a bit -- that gives a substantially larger margin into people on this side of the Atlantic. 
In terms of ways to mitigate it through hedging, there's a few ways. One is you can just minimize gas, right? You can start burning propane, you can do other things. I mean most of our refiners because of their complexity were low on gas. So we can always get into a place where we're just essentially deriving our natural gas requirements from oil. And so we play that arbitrage and signal around to try to see where that is. 
And the other thing is to use option strategies, you can go out and buy call options for gas and various ways of using options to mitigate your exposure. And then obviously, you can go out and buy a forward contract. I don't know how many people do that. It's an interesting question. We look at it all the time and we compare -- we look at it a little bit as insurance because it's not free, right? And so you have to take a view of am I trying to use this to lower my exposure from a cost perspective, am I trying to prevent a shock. 
And so then, in other words, something like we saw during Winter Storm Uri or something like that. So you have to sort of frame what are you trying to do here? Because it isn't free and if it doesn't translate into something -- that cost for somebody our size ends up being just additional operating costs that we essentially paid as insurance. 
And so you have other ways to do. You can decide to fix or float as you're getting closer into the month. So there's a lot of tools in our toolbox to mitigate this. But at the end of the day, to try to lock in lower prices going forward, there's almost always structural contango. If you look at the curve right now, it's kind of crazy looking. And so everybody's staring at this because you can see the futures activity in the first quarter. And so it's difficult, but there -- we do have tools to do that."

A lot of it depends on the fourth quarter, what happens in weather. But specifically on the trucking side, still a lot of companies struggling to find drivers to drive the trucks and get products moved around. So I think as we work through that and get drivers back to work, there is a chance that you see more highway demand for diesel, which is encouraging. 
On the jet side, we saw a nice step change in the third quarter. We were trending 71%, 72% of 2019 levels, and that jumped into the 80s. So that's nice to see. At that level, your kind of overall total light product demand is about 300,000 barrels a day below where it was in 2019, but you've got 675,000 barrels a day less refining capacity. So already really tighter supply-demand balances, at least domestically than we were pre-pandemic. 
And then we are seeing encouraging signs on the jet side. You look -- we don't have a lot of transparency there, but the nominations that we're seeing from the airlines that we supply seem to show that they're anticipating a pretty heavy holiday travel season.

So we're planning to do sequestration at the -- actually on site. 
So now that's going through our gated process and still hurdles to get through there, but that's the plan. So that's where we're headed on that. And we're excited about CCUS. It's a -- as you stated, the 45Qs uplift of about $0.15 a gallon. And just on a gross basis, the low carbon getting to a 40 CI versus 70 is worth almost $0.50 a gallon on a gross basis. 
So as far as -- if we look at demand for ethanol, we're feeling, I think, pretty good about maybe something happening with the fuel spec in the U.S. to get to a 95 RON, higher efficiency engine, good for the autos, good for ethanol, good for oil. So we're kind of more optimistic about that than we probably have been in the past. That would increase the ethanol blending. The ethanol is definitely in the fuel mix to stay in the United States. 
And we're seeing now we're getting into the situation, too, with pretty good export demand again that's kind of picking back up post the big impacts of COVID. So we're pretty optimistic about the future there. But it's really what's driving our optimism is the low carbon. We're deep into corn fiber ethanol at this point, producing that at several sites and the outlook for the carbon sequestration."

The thing about SAF is it does require additional investment, a fractionator at a minimum and maybe additional equipment beyond that. So the price of SAF needs to be such to justify that incremental investment. So we're not waiting engineering-wise for the final outcome on the SAF blenders tax credit, but we do think a favorable tax credit compared to the $1 a gallon that you get on the blenders tax credit, so a favorable one to that is likely needed to proceed beyond engineering. 
And as you say, it's not a question of if we're going to produce and sell SAF, it's a question of when. But again, we're looking for positive incremental EBITDA out of this and not just to do it. So that's kind of what the holdup is right now."

Paul, I might need some help in keeping those straight. Here we go. I'm going to start with that ethanol. You're busted, Paul Cheng.
So the third quarter, as you stated, the indicator margin was $0.70 a gallon, which was up $0.30 a gallon versus the second quarter. But what you have to remember about that indication is it's based on the CBOT corn price and does not include the corn basis. In most years, that's a fine approximation to our corn cost. But due to the low corn to stock ratio, the use to -- the stocks-to-use ratio this year basis was extremely high. If you look at some of the USDA reports, basis was $1, $1.20 a bushel. So that takes $0.30 to $0.40 out of the indicator. So at the end of the day, the indicator was just artificially high and that kind of -- EBITDA was not achievable. 
So the good news is now with the new corn crop, while the CBOT price is still high, the basis has broken. So those indicator margins you're seeing now, which are over $1 a gallon, are pretty indicative of where the industry would be. So that's -- so it's not an ongoing issue. But this corn price is going to stay high. And we're going to go through this period probably again next year where basis, as you get to the end of the corn crop, really gets high. But right now, kind of the basis is broken. 
On DGD, the indicator was down to like $2.84 in the third quarter, pretty flat to second quarter. But on DGD, there's quite a few things moving. The first thing I would tell you, we signaled that we would have lower margins in the third quarter. Some of that was we expected as prices -- as prices are going up, the product prices, fat prices, all that's going up. The RIN goes up immediately, but we've got a lag in our cost of goods with the fat. So when you break over and that price quits increasing or starts decreasing, then your RIN falls immediately and you're still consuming a higher-priced feedstock. So we had some of that in the third quarter. 
The other thing that's happened in the third quarter is we were out buying for DGD 2. We're entering the market, and I went through that earlier, anytime you go into the market in a big way and change these flows, you've got inertia the market, it's going to take a while for us to get back down. So we expect these waste feedstock prices, how they price relative to soybean oil, to come off and we're seeing a little good news there now. So we expect that to correct itself, too. And I'm trying to think what else I missed here."

So we'll continue to look at it going forward. 
And he laid out the priorities really for our use of cash as we go forward. And he wants to delever a little bit. I guess we're like somewhere around 37% total debt to cap. We'd like to push it back down closer to that 30% number we had, and you can do that in a multitude of ways. But anyway, that's one of our top priorities. 
And then we haven't given up on buybacks by any stretch of the imagination. We see them as playing a part in this capital allocation framework going forward. It's funny because you guys love us when we do it. And then sometimes we do it and the price is high and the stock comes up and you say, ""Oh, why do you do buybacks, right?"" So anyway, it's a fine balancing act for us. And I think if you just revert back to the capital allocation framework and the way we've executed it in the past, I think right now, that's our plan for execution going forward."

And then just a follow-up for Martin on the dynamics in the renewable diesel space. So this may have been a coincidence. But at the time that DGD and a competitor plant in the same area we're down, the whole complex of bean oil and waste oils came down, too. And some people interpreted that as a signal of sort of just how tight the market is, right? A couple of plants can bring down that complex by $0.20 a pound. Was your -- is your feeling the same thing? Or was that just a coincidence? And there's actually some spare capacity in feedstock that's underappreciated."

It's a coincidence on -- definitely on the bean oil side. I mean when you look at that, if you look at bean oil prices, soybean oil, just look at any veg oil price -- and veg oil price, whether it's palm oil, bean oil or canola oil, that's the big 3 globally, they're -- they have doubled since the fall of 2019. And all that was led by a shortage of palm oil. The palm oil stocks got low in Malaysia. So to put it in perspective, if you look at Malaysia and Indonesia palm oil, that production is 6x as large as soybean oil in the United States. So palm oil drives veg oil pricing. So anytime you see soybean oil, just crude degummed soybean oil move, it's a lot more about palm oil likely than anything else. 
So now that said, the waste feedstock price relative to soybean oil, as I said earlier, I think DGD has had an impact on that. It gets complicated because you get into all kinds of tallow and slaughter rates and the weight of animals and all this information, but we do expect that to come back out. Certainly, you've got a situation now where the waste feedstock prices are on an energy content or way above the value of corn on an energy content, so the people feeding waste oils are trying to figure out ways not to feed waste oils. So we're still optimistic about waste feedstock in the future, and I'm really glad we have all this pretreatment capacity to handle it."

But over the last 12 months, we've seen a lot of headlines about potential capacity additions in renewable diesel. But I think we've also seen a shift amongst a lot of those additions towards what I would characterize as kind of a capital-light entry to renewable diesel, targeting vegetable oils and avoiding the cost of pretreatment facilities. So how do you see these trends impacting RD markets over the next few years, given your increasingly differentiated position on feedstock flexibility and sourcing?"

So there's a little bit of a veg oil issue that's been coming for years. So we don't see the veg oil prices moderating. 
But what you have to remember that for Diamond Green Diesel, for our renewable diesel business, a high veg oil price is met with a higher D4 RIN, and the absolute veg oil pricing doesn't dictate margin for us. And also the spread between RBD soybean oil and crude degummed soybean oil does not impact DGD. So being in this waste feedstock position with robust pretreatment just puts us in a lot better position, and the guys that are coming in and running veg oils are not. So that position, I think, is going to be a little tough, but we feel pretty good about our position."

And then we spent the last 10 years plus just getting the assets up to a standard that we were comfortable operating in. And we realized that any acquisition like that, that we would make, we would end up going through the same process. 
And so it would have to be an incredibly compelling case for us to give that any consideration. And so although we continue to look at what's in the market just to be sure we don't miss opportunities, I wouldn't anticipate that you should expect us to be doing anything on that front.

I'll take the question on the tax rate and then hand it over to Martin for your second question. Yes, the tax rate for the quarter does look low, it was 11%. It's a little challenging to tell you kind of what to expect in the future. But in the near future, I would say it would be somewhat under 21%. 
Just as a reminder and as we said in the earnings release, you have to remember the impact that the DGD earnings have on the effective tax rate. So our consolidated pretax income includes 100% of DGD's income. And while tax expense only reflects taxes on a portion of that income. There's no tax expense on our share of the blenders tax credits included in DGD's income, nor is there any tax on our partners half of DGD's income. So that impact is pretty -- has an out-weighted impact on our overall effective rate. 
And I just also want to remind you that our partner's share of DGD's income is excluded from our net income by backing it out in noncontrolling interest. So if you look at it just from a purely EPS or cash standpoint, the only benefit Valero getting is not being taxed on our share of the blenders tax credit, which is quite a bit lower than I think some of the analysts are thinking it is. So what it tells you is that our results are not driven as much by the perceived tax benefit as they were by underlying recovery in margins. And so I'll hand it over to Martin."

And I think as this -- as we get out of the COVID and the Delta variant and back to work, and we've got a big data lag right now in California, right, we don't know what second quarter that is. We'll know that at the end of October. 
So -- but -- so we -- and credit prices are up. They've hit a low of, what, [indiscernible] $158 a ton, now they're $175.
