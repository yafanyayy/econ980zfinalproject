As we all know, we're still experiencing hard times in many regions as COVID cases continue and new variants of the virus emerge. But I hope you share my optimism that with progress on vaccinations and continued to adhere on the safety protocols, better days are ahead. 
The year 2020 will be remembered for COVID-19, but for Zoetis, it also reaffirmed the resilience of our business, the essential nature of animal health and the agility and dedication of our colleagues in the face of industry and personal challenges. 
Throughout the year, we successfully ensured colleague safety and maintained reliable supply for our customers. We kept driving innovation and strengthening our diverse portfolio of 13 blockbusters and more than 300 product lines across 8 species and 7 major product categories. 
We successfully launched our triple combination parasiticide Simparica Trio. We also achieved approvals for the first ever long-acting monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats. With [indiscernible] authorization for dogs in the European Union and several other markets and Solensia's first authorization for cats in Switzerland. 
We also continued to build on our vaccine portfolio in livestock, with the approval of our CircoMax Myco swine vaccine in the European Union. And in poultry, we continued advancing our recombinant vector vaccines with the approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT-IBD in the U.S. 
Meanwhile, in diagnostics, we successfully launched Vetscan Images, a breakthrough platform using cloud-based Artificial Intelligence for veterinary clinics. We were able to do all this while staying anchored to our purpose and advancing the 5 long-term priorities that I set out at the beginning of the year, including sustainability, where we made important progress in our ESG programs and metric reporting. We look forward to sharing our long-term ESG goals in the coming weeks. 
And finally, we delivered financial results for 2020 that were in line with the guidance we provided last February before the impact of the global pandemic was known. For the full year, we generated 9% operational growth in revenue, primarily based on new products in our containment animal business, the continued strength of our key dermatology portfolio and growth in China. 
As part of our long-term value proposition, we once again grew revenues faster than the anticipated growth for 2020 and faster than historical industry rates of 4% to 6%. As part of our value proposition, we also delivered on growing our adjusted net income faster than revenue. 
For the full year, we delivered operational growth of 10% in adjusted net income, while adapting our operations with the pandemic and continuing investments in our pipeline and new product launches. We generated strong fourth quarter results, which Glenn will discuss in a minute, and these performance trends give us confidence in our growth drivers and strong momentum for 2021. 
We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in 2021, driven by ongoing strength in pet care, continued expansion in markets outside the U.S., most notably China, and acceleration of our diagnostics portfolio penetration. We are guiding to operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue for full year 2021. 
Growth expectations for the companion animal market are in the mid-single digits, and we expect Zoetis to grow significantly faster than that based on the continued uptake of Simparica Trio, the strength of our key dermatology portfolio and the launch of monoclonal antibodies in markets outside the U.S.. 
Positive petcare trends during the dynamic, based on increased adoptions and people spending more time with their pets, should continue driving market growth in the near term. Data in the U.S. shows visits to veterinary clinics have rebounded, and the average revenue per visit has continued to increase. Over the long term, we see these trends moderating as adoption rates normalize and people eventually return to the workplace. 
The specialty care regimens and chronic care treatments that began in the pandemic should continue. And our innovative portfolio across dermatology, parasiticides, pain, vaccines and diagnostics have us well positioned for continued growth and capturing share as these shifts occur. 
In terms of the livestock market, we expect low single-digit market growth in 2021 as the impact from COVID-19 will still be felt and a number of products experienced loss of exclusivity. We expect Zoetis to grow in line with the market, even as we face increased headwinds from generic competition for DRAXXIN, our leading anti-infective product. We are confident we can leverage our life cycle innovation strategies, together with the overall diversity of our livestock portfolio, including swine product sales in China, to help us address the loss of exclusivity for DRAXXIN and maintain livestock growth that will support our 2021 guidance. 
Longer term, we will continue to invest in livestock inhibitions and data-driven animal agricultural solutions. As we continue through 2021, we will be building on the progress against our 5 priorities: driving innovative growth; enhancing customer experience; leading in digital and data analytics; cultivating a high-performing organization; and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. 
Our investment plans and focus on growth for 2021 include: continuing the successful launch of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and other markets as well as the ongoing adoption of other new parasiticides, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12; driving growth in dermatology through increased use of direct-to-consumer advertising and disease awareness campaigns in the U.S. and globally. Our focus remains on growing this market and increasing customer loyalty to our innovative treatments, which we expect to help us top $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. 
As noted earlier, we will be investing in the launch of the first monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in Europe in the first half of 2021 and advancing the regulatory process in the U.S. and other markets. While we remain confident in the eventual U.S. approval of these products, based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted, at this point, we believe it is unlikely we will receive approvals for Solensia or Librela in the U.S. in 2021. We continue to work through regulatory reviews and manufacturing inspections with the FDA, and we will continue to keep you updated on this process on future calls. 
And finally, we're continuing our development of digital and data solutions that will support more individualized animal care and more efficient and sustainable operations for producers. 
In conclusion, I'm incredibly proud of what our people accomplished in the face of such uncertainty during 2020, and it gives me great confidence in our continued success and full year guidance for 2021. 
As we navigate through recovery from the global pandemic and capitalize on the growth opportunities we see ahead, by optimism comes from what rob us over the last year: the resilience and essential nature of the animal health industry, the diversity, innovation and market leadership of our portfolio and the agility and passion of our colleagues to face any challenge. 
Now let me hand it off to Glenn, who will speak more about our fourth quarter results and guidance for the full year 2021."
215548781,699818857,2212175,"Zoetis Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2021",2021-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.7 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 9% operati",2201,"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.7 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. 
Full year revenue grew 9% operationally and 7% on a reported basis, with adjusted net income increasing 10% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. Going deeper into the numbers, price contributed 2% to full year operational revenue growth, with volume contributing 7%. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions, with other in-line products flat for the year. 
We, again, saw broad-based revenue growth, with the U.S. growing 11% and international growing 7% operationally. The innovation we brought to the market and the diversity of our portfolio was key to our strong performance as companion animal grew 17%, while livestock was flat on a year-over-year basis. 
Performance in companion animal was led by our parasiticide portfolio, bolstered by the launch of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $170 million. This added approximately $150 million of incremental revenue and exceeded our expectations set prior to the pandemic. 
Sales of Simparica also grew double digits for the year, with operational revenue growth of 16%. Our key dermatology portfolio demonstrated continued strength in 2020, growing 23% operationally, generating revenue of $925 million and increasing more than $170 million versus prior year. 
The COVID-19 pandemic created a difficult market environment for livestock. However, we are encouraged by the resiliency displayed in 2020. We remained optimistic that global livestock will return to modest growth in 2021, as the recovery from African Swine Fever in China continues and consumption patterns normalize. 
Operational growth and adjusted net income of 10% was driven mainly by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. 
Now moving on to our Q4 financial results, where we posted another strong quarter, with revenue of $1.8 billion, representing an increase of 9% operationally and 8% reported. Adjusted net income of $438 million is an increase of 3% operationally and flat on a reported basis. 
Operational revenue grew 9%, with 2% from price and 7% from volume. Volume growth of 7% consisted of 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 1% from other in-line products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 25% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal parasiticides grew 52% in the quarter, gaining market share in the U.S. of more than 7% within the flea, tick and heartworm segment versus the same period in the prior year. This includes the continued adoption of Simparica Trio, which generated sales of $60 million in Q4. 
Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, again, had significant global growth in the quarter with $257 million of revenue, representing 27% operational growth versus an extremely difficult comparative period in which key derm grew 29% for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our diagnostics portfolio, again, made positive contributions to revenue with reference lab expansion and double-digit growth in consumable and instrument revenue. The recovery in wellness visits continued to be a catalyst for growth following the slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. 
As we noted on our previous earnings call, the early fall cattle run pulled a portion of fourth quarter sales into the third quarter leading to a weaker quarter in cattle than we would typically expect. This was the primary driver of the 5% operational decline in livestock for the fourth quarter. 
For the remainder of the livestock portfolio, swine posted a second consecutive quarter of growth, with the herd rebuild continuing in key accounts as the market recovers from African Swine Fever in China. Our aquaculture business grew high single digits in the quarter, and along with swine, partially offset the decline in cattle and poultry. 
Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 11%, with companion animal products growing 30% and livestock sales declining by 15%. For companion animal, the positive trends at the vet clinic continued in Q4 with patient visits up 2% and revenue per visit increasing by 13%. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales of our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We maintained an increased investment in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas and continue to see a good return on that investment. 
Simparica Trio performed well again in the quarter with sales of $56 million. We remained extremely encouraged for the future growth of our product and the growth of the overall market segment as a material portion of Trio sales came from new patients to the category. 
Key dermatology sales were $176 million for the quarter, growing 32%, with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics. 
Companion animal diagnostics sales increased 22% in the quarter as a result of reference lab expansion and growth in point-of-care instruments and consumables. U.S. livestock declined 15% in the quarter, driven primarily by cattle, which had a portion of Q4 sales pulled into the third quarter as a result of the earlier movement from pass-through to [indiscernible]. The remaining species declined as well, with COVID-19 and pricing pressure negatively impacting our swine business. 
Poultry declines are largely attributed to product rotation and less producer profitability, leading to reduced uses of our premium products. 
To summarize U.S. performance, innovation and return on investment once again drove exceptionally strong growth in companion animal. While livestock was down in the quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. 
Revenue in our International segment grew 7% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and key dermatology products. 
Parasiticide growth in the quarter was again driven by the Simparica franchise with further adoption of Simparica Trio. In Q4, we observed a series of favorable market trends, such as increased pet ownership and medicalization rates in Asia. Overall, companion animal grew in every major market, except Italy and the U.K., which had arguably the strictest lockdown protocols. Companion animal diagnostics grew 16% in the quarter, led by an increase in point-of-care consumable usage. 
Swine revenue grew 14% operationally, posting a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Swine sales in China grew in excess of 100% for the second straight quarter. Key accounts expanded their use of vaccines and other products as they continue to rebuild herds from smaller farms to large-scale operations. China total products grew 45% operationally in the quarter and 34% operationally for 2020. 
Brazil was also a significant contributor to international growth in the quarter, growing 18% operationally. For the fourth quarter and full year 2020, Brazil delivered double-digit growth in all species, except poultry, which modestly declined. 
Overall, our International segment delivered strong results despite the challenges presented by COVID-19. Our diversity across products and geographies enabled our International segment to again be a significant driver of growth. 
Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.7% fell 80 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from other manufacturing costs, inventory charges, recent acquisitions and elevated freight expense. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased 10% operationally, resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio and Apoquel, partially offset by T&E savings. Return on investment from our DTC campaigns has been very favorable and will remain an important investment to support future growth of the business. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points, driven by the impact of net discrete tax benefits, partially offset by jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter grew 3% operationally. 
In December, we announced a 25% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In addition, we resumed our share repurchase program in January with $1.4 billion of remaining capacity under the current authorization. 
Now moving on to guidance for 2021. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. For 2021, we are projecting revenue between $7.4 billion and $7.55 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We are expecting foreign exchange favorability in 2021 of approximately 200 basis points. We expect companion animal to be the primary driver of growth in 2021, with the continued strength of our diverse parasiticide portfolio, which includes full year Simparica Trio sales. 
We believe market dynamics for companion animal will remain strong in 2021, allowing for further expansion of our key dermatology products as well as our diagnostics offerings, which we anticipate will grow faster than the overall animal health market. 
While we expect the pace of certain trends that accelerated in 2020 to moderate, such as increased spend per visit, our view is that 2020 has established a higher base for future growth. We anticipate livestock will return to global growth in 2021, primarily driven by more normalized food consumption patterns. Geographically, we expect total company sales growth to be relatively balanced between our U.S. and International segments. However, we do expect continued and meaningful growth in China and other emerging markets. 
I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with dermatology, our guidance does not assume a meaningful competitive entry in 2021. And  with continued investment behind the franchise, we believe revenue will exceed $1 billion for the full year. We also do not assume a triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2021 to compete against Simparica Trio. 
We're extremely excited about our monoclonal antibodies for pain with both Librela and Solensia having long-term blockbuster potential. However, as Kristin mentioned, while both products will launch in the first half of 2021 in the EU and other international markets, we do not currently expect either product to receive approval in the U.S. this year. 
For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 30%, which is relatively consistent with our cost of sales in 2020. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $1.775 billion and $1.85 billion, with the increase in 2020, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including recent and future product launches, key brands, and recent acquisitions and reference lab expansion in diagnostics. 
Adjusted R&D expense for 2021 is expected to be between $500 million and $520 million as we remain committed to investing in pipeline opportunities for new therapies and life cycle innovation. Adjusted interest and other income deduction is expected to be approximately $260 million, with the increase over 2020, driven by increased interest expense as well as lower interest income. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2021 is primarily related to the impact of favorable nonrecurring discrete items that occurred in 2020. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.13 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 12%. 
Our guidance reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, during the year when we'll be making meaningful investments to support future growth. Consistent with 2020, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures in 2021 to support investments in manufacturing focused on internal sourcing of API, capacity increases and facilities to support pipeline opportunities. We're also investing in Information Technology to support our recent acquisitions as well as digital capabilities and data analytics. 
Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.36 to $4.46 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14. While guidance represents full year expectations, we do anticipate growth will be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. This is largely due to full year Simparica Trio sales and a favorable comparison versus Q2 2020 as a result of COVID-19. 
To summarize, 2020 was another exceptional year in which we delivered 9% operational revenue growth and 10% operational growth in adjusted net income in the year that presented a unique set of challenges. Our guidance for 2021 highlights our ability to grow revenue organically above the market and grow adjusted net income faster than revenue even during times of elevated investment. 
Before turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to express how proud I am of our colleagues and all we've accomplished amidst an unprecedented set of circumstances. While there is no assurance that the new year will be without similar challenges faced in 2020, we cannot be more excited about the opportunity to again deliver on our long-term shareholder value proposition.

Most -- for the quarter, 4Q '20 gross margins were a bit below despite big companion animal growth. And next year, it seems like you're guiding to flattish, call it, gross margins again, despite what seems like positive mix shift. 
So Glenn, can you talk about that a bit? Why are we not seeing a bit more in gross margin considering the companion animal performance? And is expanding gross margin still a part of the long term story? And then I'll stick with sort of guidance. Just really big numbers on 2021 guidance out of the gate. You talked to livestock versus companion. Can you talk to the components of companion animal a little bit more? I don't know if I specifically heard a Trio number, but is it safe to assume Trio of $400 million plus in any other components you'd call out?"

So first, when you look at the gross margin expectation for 2021, it is relatively flat versus 2020. As you mentioned, the mix with companion animal will be beneficial as we move into 2021.

As you mentioned, the mix with companion animal will be beneficial as we move into 2021. Some of the offsets to that, though were some of the investments that we're making in other areas such as reference labs, which come at a lower margin, particularly in the early stage of their life cycle as we're building those labs, the margins will be a little lower until they reach their full operating scale. So that's some of the offsets. So there are some positives in terms of the companion animal mix, some offsets there with some of the longer terms we're investing and making in other areas. 
In terms of the drivers of companion animal growth, so obviously, we do expect Trio to be a significant driver of growth for 2021. We're not putting a specific number on Trio, but we would expect the contribution from growth in 2021 to be at least as big as what we achieved in 2020. So that will obviously be one of the drivers. 
Also, continued growth in our dermatology portfolio. We saw a very strong performance in 2020, with 23% growth in that portfolio operationally for the year. We do expect that portfolio will exceed $1 billion as we move into 2021. 
Also in companion animal diagnostics, we expect very rapid growth in diagnostics as well. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 20% growth and we expect that will help carry us forward with the strong momentum that we had in the quarter into 2021 as well as strong performance that we're seeing in many of our emerging markets, such as China and Brazil. So those are some of the factors that are driving the strong companion animal growth."

And then broader on livestock, we've read a lot about input costs going high and producers in some markets, poultry and swine. How does that factor into your outlook for low single-digit growth? 
And then second question would be just a little bit more on the companion animal expectations for 2020. I mean, obviously, you're growing well above the market. But any thoughts on sort of in line portfolio? And you commented on Trio, you commented on strong term strength? And what you see in Agro. But just could you sort of comment on Revolution Plus?

So starting on DRAXXIN, we are expecting a number of competitors to enter in the U.S. market. Again, the LOE is this month, so it hasn't happened yet. I would say more probably entrants than we expected a few months ago, but we don't think that will last, obviously. I think the market will shake out, obviously, to a few. 
As we said previously, quickly, we expect about -- to lose about 20% to 40% share over several years. In the case of DRAXXIN, given the large number of competitors, we do expect that to be faster, but we don't really expect it to be overall different. 
And really, partly what drives that, I think, is we do believe that a lower price on DRAXXIN will expand the market for macro life overall. And therefore, the market itself will grow. We also think we're positioned well from a broad portfolio, strong technical. We do expect that the price to come down in the 20% to 40%. That is an expectation. 
But as we said, this is all baked in right now to our guidance. So the expectations around where DRAXXIN is going to be is there. And if you look at livestock, you referenced some of the info costs. As you heard in some of our opening remarks, we are expecting low single-digit growth, so a return to growth in livestock overall.  Some of that will be led in the U.S. and sort of certain species, but a lot of that will be led outside the U.S. 
As a reminder, about 60% of our livestock business is outside of the U.S. and we're seeing incredible growth right now in China and some other markets, Brazil, et cetera. So overall, we do think some of the input costs in the U.S. will be a pressure. But we have -- given the diversity of our portfolio, looking at some large markets, our second largest market is China, our third largest market is Brazil, we do see strength in livestock there. So we overall do believe livestock will return to low single-digit growth in 2021.

But then there are other products that round out the portfolio of products such as ProHeart 12, products such as Revolution Plus. Also the growth that we're seeing in markets like China, where companion animal is growing very rapidly, markets like Brazil. So there are really many areas of growth that we see.

China is still going to be importing a decent amount, probably less than, in 2020. from other markets around the world, sort of maintaining that. We're also hopeful that you'll see an increase in dine out, which will send signal to the industry to expand herds. 
So 2020 was obviously hit with many different factors, but do see both an increase in demand and in markets where our technology don't really leverage some of the emerging markets, we're seeing significant uptick there. There will remain challenges in some of the U.S. producers obviously, for some of the inflow costs, et cetera. But we do believe you'll see more of a return to normalcy as we move into 2021, and that's why we're guiding at sort of the low single digits.

And Solensia, we continue to expect approval in the EU in the first half of this year to be launching sort of midyear. We already do have approval on Solensia in Switzerland. And we remain confident in the eventual approval based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted in the U.S. 
But as you saw in our remarks and our release, the approval timeline has moved out a bit. We believe this has to do with the fact that this is the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA and Animal Health. Our previous one, Cytopoint, was actually USDA. It's making it a little harder for us, honestly, to predict some with the regulatory process. We're continuing to work through the regulatory process and manufacturing inspections, and we'll continue to keep you updated.

Not only did we exceed our goals for Trio with $170 million in sales in the year, but we also saw significant growth in Simparica, which really exceeded our expectations. 
So we grew operationally 16% with Simparica. What we saw was that the advertising and driving patients into the clinic for Simparica Trio actually benefited the overall portfolio. We also saw very positive growth in ProHeart 12 as well.

If you look at the potential for the product, the 2 competitors, Nexgard and Bravecto, are each $600 million product to date. So we continue to believe there's significant growth. We are -- we remain under indexed, to be honest with you, in carcinoid. So we continue to see this as a significant part of our overall gross growth. 
From expensive -- are there synergies with derm? Not really is what I would say, except for on the cost side, obviously, we can get better buying power when you replace CTCs by leveraging the spend across both but beyond that, we don't see strong synergies, honestly, between the DTC online affecting the other unless our clinic has to carry bolts and things like that.

Librela is entering a market that's $400 million today. So it's an established market. So I think the ability for people are already bringing their dogs in for OA pain. 
So I think we have the opportunity with Librela to expand the number of patients, given the safety and efficacy profile and the compliance benefits of the product. I think we can also increase days on therapy, which also helps us grow the market. And then obviously, price, to your point, so it is priced at a premium to many of the products on the market today. It is not, obviously -- we don't have a price in the U.S. since we don't have an approval yet in the U.S. 
I think Solensia is going to be a little bit different. I think the curve is going to take a little longer. And that has to do the fact that there really isn't a market today in most parts of the world. If you had a casual hit, there really was no treatment. So cat owners have kind of been conditions to not bring their cats in. We've started focusing, about 1 year ago, to try to build that market, make pet owners aware what OA pain looks like in cats, and get encouraged them to start bringing their cats to the vet and then getting vets to treat that. We think it's a significant market, but you have to first medicalize some of these conditions and treat it. 
It's significant. There's 60 million cats in the U.S. today. And really only 40% of them have away, but only 18% of them are really identified by vet. So we think both are significant markets that we can grow the market. Solensia is more about creating a market. 
And I think you can look at our success in doing that with dermatology, with Apoquel and Cytopoint. So we're investing early. As Glenn has been talking about and some of the guidance over the last year and for 2021 in building those markets. But I would assume the curve for Librela will be much faster than the curves for Solensia as we're building a market."

So I want to understand what you're seeing on the ground? And how should we average around the re hurting cycle in 2021?

So we've seen very positive performance in livestock in China this year. So from a livestock perspective, we grew 45% in China this year, and we expect continued strong performance in China in 2021 as we continue to see the herd rebuild recovery from African Swine Fever. 
And where we're seeing that recovery is particularly in our larger accounts. And the larger accounts use more of the multinational products and of our premium products. So we've seen a really rapid acceleration of our growth. 
For example, in the second half of the year, in swine, in particular, in 2020, we grew over 100% in swine in China. And we expect very positive momentum moving into 2021 and very significant growth from China in 2021. 
In terms of the operating margins, there are a couple of things to look at as we move into 2021. And a number of areas of investments that we have in our SG&A, really continuing to support the growth of Trio as well as monoclonal antibodies to pain as well as dermatology. We've increased our DTC investment in 2020, particularly around Trio and Derm, and we plan on continuing that in 2021 as we saw a very positive return on investment there. 
Obviously, we'll continue to invest in R&D. And that will be an area of continued investment as we've seen a very positive return on that investment as well. The other thing to consider when you look at the overall guidance, with revenue growing 9% to 11% and income growing 9% to 12%, one of the reasons that income isn't growing more rapidly is the change in assumption in tax rate between 2020 and 2021. 
In 2020, our rate was 18.3%. Our guidance for 2021 is approximately 20%. If you neutralize for the impact of the tax rate, our adjusted net income would actually be growing 2% faster, so more 11% to 14%. So we are seeing margin expansion, but the impact of the tax rate is diluting that to some degree."

So what does it take to get back to mid single-digit growth on the livestock side? And what are some of the bigger innovation trends we should be watching there? 
And my second question was just following up on the topic of margins. As we start looking out to 2022 and beyond, should we be thinking about a sustained window of higher expense growth as you get many of these new launches off the ground? Or is a lot of that groundwork already been, I guess, invested as we go into '20 and 21?

We have been talking about the fact that to really get to the mid-single digits in a sustainable way you're going to need innovation. 
I think there's a few spaces that where you're already starting to see that and some that will be coming. The first is around the vector vaccine space, which we've been talking about. In 2020, we launched our first one in the U.S. for New Castle. In 2021, we launched one for IBD. 
We're looking for more launches there. This is a significant market. It's about a $300 million market, growing double digits. So we do see vector technology in poultry, which is one of the faster-growing species being an area of innovation and growth for us. 
We also think more broadly that immunotherapies are going to be really important for 2 reasons: one, they are alternative to antibiotics; and secondly, healthier animals are more productive. So it also increases productivity for producers. So I think immunotherapies, which we've been working on for a while and have a partnership with Colorado State to develop, will be important. 
The other sector that I think is really important to focus on is precision livestock farming, which we also think has great potential. We're leaders right now in the genetic space there in genetic testing. We also purchased PLA, as you know, we're looking at really, that's about individual animal care and herd monitoring, and I think that's probably the next big wave. That's probably more of a medium-term growth driver. But I think there's a number of spaces where you're to see innovation at the livestock spot, so across vectors, immunotherapies and precision life platforming. 
I'll let Glenn take the second question on long-term margin expansion."

So for 2021, we mentioned that the gross margin is relatively flat. And I talked about some of the drivers of that with some of the investments we're making in reference labs, also the impact of the DRAXXIN on LOE this year on gross margin. 
So as we move into 2022 and beyond, some of those impacts will be a little less, and we would expect to see continued expansion in gross margin. In terms of the overall operating expenses, beyond 2021, obviously, there will be 1 year where T&E normalizes when things get back to normal from COVID. But beyond that impact, we would expect that we would continue to be able to grow our expenses at a pace below that of revenue. So we'll probably continue to grow R&D in line with revenue. That may vary any given year based on the opportunities. But SG&A, based on the infrastructure that we have globally established, we should be able to grow that somewhere between inflation and revenue. So we would expect to continue to see expansion there on an overall operating margin perspective."

So I have 2 questions. First, with respect to the monoclonal antibody approval delays, so it's for both cats and dogs, but it wasn't quite clear to me whether the FDA wants more clinical data or whether there are manufacturing issues -- because of manufacturing questions? Because I think, Kristin, you had mentioned manufacturing. 
So if you could just clarify on both of them, what the FDA issues are? Whether they're clinical or manufacturing? And then second, Zoetis' R&D has obviously been amazingly differentiated from competitors. Competitors struggle to bring blockbuster companion animal products to market, even including follow-ons to Zoetis' top growth drivers over several years. 
And so considering that, can you just help us understand the unique aspects of Zoetis' R&D and its ability to maintain separation from the competition."

With regards to the monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia, it really is just working through the regulatory process and the questions that they're asking and they're requiring inspections of sites. So at this point, we have not been asked for any clinical data, but we're still in the regulatory process is what I would say. 
It is our first time doing this with the FDA. So it's just, honestly, a new process for both. And understandably, it's the first time they're looking at some of these types of products, and they have a number of questions. So it really is just going through the regulatory review process and trying to manage new manufacturing inspections, which I do know probably COVID is definitely affecting that a little bit, but we're just working through that. 
So at this point, we have not been asked for any additional clinical data, and we don't think there's any manufacturing issues at this point. We're just still working through the review process and what their expectations are. 
With regards to Zoetis' R&D, what I would say is I think it's the partnership between R&D, manufacturing and our commercial organization. It's taking those insights that commercial has of customer needs and partnered early on with R&D to develop products. 
I think the other thing we've done really well is partner with manufacturing to be able to scale those products and be able to bring them to market. We manufacture our own monoclonal antibodies. As you know, we've got very strong manufacturing capabilities which is, I think, important for launching many of the products and scaling up at the level. 
We certainly learned the hard way early on in our journey about investing in that partnership, when we saw some of the challenges we had supplying Apoquel. So I think from an R&D perspective, obviously, I think we have great scientists. But I think it's the rigorous part process and partnerships they have with our commercial and our manufacturing colleagues and our willingness to invest in disruptive technologies and take those risks that we've been managing over the last 8 years.

The second question, also on the products, is the intention to launch both the cat and dog ones at the same time. Is there an advantage to doing one or the other? And we can speak just about the EU markets where you have approval. 
And the second question on the derm products, you've targeted $1 billion in sales for this year. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that? Is it outside of the U.S.? Is it more pets, et cetera?"

So your -- first of all, it'd be great to hear from you. Secondly, on the mAb, they are both -- the manufacturing facilities are different for them, but they are outside the U.S. And prior approval inspections regulator handled them differently, but they are going to be required probably for both of these products, and they are both different, but they are both outside of the U.S. 
And I think your second question was around the derm sales growth, U.S. or ex-U.S. It's both. We still believe we're underpenetrated outside the U.S. There's the same number of dogs in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. yet, 2/3 of our sales in derm remain in the U.S. So we do think there's a significant opportunity. It has been harder to get scale outside the U.S., historically, mostly because we've not been able to do direct-to-consumer advertising those brand specific. 
One of the investments we are going to make for the first time is doing just overall disease awareness direct-to-consumer advertising in 2021. So we cannot be specific with brand, but in derm, we really are the only products. So hopefully, if you raise awareness around a disease and that there are treatments, you can encourage people to speak to their vet and get the best care. 
So that I think is one of the reasons why international we are hoping will start to grow faster. But I have to give our U.S. team tremendous credit. They continue to grow the market. The investment in direct-to-consumer advertising, raising awareness of their our products are bringing more pet in and getting more pets treated. 
And in the U.S., there are still 6 million dogs who have -- who need our products or need a derm solution who aren't getting one. So we do believe there's still growth in the U.S., although we would expect, although I'm sure -- I know the last year, we've seen very strong growth out of the U.S., we would expect over time for the U.S. growth to start to decline, the overall growth and more of the growth to come from international, but we still believe there's significant potential in both."

Kristin, just maybe want to dive in a little bit more on the launch details around the product. It seems like, obviously, one of the reasons for its relative success this year versus earlier expectations was just far less cannibalization of Simparica than originally expected. 
But wondering if you could just share with us additional metrics in terms of where you are with respect to clinic penetration rates? How many targeted clinics have you been able to actually reach? Just additional metrics around the uptake in launch would be helpful. 
Then just thinking about the product longer term, obviously, very strong first year. If I think about launching analogs on the human health side, I mean, generally, 5 years out, you're looking at something on the order of 6 to 10x first year sales. Not sure if that's applicable in the companion animal market, but just some thoughts in terms of maybe longer-term launch analogs with respect to the product?"

With regards to the launch of Trio, I would say there's a lot of unique characteristics of Vetria Launch. A, we launched at the height of the pandemic in the U.S. So I'm not sure how to compare that to other people's launches. 
We were slower to penetrate clinics, I would say, in Q2 and Q3, but we're quite pleased that by the end of the year, we reached all of our penetration goals. So I think our penetration has been quite strong. 
Given the delay, really, the outperformance was our share once we were penetrated within the clinic. The ability to get more of the patients on our product has been really strong, and that gives us good confidence as we move into 2021. 
As Glenn mentioned a few minutes earlier, we are expecting a similar contribution. For started, we'll have in Q1 where we didn't have sales last year. But with the penetration, we were able to achieve by the end of the year, which is reaching the goals we had wanted, we think that we can just get the same pull-through that we had at those clinics in 2021. We'll continue to see great growth across there. 
We're also seeing it also pull our broader parasiticide portfolio. So I'm not sure I would say, I would use a human health analog but I continue to remind everybody, we're -- we remain underpenetrated in this space. [indiscernible] is the single biggest category in the animal health space. It's $4 billion globally, with $2.5 billion in the U.S. Continuing to see about 16% growth in Simparica beyond Trio globally, it shows -- there's significant opportunity here for us to continue to grow. And we were quite pleased if you looked at overall care, we had an increase in share of 7% in Q4. So we think we can continue to take share in this and grow it overall. 
So I'm not sure it looks like human health, but with our biggest competitors already being $600 million products, I think we've got strong ability to continue to grow and to get at least our fair share in this space."

And the other tailwind you've called out is just the increase in dongles per that vet sits. And as most pet owners get vaccinated, they go back to work. How durable do you think both the increased dollars per visit and increase adoptions are? And is there any chance that could reverse when most people back of the office? 
And a follow-up question on Trio -- potential Trio competition. I think, Glenn, you said no expectations for competition this year. You previously had said no competition in the first half of this year. When do you actually -- I know it's murky, but when do you actually think there might be your first competitor?

So even a 10% increase isn't going to dramatically change things, but we are seeing an increase in vet visits, which we think is a positive trend. And we do expect that to continue in 2021. 
So as Glenn mentioned earlier, we did see a 2% increase in vet visits in Q4. We are expecting that to continue. So I think you are seeing maybe a proportional to what was the incremental tests that were adopted. We don't have very specific numbers, but I would say, assume it's somewhere between like 2% and 10% there. It will be helpful, and I do think we're going to continue to see an increase in visits. 
You asked as well about spend per visit, which was incredibly strong in 2020. We don't believe it's going to remain that strong, to be honest with you. We still think it will grow if you look generally speaking at our space, you do -- we've seen overall revenues of clinics growing in the mid- to high single digits. 
On a normal year. I'm not sure what 2020 was going to look like. But assuming it's somewhere close to a normal year, we do think you're going to see strong growth overall there and spend overall revenue into the vet clinic with growth in total number of visits as well as spend per visit. 
With regards to the Trio question on competition, we don't have the visibility that human health has as to when we'll get competitors. To be very frank, we would have expected a competitor by now. We would have expected one in derm as well. So we're not exactly sure what the challenge is. But we don't have great ways of knowing other than rumor mill in the market and strategic accounts who often try to renegotiate with us when they think of competitors entering the market, which we haven't seen yet. That does not mean that someone couldn't surprise us. So there could be, but we wanted to be clear what our guidance was based on. 
So at this point, given we don't have any specific knowledge, we will assume we do not have competition in 2021. And as to when they would come, honestly, we don't really know. 
But to your point, these are large markets. Both your question on Trio, but as well as derm, and we are expecting competition, we just, at this point, do not have any specific knowledge, so our guidance did not include an assumption for competition in either space."

Also, we established a much better infrastructure for diagnostics in 2020 in 2 ways: a, we fully integrated into our core SAP system, the Diagnostics business, so we now are able to provide one phase to our customer in terms of billing as well as product offerings. 
The other thing that we did was we made significant improvements in our bidirectional connectivity. Improving significantly throughout the year.

We successfully launched our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio. We also achieved approvals for the first ever long-acting monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats. With Librela's authorization for dogs in the European Union and several other markets and Solensia's first authorization for cats in Switzerland. 
We also continued to build on our vaccine portfolio in livestock, with the approval of our CircoMax Myco swine vaccine in the European Union. And in poultry, we continued advancing our recombinant vector vaccines with the approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT-IBD in the U.S. 
Meanwhile, in diagnostics, we successfully launched Vetscan Images, a breakthrough platform using cloud-based Artificial Intelligence for veterinary clinics. We were able to do all this while staying anchored to our purpose and advancing the 5 long-term priorities that I set out at the beginning of the year, including sustainability, where we made important progress in our ESG programs and metric reporting. We look forward to sharing our long-term ESG goals in the coming weeks. 
And finally, we delivered financial results for 2020 that were in line with the guidance we provided last February before the impact of the global pandemic was known. For the full year, we generated 9% operational growth in revenue, primarily based on new products in our containment animal business, the continued strength of our key dermatology portfolio and growth in China. 
As part of our long-term value proposition, we once again grew revenues faster than the anticipated growth for 2020 and faster than historical industry rates of 4% to 6%. As part of our value proposition, we also delivered on growing our adjusted net income faster than revenue. 
For the full year, we delivered operational growth of 10% in adjusted net income, while adapting our operations with the pandemic and continuing investments in our pipeline and new product launches. We generated strong fourth quarter results, which Glenn will discuss in a minute, and these performance trends give us confidence in our growth drivers and strong momentum for 2021. 
We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in 2021, driven by ongoing strength in pet care, continued expansion in markets outside the U.S., most notably China, and acceleration of our diagnostics portfolio penetration. We are guiding to operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue for full year 2021. 
Growth expectations for the companion animal market are in the mid-single digits, and we expect Zoetis to grow significantly faster than that based on the continued uptake of Simparica Trio, the strength of our key dermatology portfolio and the launch of monoclonal antibodies in markets outside the U.S.
Positive petcare trends during the dynamic, based on increased adoptions and people spending more time with their pets, should continue driving market growth in the near term. Data in the U.S. shows visits to veterinary clinics have rebounded, and the average revenue per visit has continued to increase. Over the long term, we see these trends moderating as adoption rates normalize and people eventually return to the workplace. 
The specialty care regimen and chronic care treatments that began in the pandemic should continue. And our innovative portfolio across dermatology, parasiticides, pain, vaccines and diagnostics have us well-positioned for continued growth and capturing share as these shifts occur. 
In terms of the livestock market, we expect low single-digit market growth in 2021 as the impact from COVID-19 will still be felt and a number of products experienced loss of exclusivity. We expect Zoetis to grow in line with the market, even as we face increased headwinds from generic competition for DRAXXIN, our leading anti-infective product. 
We are confident we can leverage our life cycle innovation strategies, together with the overall diversity of our livestock portfolio, including swine product sales in China, to help us address the loss of exclusivity for DRAXXIN and maintain livestock growth that will support our 2021 guidance. 
Longer term, we will continue to invest in livestock innovations and data-driven animal agricultural solutions. As we continue through 2021, we will be building on the progress against our 5 priorities: driving innovative growth; enhancing customer experience; leading in digital and data analytics; cultivating a high-performing organization; and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. 
Our investment plans and focus on growth for 2021 include: continuing the successful launch of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and other markets as well as the ongoing adoption of other new parasiticides, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12; driving growth in dermatology through increased use of direct-to-consumer advertising and disease awareness campaigns in the U.S. and globally. Our focus remains on growing this market and increasing customer loyalty to our innovative treatments, which we expect to help us top $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. 
As noted earlier, we will be investing in the launch of the first monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in Europe in the first half of 2021 and advancing the regulatory process in the U.S. and other markets. While we remain confident in the eventual U.S. approval of these products, based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted, at this point, we believe it is unlikely we will receive approvals for Solensia or Librela in the U.S. in 2021. 
We continue to work through regulatory reviews and manufacturing inspections with the FDA, and we will continue to keep you updated on this process on future calls. 
And finally, we're continuing our development of digital and data solutions that will support more individualized animal care and more efficient and sustainable operations for producers. 
In conclusion, I'm incredibly proud of what our people accomplished in the face of such uncertainty during 2020, and it gives me great confidence in our continued success and full year guidance for 2021. 
As we navigate through recovery from the global pandemic and capitalize on the growth opportunities we see ahead, by optimism comes from what rob us over the last year: the resilience and essential nature of the animal health industry, the diversity, innovation and market leadership of our portfolio and the agility and passion of our colleagues to face any challenge. 
Now let me hand it off to Glenn, who will speak more about our fourth quarter results and guidance for the full year 2021."

We had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.7 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 9% operati",2201,"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.7 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. 
Full year revenue grew 9% operationally and 7% on a reported basis, with adjusted net income increasing 10% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. Going deeper into the numbers, price contributed 2% to full year operational revenue growth, with volume contributing 7%. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions, with other in-line products flat for the year. 
We, again, saw broad-based revenue growth, with the U.S. growing 11% and international growing 7% operationally. The innovation we brought to the market and the diversity of our portfolio was key to our strong performance as companion animal grew 17%, while livestock was flat on a year-over-year basis. 
Performance in companion animal was led by our parasiticide portfolio, bolstered by the launch of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $170 million. This added approximately $150 million of incremental revenue and exceeded our expectations set prior to the pandemic. 
Sales of Simparica also grew double digits for the year, with operational revenue growth of 16%. Our key dermatology portfolio demonstrated continued strength in 2020, growing 23% operationally, generating revenue of $925 million and increasing more than $170 million versus prior year. 
The COVID-19 pandemic created a difficult market environment for livestock. However, we are encouraged by the resiliency displayed in 2020. We remained optimistic that global livestock will return to modest growth in 2021, as the recovery from African Swine Fever in China continues and consumption patterns normalize. 
Operational growth and adjusted net income of 10% was driven mainly by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. 
Now moving on to our Q4 financial results, where we posted another strong quarter with revenue of $1.8 billion, representing an increase of 9% operationally and 8% reported. Adjusted net income of $438 million is an increase of 3% operationally and flat on a reported basis. 
Operational revenue grew 9%, with 2% from price and 7% from volume. Volume growth of 7% consisted of 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 1% from other in-line products. 
Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 25% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal parasiticides grew 52% in the quarter, gaining market share in the U.S. of more than 7% within the flea, tick and heartworm segment versus the same period in the prior year. This includes the continued adoption of Simparica Trio, which generated sales of $60 million in Q4. 
Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, again, had significant global growth in the quarter with $257 million of revenue, representing 27% operational growth versus an extremely difficult comparative period in which key derm grew 29% for the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our diagnostics portfolio, again, made positive contributions to revenue with reference lab expansion and double-digit growth in consumable and instrument revenue. The recovery in wellness visits continued to be a catalyst for growth following the slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. 
As we noted on our previous earnings call, the early fall cattle run pulled a portion of fourth quarter sales into the third quarter leading to a weaker quarter in cattle than we would typically expect. This was the primary driver of the 5% operational decline in livestock for the fourth quarter. 
For the remainder of the livestock portfolio, swine posted a second consecutive quarter of growth, with the herd rebuild continuing in key accounts as the market recovers from African Swine Fever in China. Our aquaculture business grew high single digits in the quarter, and along with swine, partially offset the decline in cattle and poultry. 
Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 11%, with companion animal products growing 30% and livestock sales declining by 15%. For companion animal, the positive trends at the vet clinic continued in Q4 with patient visits up 2% and revenue per visit increasing by 13%. 
Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales of our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We maintained an increased investment in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas and continue to see a good return on that investment. 
Simparica Trio performed well again in the quarter with sales of $56 million. We remained extremely encouraged for the future growth of our product and the growth of the overall market segment as a material portion of Trio sales came from new patients to the category. 
Key dermatology sales were $176 million for the quarter, growing 32%, with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics. 
Companion animal diagnostics sales increased 22% in the quarter as a result of reference lab expansion and growth in point-of-care instruments and consumables. U.S. livestock declined 15% in the quarter, driven primarily by cattle, which had a portion of Q4 sales pulled into the third quarter as a result of the earlier movement from pass-through to feedlot. The remaining species declined as well, with COVID-19 and pricing pressure negatively impacting our swine business. 
Poultry declines are largely attributed to product rotation and less producer profitability, leading to reduced uses of our premium products. 
To summarize U.S. performance. Innovation and return on investment once again drove exceptionally strong growth in companion animal. While livestock was down in the quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. 
Revenue in our International segment grew 7% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and key dermatology products. 
Parasiticide growth in the quarter was again driven by the Simparica franchise with further adoption of Simparica Trio. In Q4, we observed a series of favorable market trends, such as increased pet ownership and medicalization rates in Asia. Overall, companion animal grew in every major market, except Italy and the U.K., which had arguably the strictest lockdown protocols. Companion animal diagnostics grew 16% in the quarter, led by an increase in point-of-care consumable usage. 
Swine revenue grew 14% operationally, posting a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Swine sales in China grew in excess of 100% for the second straight quarter. Key accounts expanded their use of vaccines and other products as they continue to rebuild herds from smaller farms to large-scale operations. China total products grew 45% operationally in the quarter and 34% operationally for 2020. 
Brazil was also a significant contributor to international growth in the quarter, growing 18% operationally. For the fourth quarter and full year 2020, Brazil delivered double-digit growth in all species, except poultry, which modestly declined. 
Overall, our International segment delivered strong results despite the challenges presented by COVID-19. Our diversity across products and geographies enabled our International segment to again be a significant driver of growth. 
Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.7% fell 80 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from other manufacturing costs, inventory charges, recent acquisitions and elevated freight expense. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased 10% operationally, resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio and Apoquel, partially offset by T&E savings. Return on investment from our DTC campaigns has been very favorable and will remain an important investment to support future growth of the business. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points, driven by the impact of net discrete tax benefits, partially offset by jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter grew 3% operationally. 
In December, we announced a 25% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In addition, we resumed our share repurchase program in January with $1.4 billion of remaining capacity under the current authorization. 
Now moving on to guidance for 2021. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. For 2021, we are projecting revenue between $7.4 billion and $7.55 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We are expecting foreign exchange favorability in 2021 of approximately 200 basis points. We expect companion animal to be the primary driver of growth in 2021, with the continued strength of our diverse parasiticide portfolio, which includes full year Simparica Trio sales. 
We believe market dynamics for companion animal will remain strong in 2021, allowing for further expansion of our key dermatology products as well as our diagnostics offerings, which we anticipate will grow faster than the overall animal health market. 
While we expect the pace of certain trends that accelerated in 2020 to moderate, such as increased spend per visit, our view is that 2020 has established a higher base for future growth. We anticipate livestock will return to global growth in 2021, primarily driven by more normalized food consumption patterns. Geographically, we expect total company sales growth to be relatively balanced between our U.S. and International segments. However, we do expect continued and meaningful growth in China and other emerging markets. 
I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth, beginning with dermatology. Our guidance does not assume a meaningful competitive entry in 2021. And  with continued investment behind the franchise, we believe revenue will exceed $1 billion for the full year. We also do not assume a triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2021 to compete against Simparica Trio. 
We're extremely excited about our monoclonal antibodies for pain with both Librela and Solensia having long-term blockbuster potential. However, as Kristin mentioned, while both products will launch in the first half of 2021 in the EU and other international markets, we do not currently expect either product to receive approval in the U.S. this year. 
For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 30%, which is relatively consistent with our cost of sales in 2020. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $1.775 billion and $1.85 billion, with the increase in 2020 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including recent and future product launches, key brands, and recent acquisitions and reference lab expansion in diagnostics. 
Adjusted R&D expense for 2021 is expected to be between $500 million and $520 million as we remain committed to investing in pipeline opportunities for new therapies and life cycle innovation. Adjusted interest and other income deduction is expected to be approximately $260 million, with the increase over 2020, driven by increased interest expense as well as lower interest income. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2021 is primarily related to the impact of favorable nonrecurring discrete items that occurred in 2020. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.08 billion to $2.13 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 12%. 
Our guidance reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, during the year when we'll be making meaningful investments to support future growth. Consistent with 2020, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures in 2021 to support investments in manufacturing focused on internal sourcing of API, capacity increases and facilities to support pipeline opportunities. We're also investing in information technology to support our recent acquisitions as well as digital capabilities and data analytics. 
Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.36 to $4.46 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14. While guidance represents full year expectations, we do anticipate growth will be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. This is largely due to full year Simparica Trio sales and a favorable comparison versus Q2 2020 as a result of COVID-19. 
To summarize. 2020 was another exceptional year in which we delivered 9% operational revenue growth and 10% operational growth in adjusted net income in the year that presented a unique set of challenges. Our guidance for 2021 highlights our ability to grow revenue organically above the market and grow adjusted net income faster than revenue even during times of elevated investment. 
Before turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to express how proud I am of our colleagues and all we've accomplished amidst an unprecedented set of circumstances. While there is no assurance that the new year will be without similar challenges faced in 2020, we cannot be more excited about the opportunity to again deliver on our long-term shareholder value proposition. 
Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

Most -- for the quarter, 4Q '20 gross margins were a bit below despite big companion animal growth. And next year, it seems like you're guiding to flattish, call it, gross margins again, despite what seems like positive mix shift. 
So Glenn, can you talk about that a bit? Why are we not seeing a bit more in gross margin considering the companion animal performance? And is expanding gross margin still a part of the long-term story? 
And then I'll stick with sort of guidance. Just really big numbers on 2021 guidance out of the gate. You talked to livestock versus companion. Can you talk to the components of companion animal a little bit more? I don't know if I specifically heard a Trio number, but is it safe to assume Trio of $400 million plus in any other components you'd call out?"

So first, when you look at the gross margin expectation for 2021, it is relatively flat versus 2020. As you mentioned, the mix with companion animal will be beneficial as we move into 2021.

As you mentioned, the mix with companion animal will be beneficial as we move into 2021. Some of the offsets to that, though were some of the investments that we're making in other areas such as reference labs, which come at a lower margin, particularly in the early stage of their life cycle as we're building those labs, the margins will be a little lower until they reach their full operating scale. So that's some of the offsets. So there are some positives in terms of the companion animal mix, some offsets there with some of the longer terms we're investing and making in other areas. 
In terms of the drivers of companion animal growth. So obviously we do expect Trio to be a significant driver of growth for 2021. We're not putting a specific number on Trio, but we would expect the contribution from growth in 2021 to be at least as big as what we achieved in 2020. So that will obviously be one of the drivers. 
Also, continued growth in our dermatology portfolio. We saw a very strong performance in 2020, with 23% growth in that portfolio operationally for the year. We do expect that portfolio will exceed $1 billion as we move into 2021. 
Also in companion animal diagnostics, we expect very rapid growth in diagnostics as well. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 20% growth and we expect that will help carry us forward with the strong momentum that we had in the quarter into 2021 as well as strong performance that we're seeing in many of our emerging markets, such as China and Brazil. So those are some of the factors that are driving the strong companion animal growth."

But also what steps you're taking and how meaningful of the headwind do you expect in 2021? 
And then broader on livestock. We've read a lot about input costs going high and producers in some markets, poultry and swine. How does that factor into your outlook for low single-digit growth? 
And then second question would be just a little bit more on the companion animal expectations for 2020. I mean, obviously, you're growing well above the market. But any thoughts on sort of in line portfolio? And you commented on Trio, you commented on strong term strength? And what you see [ more grow ]. But just could you sort of comment on Revolution Plus?

So starting on DRAXXIN, we are expecting a number of competitors to enter in the U.S. market. Again, the LOE is this month, so it hasn't happened yet. I would say more probably entrants than we expected a few months ago, but we don't think that will last obviously. I think the market will shake out, obviously, to a few. 
As we said previously, typically, we expect about -- to lose about 20% to 40% share over several years. In the case of DRAXXIN, given the large number of competitors, we do expect that to be faster, but we don't really expect it to be overall different. 
And really, partly what drives that, I think, is we do believe that a lower price on DRAXXIN will expand the market for macro life overall. And therefore, the market itself will grow. We also think we're positioned well from a broad portfolio, strong technical. We do expect that the price to come down in the 20% to 40%. That is an expectation. 
But as we said, this is all baked in right now to our guidance. So the expectations around where DRAXXIN is going to be is there. And if you look at broader livestock, you referenced some of the info costs. 
As you heard in some of our opening remarks, we are expecting low single-digit growth, so a return to growth in livestock overall. And yes, some of that will be led in the U.S. and sort of certain species, but a lot of that will be led outside the U.S. 
As a reminder, about 60% of our livestock business is outside of the U.S. and we're seeing incredible growth right now in China and some other markets, Brazil, et cetera. So overall, we do think some of the input costs in the U.S. will be a pressure. But we have -- given the diversity of our portfolio, looking at some large markets, our second largest market is China, our third largest market is Brazil, we do see strength in livestock there. So we overall do believe livestock will return to low single-digit growth in 2021. 
And we continue to believe it will return to normal growth in the mid single-digit range, 4% to 6%, over the medium term. So Glenn, I'm not sure if you want to take the incremental question on the broad companion animal trends in '21?"

But then there are other products that round out the portfolio of products such as ProHeart 12, products such as Revolution Plus. Also, the growth that we're seeing in markets like China, where companion animal is growing very rapidly, markets like Brazil. So there are really many areas of growth that we see.

Around ASF is driving a significant portion of the growth from a swine perspective. China is still going to be importing a decent amount, probably less than in 2020, from other markets around the world, sort of maintaining that. We're also hopeful that you'll see an increase in dine out, which will send signal to the industry to expand herds. 
So 2020 was obviously hit with many different factors, but do see both an increase in demand and in markets where our technology don't really leverage some of the emerging markets, but we're seeing significant uptick there. There will remain challenges in some of the U.S. producers obviously, for some of the input costs, et cetera. But we do believe you'll see more of a return to normalcy as we move into 2021, and that's why we're guiding at sort of the low single digits.

Be at this, I guess, this is Pascal, but you haven't had a full strength historically on those [indiscernible] and is the other one, cannibalization of legacy products, they're playing out in line with their expectations? 
And then my second question is on the new pain mAbs. How should we think about the contributions from them this year in Europe or other countries, would be meaningful at all? And how should we think about the dynamics that are impacting approval on the U.S.? Do you still anticipate? Or are you still confident that these will be blockbuster products for you with the launch in the U.S. in 2022?"

I heard the second question on mAbs, which I can answer. You were breaking up and digitizing on the first question. I think we've more or less have it to let us give a shot, and you can comment if we missed some of it, some of it we heard. 
So starting on your second question of the mAbs. We were very excited to now have Librela approved and launching in the first half of this year in the EU, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland. And Solensia, we continue to expect approval in the EU in the first half of this year to be launching sort of midyear. We already do have approval on Solensia in Switzerland. And we remain confident in the eventual approval based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted in the U.S. 
But as you saw in our remarks and our release, the approval timeline has moved out a bit. We believe this has to do with the fact that this is the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA and Animal Health. Our previous one, Cytopoint, was actually USDA. It's making it a little harder for us, honestly, to predict some with the regulatory process. We're continuing to work through the regulatory process and manufacturing inspections, and we'll continue to keep you updated. 
We don't think that changes the overall peak sales of this product at all, but it is a slightly different process. I guess Glenn might have understood a little bit better. But we'll try your first question now if we missed it."

And I think that's going very well in the veterinary clinics. We're really able to offer our customers a variety of options based on how they to best treat the animals. And I think that shows in the performance that we saw in the Simparica franchise in 2020. Not only did we exceed our goals for Trio with $170 million in sales in the year, but we also saw significant growth in Simparica, which really exceeded our expectations. 
So we grew operationally 16% with Simparica. What we saw was that the advertising and driving patients into the clinic for Simparica Trio actually benefited the overall portfolio. We also saw very positive growth in ProHeart 12 as well. So we think the breadth of the portfolio and the parasiticides was really a benefit and our field colleagues really able to execute very well with that portfolio."

Also, new people to the category overall, I would say, people who maybe previously had gotten products over-the-counter are moving in. And we are taking share from some of the other established competitors in the space. So I think we're seeing strong growth overall, I would say, there, and pleased that our share. 
If you look at the potential for the product. The 2 competitors, Nexgard and Bravecto, are each $600 million product to date. So we continue to believe there's significant growth. We are -- we remain under indexed, to be honest with you, in parasiticide. So we continue to see this as a significant part of our overall gross growth. 
From expensive -- are there synergies with derm? Not really is what I would say, except for on the cost side. Obviously, we can get better buying power when you replace CTCS by leveraging the spend across both but beyond that, we don't see strong synergies, honestly, between the DTC online, affecting the other unless our clinic has to carry bolts and things like that.

Librela is entering a market that's $400 million today. So it's an established market. So I think the ability for people are already bringing their dogs in for OA pain. 
So I think we have the opportunity with Librela to expand the number of patients, given the safety and efficacy profile and the compliance benefits of the product. I think we can also increase days on therapy, which also helps us grow the market. And then obviously price, to your point, so it is priced at a premium to many of the products on the market today. It is not, obviously -- we don't have a price in the U.S. since we don't have an approval yet in the U.S. 
I think Solensia is going to be a little bit different. I think the curve is going to take a little longer. And that has to do the fact that there really isn't a market today in most parts of the world. If you had a cat who has it, there really was no treatment. So cat owners have kind of been conditions to not bring their cats in. 
We've started focusing, about 1 year ago, to try to build that market, make pet owners aware what OA pain looks like in cats, and get encouraged them to start bringing their cats to the vet and then getting vets to treat that. We think it's a significant market, but you have to first medicalize some of these conditions and treat it. 
It's significant. There's 60 million cats in the U.S. today. And really only 40% of them have a way, but only 18% of them are really identified by vet. So we think both are significant markets that we can grow the market. Solensia is more about creating a market. 
And I think you can look at our success in doing that with dermatology, with Apoquel and Cytopoint. So we're investing early. As Glenn has been talking about and some of the guidance over the last year and for 2021 in building those markets. But I would assume the curve for Librela will be much faster than the curves for Solensia as we're building a market."

Firstly, since livestock recovery this year seems to be so contingent on China, and there are news of regulatory or illegal vaccines being used and the recurrence of ACF. 
So I want to understand what you're seeing on the ground? And how should we average around the re herding cycle in 2021? Second on operating margins. Considering that you will not have a dilutive impact of diagnose that you saw in 2020, should we be looking for better operating margins considering that revenue mix is better?

So we've seen very positive performance in livestock in China this year. So from a livestock perspective, we grew 45% in China this year, and we expect continued strong performance in China in 2021 as we continue to see the herd rebuild recovery from African Swine Fever. 
And where we're seeing that recovery is particularly in our larger accounts. And the larger accounts use more of the multinational products and of our premium products. So we've seen a really rapid acceleration of our growth. 
For example, in the second half of the year, in swine, in particular, in 2020, we grew over 100% in swine in China. And we expect very positive momentum moving into 2021 and very significant growth from China in 2021. 
In terms of the operating margins, there are a couple of things to look at as we move into 2021. Any number of areas of investments that we have in our SG&A, really continuing to support the growth of Trio as well as monoclonal antibodies for pain as well as dermatology. We've increased our DTC investment in 2020, particularly around Trio and Derm. And we plan on continuing that in 2021 as we saw a very positive return on investment there. 
Obviously, we'll continue to invest in R&D. And that will be an area of continued investment as we've seen a very positive return on that investment as well. The other thing to consider when you look at the overall guidance, with revenue growing 9% to 11% and income growing 9% to 12%. One of the reasons that income isn't growing more rapidly is the change in assumption in tax rate between 2020 and 2021. 
In 2020, our rate was 18.3%. Our guidance for 2021 is approximately 20%. If you neutralize for the impact of the tax rate, our adjusted net income would actually be growing 2% faster, so more 11% to 14%. So we are seeing margin expansion, but the impact of the tax rate is diluting that to some degree."

So what does it take to get back to mid single-digit growth on the livestock side? And what are some of the bigger innovation trends we should be watching there? 
And my second question was just following up on the topic of margins. As we start looking out to 2022 and beyond, should we be thinking about a sustained window of higher expense growth as you get many of these new launches off the ground? 
Or is a lot of that groundwork already been, I guess, invested as we go into '20 and 21? I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about longer-term margin expansion dynamics, assuming we continue this very healthy top line setup that seems to be playing out."

We have been talking about the fact that to really get to the mid-single digits in a sustainable way you're going to need innovation. 
I think there's a few spaces that where you're already starting to see that and some that will be coming. The first is around the vector vaccine space, which we've been talking about. In 2020, we launched our first one in the U.S. for New Castle. In 2021, we launched one for IBD. 
We're looking for more launches there. This is a significant market. It's about a $300 million market, growing double digits. So we do see vector technology in poultry, which is one of the faster-growing species being an area of innovation and growth for us. 
We also think more broadly that immunotherapies are going to be really important for 2 reasons: one, they are alternative to antibiotics; and secondly, healthier animals are more productive. So it also increases productivity for producers. So I think immunotherapies, which we've been working on for a while and have a partnership with Colorado State to develop, will be important. 
The other sector that I think is really important to focus on is precision livestock farming, which we also think has great potential. We're leaders right now in the genetic space there in genetic testing. We also purchased PLA, as you know, we're looking at really, that's about individual animal care and herd monitoring, and I think that's probably the next big wave. That's probably more of a medium-term growth driver. But I think there's a number of spaces where you're to see innovation at the livestock spot, so across vectors, immunotherapies and precision life platforming. 
I'll let Glenn take the second question on long-term margin expansion."

So for 2021, we mentioned that the gross margin is relatively flat. And I talked about some of the drivers of that with some of the investments we're making in reference labs, also the impact of the DRAXXIN on LOE this year on gross margin. 
So as we move into 2022 and beyond, some of those impacts will be a little less, and we would expect to see continued expansion in gross margin. In terms of the overall operating expenses. Beyond 2021, obviously, there will be 1 year where T&E normalizes when things get back to normal from COVID. But beyond that impact, we would expect that we would continue to be able to grow our expenses at a pace below that of revenue. So we'll probably continue to grow R&D in line with revenue. That may vary any given year based on the opportunities. But SG&A, based on the infrastructure that we have globally established, we should be able to grow that somewhere between inflation and revenue. So we would expect to continue to see expansion there on an overall operating margin perspective."

So if you could just clarify on both of them, what the FDA issues are? Whether they're clinical or manufacturing?

It is our first time doing this with the FDA. So it's just, honestly, a new process for both. And understandably, it's the first time they're looking at some of these types of products, and they have a number of questions. So it really is just going through the regulatory review process and trying to manage new manufacturing inspections, which I do know probably COVID is definitely affecting that a little bit, but we're just working through that. 
So at this point, we have not been asked for any additional clinical data, and we don't think there's any manufacturing issues at this point. We're just still working through the review process and what their expectations are. 
With regards to Zoetis' R&D. What I would say is I think it's the partnership between R&D, manufacturing and our commercial organization. It's taking those insights that commercial has of customer needs and partnered early on with R&D to develop products. 
I think the other thing we've done really well is partner with manufacturing to be able to scale those products and be able to bring them to market. We manufacture our own monoclonal antibodies. As you know, we've got very strong manufacturing capabilities which is, I think, important for launching many of the products and scaling up at the level. 
We certainly learned the hard way early on in our journey about investing in that partnership, when we saw some of the challenges we had supplying Apoquel. So I think from an R&D perspective, obviously, I think we have great scientists. But I think it's the rigorous part process and partnerships they have with our commercial and our manufacturing colleagues and our willingness to invest in disruptive technologies and take those risks that we've been managing over the last 8 years. 
Anything you would you add there, Glenn?"

The second question, also on the products, is the intention to launch both the cat and dog ones at the same time. Is there an advantage to doing one or the other? And we can speak just about the EU markets where you have approval. 
And the second question on the derm products, you've targeted $1 billion in sales for this year. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that? Is it outside of the U.S.? Is it more pets, et cetera?"

So your -- first of all, it'd be great to hear from you. Secondly, on the mAb, they are both -- the manufacturing facilities are different for them, but they are outside the U.S. And prior approval inspections regulator handled them differently, but they are going to be required probably for both of these products, and they are both different, but they are both outside of the U.S. 
And I think your second question was around the derm sales growth, U.S. or ex-U.S. It's both. We still believe we're underpenetrated outside the U.S. There's the same number of dogs in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. yet, 2/3 of our sales in derm remain in the U.S. So we do think there's a significant opportunity. It has been harder to get scale outside the U.S., historically, mostly because we've not been able to do direct-to-consumer advertising those brand-specific. 
One of the investments we are going to make for the first time is doing just overall disease awareness direct-to-consumer advertising in 2021. So we cannot be specific with brands, but in derm, we really are the only products. So hopefully, if you raise awareness around a disease and that there are treatments, you can encourage people to speak to their vet and get the best care. 
So that I think is one of the reasons why international we are hoping will start to grow faster. But I have to give our U.S. team tremendous credit. They continue to grow the market. The investment in direct-to-consumer advertising, raising awareness of their our products are bringing more pet in and getting more pets treated. 
And in the U.S., there are still 6 million dogs who have -- who need our products or need a derm solution who aren't getting one. So we do believe there's still growth in the U.S., although we would expect, although I'm sure -- I know the last year, we've seen very strong growth out of the U.S. We would expect over time for the U.S. growth to start to decline, the overall growth and more of the growth to come from international, but we still believe there's significant potential in both."

Kristin, just maybe want to dive in a little bit more on the launch details around the product. It seems like, obviously, one of the reasons for its relative success this year versus earlier expectations was just far less cannibalization of Simparica than originally expected. 
But wondering if you could just share with us additional metrics in terms of where you are with respect to clinic penetration rates? How many targeted clinics have you been able to actually reach? Just additional metrics around the uptake in launch would be helpful. 
Then just thinking about the product longer term, obviously, very strong first year. If I think about launching analogs on the human health side, I mean, generally, 5 years out, you're looking at something on the order of 6 to 10x first year sales. Not sure if that's applicable in the companion animal market, but just some thoughts in terms of maybe longer-term launch analogs with respect to the product."

With regards to the launch of Trio, I would say there's a lot of unique characteristics of Vetria Launch. A, we launched at the height of the pandemic in the U.S. So I'm not sure how to compare that to other people's launches. 
We were slower to penetrate clinics, I would say, in Q2 and Q3, but we're quite pleased that by the end of the year, we reached all of our penetration goals. So I think our penetration has been quite strong. 
Given the delay, really, the outperformance was our share once we were penetrated within the clinic. The ability to get more of the patients on our product has been really strong, and that gives us good confidence as we move into 2021. 
As Glenn mentioned a few minutes earlier, we are expecting a similar contribution. For starters, we'll have in Q1 where we didn't have sales last year. But with the penetration, we were able to achieve by the end of the year, which is reaching the goals we had wanted, we think that we can just get the same pull-through that we had at those clinics in 2021. We'll continue to see great growth across there. 
We're also seeing it also pull our broader parasiticide portfolio. So I'm not sure I would say, I would use a human health analog but I continue to remind everybody, we're -- we remain underpenetrated in this space. Antares is the single biggest category in the animal health space. It's $4 billion globally, with $2.5 billion in the U.S. Continuing to see about 16% growth in Simparica beyond Trio globally, it shows -- there's significant opportunity here for us to continue to grow. And we were quite pleased if you looked at overall care, we had an increase in share of 7% in Q4. So we think we can continue to take share in this and grow it overall. 
So I'm not sure it looks like human health, but with our biggest competitors already being $600 million products, I think we've got strong ability to continue to grow and to get at least our fair share in this space."

How durable do you think both the increased dollars per visit and increase adoptions are? And is there any chance that could reverse when most people back of the office? 
And a follow-up question on Trio -- potential Trio competition. I think, Glenn, you said no expectations for competition this year. You previously had said no competition in the first half of this year. When do you actually -- I know it's murky, but when do you actually think there might be your first competitor?

So even a 10% increase isn't going to dramatically change things, but we are seeing an increase in vet visits, which we think is a positive trend. And we do expect that to continue in 2021. 
So as Glenn mentioned earlier, we did see a 2% increase in vet visits in Q4. We are expecting that to continue. So I think you are seeing maybe a proportional to what was the incremental tests that were adopted. We don't have very specific numbers, but I would say, assume it's somewhere between like 2% and 10% there. It will be helpful, and I do think we're going to continue to see an increase in visits. 
You asked as well about spend per visit, which was incredibly strong in 2020. We don't believe it's going to remain that strong, to be honest with you. We still think it will grow if you look generally speaking at our space, you do -- we've seen overall revenues of clinics growing in the mid- to high single digits. 
On a normal year, I'm not sure what 2020 was going to look like. But assuming it's somewhere close to a normal year, we do think you're going to see strong growth overall there and spend overall revenue into the vet clinic, both with growth in total number of visits as well as spend per visit. 
With regards to the Trio question on competition. We don't have the visibility that human health has as to when we'll get competitors. To be very frank, we would have expected a competitor by now. We would have expected one in derm as well. So we're not exactly sure what the challenge is. 
But we don't have great ways of knowing other than rumor mill in the market and strategic accounts who often try to renegotiate with us when they think of competitors entering the market, which we haven't seen yet. That does not mean that someone couldn't surprise us. So there could be, but we wanted to be clear what our guidance was based on. 
So at this point, given we don't have any specific knowledge, we will assume we do not have competition in 2021. And as to when they would come, honestly, we don't really know. 
But to your point, these are large markets. Both your question on Trio, but as well as derm, and we are expecting competition, we just, at this point, do not have any specific knowledge, so our guidance did not include an assumption for competition in either space."

So still very positive growth in the quarter, and we saw a nice momentum as we move throughout the year. We think that will carry us well into 2021. 
Also, we established a much better infrastructure for diagnostics in 2020 in 2 ways: a, we fully integrated into our core SAP system, the Diagnostics business, so we now are able to provide one phase to our customer in terms of billing as well as product offerings. 
The other thing that we did was we made significant improvements in our bidirectional connectivity, improving significantly throughout the year. At the beginning of the year, we were -- we had that connectivity to about 30%. We increased that at the end of the year to over 70%.

In terms of key input costs and inflation for us from a manufacturing perspective, there's nothing in particular that we see particularly challenging.

I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and able to get back [indiscernible] for COVID-19, if not already, then soon. We've been very fortunate in the U.S. as vaccination rates are up and infection rates are trending down overall. But that is not the situation everywhere. In many countries, improving access to vaccines and controlling infection rates are critical hurdles for a more comprehensive global recovery. Yet with the extraordinary measures being taken by so many, I remain optimistic about the steady progress we're making to beat this dynamic. 
I'm also very proud of what we've been able to do at Zoetis in our own small way to support the global effort. We've been able to keep our colleagues safe, encourage and assist them with vaccinations where possible, and continue serving our customers in the care of their animals. 
And we're off to a very strong start in 2021 executing on strategies for building on our innovative pet care portfolio, expanding in key markets outside the U.S. and accelerating our growth in diagnostics. In the first quarter, we grew our top line revenue at 21% operationally, our best quarter ever, with 25% operational growth internationally and 19% growth in the U.S. China and Brazil led our international performance with 75% and 48% operational growth respectively, exhibiting their strength in both companion animal and livestock product sales. In total, our companion animal portfolio grew 34% operationally based on the strength of our parasiticide and dermatology products, while our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally with solid growth in cattle, swine and fish products. 
Digging deeper on pet care, it has been 1 year since the launch of our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio. It is exceeding expectations and has been well received by customers, with a-90% plus penetration rate in our largest U.S. corporate accounts. Simparica Trio is the latest growth catalyst for a portfolio of small animal parasiticides. After several successful innovations in the last few years, these products made up 16% of our total sales in the first quarter and includes such brands as Simparica, Simparica Trio, Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart.
We believe the ongoing market shift to e-commerce is another boost for this category, helping to increase compliance and months on therapy. And our direct-to-consumer campaigns for Simparica and Simparica and Simparica Trio continued showing a solid return on investment in markets around the world. 
Meanwhile, our key dermatology portfolio led by Apoquel and CytoPoint, demonstrated continued double-digit growth. We are seeing excellent traction and significant growth of international markets. Our dermatology portfolio has further growth potential as we continue expanding our international customer base and seek to become a more common first-line treatment for [indiscernible] in dogs. Veterinarians and pet owners alike appreciate the exceptional standard of care that our products can provide. 
In the companion animal space, we also continue to be pleased with our diagnostics portfolio, which grew 47% operationally in the first quarter. We have grown our point-of-care diagnostic sales, made excellent progress on improving our connectivity solutions in veterinary practices, and have seen our cloud-based VetScan images platform receiving very positive customer feedback, with placements exceeding expectations in the early launch. We're also making progress on our Reference Labs integrations and look forward to future expansions in this space, both in the U.S. and internationally. 
Our growth in livestock was driven by the performance of cattle, swine and fish in the first quarter. Cattle product sales in the U.S. were strong as the food service sector has started to recover and DRAXXIN was later than expected. Meanwhile, swine benefited from the continued recovery from African swine fever in China. 
Thanks to the unprecedented growth in revenue and our continued financial discipline and adaptability throughout COVID-19, 
[Audio Gap] our guidance for operational growth and full year revenue to the range of 10.5% to 12%. And while we had an unusually strong first quarter, we expect more normalized revenue growth in the second half of the year due to tougher comparative quarters and increasing generic competition for DRAXXIN. Glenn will provide more details on other guidance updates in his remarks. 
Since the beginning of the year, Zoetis has continued to advance our key priorities, including key milestones for new products and life cycle innovations and geographic expansions for major brands. Since our last earnings announcement, we received approval in the European Union for Solensia the first injectable monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and will be launching this year. Osteoarthritis is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated today due to limited options for therapy and difficulty recognizing pain in cats. 
Meanwhile, Librela, our monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of OA pain in dogs, has launched in the EU. And we're seeing a great customer response from vets and dogs owners who referenced increased activity, social ability and quality of life for their pets. 
In the U.S., we continued discussions with the FDA regarding our regulatory submissions and manufacturing inspection for Librela and Solensia. And we now anticipate approvals for both products in 2022, with Librela likely later in the year. We will provide updates on U.S. revenue expectations for these products in 2022 as we get further clarity on approval timing and rollout plans. 
It is also worth noting that in China, which is our second largest market in terms of revenue, Zoetis recently received approvals for several leading products, Fostera PCV MH, a 1-shot vaccine for pigs, Excenel RTU EZ, a key anti-infective for cattle and swine, and Revolution Plus, our latest parasiticide for cats. We continue to strengthen our portfolio in China, one of our key catalysts for growth. 
We're also maximizing our key brands with more geographic expansion. In poultry, we expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with approval of Poulvac Procerta HBT ND in Canada, Brazil and several other smaller markets. And in [indiscernible], we received additional approvals for Simparica Trio in Japan, Mexico and several other smaller markets.
In terms of sustainability, we published our long-term goals in March with specific commitments to communities, animals and the planet. We've built a comprehensive and rigorous approach through our Driven to Care program, and our goals include support for 10 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We'll be releasing more detail on these goals and our initial progress in our sustainability report this June.
In closing, the fundamental growth drivers for our industry continue to show strong and sustainable momentum. Pet adoption trends and higher spending per visit in the U.S. along with increased medicalization rates in markets outside the U.S. all continue to bode well for significant growth in our companion animal and diagnostic portfolios globally. We feel very confident about where our companion animal business has come over the last few years, launching innovative new products, defining new standards of treatment and expanding our global reach. In 2014, our companion animal business was 34% of our total revenue. Last year, it had grown to 55% based on the strength of our innovation and investment in growth, and we see that continuing to expand. 
In livestock, the industry is in a more limited innovation cycle, and we expect modest growth for the year. livestock growth is tied closely to the pandemic and how quickly the foodservice industry recovers. For Zoetis, we also anticipate increasing headwinds of generic competition to DRAXXIN, but we expect our life cycle innovation and competitive strategies to help us mitigate the impact. 
While U.S. livestock may present challenges for us in the near term, I feel very positive about our catalysts for growth in pet care, diagnostics, and international markets like China and Brazil. We continue to be led by our companion animal parasiticide and dermatology portfolio with more growth to come, and we see a bright future ahead for our antibodies for pain. Diagnostics is accelerating its growth as we increase our global footprint, expand our reference labs and demonstrates the potential for VetScan images to veterinary clinics. And internationally, China continues to be a market with significant growth potential, not only in swine products but with a sizable opportunity for increased medicalization of pets. And we expect major growth to continue in Brazil across the companion animal and livestock portfolios. 
As always, we remain confident that Zoetis' diverse portfolio across species and geographies, our continued pipeline of innovative new products and life cycle innovations, and the agility and commitment of our colleagues will continue driving our success in 2021 and beyond. Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our first quarter results and updated guidance for the full year 2021."
215548781,709832184,2272411,"Zoetis Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, delivering substantial growth on a global basis and across species and therapeutic areas. Today, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter fina",1930,"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, delivering substantial growth on a global basis and across species and therapeutic areas. Today, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance, and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. 
In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 22% on a reported basis and 21% operationally. Adjusted net income of $603 million was an increase of 33% on a reported basis and 34% operationally. Operational revenue grew 21%, resulting entirely from volume increases with price flat for the quarter. Volume growth of 21% includes 13% from other in line products, 5% from new products, and 3% from key dermatology products.  Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 34% operationally, with livestock growing 8% operationally in the quarter. 
Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada, Australia and Mexico. We also saw growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in small animal vaccines in diagnostics. 
Following blockbuster sales in year 1, Simparica Trio begin 2021 with strong first quarter performance, posting revenue of $90 million, growing sequentially each quarter since launch. The underlying dynamics that drove first quarter sales are very favorable for significant future growth, such as increasing clinic penetration and robust reordering rates within penetrated clinics. 
I'd again like to mention how pleased we are with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio which, in addition to the Simparica franchise, had significant growth in the Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart franchises as well. U.S. market share within the flea, tick and heartworm segment is now at an all-time high of 31%, representing an increase of more than 9% for the first quarter versus the same period in the prior year. 
Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $245 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally. We remain confident that key dermatology sales will exceed $1 billion this year. 
Our diagnostics portfolio grew 47% in Q1, led by increases in consumable and instrument revenue. 2020 presented challenging conditions for our diagnostics business, as social distancing restrictions limited our ability to enter vet clinics and increase our market share. However, our vast product portfolio, commitment to innovation, and ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio has us well positioned to grow faster than the overall diagnostics market. 
Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Improving market conditions from the COVID-19 recovery as well as successful promotional activities led to increased sales across the cattle portfolio. In addition, later-than-expected timing of generic entrants led to strong first quarter sales for DRAXXIN. Our swine portfolio grew 19% operationally as large producers continued rebuilding herds as they recover from African swine fever and created significant demand for our products. 
Poultry sales declined in the first quarter as producers expanded their use of lower-cost alternatives to our premium products. The decline in poultry partially tempered the growth in cattle, swine and fish.
Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 19%, with companion animal products growing 32% and livestock sales declining by 4%. For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain promising. While severe weather caused a slight decline in vet clinic traffic for the quarter, revenue per visit was up more than 10%.
In addition, pet ownership has increased and is trending towards a younger demographic, and younger pet owners typically spend more on pet care. This is a key driver for increased revenue per visit and creates robust demand for our diverse portfolio. 
Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth, growing 74% in the quarter. Diagnostics, key dermatology products and small animal vaccines also contributed to growth. 
Simparica Trio continues to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $83 million. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $112 million in the quarter and is now the #2 brand in the U.S. flea, tick and heartworm segment. 
Companion animal diagnostic sales increased 62% in the quarter as the continued recovery at the vet clinic and a favorable prior year comparative period led to significant growth in point-of-care consumable revenue. Key dermatology sales were $157 million for the quarter, growing 16% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
U.S. livestock declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by poultry as producers switching to lower-cost alternatives unfavorably impacted our business. Swine also declined in the quarter, which is attributed almost entirely to a favorable nonrecurring government purchase, which occurred in Q1 2020. 
Cattle grew 6% in the quarter as promotional programs and the timing of generic entrants drove growth across the product portfolio. Growth in cattle partially offset the declines in poultry and swine. 
To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a very favorable companion animal market environment, in which we offer the broadest and most innovative product portfolio. Although livestock declined in the quarter with expectations of further declines for the year, we are encouraged by a series of foodservice trends such as increased dining out and school and business reopenings. 
Revenue in our international segment grew 25% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal revenue growing 37% operationally and livestock revenue growing 17% operationally. The strength in companion animal was fueled by the continuing trends of pet adoptions, increasing standard of care by pet owners, and our investments in advertising, all of which drove growth across our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios. 
Companion animal diagnostics grew 18% in the quarter, led by a 24% increase in point-of-care consumable revenue and a second consecutive quarter of double-digit increase in instrument placement revenue. We began early experience programs for Librela, a monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs. The feedback from the programs has been extremely positive and further solidifies our view of the long-term potential of the product with an EU launch currently underway. Our feline monoclonal antibody, Solensia, will begin early experience programs in Q2 with an EU launch to follow in the third quarter. Solensia will provide cat owners an innovative therapy to address one of the largest unmet needs in animal health. 
Our international livestock business saw double-digit growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which grew low single digits in the quarter. Swine revenue grew 29% operationally led by growth in China of 128%, marking the third consecutive quarter with swine growth in excess of 100%. While additional outbreaks and strains of African swine fever have occurred, we believe it is contained to a specific region and a limited number of customers. Cattle grew 11% operationally in the quarter as a result of marketing campaigns, key account penetration, and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 39% operationally driven by strong performance in Chile, the timing of seasonal vaccination protocols, and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. 
All major markets grew in the first quarter, many in double digits. China total sales grew 75% operationally, which, in addition to the significant growth in swine, delivered 59% operational growth in companion animal. Brazil grew 48% operationally in the quarter as sales of Simparica, the leading oral parasiticide in the Brazilian market, drove a 73% operational increase in companion animal. Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, again, demonstrating the value of substantial geographic and species diversification. Our companion animal business benefited from favorable trends such as rising medicalization rates outside the U.S. And while swine was the largest growth driver for our international livestock business, the contributions were broad-based with growth across all species. 
Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 71% increased 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange and other costs, including freight. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs and advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio. This was partially offset by reductions to T&E costs as a result of COVID-19. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, an increase of 230 basis points driven by a reduction in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter, partially offset by the favorable impact of the jurisdictional mix of earnings. 
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 34% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth. 
We resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter, repurchasing approximately $180 million worth of shares. Along with our dividend, share repurchase is a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy. 
We remain in a strong liquidity position and are highly cash generative. And as a result, we expect to be able to execute on all investment priorities, including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development, while still returning excess cash to shareholders. 
Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising as a result of our first quarter performance. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. 
For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range, with projected revenue now between $7.5 billion and $7.625 billion and operational revenue growth between 10.5% and 12% for the full year versus the 9% to 11% in our February guidance.  Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.16 billion, representing operational growth of 12% to 14% compared to our prior guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.51, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.08 to $4.19. 
Our key assumptions for 2021 have not changed materially since the guidance we provided on our Q4 2020 call. However, our current view is that we will not face competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or our key dermatology products until the second half of 2022. 
On our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we anticipated growth to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, and I'd like to take this time to expand upon that further. We are expecting first half 2021 growth to materially outpace growth in the second half of the year, primarily resulting from Simparica Trio sales and the favorable Q2 2020 comparative period related to COVID-19. Subsequently, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of increased generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as challenging comparative periods when pent-up demand in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half. 
Now to summarize before we move to Q&A, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom line growth in the first quarter, with significant gains in both companion animal and livestock and across nearly every therapeutic area and geography. In addition, we raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance. And while growth will moderate in the back half of the year for the reasons I outlined, we again expect to grow faster than the market and feel very positive about our position for sustained growth beyond this year.

Can you speak a little bit more about the underlying trends you're seeing across the U.S. livestock business? How has that segment performed quarter-to-date? And it seems that DRAXXIN  competition has played out a little bit better than your expectations, but has anything changed in terms of how you're thinking about that headwind over the course of 2021? 
And then my second question is on parasiticides. It does represent a larger portion of your portfolio than it has historically. I guess how should we think about the seasonality of that business, the purchasing patterns both across retailers and vet clinics? And did you see any sort of pull forward outsized stocking dynamics in the quarter that we should be aware of in what your guidance now assumes for Simparica Trio?"

As you think about U.S. livestock, as Glenn mentioned, overall U.S. livestock was down 4%, but there was lots of different trends in there. U.S. cattle was up 6% in the quarter.

As you think about U.S. livestock, as Glenn mentioned, overall U.S. livestock was down 4%, but there was lots of different trends in there. U.S. cattle was up 6% in the quarter. And I think if you look at that, that was driven by later-than-expected entrants in the generics. So we were expecting more entrants sooner, but to your point, we don't really think it's going to end up playing out any differently by the end. 
And so what do I mean by that? If you look at that, we think the entrants will come, we think once they do, we'll likely end up -- if you look at generics, it's certainly 20% to 40% on penetration. And what we said is we think that's likely what it's going to be with DRAXXIN, both in the U.S. and in the EU and really around the globe. 
But as you think about that, it's likely going to happen a little bit later in the year. So we did do better in the beginning of the year. But if you look at that and you compare it to how we did internationally on DRAXXIN more specifically, so although you saw 6% growth in DRAXXIN in the U.S. internationally -- sorry I meant overall DRAXXIN internationally is actually down, and that was because we did have a multiple entrants sooner in that. 
So I don't think livestock really is going to play out any differently. We did see, as Glenn mentioned, a decline in poultry overall. And there is some seasonality obviously if you think about cattle. Swine was down and poultry. 
But overall I think we continue to remind, if you look at livestock overall for us, it was up 8%. I think what often people underappreciate it is that 60% of livestock is outside of the U.S. And although we focus a lot on U.S. cattle, the growth as you saw in China across swine which had 128% growth, and in Brazil still meant livestock did quite well. As you think about the parasiticides, I'll let Glenn sort of take some of that and get into some of the more specific trends."

Great performance from Simparica Trio with $90 million in the quarter alone, and Simparica also delivering $74 million with 38% growth.
In terms of seasonality, we typically do see Q1 and particularly Q2 being the stronger quarters from a parasiticide portfolio perspective, particularly in the U.S. However, as we do see Simparica Trio on a ramp-up curve, impact of that seasonality may be a little different this year as we do expect to continue to increase our clinic penetration and adoption and market share within the clinics as well. So there definitely is some seasonality within the parasiticide portfolio. But with the continued ramp-up on the product, it may not be as severe as you would typically see with an established product."

I'm just wondering if you could opine on how sustainable that is, I mean that 123 million number. Is that a new jumping off point that we should be thinking about in terms of run rate going forward and obviously growing from that? Or could there have been some bulk orders, for example in swine, as some of these producers restart their operations? 
And then another question for Glenn. On the OpEx guide, I'm just wondering if you could talk through a little bit of the details of what you're assuming for operating leverage in the second half. Are there any additional DTC programs for Trio? Are you restarting to see any expense? Is there any inflation factor in? Just wondering how we should think about the SG&A ramp going forward."

One, I think you'll see African swine fever continuing a rebuild of the herd there. It is going to take a few years to rebuild that, so I think that is going to be for the next few years of sustainable growth. You saw swine grow in the quarter at 128%. 
But I think what's also really important to focus on is how well companion animal did, which grew 59%. We've been launching a number of new products, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. We had the launch of [indiscernible] as well as Revolution Plus. So continuing to bring in new products, seeing really, really good growth across both companion animal and livestock, makes us believe that China and the investments we've even talked about in building additional facilities there and growing our biologics footprint, we are very bullish on China continuing to be a sustainable growth driver for the company. Do you want to take the question onwards?"

Q1 typically does tend to be the larger quarter of sales for China, so that necessarily isn't one that you would run off of for the rest of the year. But to Kristin's point, I'm very excited about the growth prospects that we have for China for the year.
In terms of the Opex, we grew 8% in OpEx in the first quarter, which is pretty indicative of what the guidance range would indicate for the year. But there'll be different dynamics throughout the quarters to that. So for Q1 with the growth of 8%, that really was driven by a lot of the incremental DTC that we had for Simparica Trio in the quarter. 
And also, we didn't have savings from T&E in Q1. We had the savings from T&E in Q1, because in Q1 of 2020, that was pre-COVID. We still had our elevated T&E spend. As we move throughout the year, obviously we're not going to have that benefit. 
So the impact of the incremental DTC for Simparica Trio will be there, but we also increased our spending for DTC for Simparica Trio throughout the year last year. So a number of different factors, but the overall level of growth for the year perspective is pretty similar to what we saw for the quarter."

And then our diagnostics business as well. We had 47% growth in our diagnostics business in the quarter. 
So many of our key growth drivers for the long term performed very well in the quarter, which also then enabled us to raise the guidance for the year. So it's across a number of different of our key strategic growth drivers that enabled us to raise that guidance.
In terms of poultry in the U.S., we did see some challenges this quarter as our producer customers did move to some cheaper alternatives from our products. That is something that we'll evaluate through the year. We do expect that there will be a movement back at some point to our products, but that's something that will evolve over time in terms of the efficacy that they see from those cheaper alternatives compared to our more premium products."

And as we looked last year at the sort of 10%, again as we talked about in Glenn's remarks, a 10% increase in revenue per visit. And what's been driving that is there's increased pet ownership, and that really has maintained. People are continuing to spend more time with their pets. I think you see the trend of these new pets being adopted by millennials and Gen Z, and they spend more on those pets. So we see that as a trend that will continue to drive growth overall for the industry. 
And then these pets will ultimately age. And as these -- all these new pets age, a lot of our chronic products will become even more relevant. 
I think this is also driving important growth in our diagnostics business, which grew 47% in the quarter. Again, pets can't tell you what's wrong with them, so I think vets are getting really increased focus on doing diagnostic tests in a lot of these wellness visits. 
If you think about livestock, I mean there's 2 trends to look at. One is just when we produce more protein as people go out more, really what you're going to need to see to be significant improvements here globally as an increase in travel and entertainment. And I think we're now seeing people going back to school, maybe going back to work, maybe traveling from personal. But getting that travel and entertainment industry back up will help drive the growth in livestock globally, I think, over some of these coming quarters. 
So slightly different trends, but we continue to remain bullish. And the way we see our growth is with an increasing pet care business. We see great growth in pet care from everything from our in line, our products, our derm, our [new mabs]. Looking at increased growth in China and Brazil, which again as we talked about, we think is sustainable. And then lastly, continued investment in growth in our diagnostics business, which we're quite excited about."

So we remain very bullish that customers are looking for an alternative to the products in the market right now. 
And we've seen a really strong uptake in that. This is still a significant market. If you look at sort of $90 million in the EU today, 40% of those dogs have OA, and currently only 28% of those are treated. So the early experience data that we've seen to date and the early launch makes us very optimistic for the success of this product.

Although protein is global, the dynamics are very different in each species in a few ways. One, obviously if you look at consumption, as people move into the middle class they're generally starting with milk and then eggs then poultry. Then they move up to swine and then beef. There's also differences geographically on what people consume. Obviously, China is a huge swine market. That's not true in the U.S. where you see probably more poultry and beef. So there are really different consumption trends as well.
The other real big differences is who produces in each market and each species, how much is exported. In the U.S., there's a significantly larger export market for poultry and for swine. 
So there's very different dynamics for each of the different species as people trade up and trade down different protein sources as you think about where people are sourcing those processors who are big export markets versus internal production. So -- and it does lead to very different dynamics.
The other major dynamic you should think about is that the ability for each producer to change their supply is actually quite different. Once you have a supply of cattle, they take many years to grow. You can't all of a sudden pare back in cattle. Poultry producers can decide not to use a bunch of eggs and grow chickens, which only take a few months. So it's very different in their ability to react to the market, and therefore you do see different decisions being made. 
And you probably saw in the papers today, there's huge for poultry right now, and I think poultry producers are going to have to sort of start scaling up. They can do that quickly. They can make those decisions and expand their flocks very quickly.  That is a very difficult thing, it takes a lot of time for a swine or a cattle producer. So that's why you sometimes see some of these different dynamics across species."

We are increasing our hiring really to support the strength of many of our key brands and to continue the growth there. 
From a DTC spending perspective, we would expect more DTC spending this year driven by a couple of different factors. A, we have some Simparica Trio on the market for the full year. So we will support that with advertising expenditures for the full year as well. And we also continue to see strong growth in many of our brands, such as our dermatology portfolio. and we'll continue to increase and support those brands of direct-to-consumer advertising, not only in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. as well where we are increasing our DTC spend behind many of our brands, including Simparica as well as our dermatology portfolio.

Solensia is a little different. You have to get more cats to the clinic. You have to medicalize those cats and treat them. It's a little harder to sense OA in cats. That being said, we'll have a much better sense as we get to the next quarter since we're just beginning early experience right now.

Compared to there to market. It is growing like crazy and taking share. I think when you put the marketing muscle, the technical experience muscle of Zoetis behind the product. Even with competition, we still expect these products to grow. So we will probably build our share faster, but we do expect even with competition that these products in these categories will continue to grow also bringing more people into prescription products versus some of the over the counter, really bringing new solutions I think we'll continue to grow these products in the longer term.

But to Kristin's point, this is a very large market, and we do see products on the market and franchises on the market that are approaching $1 billion today, even without a triple therapy in the U.S. So we think there is significant opportunity for future growth for this franchise.
In terms of livestock, we are off to a strong start, and we do think that the reopening trends are positive for the overall animal health industry and the growth in livestock. We're also very pleased with the performance that we've seen in many of our key markets, particularly outside of the U.S. markets such as China and Brazil and what we've been able to accomplish there. And we expect those trends to continue to be very positive. 
Obviously, we do have some dynamics, particularly to our portfolio within livestock with the impact of DRAXXIN. But overall the fundamentals in the industry are remaining positive. Profitability is up for many of our producers, which is also very encouraging for the overall industry, and we think will be positive for the longer-term outlook for livestock."

As you think about pet care, we've been having a few quarters with 10% or higher revenue per visit. That has been -- continued to be sustained. We think the trends driving this is the increased pet ownership, which hasn't changed. There was a little bit of a fear, as we were in Q3 of last year, with a lot of these dogs being returned or cats returned or re-homed, and we really haven't seen a significant trend there. 
So we think the increased pet ownership even if people go back to work, most people are going to have flexible arrangements. They're still going to be home with their pad more than probably they were before. And they build a bond with those pets and they notice things and they build habits that we think will be sustained as we do that. 
And again, the other important trend here is who is owning these pets? Millennials and Gen Z, who tend to spend more pet. 
So we really continue to see pet ownership trends and spend for per pet continuing. I mean is it going to be 10% every quarter? I'm not so sure. But historically just to remind you, I think it was 5% to 6% historically. So it's still a very strong growth driver overall for the industry, and I think these trends may be higher than what it historically has been on a go-forward basis, just given who's adopting the pets and increased focus on the pet is an important part of the family."

I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and able to get vaccinated for COVID-19, if not already, then soon. We've been very fortunate in the U.S. as vaccination rates are up and infection rates",1459,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and able to get vaccinated for COVID-19, if not already, then soon. We've been very fortunate in the U.S. as vaccination rates are up and infection rates are trending down overall. But that is not the situation everywhere. In many countries, improving access to vaccines and controlling infection rates are critical hurdles for a more comprehensive global recovery. Yet with the extraordinary measures being taken by so many, I remain optimistic about the steady progress we're making to beat this pandemic.
I'm also very proud of what we've been able to do at Zoetis in our own small way to support the global effort. We've been able to keep our colleagues safe, encourage and assist them with vaccinations where possible, and continue serving our customers in the care of their animals. And we're off to a very strong start in 2021, executing on strategies for building on our innovative pet care portfolio, expanding in key markets outside the U.S. and accelerating our growth in diagnostics. In the first quarter, we grew our top line revenue at 21% operationally, our best quarter ever, with 25% operational growth internationally and 19% growth in the U.S. China and Brazil led our international performance with 75% and 48% operational growth respectively, exhibiting their strength in both companion animal and livestock product sales. 
In total, our containment animal portfolio grew 34% operationally based on the strength of our parasiticides and dermatology products, while our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally with solid growth in cattle, swine and fish products.
Digging deeper on pet care, it has been 1 year since the launch of our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio. It is exceeding expectations and has been well received by customers, with a 90% plus penetration rate in our largest U.S. corporate accounts. Simparica Trio is the latest growth catalyst for a portfolio of small animal parasiticides. After several successful innovations in the last few years, these products made up 16% of our total sales in the first quarter and includes such brands as Simparica, Simparica Trio, Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart. We believe the ongoing market shift to e-commerce is another boost for this category, helping to increase compliance and months on therapy. And our direct-to-consumer campaigns for Simparica and Simparica Trio continued showing a solid return on investment in markets around the world.
Meanwhile, our key dermatology portfolio led by Apoquel and Cytopoint, demonstrated continued double-digit growth. We are seeing excellent traction and significant growth across the range of international market. Our dermatology portfolio has further growth potential as we continue expanding our international customer base and seek to become a more common first-line treatment for pruritus in dogs. Veterinarians and pet owners alike appreciate the exceptional standard of care that our products can provide.
In the containment animal space, we've also continued to be pleased with our diagnostics portfolio, which grew 47% operationally in the first quarter. We have grown our point-of-care diagnostic sales, made excellent progress on improving our connectivity solutions in veterinary practices, and have seen our cloud-based VetScan images platform receiving very positive customer feedback, with placements exceeding expectations in the early launch. We're also making progress on our Reference Labs integrations and look forward to future expansion in this space, both in the U.S. and internationally.
Our growth in livestock was driven by the performance of cattle, swine and fish in the first quarter. Cattle product sales in the U.S. were strong as the food service sector has started to recover and generic competition projection was later than expected. Meanwhile, swine benefited from the continued recovery from African swine fever in China.
Thanks to the unprecedented growth in revenue and our continued financial discipline and adaptability throughout COVID-19, our adjusted net income grew 34% operationally. Looking ahead, we are raising guidance for operational growth and full year revenue to the range of 10.5% to 12%. And while we had an unusually strong first quarter, we expect more normalized revenue growth in the second half of the year due to tougher comparative quarters and increasing generic competition for DRAXXIN. Glenn will provide more details on other guidance updates in his remarks.
Since the beginning of the year, Zoetis has continued to advance our key priorities, including key milestones for new products and life cycle innovations and geographic expansions for major brands. Since our last earnings announcement, we received approval in the European Union for Solensia the first injectable monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and will be launching this year. Osteoarthritis is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated today due to limited options for therapy and difficulty recognizing pain in cats.
Meanwhile, Librela, our monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of OA pain in dogs, has launched in the EU. And we're seeing a great customer response from vets and dog owners who referenced increased activity, social ability and quality of life for their pets.
In the U.S., we continued discussions with the FDA regarding our regulatory submissions and manufacturing inspection for Librela and Solensia, and we now anticipate approvals for both products in 2022, with Librela likely later in the year. We will provide updates on U.S. revenue expectations for these products in 2022 as we get further clarity on approval timing and rollout plans.
It is also worth noting that in China, which is our second largest market in terms of revenue, Zoetis recently received approvals for several leading products, Fostera PCV MH a 1-shot vaccine for pigs, Excenel RTU EZ, a key anti-infective for cattle and swine,  and Revolution Plus, our latest parasiticide for cats. We continue to strengthen our portfolio in China, one of our key catalysts for growth.
We're also maximizing our key brands with more geographic expansion. In poultry, we expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT-ND in Canada, Brazil and several other smaller markets. And in parasiticides, we received additional approvals for Simparica Trio in Japan, Mexico and several other smaller markets.
In terms of sustainability, we published our long-term goals in March with specific commitments to communities, animals and the planet. We've built a comprehensive and rigorous approach through our Driven to Care program, and our goals include support for 10 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We'll be releasing more detail on these goals and our initial progress in our sustainability report this June.
In closing, the fundamental growth drivers for our industry continue to show strong and sustainable momentum. Pet adoption trends and higher spending per visit in the U.S. along with increased medicalization rates in markets outside the U.S. all continue to bode well for significant growth in our companion animal and diagnostic portfolios globally. We feel very confident about where our companion animal business has come over the last few years, launching innovative new products, defining new standards of treatment and expanding our global reach.
In 2014, our companion animal business was 34% of our total revenue. Last year, it had grown to 55% based on the strength of our innovation and investment in growth, and we see that continuing to expand.
In livestock, the industry is in a more limited innovation cycle, and we expect modest growth for the year. Livestock growth is tied closely to the pandemic and how quickly the foodservice industry recovers.
For Zoetis, we also anticipate increasing headwinds of generic competition to DRAXXIN, but we expect our life cycle innovations and competitive strategies to help us mitigate the impact.
While U.S. livestock may present challenges for us in the near term, I feel very positive about our catalysts for growth in pet care, diagnostics, and international markets like China and Brazil. We continue to be led by our companion animal parasiticide and dermatology portfolio with more growth to come, and we see a bright future ahead for our monoclonal antibodies for pain. Diagnostics is accelerating its growth as we increase our global footprint, expand our reference labs and demonstrates the potential for VetScan images to veterinary clinics. And internationally, China continues to be a market with significant growth potential, not only in swine products, but with a sizable opportunity for increased medicalization of pets. And we expect major growth to continue in Brazil across the companion animal and livestock portfolios.
As always, we remain confident that Zoetis' diverse portfolio across species and geographies, our continued pipeline of innovative new products and life cycle innovations, and the agility and commitment of our colleagues will continue driving our success in 2021 and beyond. Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our first quarter results and updated guidance for the full year 2021."
215548781,709832184,2272900,"Zoetis Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Zoetis Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, delivering substantial growth on a global basis and across species and therapeutic areas. Today, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter fina",1930,"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, delivering substantial growth on a global basis and across species and therapeutic areas. Today, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance, and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance.
In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 22% on a reported basis and 21% operationally. Adjusted net income of $603 million with an increase of 33% on a reported basis and 34% operationally. Operational revenue grew 21%, resulting entirely from volume increases with price flat for the quarter.
Volume growth of 21% includes 13% from other in line products, 5% from new products, and 3% from key dermatology products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 34% operationally, with livestock growing 8% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada, Australia and Mexico.
We also saw growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in small animal vaccines and diagnostics. Following blockbuster sales in year 1, Simparica Trio began 2021 with strong first quarter performance, posting revenue of $90 million, growing sequentially each quarter since launch. The underlying dynamics that drove first quarter sales are very favorable for significant future growth, such as increasing clinic penetration and robust reordering rates within penetrated clinics.  
I'd again like to mention how pleased we are with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio, which, in addition to the Simparica franchise, had significant growth in the Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart franchises as well. U.S. market share within the flea, tick and heartworm segment is now at an all-time high of 31%, representing an increase of more than 9% for the first quarter versus the same period in the prior year.
Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $245 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally. We remain confident that key dermatology sales will exceed $1 billion this year.
Our diagnostics portfolio grew 47% in Q1, led by increases in consumable and instrument revenue. 2020 presented challenging conditions for our diagnostics business, as social distancing restrictions limited our ability to enter vet clinics and increase our market share. However, our vast product portfolio, commitment to innovation, and ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio has us well positioned to grow faster than the overall diagnostics market.
Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Improving market conditions from the COVID-19 recovery as well as successful promotional activities led to increased sales across the cattle portfolio. In addition, later-than-expected timing of generic entrants led to strong first quarter sales for DRAXXIN.
Our swine portfolio grew 19% operationally as large producers continued rebuilding herds as they recover from African swine fever and created significant demand for our products.
Poultry sales declined in the first quarter as producers expanded their use of lower-cost alternatives to our premium products. The decline in poultry partially tempered the growth in cattle, swine and fish.
Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 19%, with companion animal products growing 32% and livestock sales declining by 4%. For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain promising. While severe weather caused a slight decline in vet clinic traffic for the quarter, revenue per visit was up more than 10%.
In addition, pet ownership has increased and is trending towards a younger demographic, and younger pet owners typically spend more on pet care. This is a key driver for increased revenue per visit and creates robust demand for our diverse portfolio.
Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth, growing 74% in the quarter. Diagnostics, key dermatology products and small animal vaccines also contributed to growth.
Simparica Trio continues to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $83 million. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $112 million in the quarter and is now the #2 brand in the U.S. flea, tick and heartworm segment.
Companion animal diagnostic sales increased 62% in the quarter as the continued recovery at the vet clinic and a favorable prior year comparative period led to significant growth in point-of-care consumable revenue. Key dermatology sales were $157 million for the quarter, growing 16% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint.
U.S. livestock declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by poultry as producers switching to lower-cost alternatives unfavorably impacted our business. Swine also declined in the quarter, which is attributed almost entirely to a favorable nonrecurring government purchase, which occurred in Q1 2020. Cattle grew 6% in the quarter as promotional programs and the timing of generic entrants drove growth across the product portfolio. Growth in cattle partially offset the declines in poultry and swine.
To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a very favorable companion animal market environment, in which we offer the broadest and most innovative product portfolio. Although livestock declined in the quarter with expectations of further declines for the year, we are encouraged by a series of foodservice trends such as increased dining out and school and business reopenings.  
Revenue in our international segment grew 25% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal revenue growing 37% operationally and livestock revenue growing 17% operationally. The strength in companion animal was fueled by the continuing trends of pet adoptions, increasing standard of care by pet owners, and our investments in advertising, all of which drove growth across our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios.
Companion animal diagnostics grew 18% in the quarter, led by a 24% increase in point-of-care consumable revenue and a second consecutive quarter of double-digit increase in instrument placement revenue. We began early experience programs for Librela, a monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs. The feedback from the programs has been extremely positive, and further solidifies our view of the long-term potential of the product with an EU launch currently underway.
Our feline monoclonal antibody, Solensia, will begin early experience programs in Q2 with an EU launch to follow in the third quarter. Solensia will provide cat owners an innovative therapy to address one of the largest unmet needs in animal health.
Our international livestock business saw double-digit growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which grew low single digits in the quarter. Swine revenue grew 29% operationally led by growth in China of 128%, marking the third consecutive quarter with swine growth in excess of 100%. While additional outbreaks and strains of African swine fever have occurred, we believe it is contained to a specific region and a limited number of customers.
Cattle grew 11% operationally in the quarter as a result of marketing campaigns, key account penetration, and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 39% operationally driven by strong performance in Chile, the timing of seasonal vaccination protocols, and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group.
All major markets grew in the first quarter, many in double digits. China total sales grew 75% operationally, which in addition to the significant growth in swine, delivered 59% operational growth in companion animal. Brazil grew 48% operationally in the quarter as sales of Simparica, the leading oral parasiticide in the Brazilian market, drove a 73% operational increase in companion animal.
Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, again, demonstrating the value of substantial geographic and species diversification.
Our companion animal business benefited from favorable trends such as rising medicalization rates outside the U.S. And while swine was the largest growth driver for our international livestock business, the contributions were broad-based with growth across all species.
Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 71% increased 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange and other costs, including freight. Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs and advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio. This was partially offset by reductions to T&E costs as a result of COVID-19.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, an increase of 230 basis points driven by a reduction in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter, partially offset by the favorable impact of the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 34% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth.
We resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter, repurchasing approximately $180 million worth of shares. Along with our dividend, share repurchase is a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy.
We remain in a strong liquidity position and are highly cash generative. And as a result, we expect to be able to execute on all investment priorities including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development, while still returning excess cash to shareholders.
Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising as a result of our first quarter performance. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April.
For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range, with projected revenue now between $7.5 billion and $7.625 billion and operational revenue growth between 10.5% and 12% for the full year versus the 9% to 11% in our February guidance.
Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.16 billion, representing operational growth of 12% to 14% compared to our prior guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.51, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.08 to $4.19.
Our key assumptions for 2021 have not changed materially since the guidance we provided on our Q4 2020 call. However, our current view is that we will not face competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or our key dermatology products until the second half of 2022.
On our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we anticipated growth to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, and I'd like to take this time to expand upon that further. We are expecting first half 2021 growth to materially outpace growth in the second half of the year, primarily resulting from Simparica Trio sales and the favorable Q2 2020 comparative period related to COVID-19. Subsequently, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of increased generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as challenging comparative periods when pent-up demand in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half.
Now to summarize before we move to Q&A, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom line growth in the first quarter with significant gains in both companion animal and livestock and across nearly every therapeutic area and geography. In addition, we raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance. And while growth will moderate in the back half of the year for the reasons I outlined, we again expect to grow faster than the market and feel very positive about our position for sustained growth beyond this year.
Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

And then my second question is on parasiticides. It does represent a larger portion of your portfolio than it has historically. I guess how should we think about the seasonality of that business, the purchasing patterns both across retailers and vet clinics and did you see any sort of pull forward outsized stocking dynamics in the quarter that we should be aware of and what your guidance now assumes for Simparica Trio?"

As you think about U.S. livestock, as Glenn mentioned, overall U.S. livestock was down 4%, but there was lots of different trends in there. U.S. cattle was up 6% in the quarter. And I think if you look at that, that was driven by later-than-expected entrants in the generics. So we were expecting more entrants sooner, but to your point, we don't really think it's going to end up playing out any differently by the end.
And so what do I mean by that? If you look at that, we think the entrants will come, we think once they do, we'll likely end up -- if you look at generics, it's normally 20% to 40% penetration. And what we said is we think that's likely what it's going to be with DRAXXIN, both in the U.S. and in the EU and really around the globe.
But as you think about that, it's likely going to happen a little bit later in the year. So we did do better in the beginning of the year. But if you look at that and you compare it to how we did internationally on DRAXXIN more specifically, so although you saw 6% growth in DRAXXIN in the U.S. internationally -- sorry just meant overall DRAXXIN internationally is actually down, and that was because we did have a multiple entrants sooner in that.
So I don't think livestock really is going to play out any differently. We did see, as Glenn mentioned, a decline in poultry overall. And there is some seasonality obviously if you think about cattle. Swine was down and poultry.
But overall I think we continue to remind, if you look at livestock overall for us, it was up 8%. I think what often people underappreciate is that 60% of livestock is outside of the U.S. And although we focus a lot on U.S. cattle, the growth as you saw in China across swine which had 128% growth, and in Brazil still meant livestock did quite well. As you think about the parasiticides, I'll let Glenn sort of take some of that and get into some of the more specific trends."

In terms of seasonality, we typically do see Q1 and particularly Q2 being the stronger quarters from a parasiticide portfolio perspective, particularly in the U.S. However, as we do see Simparica Trio on a ramp-up curve, the impact of that seasonality may be a little different this year as we do expect to continue to increase our clinic penetration and adoption and market share within the clinics as well. So there definitely is some seasonality within the parasiticide portfolio. But with the continued ramp-up on the product, it may not be as severe as you would typically see with an established product."

I'm just wondering if you could opine on how sustainable that is, I mean that 123 million number. Is that a new jumping off point that we should be thinking about in terms of run rate going forward and obviously growing from that? Or could there have been some bulk orders, for example in swine, as some of these producers restart their operations?
And then another question for Glenn. On the OpEx guide, I'm just wondering if you could talk through a little bit of the details of what you're assuming for operating leverage in the second half. Are there any additional DTC programs for Trio? Are you restarting to see any expense? Is there any inflation factor in? Just wondering how we should think about the SG&A ramp going forward."

One, I think you'll see African swine fever continuing a rebuild of the herd there. It is going to take a few years to rebuild that, so I think that is going to be for the next few years of sustainable growth. You saw swine grow in the quarter at 128%. 
But I think what's also really important to focus on is how well companion animal did, which grew 59%. We've been launching a number of new products, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. We had the launch of Fostera PCV MH as well as Revolution Plus. So continuing to bring in new products, seeing really, really good growth across both companion animal and livestock, makes us believe that China and the investments we've even talked about in building additional facilities there and growing our biologic footprint, we are very bullish on China continuing to be a sustainable growth driver for the company.

Q1 typically does tend to be the larger quarter of sales for China, so that necessarily isn't one that you would run off of for the rest of the year. But to Kristin's point, I'm very excited about the growth prospects that we have for China for the year.
In terms of the OpEx, we grew 8% in OpEx in the first quarter, which is pretty indicative of what the guidance range would indicate for the year. But there'll be different dynamics throughout the quarters to that. So for Q1 with the growth of 8%, that really was driven by a lot of the incremental DTC that we had for Simparica Trio in the quarter.
And also, we didn't have the savings from T&E in Q1. We had the savings from T&E in Q1, because in Q1 of 2020, that was pre-COVID. We still had our elevated T&E spend. As we move throughout the year, obviously we're not going to have that benefit.
So the impact of the incremental DTC for Simparica Trio will be there, but we also increased our spending for DTC for Simparica Trio throughout the year last year. So a number of different factors, but the overall level of growth for the year perspective is pretty similar to what we saw for the quarter."

And maybe more specifically, is the step-up in companion just due to Trio? I mean if you annualize out the 90 million, you get to 360 already and it seems like that was in and around the original guidance when we think about the contribution to growth.

And then our diagnostics business as well. We had 47% growth in our diagnostics business in the quarter.
So many of our key growth drivers for the long term performed very well in the quarter, which also then enabled us to raise the guidance for the year. So it's across a number of different of our key strategic growth drivers that enabled us to raise that guidance.
In terms of poultry in the U.S., we did see some challenges this quarter as our producer customers did move to some cheaper alternatives from our anticoccidials. That is something that we'll evaluate through the year. We do expect that there will be a movement back at some point to our products, but that's something that will evolve over time in terms of the efficacy that they see from those cheaper alternatives compared to our more premium products."

We look at some of the trends you've seen this year, and a lot of these are more sustainable on the pet care side. And I think the trends, that I'll talk about in a second, are a little bit different on the livestock side. 
What you've been seeing over the last few quarters is an increase in revenue per visit. That has been sustainable. And as we looked last year at the sort of 10%, again as we talked about in Glenn's remarks, a 10% increase in revenue per visit. And what's been driving that is there's increased pet ownership, and that really has maintained. People are continuing to spend more time with their pets. I think you see the trend of these new pets being adopted by millennials and Gen Z, and they spend more on those pets. So we see that as a trend that will continue to drive growth overall for the industry.
And then these pets will ultimately age. And as these -- all these new pets age, a lot of our chronic products will become even more relevant.
I think this is also driving important growth in our diagnostics business, which grew 47% in the quarter. Again, pets can't tell you what's wrong with them, so I think vets are getting really increased focus on doing diagnostic tests in a lot of these wellness visits.
If you think about livestock, I mean there's 2 trends to look at. One is just when will we produce more protein as people go out more, really what you're going to need to see the significant improvements here globally as an increase in travel and entertainment. And I think we're now seeing people going back to schools, maybe going back to work, maybe traveling for personal, but getting that travel and entertainment industry back up will help drive the growth in livestock globally, I think, over some of these coming quarters.
So slightly different trends, but we continue to remain bullish. And the way we see our growth is with an increasing pet care business. We see great growth in pet care from everything from our in line, our para's, our derm, our [indiscernible]. Looking at increased growth in China and Brazil, which again as we talked about, we think is sustainable.

Although protein is global, the dynamics are very different in each species in a few ways. One, obviously if you look at consumption, as people move into the middle class, they're generally starting with milk and then eggs then poultry, then they move up to swine and then beef. There's also differences geographically on what people consume. Obviously, China is a huge swine market. That's not true in the U.S. where you see probably more poultry and beef. So there are really different consumption trends as well.
The other real big differences is who produces in each market and for each species, how much is exported. In the U.S., there's a significantly larger export market for poultry and for swine.
So there's very different dynamics for each of the different species as people trade up and trade down different protein sources as you think about where people are sourcing those protein sources who are big export markets versus internal production. So -- and it does lead to very different dynamics.
The other major dynamic you should think about is that the ability for each producer to change their supply is actually quite different. Once you have a supply of cattle, they take many years to grow. You can't all of a sudden pare back in cattle. Poultry producers can decide not to use a bunch of eggs and grow chickens, which only take a few months. So it's very different in their ability to react to the market, and therefore you do see different decisions being made and you probably saw in the papers today, there's huge demand for poultry right now, and I think poultry producers are going to have to sort of start scaling up. They can do that quickly. They can make those decisions and expand their flocks very quickly.  That is a very difficult thing, it takes a lot of time for a swine or a cattle producer. So that's why you sometimes see some of these different dynamics across species."

But I would remind you once, certainly if you look at Simparica Trio, that we've done incredibly well with Simparica, and it was the third to market. And we continue to grow this franchise already around the world, the Simparica franchise even with other competitors on the market.
So is there anything you want to add there, Glenn? Do you want to take the second question?"

Part of it is bit of a normalization from the COVID impact in 2020. We would expect that T&E expenditures would begin to increase, particularly in the second half of the year. But also our compensation costs as we ramped up hiring some positions that may have been on hold, with the impact of COVID, it's just more difficult to fill. We are increasing our hiring really to support the strength of many of our key brands and to continue the growth there.
From a DTC spending perspective, we would expect more DTC spending this year driven by a couple of different factors. A, we have some Simparica Trio on the market for the full year. So we will support that with advertising expenditures for the full year as well. And we also continue to see strong growth in many of our brands, such as our dermatology portfolio and we'll continue to increase and support those brands with direct-to-consumer advertising, not only in the U.S., but outside of the U.S. as well where we are increasing our DTC spend behind many of our brands, including Simparica as well as our dermatology portfolio. So there are a number of areas I'll spend really to support the significant revenue growth opportunities that we see not only for this year, but for many years beyond."

You would see Librela priced at a premium similar to that.
So we would expect that Librela will be a high-margin product for us consisting with the overall companion animal portfolio, which typically is above our overall gross margin level. So that will be a positive contributor to gross margin over time.
In terms of ASF and our development for vaccines, as we've said before, this Is a very complicated disease state, it's going to take many years to find a solution. We are active in those development studies, but it will be a multiyear time frame before we find a solution for African swine fever."

I think we're now just in early experience with Solensia, so it's probably a little earlier there.
But again, as we said I think a little bit previously, I do think the launch curves are going to look different between Librela and Solensia a little bit. Librela is going to enter an established market. The great news is the vets are already very comfortable with injectable monoclonal antibodies given Cytopoint. So I think you'll see a really nice uptick, and I think we'll do very well there.
Solensia is a little different. You have to get more cats to the clinic. You have to medicalize those cats and treat them. It's a little harder to always sense OA in cats. That being said, we'll have a much better sense as we get to the next quarter since we're just beginning early experience right now. 
We're really bullish on this in the medium term how fast that uptake happened. I think early experience, which is what we're in right now, we'll be able to better inform that as we get to the next quarter. But the science behind it, the safety, the efficacy is really, really strong and what's different, as we've talked about for Solensia, there really are very few alternatives for cats.

So we think the increased pet ownership even if people go back to work, most people are going to have flexible arrangements. They're still going to be home with their pet more than probably they were before and they build a bond with those pets and they notice things and they build habits that we think will be sustained as we do that.
And again, the other important trend here is who is owning these pets? Millennials and Gen Z, who tend to spend more per pet. 
So we really continue to see pet ownership trends and spend per pet continuing. I mean is it going to be 10% every quarter? I'm not so sure. But historically just to remind you, I think it was 5% to 6% historically. So it's still a very strong growth driver overall for the industry, and I think these trends may be higher than what it historically has been on a go-forward basis, just given who's adopting the pets and increased focus on the pet is an important part of the family."

[ I hope ] you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and getting vaccinated for COVID-19. I'd like to start the call by welcoming our new Chief Financial Officer, Wetteny Joseph, who is joining me on the call today. As the former CFO of Catalent, Wetteny is a veteran of the biopharma industry and very familiar with many of you in the investment community. Wetteny joined us on June 1 and is off to a fast start, learning all about the company and animal health, everything from cattle [ runs ] and drought impacts to pet care trends and parasiticide season. 
I'm confident that Wetteny will make strong contributions to our ongoing market performance, value creation and leadership in animal health. I also want to take a moment to thank Glenn David for his partnership and all of his contributions to Zoetis as CFO over the last 5 years. Glenn has taken on a new role overseeing our international operations and other business units, including PHARMAQ, biodevices and Pumpkin Pet Insurance. I know he will bring his signature leadership qualities, business skills and industry knowledge to this role and continue driving profitable growth in these areas. Now turning to the second quarter. We achieved strong results once again, with 22% operational growth in revenue and 28% operational growth in adjusted net income. 
Our companion animal portfolio generated 36% operational revenue growth, driven by our pet care, parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and diagnostics. Meanwhile, livestock product sales were up 3% operationally and remain in line with our expectations for more moderate growth this year. The second quarter results also reflected favorable comparisons to last year's second quarter when the uncertainty of COVID-19 and related lockdowns were most severely felt across the animal health industry. 
We are raising full year guidance for revenue and adjusted net income again this quarter to reflect our first half performance and confidence in the underlying growth drivers of our business. We remain on track for a very strong year and continue to focus on sustaining our investments in long-term growth opportunities. 
With a strong cash flow and positive outlook, [indiscernible] we are investing internally and externally in innovative new products, market expansion plans and direct-to-consumer promotion that will support future growth. Our team has been delivering strong growth based on internally developed companion animal parasiticides, led by Simparica, ProHeart and Revolution Plus franchises. 
We have redefined care for the dermatology category with our development of Apoquel and Cytopoint, and we see more growth potential coming from our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, new vector vaccines for poultry and the industry's first cloud-based diagnostic platform with AI capabilities. In terms of our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of OA pain in dogs and cats, we continue to anticipate U.S. approval for Librela and Solensia in 2022. 
Meanwhile, initial customer response from vets and pet owners in Europe has been excellent, and we recently received approval of Solensia in Canada. I always say with great pride that we have the best field force in the animal health industry, and we will continue to expand their scope, effectiveness and digital tools in ways that can enhance our customers' experience and support our growth objectives. 
We've also seen a positive return on our investment in direct-to-consumer promotions for Simparica, Apoquel and disease awareness over the years and DTC remains an area of ongoing investment to support our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios. And finally, we continue to look externally for business development opportunities that can complement our portfolio and expand our market presence or capabilities. 
Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire Jurox, a privately held animal health company based in Australia. Expected to close in the first half of 2022, the acquisition will provide us with growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity and increased capabilities in Australia, our fifth largest market and also bring us a range of companion animal and livestock products primed for global expansion. 
As I wrap up my remarks, our growth story for this year remains very consistent based on 3 recurring catalysts. First, our companion animal portfolio driven by our triple combinations Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our dermatology treatments, Apoquel and Cytopoint, new monoclonal antibodies for pain and our VetScan diagnostic systems. 
The entire portfolio is benefiting from strong pet care trends in terms of increasing clinic visits, rising spend per visit and a focus on diagnostics and specialty care, especially among newer and younger generations of pet owners. Recent estimates for market growth in companion animal products are in the high single digits, and Zoetis continues to expect to grow faster than the market. 
We're gaining share in the approximately $5 billion global parasiticide market for pets and we're excited by veterinarian and pet owner responses to our new monoclonal antibodies for pain. We also continue to see progress in the early launch of Vetscan Imagyst, which leads to our second catalyst for growth, Diagnostics, which posted 38% operational revenue growth in the second quarter and access to vet clinics in the U.S. rebounded from the year ago quarter. Our third growth catalyst is International, where we continue to generate strong operational growth driven by China and Brazil, which grew at 30% and 40%, respectively. All our catalysts for growth are buoyed by our priority to champion a healthier and more sustainable future through commitments to our communities animals and the planet. You can read more about our progress on these ESG goals and our first sustainability report, which was published in June. 
In closing, we had a great second quarter, and we're focused on delivering a record-setting year. The market dynamics in animal health remains strong, steady and resilient even during the challenging times based on people's unbreakable bond with animals. For the remainder of the year, our diverse portfolio, innovative pet care products, strength in diagnostics and expansion in international markets will continue driving our performance. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny."

And good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter performance, I would like to take a moment to express how excited I am to join Zoetis, a company with an exceptional opportunity for meaningful long-term growth driven by the durability and resiliency of the existing portfolio, a robust product pipeline and a keen focus on future innovation. I look forward to leading an outstanding finance organization and maintaining the financial principles and investment strategies, which position Zoetis as the world leader in animal health. 
I would also like to express my appreciation to the Zoetis colleagues and the investment community for such a warm and gracious welcome. I had the pleasure of speaking with several of our investors since becoming CFO, and I look forward to connecting with many more in the coming weeks. 
Now shifting focus to earnings. This morning, I will provide commentary on our second quarter financial results, [ contributing ] factors to our performance and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 26% on a reported basis and 22% operationally. 
Adjusted net income of $566 million was an increase of 33% on a reported basis and 28% operationally. Operational revenue grew 22% with 2% from price and 20% from volume. Volume growth includes 12% from other in-line products, 6% from new products and 2% from key dermatology products. We delivered another strong quarter and remain encouraged by the performance of our business, health of the overall industry and our outlook for the future. It is worth noting that Q2 2020 is a favorable comparative period due to the impact of COVID-19. 
The pandemic caused widespread uncertainty last year, which led to clinic closures, supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer demand from restaurant and food service to grocery stores. This materially impacted several aspects of our companion animal and livestock businesses. Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter. 
Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing [ 36% ] operationally with livestock growing 3% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was again driven by our parasiticide portfolio, led by sales of Simparica Trio and with significant contributions from the broader portfolio. 
We also continue to see growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint as well as in vaccines and diagnostics. Simparica Trio has continued to perform exceptionally well, posting revenue of $139 million, representing growth of more than 200% versus the comparable 2020 period. In addition to sales, we are exceeding our other performance measures as well, such as clinic penetration, share within penetrated clinics and reordering rates. 
The strength of our entire companion animal parasitic portfolio was evident again this quarter, growing 50% operationally with meaningful growth in the ProHeart and Revolution Stronghold franchises in addition to the Simparica franchise. Having the broadest and most innovative portfolio within a large and expanding therapeutic area [indiscernible] bullish on future growth in parasiticide. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $280 million in the quarter, growing 22% operationally. Cytopoint had a particularly strong quarter, growing 42% operationally and generating quarterly revenue of $100 million for the first time since launch. 
Year-to-date sales for key dermatology products are $524 million and our view remains unchanged that sales will exceed $1 billion this year. Our diagnostics portfolio had operational growth of 38% in Q2, led by increases in consumable and [ instrument ] revenue as the business continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic. 
With our sustained investments in diagnostics, the new technology we are bringing to the market and the ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio, we are well positioned to grow faster than the diagnostics market, which is expected to grow double digits and outpaced the overall animal health market. Livestock growth in the quarter was driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Cattle grew 3% and swine grew 6% operationally despite price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs weighing on [ producer profitability ] in the U.S. 
Data suggests the food service and restaurant industries continued to recover in the second quarter, which is a crucial dynamic for demand of our premium products. Poultry was the only species [indiscernible] in the quarter, which fell 4% as producers in the U.S. expanded their use of lower-cost alternatives to our products. The decline in poultry partially offset the growth in cattle, swine and fish products. 
Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 22% with sales of companion animal products growing 34% and lifestyle product sales declining 8%. U.S. quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in company history. For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain robust. Vet [indiscernible] revenue increased double digits in the quarter and patient visits and spend per visit were up as well. While we expect some of the trends to moderate, our view is they will remain above pre-COVID-19 levels. 
A meaningful portion of pet acquisitions, which occurred during the pandemic were by millennials and Gen Z. This infuses a solid foundation of younger pet ownership who are willing to spend disproportionately more on all aspects of pet care than prior generations and will be a key growth driver for companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics moving forward. 
Our companion animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth in the U.S., growing 59% in the quarter. 
Key dermatology products, vaccines and diagnostics also contributed to growth. Simparica Trio had an incredibly strong quarter in the U.S. with sales of $120 million, generating the highest revenue by a single product in the U.S. for Q2. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $153 million, growing 96% and remain the #2 brand in the U.S. flea, tick and heartworm market. 
Key dermatology sales were $197 million for the quarter, growing [ 23% ] with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Diagnostic sales increased 22% in the quarter with growth in instruments, rapid tests, point-of-care consumables and reference lab revenue. U.S. livestock sales fell 8% in the quarter driven by declines in cattle and poultry with swine essentially flat for the quarter. 
Q2 cattle sales were negatively impacted by a promotional program in the first quarter of this year, which pulled forward a portion of second quarter sales. In addition, price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs weighing on beef and dairy end markets presented challenges to our cattle business this quarter. 
Poultry declined in the quarter has produced expanded use of lower cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of higher feed costs and labor wages and smaller [ flog ] sizes reducing disease pressure. We also faced generic competition [ from Zoamix ], our alternative to antibiotics and medicated feed additives. 
To summarize, our U.S. operations delivered another strong quarter led by our innovative and robust companion animal portfolio. The end market dynamics for companion animals remain extremely healthy with pet ownership and pet spending trends driving an environment conducive to sustainable future growth, which is expected to more than offset the near-term weaknesses to [ U.S. livestock business ]. 
Now turning to our International segment. Revenue in our International segment also grew 22% operationally in the quarter with companion animal revenue growing 41% and live stock revenue growing 10% operationally. The trends fueling strength in our international companion animal business are very similar to those in the U.S. The increasing [ medicalization rates ] and standard of care by pet owners coupled with significant investments in advertising and promotion to support new product launches and key brands drove growth across our parasiticides, vaccines, diagnostics and key dermatology portfolios. Diagnostics grew 106% operationally in the quarter with consumables and instrument revenue each exceeding 100% operational growth. Librela, our monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs launched in the EU in the second quarter. Feedback from the early experience trials in Q1 was encouraging and second quarter sales exceeded our expectations.  
Further supporting our optimism on the long-term blockbuster potential of the product as well as monoclonal antibodies as a platform for future growth. Our feline monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain Solensia began early experience programs in the second quarter with an EU launch following in Q3. As previously mentioned, OA pain in cat is a significant unmet need in animal health, and we're excited to provide pet owners with a novel product in a space that has previously lacked innovation. Meanwhile, our international livestock business had its second [indiscernible] with growth across all species, led by strong operational growth in cattle and swine. [indiscernible] growth in the quarter was driven by marketing campaigns, key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets. 
Revenue growth in swine is largely attributed to China, which will be 38% operationally. The [ feed ] for growth in swine remained consistent with previous quarters as large key accounts increase their use of our vaccines and other products as they continue to expand production as the market shifts from smaller farms to larger scale modern operations. 
Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% operationally. Growth was driven by strong performance of [indiscernible] in Chile, vaccine volume in Norway and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. From a market perspective lens, all major markets grew double digits in the second quarter [indiscernible] which declined slightly in Q2. China and Brazil had strong quarters, growing 30% and 40%, respectively, on an operational basis. 
Growth in companion animal across emerging markets remains a key driver of our international business. And in addition to the growth in China and Brazil, our other emerging markets, companion animal business grew 68% operationally. Overall, our International segment delivered strong results, demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography. 
The lifestyle business continues to perform well and increasing pet acquisitions and pet care spending are extremely encouraging trends for long-term growth in companion animal. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin [indiscernible] is essentially flat on a reported basis compared to the prior year as favorable product mix and price were offset by higher manufacturing costs in freight. 
Adjusted operating expenses increased 23% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs, advertising and promotion expense and freight. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, a decrease of 230 basis points, driven by the favorable impact of [indiscernible] mix of earnings, lower [ GILTI ] tax and an increase in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. 
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were 28% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth. We remain in a very strong liquidity position and continued our share buyback program, repurchasing approximately [ $165 million ] worth of shares in the quarter. 
The strength of our balance sheet and substantial free cash flow generation allows us to make significant investments for future growth while still returning excess cash to shareholders. Before I review our updated guidance, I would like to reiterate a point that has been discussed on prior earnings calls, which is that we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of varying comparative periods where pent-up demand created by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020 work its way through the system in the second half of the year in addition to the expected increased generic competition for [indiscernible]. 
Adjusting for the variability in the comparative period due to the pandemic, our phasing of top line growth would be more normalized and consistent quarter-to-quarter throughout this year. Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising and narrowing as a result of our second quarter performance, strength of our product portfolio and favorable market dynamics, which we expect to continue [Audio Gap] Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July. 
For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between [ $7.625 billion and $7.7 billion ] and operational revenue growth between 12.5% and 13.5% for the full year [indiscernible] versus the 10.5% to 12% in our May guidance. 
Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion versus $1.82 billion and $1.87 billion in our prior guidance. The increased spend represents additional advertising and promotion investments, a significant portion of which will occur in the third quarter as well as compensation-related costs due to company performance. 
Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.135 billion and $2.175 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of 12% to 14%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.47 to $4.55 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of [ $4.09 ] to $4.19. 
Now to summarize before we move on to Q&A. Our strong performance in the first half of 2021 continues to underscore the value of our diversity, innovation and durable business model. We again raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance and expect to grow faster than the market. We continue to focus on long-term sustainable growth by investing in our pipeline, including infrastructure to support current and future product launches and remain very positive in our outlook for sustainable growth beyond this year. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

So that's playing out a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in the livestock figures for the U.S., but we expect to see further declines in terms of livestock for the remainder of the year and all that's factored into the guidance that we raised today as well."

So as you look in the quarter, we saw overall clinic revenues up 14%, and that was equally split between vet visits and spend per visit. And our confidence in the [Audio Gap] trends really have to do with a few things. One, there are more pets. We've talked about that for a number of quarters. The other thing is it's an increase in the standard of care, the expectations of pet owners, greater use across the portfolio, greater use of diagnostics, more people home, noticing more about their pets. 
But the other really important trend that's going to continue to play out is who is adopting a lot more of these pets. And that's a lot of millennials and Gen Z, and they tend to spend more on their pets. They're very engaged in their care. So we see these as durable trends that will continue and will remain a big growth driver for the company over the coming years."

We're in a very positive market dynamic with very strong performance across our portfolio. Last year, given the pandemic, there's a bit of variability across the year.

I'll start on more strategic drivers and I'll let Wetteny get into some of the specifics here. livestock really has performed as we expected. 
And as we talked about going into the year with the [indiscernible] DRAXXIN, we did expect a decline in general, as we talked about for the last few years. That's generally 20% to 40% over 2 to 3 years. And as we said, we thought that would be faster. As you look at the quarter, we did see a 19% decline overall in DRAXXIN specifically. And I think that is one of the key factors in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned earlier, I think it will continue. But if you look at broader livestock. 
Historically, it's a low to mid-single-digit grower. Certainly, as you saw in 2019 with [ ASF ] in China in 2020 with COVID it's been lower than what you've historically seen. We do believe, as we said, that overall, this will trend back to a market growth in the mid-single digits, call it, around the 4% range, maybe 3% to 5%. 
And then we think Zoetis will be in line with that. It could be slightly lower over the next few years, as you see this year. And really the strategic driver of that is that we have a number. We have the largest number of products hitting loss of exclusivity. As you look at our guidance, that's why it is baked in. So it wasn't just DRAXXIN. We also in poultries you were just referencing, had Zoamix and [ BMD ] as well. 
But again, we've got good growth in some of these other species as well. As you look at poultry really excited at the growth of vector vaccines, it's $300 million market, growing 13%. We've already launched 2 of them Newcastle and IBD, and that will be a growing portfolio for us. But I'll let when you get into some of the more specific numbers. But I do think if you look at livestock just more strategically on a higher level, I think it's going to be a lower for the companion animal, but we do think it goes back to historical levels.

One, there was a little bit of a delay in terms of the entry of generic for DRAXXIN also we ran a promotion in the first quarter that accelerated some revenue into Q1, taking it out of Q2.

As we mentioned, as long as we do not have competition, we will invest aggressively behind this brand. And even when we do, we will do it as well because we've seen very strong ROI in doing that."

I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and getting vaccinated for COVID-19. 
I'd like to start the call by welcoming our new Chief Financial Officer, Wetteny Joseph, who is joining me on the call today. As the former CFO of Catalent, Wetteny is a veteran of the biopharma industry and very familiar with many of you in the investment community. Wetteny joined us on June 1 and is off to a fast start, learning all about the company and animal health, everything from cattle runs and drought impacts to pet care trends and parasiticide season. I'm confident that Wetteny will make strong contributions to our ongoing market performance, value creation and leadership in animal health. 
I also want to take a moment to thank Glenn David for his partnership and all of his contributions to Zoetis as CFO over the last 5 years. Glenn has taken on a new role overseeing our international operations and other business units, including PHARMAQ, biodevices and Pumpkin Pet Insurance. I know he will bring his signature leadership qualities, business skills and industry knowledge to this role and continue driving profitable growth in these areas. 
Now turning to the second quarter. We achieved strong results once again, with 22% operational growth in revenue and 28% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our companion animal portfolio generated 36% operational revenue growth, driven by our pet care, parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and diagnostics. Meanwhile, livestock product sales were up 3% operationally and remain in line with our expectations for more moderate growth this year. The second quarter results also reflected favorable comparisons to last year's second quarter when the uncertainty of COVID-19 and related lockdowns were most severely felt across the animal health industry.  
We are raising full year guidance for revenue and adjusted net income again this quarter to reflect our first half performance and confidence in the underlying growth drivers of our business. We remain on track for a very strong year and continue to focus on sustaining our investments in long-term growth opportunities.  
With a strong cash flow and positive outlook, we are investing internally and externally in innovative new products, market expansion plans and direct-to-consumer promotions that will support future growth. Our team has been delivering strong growth based on internally developed companion animal parasiticides, led by Simparica, ProHeart and REVOLUTION PLUS franchises.  
We have redefined care for the dermatology category with our development of APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, and we see more growth potential coming from our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, new vector vaccines for poultry and the industry's first cloud-based diagnostic platform with AI capabilities. In terms of our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of OA pain in dogs and cats, we continue to anticipate U.S. approval for Librela and SOLENSIA in 2022.  
Meanwhile, initial customer response from vets and pet owners in Europe has been excellent, and we recently received approval of SOLENSIA in Canada. I always say with great pride that we have the best field force in the animal health industry, and we will continue to expand their scope, effectiveness and digital tools in ways that can enhance our customers' experience and support our growth objectives.  
We've also seen a positive return on our investment in direct-to-consumer promotions for Simparica, APOQUEL and disease awareness over the years and DTC remains an area of ongoing investment to support our parasiticides and dermatology portfolios. 
And finally, we continue to look externally for business development opportunities that can complement our portfolio and expand our market presence or capabilities. Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire Jurox, a privately held animal health company based in Australia. Expected to close in the first half of 2022, the acquisition will provide us with growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity and increased capabilities in Australia, our fifth largest market, and also bring us a range of companion animal and livestock products primed for global expansion.  
As I wrap up my remarks, our growth story for this year remains very consistent based on 3 recurring catalysts. First, our companion animal portfolio driven by our triple combinations Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our dermatology treatments, APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, new monoclonal antibodies for pain, and our VETSCAN diagnostic systems. The entire portfolio is benefiting from strong pet care trends in terms of increasing clinic visits, rising spend per visit and a focus on diagnostics and specialty care, especially among newer and younger generations of pet owners. 
Recent estimates for market growth in companion animal products are in the high single digits, and Zoetis continues to expect to grow faster than the market. We're gaining share in the approximately $5 billion global parasiticide market for pets and we're excited by veterinarian and pet owner responses to our new monoclonal antibodies for pain. 
We also continue to see progress in the early launch of VETSCAN IMAGYST, which leads to our second catalyst for growth, Diagnostics, which posted 38% operational revenue growth in the second quarter and access to vet clinics in the U.S. rebounded from the year ago quarter. 
Our third growth catalyst is International, where we continue to generate strong operational growth driven by China and Brazil, which grew at 30% and 40%, respectively. All our catalysts for growth are buoyed by our priority to champion a healthier and more sustainable future through commitments to our communities, animals and the planet. You can read more about our progress on these ESG goals and our first sustainability report, which was published in June.  
In closing, we had a great second quarter, and we're focused on delivering a record-setting year. The market dynamics in animal health remains strong, steady and resilient even during the challenging times based on people's unbreakable bond with animals. For the remainder of the year, our diverse portfolio, innovative pet care products, strength in diagnostics and expansion in international markets will continue driving our performance. 
Now let me hand things off to Wetteny."

And good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter performance, I would like to take a moment to express how excited I am to join Zoetis, a company with an exceptional opportunity for meaningful long-term growth driven by the durability and resiliency of the existing portfolio, a robust product pipeline and a keen focus on future innovation. I look forward to leading an outstanding finance organization and maintaining the financial principles and investment strategies, which positions Zoetis as the world leader in animal health.  
I would also like to express my appreciation to the Zoetis colleagues and the investment community for such a warm and gracious welcome. I had the pleasure of speaking with several of our investors since becoming CFO, and I look forward to connecting with many more in the coming weeks.  
Now shifting focus to earnings. This morning, I will provide commentary on our second quarter financial results, contributing factors to our performance and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. 
In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 26% on a reported basis and 22% operationally. Adjusted net income of $566 million was an increase of 33% on a reported basis and 28% operationally. Operational revenue grew 22% with 2% from price and 20% from volume. Volume growth includes 12% from other in-line products, 6% from new products and 2% from key dermatology products. 
We delivered another strong quarter and remain encouraged by the performance of our business, health of the overall industry and our outlook for the future. It is worth noting that Q2 2020 is a favorable comparative period due to the impact of COVID-19. The pandemic caused widespread uncertainty last year, which led to clinic closures, supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer demand from restaurant and food service to grocery stores. This materially impacted several aspects of our companion animal and livestock businesses. 
Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 36% operationally with livestock growing 3% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was again driven by our parasiticide portfolio, led by sales of Simparica Trio and with significant contributions from the broader portfolio.  
We also continue to see growth in our key dermatology products, APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT as well as in vaccines and diagnostics. Simparica Trio has continued to perform exceptionally well, posting revenue of $139 million, representing growth of more than 200% versus the comparable 2020 period. In addition to sales, we are exceeding our other performance measures as well, such as clinic penetration, share within penetrated clinics and reordering rates.  
The strength of our entire companion animal parasiticide portfolio was evident again this quarter, growing 50% operationally with meaningful growth in the ProHeart and Revolution/Stronghold franchises in addition to the Simparica franchise. Having the broadest and most innovative portfolio within a large and expanding therapeutic area leaves us bullish on future growth in parasiticides. 
Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $280 million in the quarter, growing 22% operationally. CYTOPOINT had a particularly strong quarter, growing 42% operationally and generating quarterly revenue of $100 million for the first time since launch. Year-to-date sales for key dermatology products are $524 million and our view remains unchanged that sales will exceed $1 billion this year. 
Our diagnostics portfolio had operational growth of 38% in Q2, led by increases in consumable and instrument revenue as the business continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic.  
With our sustained investments in diagnostics, the new technology we are bringing to the market and the ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio, we are well positioned to grow faster than the diagnostics market, which is expected to grow double digits and outpace the overall animal health market. 
Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Cattle grew 3% and swine grew 6% operationally despite price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs weighing on producer profitability in the U.S. Data suggests the food service and restaurant industries continued to recover in the second quarter, which is a crucial dynamic for demand of our premium products. 
Poultry was the only species to decline in the quarter, which fell 4% as producers in the U.S. expanded their use of lower-cost alternatives to our products. The decline in poultry partially offset the growth in cattle, swine and fish products.  
Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 22% with sales of companion animal products growing 34% and lifestyle product sales declining 8%. U.S. quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in company history. For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain robust. Vet clinic revenue increased double digits in the quarter and patient visits and spend per visit were up as well. While we expect some of the trends to moderate, our view is they will remain above pre-COVID-19 levels.  
A meaningful portion of pet acquisitions, which occurred during the pandemic were by millennials and Gen Z. This infuses a solid foundation of younger pet ownership who are willing to spend disproportionately more on all aspects of pet care than prior generations and will be a key growth driver for companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics moving forward.  
Our companion animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth in the U.S., growing 59% in the quarter. Key dermatology products, vaccines and diagnostics also contributed to growth. 
Simparica Trio had an incredibly strong quarter in the U.S. with sales of $120 million, generating the highest revenue by a single product in the U.S. for Q2. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $153 million, growing 96% and remain the #2 brand in the U.S. flea, tick and heartworm market.  
Key dermatology sales were $197 million for the quarter, growing 23% with significant growth for APOQUELand CYTOPOINT. Diagnostic sales increased 22% in the quarter with growth in instruments, rapid tests, point-of-care consumables and reference lab revenue. 
U.S. livestock sales fell 8% in the quarter driven by declines in cattle and poultry with swine essentially flat for the quarter. Q2 cattle sales were negatively impacted by a promotional program in the first quarter of this year, which pulled forward a portion of second quarter sales. In addition, price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs weighing on beef and dairy end markets presented challenges to our cattle business this quarter.  
Poultry declined in the quarter as producers expanded use of lower cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of higher feed costs and labor wages and smaller flock sizes reducing disease pressure. We also faced generic competition for Zoamix, our alternative to antibiotics in medicated feed additives.  
To summarize, our U.S. operations delivered another strong quarter led by our innovative and robust companion animal portfolio. The end market dynamics for companion animals remain extremely healthy with pet ownership and pet spending trends driving an environment conducive to sustainable future growth, which is expected to more than offset the near-term weaknesses to U.S. livestock business.  
Now turning to our International segment. Revenue in our International segment also grew 22% operationally in the quarter with companion animal revenue growing 41% and livestock revenue growing 10% operationally. The trends fueling strength in our international companion animal business are very similar to those in the U.S. The increasing medicalization rates and standard of care by pet owners coupled with significant investments in advertising and promotion to support new product launches and key brands drove growth across our parasiticides, vaccines, diagnostics and key dermatology portfolios. 
Diagnostics grew 106% operationally in the quarter with consumables and instrument revenue each exceeding 100% operational growth. Librela, our monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs launched in the EU in the second quarter. Feedback from the early experience trials in Q1 was encouraging and second quarter sales exceeded our expectations, further supporting our optimism on the long-term blockbuster potential of the product as well as monoclonal antibodies as a platform for future growth. 
Our feline monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain, SOLENSIA, began early experience programs in the second quarter with an EU launch following in Q3. As previously mentioned, OA pain in cats is a significant unmet need in animal health, and we're excited to provide pet owners with a novel product in a space that has previously lacked innovation. 
Meanwhile, our international livestock business had its second consecutive quarter with growth across all species, led by strong operational growth in cattle and swine. 
Cattle  growth in the quarter was driven by marketing campaigns, key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets.  
Revenue growth in swine is largely attributed to China, which grew 38% operationally. The themes of growth in swine remained consistent with previous quarters as large key accounts increased their use of our vaccines and other products as they continue to expand production as the market shifts from smaller farms to larger scale modern operations.  
Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% operationally. Growth was driven by strong performance of Alpha Flux in Chile, vaccine volume in Norway and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. 
From a market perspective lens, all major markets grew double digits in the second quarter with the exception of Japan, which declined slightly in Q2. China and Brazil had strong quarters, growing 30% and 40%, respectively, on an operational basis.  
Growth in companion animal across emerging markets remains a key driver of our international business. And in addition to the growth in China and Brazil, our other emerging markets' companion animal business grew 68% operationally. 
Overall, our International segment delivered strong results, demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography. The livestock business continues to perform well and increasing pet acquisitions and pet care spending are extremely encouraging trends for long-term growth in companion animal. 
Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margins of [ 70% ] is essentially flat on a reported basis compared to the prior year as favorable product mix and price were offset by higher manufacturing costs in freight. Adjusted operating expenses increased 23% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs, advertising and promotion expense and freight. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, a decrease of 230 basis points, driven by the favorable impact of jurisdictional mix of earnings, lower GILTI tax and an increase in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter.  
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were 28% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth. We remain in a very strong liquidity position and continued our share buyback program, repurchasing approximately $165 million worth of shares in the quarter. The strength of our balance sheet and substantial free cash flow generation allows us to make significant investments for future growth while still returning excess cash to shareholders. 
Before I review our updated guidance, I would like to reiterate a point that has been discussed on prior earnings calls, which is that we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of varying comparative periods where pent-up demand created by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020 work its way through the system in the second half of the year in addition to the expected increased generic competition for DRAXXIN. Adjusting for the variability in the comparative period due to the pandemic, our phasing of top line growth would be more normalized and consistent quarter-to-quarter throughout this year. 
Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising and narrowing as a result of our second quarter performance, strength of our product portfolio and favorable market dynamics, which we expect to continue [Audio Gap]. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July.  
For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $7.625 billion and $7.7 billion and operational revenue growth between 12.5% and 13.5% for the full year versus the 10.5% to 12% in our May guidance.  
Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion versus $1.82 billion and $1.87 billion in our prior guidance. The increased spend represents additional advertising and promotion investments, a significant portion of which will occur in the third quarter as well as compensation-related costs due to company performance.  
Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.135 billion and $2.175 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of 12% to 14%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.47 to $4.55 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.19.  
Now to summarize before we move on to Q&A. Our strong performance in the first half of 2021 continues to underscore the value of our diversity, innovation and durable business model. We again raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance and expect to grow faster than the market. We continue to focus on long-term sustainable growth by investing in our pipeline, including infrastructure to support current and future product launches and remain very positive in our outlook for sustainable growth beyond this year.

We have been very excited at the uptick in Librela and what we're seeing and your question about how is it really being used. We've seen really strong efficacy of the product. The feedback we've gotten, the early experience in our first quarter of sales is just really quick efficacy. So they're noticing differences pretty quick. It's improving quality of life, better sociability. So we really think more and more vets are looking at this as a first-line therapy. We do think that there's significant opportunities for Librela to grow the category. 
The dog categories we've talked about before, currently is $400 million, but we believe by bringing this type of innovation to the market supports them globally. But bringing this type of innovation from the safety and efficacy profile, we think we have the ability to potentially double that market if you look at how many dogs there are, how many have OA and how many are treated. So we look at the opportunity to grow this market in a few ways. Certainly, as I talked about getting more animals, getting more days on treatment and better compliance, and then certainly with prices. This product is priced at a premium to those that are already on the market. So Wetteny, do you want to take the second question on livestock?"

In the U.S. with the generic competition for DRAXXIN, we expected to see some headwind there, and it's really playing out in line with our expectations. 
One more point I'll make is, if you recall, in Q1, we did have some promotions, again, in line with our generic defense strategy, that really accelerated some of our revenues into Q1 from Q2. So that's playing out a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in the livestock figures for the U.S., but we expect to see further declines in terms of livestock for the remainder of the year and all that's factored into the guidance that we raised today as well."

And our confidence in the durable trends really have to do with a few things. One, there are more pets. We've talked about that for a number of quarters. The other thing is it's an increase in the standard of care; the expectations of pet owners; greater use -- across the portfolio, greater use of diagnostics; more people home, noticing more about their pets. But the other really important trend that's going to continue to play out is who is adopting a lot more of these pets.

Certainly, it's placements, as we've talked about, where we are seeing good growth there, stronger in the quarter in International than the U.S. but also really driving consumable use.

I think if you look at it from an overall perspective, certainly the first half and the second half of the year, if you look at purely top line, it's really roughly in line, pretty consistent sort of phasing across the year. The growth rates will moderate based on last year, largely not really a matter of how this year is executing for us. We're in a very positive market dynamic with very strong performance across our portfolio. Last year, given the pandemic, there's a bit of variability across the year. There was a disruption in the first half of the year given COVID-19, which created more demand that got pent up and caught up in the back half of the year.

I'll start on more strategic drivers and I'll let Wetteny get into some of the specifics here. Livestock really has performed as we expected. As we talked about going into the year with the LOE of DRAXXIN, we did expect a decline in general, as we talked about for the last few years. That's generally 20% to 40% over 2 to 3 years. And as we said, we thought that would be faster. As you look at the quarter, we did see a 19% decline overall in DRAXXIN specifically. And I think that is one of the key factors in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned earlier, I think it will continue. 
But if you look at broader livestock, historically, it's a low to mid-single-digit grower. Certainly, as you saw in 2019 with ASF in China in 2020 with COVID, it's been lower than what you've historically seen. We do believe, as we said, that overall, this will trend back to a market growth in the mid-single digits, call it, around the 4% range, maybe 3% to 5%. And then we think Zoetis will be in line with that. It could be slightly lower over the next few years, as you see this year. And really the strategic driver of that is that we have a number -- we have the largest number of products hitting loss of exclusivity. As you look at our guidance, that's why it is baked in. So it wasn't just DRAXXIN. We also, in poultries, you were just referencing, had Zoamix and BMD as well. 
But again, we've got good growth in some of these other species as well. As you look at poultry, ,we're really excited at the growth of vector vaccines. It's $300 million market, growing 13%. We've already launched 2 of them for Newcastle and IBD, and that will be a growing portfolio for us. But I'll let Wetteny get into some of the more specific numbers. But I do think if you look at livestock just more strategically on a higher level, I think it's going to be a lower growth for the companion animal, but we do think it goes back to historical levels.

Now the first quarter did benefit a bit from 2 things. One, there was a little bit of a delay in terms of the entry of generics for DRAXXIN, but also we ran a promotion in the first quarter that accelerated some revenue into Q1, taking it out of Q2. So if you take those into consideration, which are exactly in line with our defense strategy, livestock really is performing exactly as we expected given that the intensification of generic competition, as we expected, just begin really into the late first quarter into the second quarter, we expect those declines to continue.

So we have been having ongoing good conversations with regulatory authorities and we remain on track for the guidance we previously provided, which is approval for both those products, with SOLENSIA likely earlier in the year than Librela. But you should not probably expect that we'll be producing out of Lincoln, Nebraska at launch for Librela."

And we're really focused on those reorders, which we now have at 80% and continuing to grow those overall reorder rates. 
Direct-to-consumer advertising is critical in this category. It is $5 billion. It is a category that consumers really do go in and ask for brand. We do obviously track our ROI on this. And as you've seen and as Wetteny mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest behind this brand. We have seen incredibly strong ROI in doing so. And that is why you're seeing us step up that. 
As we talked about earlier, it has outpaced our expectations. I think that has everything to do with the innovative nature of the product, but it also has to do with the investment we put behind that in direct-to-consumer advertising and investing with our field force, and we will continue to do that. You should expect this year and next year, certainly, we have a window of opportunity with no competition in the U.S., and we will leverage that opportunity. We still don't know exactly when we'll see competition. At this point, we don't expect any until the second half of 2022 at the earliest as we mentioned, but as long as we do not have competition, we will invest aggressively behind this brand. And even when we do, we will do it as well because we've seen very strong ROI in doing that."

We delivered strong results again this quarter with 10% operational growth in both revenue and adjusted net income, driven by our innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides a",1043,"Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered strong results again this quarter with 10% operational growth in both revenue and adjusted net income, driven by our innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides and dermatology products. 
Our U.S. business grew revenue 7% operationally, while International grew revenue 14% operationally. In terms of species, our companion animal portfolio generated 19% operational revenue growth in the quarter with great performance in markets around the world. Our latest innovation in parasiticides, the triple combination in Simparica Trio is increasing its global adoption. Our groundbreaking dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, continue to redefine and expand the category. And we completed the first full quarter of sales for both of our new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia. 
These new products are exceeding expectations and receiving very positive feedback from veterinarians and pet owners in European markets where they've been launched. When you add all of this to our growth in diagnostics for companion animals, I see our business continuing to capitalize on the positive demographics for pets. Increased spending on pet wellness and treatment will be sustainable well beyond the pandemic and our portfolio and pipeline have us well positioned to continue leading and innovating in this market. 
Livestock product sales continue to present a more complex picture for the industry and Zoetis, with market dynamics vary widely by species and geographies. As we expected, our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally in the third quarter, largely due to generic competition across cattle, poultry and swine, and most significantly in the U.S. We have taken proactive strategies to protect these product lines including the introduction of a life cycle innovation like [ DRAXXIN KP, ] but pricing pressure remains due to the increasing effects of generic competition. 
On the positive side, we saw 7% operational growth for Livestock and International as markets like Brazil, Chile and other emerging markets performed well. Our long-term advantage in livestock continues to be our diverse portfolio and strength across geographies and product categories like medicines, vaccines and medicated feed additives. We also continue to invest in R&D programs that align with our customers' long-term needs for more efficient and sustainable production methods, which can be built on new therapies, analytics and digital solutions. 
We remain on track for a record-setting year with updated guidance for operational revenue growth in the range of 14% to 14.5% and adjusted net income growth in the range of 16.5% to 18% for 2021. Our major catalysts for growth have performed well this year and have more runway ahead for 2022 and beyond and we're going to make the right investments and continue successfully executing our growth strategies. Our strength in pet care has an incredibly strong foundation across parasiticides, dermatology and vaccines. Through the first 9 months of 2021, our companion animal portfolio has grown 29% operationally. 
We also remain very excited about the long-term blockbuster potential of our new monoclonal antibody franchises in pain, Librela and Solensia, as they grow in Europe, and we made progress on approvals in the U.S. We currently expect approval of Solensia in the U.S. in the first half of 2022 with Librela remaining more likely in the second half. Our revenue growth in international markets has been 20% operationally through the first 9 months, driven by China, Brazil and other emerging markets. We continue to expect growth to come across both our companion animal and Life portfolios in these markets. 
Finally, our diagnostics portfolio remains a key catalyst for growth with 28% operational growth through the first 9 months. We are gaining significant traction with our expansion of the point-of-care portfolio in markets outside the U.S. We always believe international expansion was one of the biggest value drivers for the Abaxis acquisition once we combine that portfolio with a global Zoetis footprint. 
The acceleration of international growth for diagnostics is a very positive sign and continues gaining momentum. We also recently added digital cytology testing to our VetScan Imagyst platform in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This means we can now offer a network of expert remote pathologists in addition to artificial intelligence technology for fecal testing. We are seeing our strongest early adoption of VetScan Imagyst in Germany, Australia, Spain and the U.K., and we will continue developing additional applications for the platform over time. 
In addition to our ongoing investments in R&D programs and direct-to-consumer campaigns, we are investing in manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demands for our new parasiticide products and monoclonal antibody therapies. Expansions are underway at our sites in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Lincoln, Nebraska and Telemor Ireland. All of these are significant multiyear projects to ensure we have ongoing reliable supply while maintaining a diverse global network of third-party contract manufacturers that give us the greatest flexibility and redundancy. 
Our supply chain team has done an excellent job over the last 2 years to optimize inventory levels of key products while minimizing the impact of a challenging global supply landscape. We continue to carefully monitor and manage our supply chain and inventories. 
And finally, before I hand things off to Wetteny, I wanted to note our recent news about changes in our R&D leadership team. Longtime R&D leader, Cathy Knupp, will be retiring at the end of the year and ensuring a smooth transition through February. I am very grateful to Cathy for building the most innovative and productive R&D organization in the animal health industry and for leaving us with a rich pipeline of future innovations and R&D talent, which includes her successor, Rob Holzer. 
Rob has been with Zoetis since 2015, working on many of the innovations that have come to market recently in parasiticides and monoclonal antibodies. He has experience running our global therapeutics and biologics R&D organization and is the right leader for the future of innovation at Zoetis. 
In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another great quarter and bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers every day. We are confident in the updated guidance we have provided and see the fundamental growth drivers of our business continuing into 2022 and beyond. Now let me hand things over to Wetteny."

The focus of my comments today will be on our third quarter financial results, the contributing factors that drove our performance and an update of our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the third quarte",2161,"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. The focus of my comments today will be on our third quarter financial results, the contributing factors that drove our performance and an update of our improved full year 2021 guidance. 
In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 11% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Adjusted net income of $597 million was an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Operational revenue grew 10% with 2% from price and 8% from volume. Volume growth is comprised of 5% from new products, including [indiscernible] Simparica Trio and 3% from our in-line portfolio, primarily our key dermatology franchise. 
Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter. Companion Animal Products again led the way in terms of [indiscernible] growth, growing 19% operationally with livestock declining 2% operationally in the quarter. Our parasiticide portfolio made the largest contribution to companion animal growth driven by sales of Simparica Trio and continued strength across our broader portfolio, including the ProHeart franchise, Simparica and REVOLUTION Stronghold Plus. We also saw a robust growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
Simparica Trio had another exceptional quarter, posting revenue of $122 million, representing operational growth of 140% versus the comparable 2020 period with year-to-date sales of $350 million. We believe the global fleet tick and [ hardware ] market will continue to expand and that our broad and innovative portfolio, which were 32% operationally in the quarter has us well positioned to capture share and outpace our competitors. Global sales of our key dermatology products were $321 million in the quarter, growing 26% operationally. Total sales exceeded $300 million for the first time in company's history and we remain ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in dermatology sales for the year. 
Our diagnostics portfolio had operational sales growth of 7% in Q3 against a very challenging comparative period as the third quarter of 2020 had a sharp increase in wellness visits following wide-scale clinic closures in the second quarter. Our International Diagnostics portfolio performed very well, which as Kristin mentioned, was a key component for the strategic rationale of the Abaxis acquisition. Abaxis remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we will continue to make significant investments in new technology, expand our reference lab footprint, as well as provide flexible solutions to our customers. Our equine products delivered strong results with operational sales growth of 20% in the quarter as horse shows and racing return to pre-pandemic levels and fueled growth in vaccines as well as nutritional and pain products. 
The expected decline in livestock in the quarter was primarily driven by our U.S. cattle and U.S. poultry businesses as our International segment delivered operational growth across all species. Globally, our cattle business declined 5% operationally in the quarter driven by the impact of generic competition for Jackson and a difficult comparative quarter resulting from COVID-19 dynamics and an earlier fall cattle run in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2020. 
Poultry also declined in the quarter as producers in the U.S. related to lower cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of current market dynamics. Sales were also negatively impacted by generic competition Zoamix and BMD are alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. The decline in cattle and poultry offset the growth in fish. 
Swine was essentially flat in the quarter as a decline in the U.S., primarily from pricing pressure on our anti-infective and vaccine portfolio as a result of generic competition offset the growth internationally from further key account expansion. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, benchmarked against a very difficult prior year comparative period on both the companion animal and livestock sides of our business. 
Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. quarter revenue exceeded $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter with revenue growth of 7%. Sales of companion animal products grew 17% and [indiscernible] product sales declined by 13%. For companion animal, pet care trends continue to be robust. Pet clinic revenue and patient visits grew again this quarter against growth rates from the third quarter of last year, which were well above historical levels. Our view remains unchanged that certain trends will moderate, but will remain above prepandemic levels. 
Growth in U.S. companion animal was led by our parasiticide portfolio and our key dermatology products. Simparica Trio continues to perform well, with U.S. sales of $110 million and year-to-date sales north of $300 million. This quarter is also an excellent representation of our commitment to invest in the broader parasiticides portfolio as we launched a targeted DTC campaign for ProHeart in prevalent heartworm geographies. Key dermatology sales were $217 million in the U.S. for the quarter, growing 20% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
U.S. Diagnostics sales grew 2% in the quarter, which, as I mentioned earlier, had a very difficult comparative period. However, year-to-date performance has been strong at 23% growth. U.S. livestock sales declined 13% in the quarter. Our U.S. cattle business faced a comparative period that saw robust growth as third quarter performance of 2020 benefited from the early fall cattle run and pent-up demand work its way through the system. In addition, generic competition has not entered the market in the third quarter of 2020. 
Our generic defense strategy has been successful, as we have been able to maintain a greater volume share of the [indiscernible] market than originally expected, although additional generics will likely enter the market in the coming quarters. From an end market perspective, producer profitability remains challenged by input costs, primarily feed and labor. 
U.S. poultry sales declined in the quarter as smaller [ fox ] resulted in lower disease pressure, allowing producers to expand usage of lower cost alternatives to a highly efficacious premium products. In addition, generic competition is creating pricing pressure on our Zoamix and BMD franchises. 
To summarize, our U.S. operations delivered another strong quarter, driven by our innovative and robust companion animal products, along with pet care end markets displaying very strong fundamentals. The near-term weakness in our U.S. livestock pipe business has been expected and has been more than offset by the strength in companion animal, which demonstrates the importance of diversification across species. 
Now turning to our International segment. Revenue of our International segment grew 14% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal revenue growing 24%, and last take revenue growing 7% operationally. In the second half of 2020, we saw a material uptick in medicalization rates and standard of care by pet owners, a trend which has continued through the third quarter of this year. We, in turn, made significant investments in advertising and promotions to capitalize on favorable market conditions and drive growth. Companion animal achieved broad-based growth internationally in the quarter, led by strong performance of our key dermatology products. Through 3 quarters of 2021, year-to-date sales are in excess of total sales from the entire prior year. 
In addition, we are in the early stages of a DTC campaign for key dermatology, which we expect will create additional demand for our products. Parasiticide had a strong quarter internationally, led by significant growth in the Simparica franchise, which benefited from DTC campaigns and drove growth in Brazil, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Librela, a monoclonal antibody for alleviation pain in dogs, has done extremely well, generating $15 million in quarterly sales in a select number of markets. Feedback from veterinarians and pet owners on the quality of life improvement for the patients has been extremely encouraging. 
Our feline [ onco ] antibody for alleviation of pain, Solensia, a positive feedback from the early experience programs in Q2 and launched in the EU this quarter. OA pain in cat is a significant unmet need in Animal Health, and our view is that Solensia will become a blockbuster product with the pain market for cash becoming approximately a $200 million global category over time. 
Our international diagnostics portfolio grew 20% operationally in the quarter with significant growth in consumable and instrument revenue and strong growth across a number of geographies such as the U.K., Australia, China and various other markets. 
Moving on to livestock. Our International business again delivered growth across all species, led by strong operational growth in cattle and fish. Cattle growth in the quarter was driven by further key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 21% operationally. Growth in our fish portfolio was primarily the result of increased sales of our Alpha Flux sea lice treatment product as well as strong growth in vaccines. 
Performance in swine and poultry were also fueled by growth in key accounts as well as overall market growth, primarily in emerging markets. At a market level view for our International segment, all major markets grew operationally in the third quarter with the exception of France, which was essentially flat in Q3. Emerging markets was again a key contributor to our international performance led by Brazil, which grew 22% on an operational basis. 
As we expected, growth in China slowed in the third quarter as lower pork prices challenged reducer profitability. However, the companion animal business in China, which grew double digits once again, offset the weakness in swine. Overall, total emerging markets has grown significantly in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
Our International segment again delivered strong results with robust growth in companion animal and growth across all species and livestock. On a year-to-date basis, our International segment has grown 20% operationally with our companion animal and largest businesses, each growing double digits. While falling pulp prices in China are creating a headwind that is moderating growth in swine, it is more than offset by the growth across other species and markets, further demonstrating the importance of our diversity across wishes and geography. 
Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.7% in increased 110 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as favorable product mix, foreign exchange, low inventory charges and price were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 19% operationally with SG&A expenses growing 20% operationally, resulting from increased compensation related costs as well as increased advertising and promotion expense, freight and T&E. R&D expenses were 17% operationally driven by higher project spend. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, a decrease of 330 basis points due to favorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including increased variability related to foreign-derived intangible income and an increase in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. Our liquidity position remains very healthy ending in the third quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents following a $600 million repayment of long-term debt in August. 
Our financial flexibility is in a very strong position, which allows us to make meaningful investments in our business while returning excess cash to shareholders as demonstrated by our repurchase of Zoetis shares of approximately $200 million in the quarter. 
Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising and narrowing as a result of our performance in the third quarter and confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable future growth. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-October. For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $7.7 billion and $7.75 billion and operational revenue growth between 14% and 14.5% for the full year versus the 12.5% to 13.5% in our August guidance. 
Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.91 billion and $1.94 billion, versus $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion in our prior guidance. The guidance range largely represents additional competition related costs as well as increased advertising and promotion spend to support growth of new products and key franchises. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.2 billion and $2.225 billion, representing operational growth of 16.5% to 18% compared to our prior guidance of 13% to 15%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.67 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.23 to $4.29. 
Now to summarize before we move to Q&A. In the 3 quarters, we've delivered strong operational top and billing with revenue growing 17% operationally and again raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance. We have achieved significant growth across our key franchises and are extremely excited about our new product launches and product pipeline. 
Now I'll hand things over to our operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

So we're very pleased with how the product is performing as well as our active KP in terms of maintaining largely the market share from a volume perspective here.

So I think we have a lot of the growth drivers this year that we think will continue into next year. I mean obviously, things we're going to watch for next year, there could be headwinds for us. It could be the timing of competition for a potential product against Apoquel or Simparica Trio. 
As Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, we're not really expecting that until the second half of 2022. Again, we don't have great visibility into that. Obviously, we think livestock, once we lap some of this DRAXXIN impact, that will lessen as a real headwind for us.

And our portfolio is really well positioned and continues to perform very well against those dynamics. As we discussed on the prior earnings call, what we're seeing in terms of growth rates in the second half of this year is more a reflection of how the phasing occurred last year versus this year, given our position in the market, again, the strong market dynamics that we continue to face. But to face here, if you look at last year, the second half had almost 17% more revenue in the back half than the first half of last year. And so that's really what's driving the comp here is the phasing of last year where this year is a little bit more normalized. 
As Kristin just referenced, we see a number of growth drivers for us, not only from the overall market, but also our portfolio across derm, as we look at pain diagnostics, as well with the one area -- the areas that we're watching, including DRAXXIN. To your point around inflation, as you know, given our portfolio and the innovative products that we have and demand we take of those products position us well to take price. And you saw the 2% price in the quarter, including 10% operational growth. And we'll continue to look at opportunities to continue to do that as we go into next year. 
You saw in the quarter our gross margin has actually expanded by 110 basis points versus last year Q3. And so -- and that's despite some headwinds in the areas of freight, et cetera. So we'll continue to monitor those and take price where we can, given the innovative products that we're going to the market with our customers."

There's just a lot of noise out there with other companies and swine chatter. So I guess the first question is, was that a clean number, no pull forward? And maybe just talk to this market overall? Do you still view it as a low single-digit grower for you this year with eventual improvement to mid-single digit and, call it, '22, '23. And then just a pivot question, remind me, I know we're not going to get a 22% guide, but maybe conceptually at a high level, how do we think of '22 in terms of a year where the Delta -- how do we think about the Delta between revenue and EPS growth? And I guess where I'm going with this is a lot of innovation for you where you're still dominating the market. So conceptually, do we just think about it as another year of spending, supporting the portfolio of DTC, where the delta between those 2 revenues, revs and EPS might be a little bit tighter than prior years.

I'll take the first part of the question, and I will let Wetteny take the second half, John. Livestock is complex [indiscernible] And so not just the difference between U.S. and international, but the difference between the species. So as you rightly mentioned, the U.S. was down significantly in livestock, and that's pretty much generic competition against DRAXXIN [indiscernible] and some other products that we mentioned before. But to your point, international was up 7%. And that was still a really rough time in China, as you saw in the quarter, with China livestock down about 10%, but more than made up for by China's companion animal. And really, it has to do with the mix between species that are growing quite quickly for us like fish, cattle and poultry may be struggling, but you look at strong growth in emerging markets, which is what's really booing livestock. And as we've said in previous quarters, how U.S. livestock does not mean how overall livestock goes. So I think we -- really -- the diversity of our portfolio across species, across geographies, continues to really be one of the strengths for us at least. And we do think, overall, you'll see a flat to low single-digit growth overall across the company for us in livestock. That may be a little bit slower than the market, as we said, because of DRAXXIN and some of the key LOEs that we have. And ultimately, once we lap some of those LOEs, we think you do go back in '23, '24 to a mid-single digit exactly where we've always been. 
So the historic growth of livestock is around 4%. And as we said, we think it absolutely returns there. And what's the reason to believe, well, if we're growing international in the quarter at 7% and really the U.S. is mostly getting hit by the generics, once we lap those, we do believe you can get back to a livestock growth in the sort of mid-single digits is the way it historically has been. But I'll let Wetteny take your second question."

No. But I don't think -- we saw very weak, as you saw in Q1, and there's a huge bounce back in the second half as we saw last year. We do think that vet revenue and vet clinic will continue to grow above historical rates.

Again, the pricing dynamics for pork, which we discussed on the last call, started back in mid-June. And so we expected to see sort of decline in the pork area. 
Now the other part of your question is, long term, what are we expecting in the market? We do see continued opportunity to grow substantially in China over time as we bring more and more of our price to the market. But also, if you look at what's happened since African Swine Fever, you see a concentration more in larger producers versus backyard farms, and we think that will bode well in terms of on [indiscernible] over time as well and for our premium products with respect to swine. And then on the companion animal side, we continue to see really robust growth in China. I think companion animal, we saw double-digit growth this quarter in companion animal, which obviously was partly offset by swine.

Yes, we are seeing animals return. I don't have the specific number of days that they're coming back. We can certainly look into that and see if we can get that data for you. It is priced at a p",442,"Sure. I can start there. We are really pleased with Librela. Yes, we are seeing animals return. I don't have the specific number of days that they're coming back. We can certainly look into that and see if we can get that data for you. It is priced at a premium to both RIMADYL as well as to Galliprant on the market. So given it has a phenomenal both safety and efficacy profile, it has been priced at a premium. The price obviously varies from market to market. So I don't think we have that overall information. With regard to the second part of your answer on Solensia, cat is a quite different market. So although today, the market in dogs is 400, and we believe we can double it, the market is actually pretty hard to size in cat. There's very few approved products out there today to treat cats. So it's hard to even say what it is. I mean it's not 0, but it may be tens of millions. It's certainly not hundreds of millions of dollars. 
And cats are like medicalized than dogs. So you really have to first medicalize those cats. You have to be able to -- cats like to hide their pain. So you also have to find a way that pet owners can notice pain in cats better and identify it and bring them to the vet. So the reason we said it's a smaller market is the number of cats that are medicalized are just smaller and then the number that are actually treated is really small. So the first thing is you need to be able to identify in cats with pet owners, convince them to take their cat to the vet and build the market from scratch. I mean, cat owners when they used to call the vet when their cat was suffering from pain from osteoarthritis were told there really wasn't anything. There's no product in the U.S., for example, whatsoever. 
So it's really about really retraining pet owners that there is a product that can meet their cat needs and helping vets really bring the cat into the vet. I mean a lot of pet owners don't like putting their cats in crates to bring them to the vet as you probably know. But we're very confident that we have a strong pipeline for cat that will increasingly medicalize cats over time and help build this market. But as we said, just given the number of medicalized cats, it will be a smaller market than the dog space, and it will likely take a little longer to build it."

Two other important points to recall here is that if you look at pet ownership, more and more we're seeing millennials and Gen Z bring pets to their homes, and they're doing a lot more research and looking at pet care and wellness and they're willing to spend more on their path. So the increase in pet ownership, we expect that to continue to provide really strong tailwinds in the industry for spending on test as we look forward and as those tests continue to age as well."

We delivered strong results again this quarter with 10% operational growth in both revenue and adjusted net income, driven by our innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides and dermatology products. 
Our U.S. business grew revenue 7% operationally, while International grew revenue 14% operationally. In terms of species, our companion animal portfolio generated 19% operational revenue growth in the quarter with great performance in markets around the world. Our latest innovation in parasiticides, the triple combination Simparica Trio is increasing its global adoption. Our groundbreaking dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, continue to redefine and expand the category. And we completed the first full quarter of sales for both of our new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia. 
These new products are exceeding expectations and receiving very positive feedback from veterinarians and pet owners in European markets where they've been launched. When you add all of this to our growth in diagnostics for companion animals, I see our business continuing to capitalize on the positive demographics for pets. Increased spending on pet wellness and treatment will be sustainable well beyond the pandemic and our portfolio and pipeline have us well-positioned to continue leading and innovating in this market. 
Livestock product sales continue to present a more complex picture for the industry and Zoetis, with market dynamics varying widely by species and geographies. As we expected, our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally in the third quarter, largely due to generic competition across cattle, poultry and swine, and most significantly in the U.S. We have taken proactive strategies to protect these product lines including the introduction of a life cycle innovation like Draxxin KP, but pricing pressure remains due to the increasing effects of generic competition. 
On the positive side, we saw 7% operational growth for Livestock and International as markets like Brazil, Chile and other emerging markets performed well. Our long-term advantage in livestock continues to be our diverse portfolio and strength across geographies and product categories like medicines, vaccines and medicated feed additives. We also continue to invest in R&D programs that align with our customers' long-term needs for more efficient and sustainable production methods, which can be built on new therapies, analytics and digital solutions. 
We remain on track for a record-setting year with updated guidance for operational revenue growth in the range of 14% to 14.5% and adjusted net income growth in the range of 16.5% to 18% for 2021. Our major catalysts for growth have performed well this year and have more runway ahead for 2022 and beyond and we're going to make the right investments and continue successfully executing our growth strategies. Our strength in pet care has an incredibly strong foundation across parasiticides, dermatology and vaccines. Through the first 9 months of 2021, our companion animal portfolio has grown 29% operationally. 
We also remain very excited about the long-term blockbuster potential of our new monoclonal antibody franchises in pain, Librela and Solensia, as they grow in Europe, and we made progress on approvals in the U.S. We currently expect approval of Solensia in the U.S. in the first half of 2022 with Librela remaining more likely in the second half. Our revenue growth in international markets has been 20% operationally through the first 9 months, driven by China, Brazil and other emerging markets. We continue to expect growth to come across both our companion animal and livestock portfolios in these markets. 
Finally, our diagnostics portfolio remains a key catalyst for growth with 28% operational growth through the first 9 months. We are gaining significant traction with our expansion of the point-of-care portfolio in markets outside the U.S. We always believe international expansion was one of the biggest value drivers for the Abaxis acquisition once we combine that portfolio with a global Zoetis footprint. 
The acceleration of international growth for diagnostics is a very positive sign and continues gaining momentum. We also recently added digital cytology testing to our VetScan Imagyst platform in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This means we can now offer a network of expert remote pathologists in addition to artificial intelligence technology for fecal testing. We are seeing our strongest early adoption of VetScan Imagyst in Germany, Australia, Spain and the U.K., and we will continue developing additional applications for the platform over time. 
In addition to our ongoing investments in R&D programs and direct-to-consumer campaigns, we are investing in manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demands for our new parasiticide products and monoclonal antibody therapies. Expansions are underway at our sites in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Lincoln, Nebraska and Tullamore, Ireland. All of these are significant multiyear projects to ensure we have ongoing reliable supply while maintaining a diverse global network of third-party contract manufacturers that give us the greatest flexibility and redundancy. 
Our supply chain team has done an excellent job over the last 2 years to optimize inventory levels of key products while minimizing the impact of a challenging global supply landscape. We continue to carefully monitor and manage our supply chain and inventories. 
And finally, before I hand things off to Wetteny, I wanted to note our recent news about changes in our R&D leadership team. Longtime R&D leader, Cathy Knupp, will be retiring at the end of the year and ensuring a smooth transition through February. I am very grateful to Cathy for building the most innovative and productive R&D organization in the animal health industry and for leaving us with a rich pipeline of future innovations and R&D talent, which includes her successor, Rob Holzer. 
Rob has been with Zoetis since 2015, working on many of the innovations that have come to market recently in parasiticides and monoclonal antibodies. He has experience running our global therapeutics and biologics R&D organization and is the right leader for the future of innovation at Zoetis. 
In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another great quarter and bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers every day. We are confident in the updated guidance we have provided and see the fundamental growth drivers of our business continuing into 2022 and beyond. Now let me hand things over to Wetteny."

The focus of my comments today will be on our third quarter financial results, the contributing factors that drove our performance and an update of our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the third quarte",2155,"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. The focus of my comments today will be on our third quarter financial results, the contributing factors that drove our performance and an update of our improved full year 2021 guidance. 
In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 11% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Adjusted net income of $597 million was an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Operational revenue grew 10% with 2% from price and 8% from volume. Volume growth is comprised of 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio and 3% from our in-line portfolio, primarily our key dermatology franchise. 
Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter. Companion Animal Products again led the way in terms of fish' growth, growing 19% operationally with livestock declining 2% operationally in the quarter. Our parasiticide portfolio made the largest contribution to companion animal growth driven by sales of Simparica Trio and continued strength across our broader portfolio, including the ProHeart franchise, Simparica and REVOLUTION Stronghold Plus. We also saw a robust growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
Simparica Trio had another exceptional quarter, posting revenue of $122 million, representing operational growth of 140% versus the comparable 2020 period with year-to-date sales of $350 million. We believe the global fleet tick in hardware market will continue to expand and that our broad and innovative portfolio, which were 32% operationally in the quarter has us well-positioned to capture share and outpace our competitors. Global sales of our key dermatology products were $321 million in the quarter, growing 26% operationally. Total sales exceeded $300 million for the first time in company's history and we remain ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in dermatology sales for the year. 
Our diagnostics portfolio had operational sales growth of 7% in Q3 against a very challenging comparative period as the third quarter of 2020 had a sharp increase in wellness visits following wide-scale clinic closures in the second quarter. Our International Diagnostics portfolio performed very well, which as Kristin mentioned, was a key component for the strategic rationale of the Abaxis acquisition. Abaxis remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we will continue to make significant investments in new technology, expand our reference lab footprint, as well as provide flexible solutions to our customers. Our equine products delivered strong results with operational sales growth of 20% in the quarter as horse shows and racing return to pre-pandemic levels and fueled growth in vaccines as well as nutritional and pain products. 
The expected decline in livestock in the quarter was primarily driven by our U.S. cattle and U.S. poultry businesses as our International segment delivered operational growth across all species. Globally, our cattle business declined 5% operationally in the quarter driven by the impact of generic competition for Jackson and a difficult comparative quarter resulting from COVID-19 dynamics and an earlier fall cattle run in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2020. 
Poultry also declined in the quarter as producers in the U.S. relocated to lower cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of current market dynamics. Sales were also negatively impacted by generic competition Zoamix and BMD, our alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. The decline in cattle and poultry offset the growth in fish. 
Swine was essentially flat in the quarter as a decline in the U.S., primarily from pricing pressure on our anti-infective and vaccine portfolio as a result of generic competition offset the growth internationally from further key account expansion. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, benchmarked against a very difficult prior year comparative period on both the companion animal and livestock sides of our business. 
Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. quarter revenue exceeded $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter with revenue growth of 7%. Sales of companion animal products grew 17% and livestock product sales declined by 13%. For companion animal, pet care trends continue to be robust. Pet clinic revenue and patient visits grew again this quarter against growth rates from the third quarter of last year, which were well above historical levels. Our view remains unchanged that certain trends will moderate, but will remain above prepandemic levels. 
Growth in U.S. companion animal was led by our parasiticide portfolio and our key dermatology products. Simparica Trio continues to perform well, with U.S. sales of $110 million and year-to-date sales north of $300 million. This quarter is also an excellent representation of our commitment to invest in the broader parasiticides portfolio as we launched a targeted DTC campaign for ProHeart in prevalent heartworm geographies. Key dermatology sales were $217 million in the U.S. for the quarter, growing 20% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. 
U.S. Diagnostics sales grew 2% in the quarter, which, as I mentioned earlier, had a very difficult comparative period. However, year-to-date performance has been strong at 23% growth. U.S. livestock sales declined 13% in the quarter. Our U.S. cattle business faced a comparative period that saw robust growth as third quarter performance of 2020 benefited from an early fall cattle run and pent-up demand worked its way through the system. In addition, generic competition has not entered the market in the third quarter of 2020. 
Our generic defense strategy has been successful, as we have been able to maintain a greater volume share of the [indiscernible] market than originally expected, although additional generics will likely enter the market in the coming quarters. From an end market perspective, producer profitability remains challenged by input costs, primarily feed and labor. 
U.S. poultry sales declined in the quarter as smaller flocks resulted in lower disease pressure, allowing producers to expand usage of lower cost alternatives to a highly efficacious premium products. In addition, generic competition is creating pricing pressure on our Zoamix and [ BNC ] franchises. 
To summarize, our U.S. operations delivered another strong quarter, driven by our innovative and robust companion animal products, along with pet care end markets displaying very strong fundamentals. The near-term weakness in our U.S. livestock business has been expected and has been more than offset by the strength in companion animal, which demonstrates the importance of diversification across species. 
Now turning to our International segment. Revenue of our International segment grew 14% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal revenue growing 24%, and livestock revenue growing 7% operationally. In the second half of 2020, we saw a material uptick in medicalization rates and standard-of-care by pet owners, a trend which has continued through the third quarter of this year. We, in turn, made significant investments in advertising and promotions to capitalize on favorable market conditions and drive growth. Companion animal achieved broad-based growth internationally in the quarter, led by strong performance of our key dermatology products. Through 3 quarters of 2021, year-to-date sales are in excess of total sales from the entire prior year. 
In addition, we are in the early stages of a DTC campaign for key dermatology, which we expect will create additional demand for our products. Parasiticide had a strong quarter internationally, led by significant growth in the Simparica franchise, which benefited from DTC campaigns and drove growth in Brazil, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Librela, a monoclone antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs, has done extremely well, generating $15 million in quarterly sales in a select number of markets. Feedback from veterinarians and pet owners on the quality of life improvement for the patients has been extremely encouraging. 
Our feline onco antibody for alleviation of OA pain, Solensia, a positive feedback from the early experience programs in Q2 and launched in the EU this quarter. OA pain in cats is a significant unmet need in Animal Health, and our view is that Solensia will become a blockbuster product with the pain market for cash becoming approximately a $200 million global category over time. 
Our international diagnostics portfolio grew 20% operationally in the quarter with significant growth in consumable and instrument revenue and strong growth across a number of geographies such as the U.K., Australia, China and various other markets. 
Moving on to livestock. Our International business again delivered growth across all species, led by strong operational growth in cattle and fish. Cattle growth in the quarter was driven by further key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 21% operationally. Growth in our fish portfolio was primarily the result of increased sales of our Alpha Flux sea lice treatment product as well as strong growth in vaccines. 
Performance in swine and poultry were also fueled by growth in key accounts as well as overall market growth, primarily in emerging markets. At a market level view for our International segment, all major markets grew operationally in the third quarter with the exception of France, which was essentially flat in Q3. Emerging markets was again a key contributor to our International performance led by Brazil, which grew 22% on an operational basis. 
As we expected, growth in China slowed in the third quarter as lower pork prices challenged reducer profitability. However, the companion animal business in China, which grew double digits once again, offset the weakness in swine. Overall, total emerging markets has grown significantly in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. 
Our International segment again delivered strong results with robust growth in companion animal and growth across all species and livestock. On a year-to-date basis, our International segment has grown 20% operationally with our companion animal and livestock businesses, each growing double digits. While falling pulp prices in China are creating a headwind that is moderating growth in swine, it is more than offset by the growth across other species and markets, further demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography. 
Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.7% increased 110 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as favorable product mix, foreign exchange, low inventory charges and price were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 19% operationally with SG&A expenses growing 20% operationally, resulting from increased compensation related costs as well as increased advertising and promotion expense, freight and T&E. R&D expenses were 17% operationally driven by higher project spend. 
The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, a decrease of 330 basis points due to favorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including increased favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income and an increase in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. Our liquidity position remains very healthy ending in the third quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents following a $600 million repayment of long-term debt in August. 
Our financial flexibility is in a very strong position, which allows us to make meaningful investments in our business while returning excess cash to shareholders as demonstrated by our repurchase of Zoetis shares of approximately $200 million in the quarter. 
Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising and narrowing as a result of our performance in the third quarter and confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable future growth. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-October. For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $7.7 billion and $7.75 billion and operational revenue growth between 14% and 14.5% for the full year versus the 12.5% to 13.5% in our August guidance. 
Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.91 billion and $1.94 billion, versus $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion in our prior guidance. The guidance range largely represents additional competition related costs as well as increased advertising and promotion spend to support growth of new products and key franchises. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.2 billion and $2.225 billion, representing operational growth of 16.5% to 18% compared to our prior guidance of 13% to 15%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.67 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.23 to $4.29. 
Now to summarize before we move to Q&A. In the 3 quarters, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom line growth with revenue growing 17% operationally and again raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance. We have achieved significant growth across our key franchises and are extremely excited about our new product launches and product pipeline.

As Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, we're not really expecting that until the second half of 2022. Again, we don't have great visibility into that.

And our portfolio is really well-positioned and continues to perform very well against those dynamics. As we discussed on the prior earnings call, what we're seeing in terms of growth rates in the second half of this year is more a reflection of how the phasing occurred last year versus this year, given our position in the market, again, the strong market dynamics that we continue to face. But to face here, if you look at last year, the second half had almost 17% more revenue in the back half than the first half of last year. And so that's really what's driving the comp here is the phasing of last year where this year is a little bit more normalized. 
As Kristin just referenced, we see a number of growth drivers for us, not only from the overall market, but also our portfolio across paras, derm, as we look at pain diagnostics, as well with the one area -- the areas that we're watching, including DRAXXIN. To your point around inflation, as you know, given our portfolio and the innovative products that we have and demand we take of those products position us well to take price. And you saw the 2% price in the quarter, including 10% operational growth. And we'll continue to look at opportunities to continue to do that as we go into next year. 
You saw in the quarter our gross margin has actually expanded by 110 basis points versus last year Q3. And so -- and that's despite some headwinds in the areas of freight, et cetera. So we'll continue to monitor those and take price where we can, given the innovative products that we're going to the market with our customers."

And then just a pivot question, remind me, I know we're not going to get a 22% guide, but maybe conceptually at a high level, how do we think of '22 in terms of a year where the Delta -- how do we think about the Delta between revenue and EPS growth? And I guess where I'm going with this is a lot of innovation for you where you're still dominating the market.

I'll take the first part of the question, and I will let Wetteny take the second half, John. Livestock is a complex [indiscernible] And so not just the difference between U.S. and international, but the difference between the species. So as you rightly mentioned, the U.S. was down significantly in livestock, and that's pretty much generic competition against DRAXXIN, Zoamix and some other products that we mentioned before. But to your point, international was up 7%. And that was still a really rough time in China, as you saw in the quarter, with China livestock down about 10%, but more than made up for by China's companion animal. And really, it has to do with the mix between species that are growing quite quickly for us like fish, cattle and poultry may be struggling, but you look at strong growth in emerging markets, which is what's really booing livestock. .
And as we've said in previous quarters, how U.S. livestock goes not mean how overall livestock goes. So I think we -- really -- the diversity of our portfolio across species, across geographies, continues to really be one of the strengths for us at least. And we do think, overall, you'll see a flat to low single-digit growth overall across the company for us in livestock. That may be a little bit slower than the market, as we said, because of DRAXXIN and some of the key LOEs that we have. And ultimately, once we lap some of those LOEs, we think if you go back in '23, '24 to a mid-single digit exactly where we've always been. 
So the historic growth of livestock is around 4%. And as we said, we think it absolutely returns there. And what's the reason to believe, well, if we're growing international in the quarter at 7% and really the U.S. is mostly getting hit by the generics, once we lap those, we do believe you can get back to a livestock growth in the sort of mid-single digits is the way it historically has been.

As expected, we saw growth decelerate in China this quarter with about 1% growth in the quarter. But keep in mind, China has actually grown 35% on a year-to-date basis. So we're",277,"Yes, I'll start and see what Kristin wants to add here with respect to China. As expected, we saw growth decelerate in China this quarter with about 1% growth in the quarter. But keep in mind, China has actually grown 35% on a year-to-date basis. So we're up against a very solid comparative last year where we saw 63% growth in the quarter, and swine was actually up 159% in the same quarter last year. Again, the pricing dynamics for pork, which we discussed on the last call, started back in mid-June. And so we expected to see sort of decline in the pork area. 
Now the other part of your question is, long term, what are we expecting in the market? We do see continued opportunity to grow substantially in China over time as we bring more and more of our products to the market. But also, if you look at what's happened since African Swine Fever, you see a concentration more in larger producers versus backyard farms, and we think that will bode well in terms of on [indiscernible] position over time as well and for our premium products with respect to swine. And then on the companion animal side, we continue to see really robust growth in China. I think companion animal, we saw double-digit growth this quarter in companion animal, which obviously was partly offset by swine. So long term, we continue to expect really solid growth in China, which is our second largest market, driven by the market dynamics that we discussed, although there may be cycles that we'll see in Swine as we're going through right now from a pricing standpoint."

Are owners returning monthly for the next injection or is the time between injections longer than that? What is the average patient cost of each injection?

We can certainly look into that and see if we can get that data for you. It is priced at a premium to both RIMADYL as well as to Galliprant on the market. So given it has a phenomenal both safety and efficacy profile, it has been priced at a premium. The price obviously varies from market to market. So I don't think we have that overall information. With regard to the second part of your answer on Solensia, cat is a quite different market. So although today, the market in dogs is $400 million, and we believe we can double it, the market is actually pretty hard to size in cat. There's very few approved products out there today to treat cats. So it's hard to even say what it is. I mean it's not 0, but it may be tens of millions. It's certainly not hundreds of millions of dollars. 
And cats are less medicalized than dogs. So you really have to first medicalize those cats. You have to be able to -- cats like to hide their pain. So you also have to find a way that pet owners can notice pain in cats better and identify it and bring them to the vet. So the reason we said it's a smaller market is the number of cats that are medicalized are just smaller and then the number that are actually treated is really small. So the first thing is you need to be able to identify in cats with pet owners, convince them to take their cat to the vet and build the market from scratch. I mean, cat owners when they used to call the vet when their cat was suffering from pain from osteoarthritis were told there really wasn't anything. There's no product in the U.S., for example, whatsoever. 
So it's really about really retraining pet owners that there is a product that can meet their cat needs and helping vets really bring the cat in to the vet. I mean a lot of pet owners don't like putting their cats in crates to bring them to the vet as you probably know. But we're very confident that we have a strong pipeline for cat that will increasingly medicalize cats over time and help build this market. But as we said, just given the number of medicalized cats, it will be a smaller market than the dog space, and it will likely take a little longer to build it."

We continue to expect that these statistics will continue to be above prepandemic levels, albeit they will moderate from their peaks. 
Two other important points to recall here is that if you look at pet ownership, more and more we're seeing millennials and Gen Z bring pets into their homes, and they're doing a lot more research and looking at pet care and wellness and they're willing to spend more on their pets. So the increase in pet ownership, we expect that to continue to provide really strong tailwinds in the industry for spending on pets as we look forward and as those pets continue to age as well."

I mean, we have the same theories that you do that there could be certain technical reasons for some competitors. And let me be clear, everyone is working in the space. This is -- parasiticide is the largest single market in animal health at $5 billion.

So I don't know that it's the same thing that's holding each of the companies back. I mean we were not really clear. It definitely could be regulatory. It could be technical. It could be manufacturing, CMC -- we're not exactly clear. 
And to your point, there's really very few public companies who actually disclose much about their pipeline. So our ability to know where people are is quite limited. We just -- and we always -- I know it's a little [indiscernible] we keep pushing it out sort of like 6 to 12 months or whenever you ask the question because if we haven't seen it and we haven't heard it in corporate accounts as they're negotiating with us, we think it's definitely another -- every quarter with another 3-plus months out. And that's really where some of our thought comes from.
And yes, we are confident that even if you'll see -- look, we are planning on competition in these key products. But I think the strength and diversity of our pipeline globally that makes us confident we can continue to grow above market. I mean we've got diagnostics. We've got pain meds. We still think they're going to be growing in derm, to be honest with you. It's still a lot of unmet medical need.
