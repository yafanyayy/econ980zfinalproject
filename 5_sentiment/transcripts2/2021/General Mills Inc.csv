We are looking forward to have our live Q&A session on our third quarter results. I hope everyone had a chance to review our press release, listen to our prepared remarks and view our presentation materials, which are made available this morning on our Investor Relations site. Also refer to the press release we issued yesterday announcing our proposed sale of our European Yoplait operations to Sodiaal. I'll just note that in regard to that transaction, we have a memorandum of understanding and that is still subject to appropriate labor consultations, regulatory filings and other customary closing conditions, and we expect to close that proposed transaction by the end of the calendar year. 
Furthermore, it's important to note that in our Q&A session today, we may make forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions, including facts and assumptions related to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results in fiscal '21. Please refer to this morning's press release for factors that could impact our forward-looking statements and for reconciliations of non-GAAP information, which may be discussed on today's call. 
I'm here virtually with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; Kofi Bruce, our CFO; Bethany Quam, Group President for our Pet segment; and John Nudi, President for North America Retail. We're holding this call from different locations so hopefully, technology cooperates and everything goes smoothly. And with that, we can get into the first question. Jennifer, you can get us started."

Thinking about it that way would imply fiscal 4Q organic sales growth that would look to be roughly in line with what you reported in fiscal 3Q, again, on a 2-year basis. And I realize some of this is likely a bit of a shift of inventory refill from -- that you expected in 3Q into 4Q, but it would seem to suggest you believe sales growth -- the sales growth deceleration as reopening occurs is likely to be maybe slower than many currently expect. So I'm just trying to get a sense if that's a fair characterization of your thinking at this juncture. And if it is, sort of what's informing that viewpoint?"

Thank you, Andrew. This is Jeff Harmening. You have that exactly right. I mean, as we look at the third quarter of this year, demand was high all over the world, including the U.S., fueled by clearly the pandemic as well as stimulus spending and in addition to that, some weather-related events. As we look at Q4, we really believe that our sales, both in terms of pounds and pricing, is going to be higher than it was pre pandemic. And we're seeing that in the first couple of weeks of the month. And we're confident the consumer behaviors aren't changing seeing as quickly as some would think. 
And what fuels that, Andrew, is really, as you look at the last year, if you look at 2020, our foodservice business, in general, in the U.S., the industry declined about 25%. And of that, about 25% was quick service restaurants, schools and health care and we've seen quick service restaurants bounce back and school are gradually getting online as is health care. So that will bounce back relatively quickly. Another 25% of that decline was related to casual dining, and that's going to take longer to come back. And then finally, about half of the decline we've seen over the last year away-from-home heating, is really driven by travel, leisure, business and industry, think canteens at places of work. And clearly, that's going to take a longer-term to cut back, if it ever does at all because we're not going to work the same way. We're going to be working at home a little more than we were before. People want flexible schedules. While consumers may be making vacation plans now more than they have, business people are not going to be traveling as much because technology has cut up and we realize we can do a lot of things remotely. So we have what fuels our belief in the fourth quarter, and we're confident there's not on inventory buildup, but the move will be better than what some expected based on what we've seen over the past year and kind of what we see in the first few weeks of this month, this quarter."

So as you think about the other factors, certainly, as you -- as we flagged, there are higher costs to operate in this higher demand environment.

Specifically, as we're operating in an environment where we need to open new lanes of freight to reach our external supply capacity. But also to reposition within the network, which is where we've seen some incremental costs as related to the weather in the quarter. And as we get to Q4, while we're not giving guidance on Q4 inflation, I think it's important to note for the full year, we are still expecting about 3% inflation. And the way I'd characterize it is our expectation at the beginning of the year were 3% and we were rounding up to about 3%, and we're in a position now where we will be rounding down to about 3% inflation. And I think the critical thing for us is we're taking the opportunity to act with all of our SRM and our HMM levers to set ourselves up to -- in anticipation of higher inflation as we step into F '22."

Foundationally, after those, you need to look at the higher operating costs in this environment related to us securing additional capacity from external supply chain. And with that, the logistics cost associated with operating in that environment puts us in a position where we are securing more lanes for freight to support that external capacity at higher spot market rates, which we would note that we're seeing about mid-single-digit inflation in freight in this environment. So as we're exposed to the spot markets on those external supply chain lanes, the cost of delivering to customers and distribution centers is higher. 
So those 2 factors, I would expect to be largely linked to the demand environment and as supply and demand come more into balance. As our inventory levels in the system come more into balance, I would expect those costs to abate. And obviously, we're lapping a tremendously strong Q4 where a fair amount of leverage was driven just in part because of the inventory in the system that both us and the retailers used to draw down to service the demand."

What we see happening is that demand will be higher in the near future than it was pre pandemic. Certainly, as people return to eating out and people return to schools, we'll see a reversion of some of that volume back to where it was before, just not all the way back. So I would envision an environment where demand is not as high as it is today in at-home meeting, but it's higher than it was pre pandemic. And I think some investors and some analysts feel as if volume is just going to snap back to the way it was before the pandemic. And what we've seen outside the U.S., what we're currently seeing in our current channel will lead us to believe that any return to normal will be more elongated, and that return to norm will eventually be different. 
So as we see that, the same would hold true of our bars category, and I'll give a little high level commentary, and then Jon Nudi may want to weigh in. In bars because it really is energy on-the-go, the fact that the category has been down recently, is because people have not been on-the-go as much. As people start to get out a little bit more, we've seen the category improve a little bit. In fact, I'm really pleased with our progress in terms of share. We're competing effectively all over the world in the bars category, that would be the U.S. as well as Europe as well as Australia. And so we're starting to see that category return a little bit, and we've been competing quite effectively in it. Jon, do you have anything you want to add to that?"

In fact, one of the things I'm proud of is that we're actually growing share total bars. As many of you remember, we've been struggling with this category in the last few years. And our turnarounds are really gone by Nature Valley base brands. We've got some really strong marketing out there, some great news around recyclable wrapper that just rolled out as well as the #1 launch in the category, which is packed this past year. So we feel good about how we're performing. And as Jeff mentioned, we get back to a more normal time the categories will bounce back to growth."

You're absolutely correct, right, as you get exposed into the food drug mass channel, there is more treats that are sold in that channel.

And so that is the opportunity for pet parents to clean -- to feed a bone alternative, biscuit that meets the true Blue promise. And so we are continuing to do well in the treats category, but we know we can do better. And so we have both innovation launching as well as we're doing some price pack architect work as well. And so we're able to merchandise. If you look at the Pet category, the treat segment is obviously more responsive to merchandising than your food segment. And so if you look in our remarks today, we have a picture of how the whole portfolio will show up now. And so when we merchandise, retailers are able to offer the new bone, our sticks, our sizzlers, and we really cover all different treat types. So we're continuing to press merchandise. We also are starting to do some different types of marketing behind tradable moments. And so we are pushing on all areas to continue to drive that business. It's a huge category. We've got growth. We'd like to have a higher share of it."

We've seen at-home trends have accelerated across those markets, even the markets that are more open. And they may be a couple of points less growth at-home than those that have been relatively more closed, but we're seeing pretty consistent performance across markets over the past year, whether it's at-home or away-from-home consumption. 
The -- there's been a lot of talk on reopening the last month, but the data gets really challenging because -- especially because of the weather situation. So for example, Texas has opened up. It's away-from-home eating, but they had a huge winter snowstorm over the last month, which elevated demand quite a bit. And so trying to pick part and pieces. And the variables over the recent short term, but it's really difficult to do. And I don't say that to try to hide anything. But if you look at it, you would see that at-home consumption in Texas would be up, which would be counterintuitive, but that's because of this huge storm. And so I think we'll know a lot more at the end of this quarter once we've seen more. So right now, what I can tell you is over the long term, over the last year, we have seen elevated demand across markets. Over the shorter term, there are so many variables to play.

We are looking forward to have our live Q&A session on our third quarter results. I hope everyone had a chance to review our press release, listen to our prepared remarks and view our presentation materials, which are made available this morning on our Investor Relations site. Also refer to the press release we issued yesterday announcing our proposed sale of our European Yoplait operations to Sodiaal. I'll just note that in regard to that transaction, we have a memorandum of understanding and that is still subject to appropriate labor consultations, regulatory filings and other customary closing conditions, and we expect to close that proposed transaction by the end of the calendar year. 
Furthermore, it's important to note that in our Q&A session today, we may make forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions, including facts and assumptions related to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results in fiscal '21. Please refer to this morning's press release for factors that could impact our forward-looking statements and for reconciliations of non-GAAP information, which may be discussed on today's call. 
I'm here virtually with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; Kofi Bruce, our CFO; Bethany Quam, Group President for our Pet segment; and John Nudi, President for North America Retail. We're holding this call from different locations, so hopefully, technology cooperates and everything goes smoothly. And with that, we can get into the first question. Jennifer, you can get us started."

Thinking about it that way would imply fiscal 4Q organic sales growth that would look to be roughly in line with what you reported in fiscal 3Q, again, on a 2-year basis. And then I realize some of this is likely a bit of a shift of inventory refill from -- that you expected in 3Q into 4Q, but it would seem to suggest that you believe sales growth -- the sales growth deceleration as reopening occurs is likely to be maybe slower than many currently expect. So I'm just trying to get a sense if that's a fair characterization of your thinking at this juncture. And if it is, sort of what's informing that viewpoint?"

This is Jeff Harmening. You do have that -- you have that exactly right. I mean as we look at the third quarter of this year, demand was high all over the world, including the U.S., fueled by clearly the pandemic as well as stimulus spending and, in addition to that, some weather-related events. As we look at Q4, we really believe that our sales, both in terms of pounds and pricing, is going to be higher than it was pre pandemic. And we're seeing that in the first couple of weeks of the month. And we're confident the consumer behaviors aren't changing as quickly as some would think. 
And what fuels that, Andrew, is really, as you look at the last year, if you look at 2020, our foodservice business, in general, in the U.S., the industry declined about 25%. And of that, about 25% was quick service restaurants, schools and health care. And we've seen quick service restaurants bounce back, and school are gradually getting online as is health care. So that will bounce back relatively quickly. Another 25% of that decline was related to casual dining, and that's going to take longer to come back. 
And then finally, about half of the decline we've seen over the last year in away-from-home heating is really driven by travel, leisure, business and industry, think canteens at places of work. And clearly, that's going to take a longer-term to cut back, if it ever does at all, because we're not going to work the same way. We're going to be working at home a little more than we were before. People want flexible schedules. While consumers may be making vacation plans now more than they have, business people are not going to be traveling as much because technology has cut up, and we realize we can do a lot of things remotely. So we have what fuels our belief in the fourth quarter, and we're confident there's not only inventory buildup, but moving will be better than what some expected based on what we've seen over the past year and kind of what we see in the first few weeks of this month, this quarter."

Chris, I'll be happy to address your question. Thanks for asking. So as you think about the other factors, certainly, as you -- as we flagged, there are higher costs to operate in this higher demand environment. And I will tell you that part of the cost in our logistics network costs have gone up in relation to responding to the high demand environment. Specifically, as we're operating in an environment where we need to open new lanes of freight to reach our external supply capacity but also to reposition within the network, which is where we've seen some incremental costs as related to the weather in the quarter. And as we get to Q4, while we're not giving guidance on Q4 inflation, I think it's important to note for the full year, we are still expecting about 3% inflation. And the way I'd characterize it is our expectation at the beginning of the year were 3%, and we were rounding up to about 3%, and we're in a position now where we will be rounding down to about 3% inflation. And I think the critical thing for us is we're taking the opportunity to act with all of our SRM and our HMM levers to set ourselves up to -- in anticipation of higher inflation as we step into F '22."

We'll also, just we will use all of the tools, and that includes list pricing. But it's list pricing. It is price pack architecture. It's how we manage trade and then finally, price and mix.

Foundationally, after those, you need to look at the higher operating costs in this environment related to us securing additional capacity from external supply chain. And with that, the logistics cost associated with operating in that environment puts us in a position where we are securing more lanes for freight to support that external capacity at higher spot market rates, which we would note that we're seeing about mid-single-digit inflation in freight in this environment. So as we're exposed to the spot markets on those external supply chain lanes, the cost of delivering to customers and distribution centers is higher. 
So those 2 factors, I would expect to be largely linked to the demand environment and as supply and demand come more into balance. As our inventory levels in the system come more into balance, I would expect those costs to abate. And obviously, we're lapping a tremendously strong Q4 where a fair amount of leverage was driven just in part because of the inventory in the system that both us and the retailers used to draw down to service the demand."

What we see happening is that demand will be higher in the near future than it was pre pandemic. Certainly, as people return to eating out and people return to schools, we'll see a reversion of some of that volume back to where it was before, just not all the way back. So I would envision an environment where demand is not as high as it is today in at-home meeting, but it's higher than it was pre pandemic. And I think some investors and some analysts feel as if volume is just going to snap back to the way it was before the pandemic. And what we've seen outside the U.S., what we're currently seeing in our current channel will lead us to believe that any return to normal will be more elongated, and that return to normal will eventually be different. 
So as we see that, the same would hold true of our bars category, and I'll give a little high level commentary, and then Jon Nudi may want to weigh in. In bars because it really is energy on-the-go, the fact that the category has been down recently,is because people have not been on-the-go as much. As people start to get out a little bit more, we've seen the category improve a little bit. In fact, I'm really pleased with our progress in terms of share. We're competing effectively all over the world in the bars category, that would be the U.S. as well as Europe as well in Australia. And so we're starting to see that category return a little bit, and we've been competing quite effectively in it. Jon, do you have any other -- anything you want to add to that?"

In fact, one of the things I'm proud of is that we're actually growing share in total bars. As many of you remember, we've been struggling with this category for the last few years. And our turnaround is really known by Nature Valley base brands. We've got some really strong marketing out there, some great news around recyclable wrapper that just rolled out as well as the #1 launch in the category, which is packed this past year. So we feel good about how we're performing. And as Jeff mentioned, when we get back to a more normal time, the categories will bounce back to growth."

You're absolutely correct, right, as you get exposed into the food drug mass channel, there is more treats that are sold in that channel.

And so that is the opportunity for pet parents to clean -- to feed a bone alternative, crunchy biscuits that meets the true Blue promise. And so we are continuing to do well in the treats category, but we know we can do better. And so we have both innovation launching as well as we're doing some price pack architect work as well. And so we're able to merchandise. 
If you look at the Pet category, the treat segment is obviously more responsive to merchandising than your food segment. And so if you look in our remarks today, we have a picture of how the whole portfolio will show up now. And so when we merchandise, retailers are able to offer the new bone, our sticks, our sizzlers, and we really cover all different treat types. So we're continuing to press merchandise. We also are starting to do some different types of marketing behind tradable moments. And so we are pushing on all areas to continue to drive that business. It's a huge category. We've got growth. We'd like to have a higher share of it."

Let me provide a little background on the last year, and I'll tell you a little bit of what we're seeing in the last month or so. But as we look at the past year, we've really seen the at-home trends across our markets. And some have been relatively more open than others, as you know. We've seen at-home trends have accelerated across those markets, even the markets that are more open. And they may be a couple of points less growth at-home than those that have been relatively more closed, but we're seeing pretty consistent performance across markets over the past year, whether it's at-home or away-from-home consumption. 
The -- there's been a lot of talk on reopening the last month, but the data gets really challenging because -- especially because of the weather situation. So for example, Texas has opened up. It's away-from-home eating, but they had a huge winter snowstorm over the last month, which elevated demand quite a bit. And so trying to pick apart the pieces. And the variables over the recent short term is really difficult to do. And I don't say that to try to hide anything. But if you look at it, you would see that at-home consumption in Texas would be up, which would be counterintuitive, but that's because of this huge storm. 
And so I think we'll know a lot more at the end of this quarter once we've seen more. So right now, what I can tell you is over the long term, over the last year, we have seen elevated demand across markets. Over the shorter term, there are so many variables to play.

Today, I will walk through highlights of our third quarter and the progress we've made toward our fiscal 2021 priorities. Next, with the third anniversary of our transformational Blue Buffalo acquisition only a month away, I've asked Bethany Quam to recap our tremendous performance over the past 3 years and share our plan for continued growth in our Pet segment. Finally, Kofi will offer more details on the quarter and provide our full year guidance outlook.
I'm proud to say that General Mills has continued to rise to the challenge of serving our consumers and customers and delivering on our purpose of making food the world loves and needs. We executed well yet again in the third quarter and delivered solid growth on the top and bottom lines. We made continued progress this quarter toward achieving our fiscal 2021 priorities which I'll walk through in more detail in a moment. We remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth with our Accelerate strategy, and we fully expect to emerge from the pandemic a stronger company. And I'm pleased to share that with our strengthened balance sheet and increased financial flexibility, we have returned to using our full set of capital allocation tools to drive growth for our business and value for our shareholders.
We resumed dividend growth in the second quarter. We were resuming our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. And with yesterday's announcement on the proposed divestiture of our European Yoplait operations, we are executing against our portfolio-shaping priorities to improve our growth profile.
Before I get into our third quarter results, let me share a bit more on yesterday's announcement. We have entered into a memorandum of understanding to sell our interest in our European Yoplait operations to Sodiaal, a leading French dairy cooperative and our current joint venture partner in the business in exchange for full ownership of Yoplait Canada and a reduced royalty on our North America yogurt licenses. The transaction is fully aligned with our Accelerate strategy. It improves our growth profile, enhances our margins and creates value for our shareholders. And importantly, it allows our Europe and Australia segment to increase its focus on the businesses where we see the greatest potential for growth, our advantaged global platforms, including Mexican food, super premium ice cream and snack bars. Kofi will share more details on the transaction at the end of our prepared remarks this morning.
With this sale, we will deliver on our commitment to divest approximately 5% of our net sales, and we remain committed to further portfolio reshaping through acquisitions and/or divestitures to enhance our growth profile.
With that, let me shift back to our third quarter results. Slide 6 offers a quick snapshot of our performance. Third quarter organic net sales were up 7%, driven by continued strong demand for food at-home and our ongoing ability to compete effectively everywhere we play. Adjusted operating profit was up 5% in the quarter, reflecting higher net sales, partially offset by higher input costs. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6%. We continue to focus on 3 priorities for fiscal 2021, competing effectively everywhere we play, operating efficiently to fuel investment in our brands and capabilities and continuing to enhance our financial flexibility by reducing our debt leverage. We've made good progress against each of those priorities in the third quarter and remain on track to achieve them for the full year. Let me share a bit more detail on how we're executing against each of these priorities.
As part of the Accelerate strategy we announced last month, we've prioritized driving profitable growth in 8 core markets that make up the vast majority of our sales and profit. In addition, we outlined 5 global platforms where our differentiated advantages will drive differential growth for our portfolio. We continue to win across these markets and platforms in fiscal '21, enabled by strong execution on our leading brands. Through the first 3 quarters, we've held or grown share in 6 of our 8 core markets, and we've increased our share in each of our global platforms, including gaining more than a full point of share in Mexican food, more than 0.5 point in cereal, 40 basis points in pet food and 30 basis point increases in snack bars and in ice cream. We're competing effectively, and we're winning.
Our second key priority this year is operating efficiently to fuel investments in our brands and capabilities and hereto, we've made good progress. We're on track to deliver another year of strong HMM savings at 4% of cost of goods, which is enabling us to invest for growth. Media investment to support our brands was up again in the third quarter and is up 12% on a year-to-date basis, including strong support behind compelling campaigns on Cheerios, Blue, Old El Paso and Häagen-Dazs that are help driving growth and market share gains. On the capability side, we're continuing to invest to unleash our scale and drive differentiated growth and efficiency across our enterprise. In the third quarter, we continued our investments behind our digital, data and analytics, strategic revenue management and e-commerce capabilities. We're already realizing the benefits of these investments, including triple-digit growth in our U.S. e-commerce business over the past 9 months. We'll see continued tangible benefits from our capability investments in fiscal '22, and we expect these capabilities will create further competitive advantages for General Mills over the long term.
In addition to supporting accelerated investments in brands and capabilities, our strong performance has enabled us to meet another key priority for fiscal 2021, reducing our debt leverage. We ended the third quarter with a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.8x, which is nearly half a turn below our fiscal 2020 results. With our strengthened balance sheet position, we have resumed our share repurchase program as of the fourth quarter, and we have the capacity to execute bolt-on acquisitions that will further reshape our portfolio and help us achieve our long-term organic sales growth target. In other words, we are back to having a full set of capital allocation tools at our disposal to drive shareholder value, including investment in our business, dividend growth, M&A and share buybacks.
We are proud of our team and the progress we've made in this challenging year. We are serving our consumers, strengthening our brands, investing in our capabilities and returning capital to shareholders. We're delivering on our fiscal '21 priorities, and we're on track to drive strong sales and profit growth for the full year despite tough comparisons in the fourth quarter. I fully expect General Mills will emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company, better able to capitalize on the growth opportunities that lie ahead.
One of the most compelling growth opportunities in our portfolio resides within our Pet segment. As I mentioned, next month marks the third anniversary of our transformational acquisition of Blue Buffalo. As we think about continuing to reshape our portfolio for enhanced growth, we look to our performance with Blue as evidence of our ability to successfully acquire, nurture and grow brands and businesses where we can leverage the power of General Mills team and capabilities.
To speak more about this, I'll now hand it over to Bethany Quam, President of our Pet segment. Bethany?"

It's a pleasure to be with you today to share the exciting progress Blue Buffalo has made. We are loving and feeding more pets like family, and we're excited about the future.When General Mills acquired Blue Buffalo",1619,"Thank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to share the exciting progress Blue Buffalo has made. We are loving and feeding more pets like family, and we're excited about the future.
When General Mills acquired Blue Buffalo, we highlighted 5 compelling, strategic and financial benefits. The business operated in an attractive growth category. Blue was a leading brand with a loyal consumer base that we believe was still in its early stages of growth. It has proven to be successful in both existing and emerging channels. It was a scale platform with strong growth and operational efficiency, and it would contribute meaningfully to General Mills' growth and margin profile. The initial benefits we outlined 3 years ago have all proven to be true, and we've identified more opportunities for growth. As part of General Mills, Blue Buffalo net sales have grown at a 10% compound rate to more than $1.7 billion. And thanks to our operating efficiency, operating profit has grown even faster than sales, an 11% compound rate to more than $400 million, further strengthening an operating margin that was already accretive to General Mills' average.
Our ability to achieve this level of growth comes from our commitment to loving and feeding more pets like family. In Blue's early days with General Mills, we invested significantly to continue to build the brand and accelerate Blue's expansion in the food, drug and mass channel, or FDM, where about 40% of pet food is sold. As a result, since the acquisition: we've increased our distribution in FDM from 22% to 86%; we've nearly doubled our household penetration; and we've increased our all channel market share to about 7.7% in this fast-growing category. As we've grown, we stay true to the values that form the foundation of the Blue brand. Blue Buffalo was created by the Biscuit family, pet parents who beloved Ardell Blue who suffered 3 bouts with cancer. Their promise to feed Blue the best food possible sparked a natural pet food revolution. The Biscuits continue to partner with us as founders and brand advisers and our commitment to using only high-quality natural ingredients and telling the authentic brand story remains the bedrock of this brand today.
While pets aren't impacted by the at-home versus away-from-home eating trends that have driven growth across General Mills' human food businesses, the pandemic did impact pet parents, how they feed their pets, shop and get their information, and there are more pets. The rate of U.S. population growth accelerated this past year, roughly doubling from pre-pandemic levels and placing millions of new pets in the household. And pets became more a part of the family than ever, with 59% of pet parents reporting deeper bond with their pets.
This shift to high-quality natural food also accelerated during the pandemic. Average pet food spend per household was up 6% as pet parents traded up and switched to more premium foods like Blue. We also saw a shopping pattern shift, Blue's strong presence across channels allowed us to be available wherever pet parents wanted to shop. Together, these trends drove strong profitable growth for Blue, with organic net sales up 13% so far in fiscal '21 and broad-based market share growth across key segments and retail channels. Looking forward, Blue is well-positioned for continued growth. Pet food is a great category, Blue leads in the most attractive segments, and we have a clear plan for growth.
Since we acquired Blue Buffalo, the U.S. pet food category has grown about 4% a year, and recent trends point to continued mid single-digit growth for the category going forward. Natural pet food, which represents about 30% of total pet food sales today, has led the category with 9% growth in calendar 2020. Because we know pet parents want natural high-quality ingredients for their pets, we expect the natural segment to continue to drive category growth in the years ahead. And Blue Buffalo is well-positioned to lead this growth as the leading natural brand and the brand most likely to be recommended by pet parents. It is truly a proud distinction to be recognized by pet parents as the most loved and trusted natural brand on the market.
Our long-term strategy to drive continued growth in pet is aligned to General Mills' broader Accelerate framework. We will continue to lead with our purpose, love them like family, feed them like family. And in terms of where to play, we remain focused on leading and expanding our presence in high-quality natural feeding and treating for dogs and cats. The rest of my remarks will focus on how we're delivering for our pet parents and our shareholders by boldly building Blue, relentlessly innovating, leveraging the advantages of General Mills' scale and being a force for good.
I'll start with how we're boldly building Blue. Since the brand was launched, Blue Buffalo has invested $1.4 billion to drive brand awareness, connect with pet parents and store through our pet receptive program and reach them online. Our consistent investment has enabled us to capture an outside share voice in the market. And we continue to build Blue, we will make considered choices about the channels and messages that will help us most effectively reach pet parents. Over the past 3 years, Blue has become a successful omni-channel business by leveraging the power of the brand and partnering with our customers to drive growth. For example, we recently ran our third annual up with the old and in with the Blue campaign to encourage that parents to make pet health heart of their New Year's resolution and trade up to Blue. Our integrated campaigns combined digital rewards with in-store promotions and natural media and was delivered consistently across the channel. Our omni-channel approach is working, demonstrated by our results in the third quarter. Blue grew in all channels, including in pet specialty, where retail sales grew for the first time to Blue's initial expansion into FDM more than 3 years ago.
Beyond brand building, innovation is the second part of how we'll win strategy. It all starts with a nutritional philosophy. We believe all dogs and cats, regardless of life stage, breed size or specialized condition deserve high-quality natural feeding and treating. All of our products adhere to our true Blue promise. Real meat is the first ingredient with no poultry byproduct meal, no corn, wheat or soy and no artificial flavors or preservatives. We see significant opportunity to innovate and bring the true Blue promise to parts of the category where natural and Blue are underrepresented today. We are currently focused on naturalizing 3 segments: condition-based diets, wet cat food and treats.
True solutions is our product line that will naturalize condition-based diets. Fruitful Belly, for example, provides digestive care for dogs and cats with sensitive stomachs. True solutions give pet parents a way to offer natural solutions to support their dog or cat specific health needs. Wet cat food is an attractive growing segment with roughly $5 billion in retail sales. Pet parents want natural foods for their cats, but won't compromise on food their cats enjoy. We recently launched Paceful, a high-quality, all-natural portfolio of wet cat food that even our most picky cats love. We leveraged our research and development expertise to develop a project that is both tasty and natural so pet parents don't have to choose. It's available across channels, and we just kicked off an integrated one case that all it takes campaign to support the launch.
Trace is another area where Blue under-indexes today, pet parents are treating their pets more than ever, and Blue aims to be there for every treatable moment. We just added a new item to our treat line with bone, perfect for everyday treating. This innovation offers an all-natural option to mainstream crunchy bone treats and helps round out our offerings in the more than $7 billion treat segment of the category.
The third pillar of our How to Win strategy is leveraging the combined scale of General Mills and Blue Buffalo. It all starts with capabilities like digital, data and analytics to drive growth and efficiency and product development expertise to relentlessly innovate. In fact, we recently completed construction of a new pet pilot plant that is co-located with the General Mills global R&D facility, encouraging the free full of ideas and best practices as we work on innovation across our platform. But the real magic is in the combined power of our people, our bucks, as we call them. We're working to humanize pet food so the combined power of pets and human food experts coming together is exciting. In these ways and so many more, Blue benefits from the opportunities of the big while keeping the spirit of a small, all while staying true to our brand's purpose.
Finally, we will continue to be a force for good, leaning into Blue's founding mission to support pet health and cure pet cancer. We have already helped to raise over $30 million for pet cancer research, and we remain dedicated to this important cause. And as part of the broader General Mills enterprise, Blue is committed to advancing our efforts in climate, sustainability and all other ESG matters. After 3 successful years of profitable growth, we remain bullish about Blue's future. Our purpose has never been more relevant for pet parents, and we are well positioned to continue to lead in the most attractive segment of this growing category. We are excited about what's ahead for Blue.
I will now turn it over to Kofi Bruce, our CFO, to share more on General Mills' third quarter financial results and business outlook. Kofi?"
274715,709029722,2241942,"General Mills, Inc., Q3 2021 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bethany, and hello, everyone.I'll start with our third quarter financial results on Slide 29. Net sales of $4.5 million were up 8%. Organic net sales grew 7% in the quarter as we continued to compete effectively amid the elevated consumer demand",2025,"Thanks, Bethany, and hello, everyone.
I'll start with our third quarter financial results on Slide 29. Net sales of $4.5 million were up 8%. Organic net sales grew 7% in the quarter as we continued to compete effectively amid the elevated consumer demand driven by the pandemic. Adjusted operating profit of $716 million increased 5% in constant currency, primarily driven by higher net sales, including positive price mix. This was partially offset by higher input costs, including input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.82 in the quarter and grew 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and lower net interest expense, partially offset by higher diluted shares outstanding.
Slide 30 summarizes the components of our net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 7%, with 5% growth in organic pound volume and 3 points of positive organic price/mix. Foreign exchange added 1 point of growth to reported net sales.
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America retail on Slide 31. Third quarter organic net sales were up 9%, led by 15% growth in U.S. meals and baking, 9% constant currency growth in Canada and 9% growth in U.S. Cereal. Third quarter, Nielsen-measured U.S. retail sales increased 10%, 1 point ahead of U.S. net sales growth in the quarter. We'd expect some retail inventory replenishment in Q4 as our capacity and consumer demand come into better balance. We continue to compete effectively in North America retail. We grew or held fiscal year-to-date market share in 7 of our top 10 U.S. categories, and we gained share in Canada. Third quarter constant currency segment operating profit increased 14%, driven primarily by volume growth, HMM, cost savings and fixed cost leverage in the supply chain, partially offset by input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs.
And I'll quickly touch on the latest pet results to build upon Bethany's comments. Organic net sales grew 14% in the third quarter, driven by double-digit growth for both dog food and cat food, and this continues to be a trend of strong net sales growth across product segments fiscal year-to-date, including approximately 25% growth in both wet food and treats. Blue has continued to gain share and grow household penetration as we drive awareness through our omni-channel growth model. On the bottom line, Pet's third quarter segment operating profit grew 9% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth, partially offset by negative price/mix, including innovation, launch investments tied to our new tastes book product line as well as higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses.
Turning to Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment results on Slide 33. Third quarter organic net sales declined 10%, driven by the continued reduction in away-from-home demand albeit the pandemic. We continue to see double-digit declines in consumer traffic negatively impact the segment's key away-from-home channels, including restaurants, schools and lodging. The away-from-home declines have only moderated slightly in recent months, and we continue to compete well, having gained market share in measured channels fiscal year-to-date. Segment operating profit in the quarter was down 31%, driven by lower net sales and fixed cost deleverage in the supply chain.
In Europe and Australia, third quarter organic net sales grew 7%, primarily driven by growth in Old El Paso Mexican food and Häagen-Dazs retail ice cream. We've competed effectively fiscal year-to-date, growing our holding market share in France, the U.K. and Australia, the segment's 3 largest markets. Third quarter segment operating profit increased 24% in constant currency, driven by positive price/mix, volume growth and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher input costs.
In Asia and Latin America, organic net sales grew 14% in the third quarter. Net sales were up double digits in Latin America, driven by continued strong growth of Yoplait meals and snacks and Kitano seasonings in Brazil. Net sales were also up double digits in Asia in the quarter, driven primarily by growth in Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Betty Crocker dessert mixes. Net sales growth benefited in the third quarter as we began to lap the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in China that caused significant reduction in our Häagen-Dazs shop net sales last year. Third quarter segment operating profit increased 18% in constant currency, driven by higher net sales, partially offset by higher input costs.
Slide 36 summarizes our third quarter joint venture results. Cereal partners worldwide posted another strong quarter of top line growth, with constant currency net sales up 5%. CPW's net sales growth was broad-based, led by growth in Brazil, Turkey, France, Russia and Chile. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by positive price/mix in the quarter. Third quarter combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 9% to $12 million, driven primarily by net sales growth at CPW.
Turning to total company margin results. Third quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 90 basis points, driven primarily by higher input costs, including input cost inflation, costs to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs, partially offset by positive price/mix. Fiscal year-to-date adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points. Third quarter adjusted operating profit margin decreased 30 basis points, driven by a lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by SG&A expenses that grew slower than net sales. This result was modestly below our expectations, reflecting higher logistics costs and higher input cost inflation. Looking ahead, as we experienced higher inflationary environment, our first line of defense will continue to be our strong holistic margin management cost savings program. In addition, we are taking actions now and in the coming months, leveraging our strategic revenue management toolkit to drive net price realization that will benefit our fiscal '22.
Slide 38 summarizes other noteworthy Q3 income statement items. Unallocated corporate expenses excluding certain items affecting comparability, increased $25 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $4 million from a year ago, driven primarily by lower interest rates, partially offset by a $4 million expense related to our February debt exchange which allowed us to lock in lower interest rates on some long-term debt. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% compared to 21% a year ago, driven primarily by nonrecurring discrete benefits in fiscal 2020, partially offset by favorable earnings mix by market in fiscal 2021, and our average diluted shares outstanding were up 1%.
Our fiscal '21 9-month results are summarized on Slide 39. Net sales of $13.6 billion were up 8%. Organic net sales were also up 8%, including growth from organic volume and positive organic price/mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit of $2.4 billion increased or 11% in constant currency, primarily driven by higher net sales, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses, including a double-digit increase in media investment. Fiscal year-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $2.88 and grew 14% in constant currency, driven by higher adjusted operating profit, higher after-tax earnings from joint ventures and lower net interest expense, partially offset by higher diluted shares outstanding and a higher adjusted effective tax rate.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. 9 months operating cash flow totaled $2.2 billion, up 2% from the first 9 months of last year, primarily driven by higher net earnings, partially offset by changes in inventory. Our core working capital balance decreased $198 million from a year ago, primarily driven by improvements in accounts payable. Capital investments through 9 months of $346 million increased $77 million from a year ago, including higher spending on growth capital. We paid $932 million in dividends in the first 9 months. And as Jeff mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with a leverage ratio of 2.8x net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to our expectations for the balance of fiscal '21. We've outlined some key assumptions on Slide 41. We expect our Q4 net sales to be below last year's fourth quarter that saw a 21% reported net sales growth due to the pandemic-driven consumer stock up as well as the 53rd week and the extra month of Pet results. Even so, we anticipate Q4 organic net sales to be significantly above Q4 of fiscal '19, reflecting our expectation that at-home food demand will remain significantly above pre-pandemic level. Considering our strong year-to-date performance and our plans to continue competing effectively in the fourth quarter, we expect full year organic net sales to increase approximately 3.5%. On the bottom line, we anticipate that our better-than-expected first half adjusted operating profit margin results will be offset by higher input cost inflation and higher logistics costs than we expected in the second half. As a result, we now expect our full year fiscal '21 adjusted operating profit margin to be approximately in line with fiscal 2020 level, consistent with the guidance we outlined at the beginning of the year.
Finally, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet and have resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to Q4 and fiscal 2022 where we'll be comparing against pandemic driven results that included unprecedented global at-home food demand, we plan to introduce a 2-year compound growth metric into our quarterly communications. This will enable investors to compare our results against pre-pandemic periods and give you better visibility into the underlying momentum in our business. In other words, you'll be able to better see how much demand is sticking.
For example, as you can see on Slide 42, on a 2-year basis, our compound annual organic net sales growth improved from down 2% in fiscal '18 to flat in fiscal '19 and then stepped up the 2% growth in fiscal '20 when the pandemic hit. Our full year fiscal '21 guidance implies that this positive momentum will continue with an estimated 2-year organic net sales compound annual growth rate of approximately 4%. We'll continue to leverage this statistic as we move into fiscal 2022, and we'll look to sunset it once the current and comparison years reflect a less volatile operating environment.
And before I wrap up, let me share a few details about our proposed Yoplait Europe divestiture. We've entered into a memorandum of understanding to sell our 51% interest in Yoplait SAS to Sodiaal. Net sales for the businesses that would become fully owned by Sodiaal totaled $740 million in fiscal '20. In return, General Mills will receive noncash consideration, including Sodiaal's 49% interest in Yoplait Canada, which generated $290 million in net sales in fiscal '20 as well as a royalty-free license for the use of Yoplait and Liberte brands in the U.S. and Canada.
The transaction enhances our growth profile. For example, our total company compound annual net sales growth between fiscal '18 and fiscal '20 would have been approximately 25 basis points higher without the Yoplait Europe business. We do not expect a material impact to leverage, allowing us to maintain our balance sheet flexibility for future potential acquisitions and share repurchase activity. And we expect the transaction to be minimally dilutive, roughly 1% to 2% dilutive to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months, excluding transaction costs and any gain or loss on the sale. We anticipate the deal to close by the end of the calendar year, subject to labor consultations, regulatory filings and other customary closing conditions.
Let me close with a few thoughts. The General Mills team has risen to the challenges presented by the pandemic, making food the world loves and needs. We continue to make progress towards achieving our fiscal '21 priorities. We are back to fully leveraging all our capital allocation tools, including dividend growth, share repurchases and portfolio shaping. And as we look ahead, we expect to emerge from the pandemic, a stronger company, well-positioned to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value as we execute our accelerate strategy.

And I'm pleased to share that with our strengthened balance sheet and increased financial flexibility, we have returned to using our full set of capital allocation tools to drive growth for our business and value for our shareholders.
We resumed dividend growth in the second quarter. We were resuming our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. And with yesterday's announcement on the proposed divestiture of our European Yoplait operations, we are executing against our portfolio-shaping priorities to improve our growth profile.
Before I get into our third quarter results, let me share a bit more on yesterday's announcement. We have entered into a memorandum of understanding to sell our interest in our European Yoplait operations to Sodiaal, a leading French dairy cooperative and our current joint venture partner in the business, in exchange for full ownership of Yoplait Canada and a reduced royalty on our North America yogurt licenses. The transaction is fully aligned with our Accelerate strategy. It improves our growth profile, enhances our margins and creates value for our shareholders. And importantly, it allows our Europe and Australia segment to increase its focus on the businesses where we see the greatest potential for growth, our advantaged global platforms, including Mexican food, super premium ice cream and snack bars. Kofi will share more details on the transaction at the end of our prepared remarks this morning.
With this sale, we will deliver on our commitment to divest approximately 5% of our net sales, and we remain committed to further portfolio reshaping through acquisitions and/or divestitures to enhance our growth profile.
With that, let me shift back to our third quarter results. Slide 6 offers a quick snapshot of our performance. Third quarter organic net sales were up 7%, driven by continued strong demand for food at home and our ongoing ability to compete effectively everywhere we play. Adjusted operating profit was up 5% in the quarter, reflecting higher net sales, partially offset by higher input costs. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6%. We continue to focus on 3 priorities for fiscal 2021, competing effectively everywhere we play, operating efficiently to fuel investment in our brands and capabilities and continuing to enhance our financial flexibility by reducing our debt leverage. We've made good progress against each of those priorities in the third quarter and remain on track to achieve them for the full year. Let me share a bit more detail on how we're executing against each of these priorities.
As part of the Accelerate strategy we announced last month, we've prioritized driving profitable growth in 8 core markets that make up the vast majority of our sales and profit. In addition, we outlined 5 global platforms where our differentiated advantages will drive differential growth for our portfolio. We continue to win across these markets and platforms in fiscal '21, enabled by strong execution on our leading brands. Through the first 3 quarters, we've held or grown share in 6 of our 8 core markets, and we've increased our share in each of our global platforms, including gaining more than a full point of share in Mexican food, more than 0.5 point in cereal, 40 basis points in pet food and 30 basis point increases in snack bars and in ice cream. We're competing effectively, and we're winning.
Our second key priority this year is operating efficiently to fuel investments in our brands and capabilities and here, too, we've made good progress. We're on track to deliver another year of strong HMM savings at 4% of cost of goods, which is enabling us to invest for growth. Media investment to support our brands was up again in the third quarter and is up 12% on a year-to-date basis, including strong support behind compelling campaigns on Cheerios, Blue, Old El Paso and Häagen-Dazs that are helping driving growth and market share gains. 
On the capability side, we're continuing to invest to unleash our scale and drive differentiated growth and efficiency across our enterprise. In the third quarter, we continued our investments behind our digital, data and analytics, strategic revenue management and e-commerce capabilities. We're already realizing the benefits of these investments, including triple-digit growth in our U.S. e-commerce business over the past 9 months. We'll see continued tangible benefits from our capability investments in fiscal '22, and we expect these capabilities will create further competitive advantages for General Mills over the long term.
In addition to supporting accelerated investments in brands and capabilities, our strong performance has enabled us to meet another key priority for fiscal 2021, reducing our debt leverage. We ended the third quarter with a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.8x, which is nearly a half turn below our fiscal 2020 result. With our strengthened balance sheet position, we have resumed our share repurchase program as of the fourth quarter, and we have the capacity to execute bolt-on acquisitions that will further reshape our portfolio and help us achieve our long-term organic sales growth target. In other words, we are back to having a full set of capital allocation tools at our disposal to drive shareholder value, including investment in our business, dividend growth, M&A and share buybacks.
We are proud of our team and the progress we've made in this challenging year. We are serving our consumers, strengthening our brands, investing in our capabilities and returning capital to shareholders. We're delivering on our fiscal '21 priorities, and we're on track to drive strong sales and profit growth for the full year, despite tough comparisons in the fourth quarter. I fully expect General Mills will emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company, better able to capitalize on the growth opportunities that lie ahead.
One of the most compelling growth opportunities in our portfolio resides within our Pet segment. As I mentioned, next month marks the third anniversary of our transformational acquisition of Blue Buffalo. As we think about continuing to reshape our portfolio for enhanced growth, we look to our performance with Blue as evidence of our ability to successfully acquire, nurture and grow brands and businesses where we can leverage the power of General Mills team and capabilities.
To speak more about this, I'll now hand it over to Bethany Quam, President of our Pet segment. Bethany?"
274715,709029722,2242010,"General Mills, Inc., Q3 2021 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to share the exciting progress Blue Buffalo has made. We are loving and feeding more pets like family, and we're excited about the future.When General Mills acquired Blue Buffalo",1618,"Thank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to share the exciting progress Blue Buffalo has made. We are loving and feeding more pets like family, and we're excited about the future.
When General Mills acquired Blue Buffalo, we highlighted 5 compelling, strategic and financial benefits. The business operated in an attractive growth category. Blue was a leading brand with a loyal consumer base that we believe was still in its early stages of growth. It had proven to be successful in both existing and emerging channels. It was a scaled platform with strong growth and operational efficiency, and it would contribute meaningfully to General Mills' growth and margin profile. The initial benefits we outlined 3 years ago have all proven to be true, and we've identified more opportunities for growth. As part of General Mills, Blue Buffalo net sales have grown at a 10% compound rate to more than $1.7 billion. And thanks to our operating efficiency, operating profit has grown even faster than sales, an 11% compound rate to more than $400 million, further strengthening an operating margin that was already accretive to General Mills' average.
Our ability to achieve this level of growth comes from our commitment to loving and feeding more pets like family. In Blue's early days with General Mills, we invested significantly to continue to build the brand and accelerate Blue's expansion in the food, drug and mass channel, or FDM, where about 40% of pet food is sold. As a result, since the acquisition, we've increased our distribution in FDM from 22% to 86%; we've nearly doubled our household penetration; and we've increased our all channel market share to about 7.7% in this fast-growing category. 
As we've grown, we stayed true to the values that form the foundation of the Blue brand. Blue Buffalo was created by the Bishop family, pet parents whose beloved Airedale, Blue, suffered 3 bouts with cancer. Their promise to feed Blue the best food possible sparked a natural pet food revolution. The Bishops continue to partner with us as founders and brand advisers. And our commitment to using only high-quality natural ingredients and telling the authentic brand story remains the bedrock of this brand today.
While pets aren't impacted by the at-home versus away-from-home eating trends that have driven growth across General Mills' human food businesses, the pandemic did impact pet parents, how they feed their pets, shop and get their information, and there are more pets. The rate of U.S. pet population growth accelerated this past year, roughly doubling from pre-pandemic levels and placing millions of new pets in the household. And pets became more a part of the family than ever, with 59% of pet parents reporting deeper bond with their pets.
This shift to high-quality natural food also accelerated during the pandemic. Average pet food spend per household was up 6% as pet parents traded up and switched to more premium foods like Blue. We also saw a shopping pattern shift. Blue's strong presence across channels allowed us to be available wherever pet parents wanted to shop. Together, these trends drove strong profitable growth for Blue, with organic net sales up 13% so far in fiscal '21 and broad-based market share growth across key segments and retail channels. Looking forward, Blue is well-positioned for continued growth. Pet food is a great category, Blue leads in the most attractive segments, and we have a clear plan for growth.
Since we acquired Blue Buffalo, the U.S. pet food category have grown about 4% a year, and recent trends point to continued mid single-digit growth for the category going forward. Natural pet food, which represents about 30% of total pet food sales today, has led the category with 9% growth in calendar 2020. Because we know pet parents want natural high-quality ingredients for their pets, we expect the natural segment to continue to drive category growth in the years ahead. And Blue Buffalo is well-positioned to lead this growth as the leading natural brand and the brand most likely to be recommended by pet parents. It is truly a proud distinction to be recognized by pet parents as the most loved and trusted natural brand on the market.
Our long-term strategy to drive continued growth in pet is aligned to General Mills' broader Accelerate framework. We will continue to lead with our purpose, love them like family, feed them like family. And in terms of where to play, we remain focused on leading and expanding our presence in high-quality natural feeding and treating for dogs and cats. The rest of my remarks will focus on how we're delivering for our pet parents and our shareholders by boldly building Blue, relentlessly innovating, leveraging the advantages of General Mills' scale and being a force for good.
I'll start with how we're boldly building Blue. Since the brand was launched, Blue Buffalo has invested $1.4 billion to drive brand awareness, connect with pet parents and store through our Pet Detective program and reach them online. Our consistent investment has enabled us to capture an outside share voice in the market. And we continue to build Blue, we will make considered choices about the channels and messages that will help us most effectively reach pet parents. 
Over the past 3 years, Blue has become a successful omni-channel business by leveraging the power of the brand and partnering with our customers to drive growth. For example, we recently ran our third annual out with the old, in with the Blue campaign to encourage that parents to make pet health heart of their New Year's resolution and trade up to Blue. Our integrated campaigns combine digital rewards with in-store promotions and natural media and we delivered consistently across the channel. Our omni-channel approach is working, demonstrated by our results in the third quarter. Blue grew in all channels, including in pet specialty, where retail sales grew for the first time to Blue's initial expansion into FDM more than 3 years ago.
Beyond brand building, innovation is the second part of how we'll win strategy. It all starts with a nutritional philosophy. We believe all dogs and cats, regardless of life stage, breed size or specialized condition, deserve high-quality natural feeding and treating. All of our products adhere to our true Blue promise. Real meat is the first ingredient with no poultry byproduct meal, no corn, wheat or soy and no artificial flavors or preservatives. We see significant opportunity to innovate and bring the true Blue promise to parts of the category where natural and Blue are underrepresented today. We are currently focused on naturalizing 3 segments: condition-based diets, wet cat food and treats.
True Solutions is our product line that will naturalize condition-based diets. Fruitful Belly, for example, provides digestive care for dogs and cats with sensitive stomachs. True Solutions give pet parents a way to offer natural solutions to support their dog or cat-specific health needs. Wet cat food is an attractive growing segment with roughly $5 billion in retail sales. Pet parents want natural foods for their cats, but won't compromise on food their cats enjoy. We recently launched Tastefuls, a high-quality, all-natural portfolio of wet cat food that even our most picky cats love. We leveraged our research and development expertise to develop a project that is both tasty and natural so pet parents don't have to choose. It's available across channels, and we just kicked it off an integrated ONE TASTE IS ALL IT TAKES campaign to support the launch.
Treats is another area where Blue underinvests today, pet parents are treating their pets more than ever, and Blue aims to be there for every treatable moment. We just added a new item to our treat line with bone, perfect for everyday treating. This innovation offers an all-natural option to mainstream crunchy bone treats and helps round out our offerings in the more than $7 billion treat segment of the category.
The third pillar of our How to Win strategy is leveraging the combined scale of General Mills and Blue Buffalo. It all starts with capabilities like digital, data and analytics to drive growth and efficiency and product development expertise to relentlessly innovate. In fact, we recently completed construction of a new pet pilot plant that is co-located with the General Mills global R&D facility, encouraging the free fall of ideas and best practices as we work on innovation across our platform. But the real magic is in the combined power of our people, our bucks, as we call them. We're working to humanize pet food so the combined power of pets and human food experts coming together is exciting. In these ways and so many more, Blue benefits from the opportunities of the big, while keeping the spirit of the small, all while staying true to our brand's purpose.
Finally, we will continue to be a force for good, leaning into Blue's founding mission to support pet health and cure pet cancer. We have already helped to raise over $30 million for pet cancer research, and we remain dedicated to this important cause. And as part of the broader General Mills enterprise, Blue is committed to advancing our efforts in climate, sustainability and all other ESG matters. After 3 successful years of profitable growth, we remain bullish about Blue's future. Our purpose has never been more relevant for pet parents, and we are well positioned to continue to lead in the most attractive segment of this growing category. We are excited about what's ahead for Blue.
I will now turn it over to Kofi Bruce, our CFO, to share more on General Mills' third quarter financial results and business outlook. Kofi?"
274715,709029722,2242010,"General Mills, Inc., Q3 2021 Pre Recorded Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2021",2021-03-24,"Earnings Calls","General Mills, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bethany, and hello, everyone.I'll start with our third quarter financial results on Slide 29. Net sales of $4.5 million were up 8%. Organic net sales grew 7% in the quarter as we continued to compete effectively amid the elevated consumer demand",2022,"Thanks, Bethany, and hello, everyone.
I'll start with our third quarter financial results on Slide 29. Net sales of $4.5 million were up 8%. Organic net sales grew 7% in the quarter as we continued to compete effectively amid the elevated consumer demand driven by the pandemic. Adjusted operating profit of $716 million increased 5% in constant currency, primarily driven by higher net sales, including positive price/mix. This was partially offset by higher input costs, including input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.82 in the quarter and grew 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and lower net interest expense, partially offset by higher diluted shares outstanding.
Slide 30 summarizes the components of our net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 7%, with 5% growth in organic pound volume and 3 points of positive organic price/mix. Foreign exchange added 1 point of growth to reported net sales.
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America retail on Slide 31. Third quarter organic net sales were up 9%, led by 15% growth in U.S. meals and baking, 9% constant currency growth in Canada and 9% growth in U.S. Cereal. Third quarter, Nielsen-measured U.S. retail sales increased 10%, 1 point ahead of U.S. net sales growth in the quarter. We'd expect some retail inventory replenishment in Q4 as our capacity and consumer demand come into better balance. We continue to compete effectively in North America retail. We grew or held fiscal year-to-date market share in 7 of our top 10 U.S. categories, and we gained share in Canada. Third quarter constant currency segment operating profit increased 14%, driven primarily by volume growth, HMM, cost savings and fixed cost leverage in the supply chain, partially offset by input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs.
And I'll quickly touch on the latest pet results to build upon Bethany's comments. Organic net sales grew 14% in the third quarter, driven by double-digit growth for both dog food and cat food, and this continues to be a trend of strong net sales growth across product segments fiscal year-to-date, including approximately 25% growth in both wet food and treats. Blue has continued to gain share and grow household penetration as we drive awareness through our omni-channel growth model. On the bottom line, Pet's third quarter segment operating profit grew 9% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth, partially offset by negative price/mix, including innovation, launch investments tied to our new Tastefuls product line as well as higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses.
Turning to Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment results on Slide 33. Third quarter organic net sales declined 10%, driven by the continued reduction in away-from-home demand amid the pandemic. We continue to see double-digit declines in consumer traffic negatively impact the segment's key away-from-home channels, including restaurants, schools and lodging. The away-from-home declines have only moderated slightly in recent months, and we continue to compete well, having gained market share in measured channels fiscal year-to-date. Segment operating profit in the quarter was down 31%, driven by lower net sales and fixed cost deleverage in the supply chain.
In Europe and Australia, third quarter organic net sales grew 7%, primarily driven by growth in Old El Paso Mexican food and Häagen-Dazs retail ice cream. We've competed effectively fiscal year-to-date, growing or holding market share in France, the U.K. and Australia, the segment's 3 largest markets. Third quarter segment operating profit increased 24% in constant currency, driven by positive price/mix, volume growth and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher input costs.
In Asia and Latin America, organic net sales grew 14% in the third quarter. Net sales were up double digits in Latin America, driven by continued strong growth of Yoplait meals and snacks and Kitano seasonings in Brazil. Net sales were also up double digits in Asia in the quarter, driven primarily by growth in Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Betty Crocker dessert mixes. Net sales growth benefited in the third quarter as we began to lap the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in China that caused significant reduction in our Häagen-Dazs shop net sales last year. Third quarter segment operating profit increased 18% in constant currency, driven by higher net sales, partially offset by higher input costs.
Slide 36 summarizes our third quarter joint venture results. Cereal Partners Worldwide posted another strong quarter of top line growth, with constant currency net sales up 5%. CPW's net sales growth was broad-based, led by growth in Brazil, Turkey, France, Russia and Chile. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by positive price/mix in the quarter. Third quarter combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 9% to $12 million, driven primarily by net sales growth at CPW.
Turning to total company margin results. Third quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 90 basis points, driven primarily by higher input costs, including input cost inflation, costs to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs, partially offset by positive price/mix. Fiscal year-to-date adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points. Third quarter adjusted operating profit margin decreased 30 basis points, driven by a lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by SG&A expenses that grew slower than net sales. This result was modestly below our expectations, reflecting higher logistics costs and higher input cost inflation. 
Looking ahead, as we experience higher inflationary environment, our first line of defense will continue to be our strong holistic margin management cost savings program. In addition, we are taking actions now and in the coming months, leveraging our strategic revenue management toolkit to drive net price realization that will benefit our fiscal '22.
Slide 38 summarizes other noteworthy Q3 income statement items. Unallocated corporate expenses excluding certain items affecting comparability increased $25 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $4 million from a year ago, driven primarily by lower interest rates, partially offset by a $4 million expense related to our February debt exchange, which allowed us to lock in lower interest rates on some long-term debt. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% compared to 21% a year ago, driven primarily by nonrecurring discrete benefits in fiscal 2020, partially offset by favorable earnings mix by market in fiscal 2021, and our average diluted shares outstanding were up 1%.
Our fiscal '21 9-month results are summarized on Slide 39. Net sales of $13.6 billion were up 8%. Organic net sales were also up 8%, including growth from organic volume and positive organic price/mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit of $2.4 billion increased 11% in constant currency, primarily driven by higher net sales, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses, including a double-digit increase in media investment. Fiscal year-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $2.88 and grew 14% in constant currency, driven by higher adjusted operating profit, higher after-tax earnings from joint ventures and lower net interest expense, partially offset by higher diluted shares outstanding and a higher adjusted effective tax rate.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. 9 months operating cash flow totaled $2.2 billion, up 2% from the first 9 months of last year, primarily driven by higher net earnings, partially offset by changes in inventory. Our core working capital balance decreased $198 million from a year ago, primarily driven by improvements in accounts payable. Capital investments through 9 months of $346 million increased $77 million from a year ago, including higher spending on growth capital. We paid $932 million in dividends in the first 9 months. And as Jeff mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with a leverage ratio of 2.8x net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.
Turning to our expectations for the balance of fiscal '21. We've outlined some key assumptions on Slide 41. We expect our Q4 net sales to be below last year's fourth quarter that saw a 21% reported net sales growth due to the pandemic-driven consumer stock up as well as the 53rd week and the extra month of Pet results. Even so, we anticipate Q4 organic net sales to be significantly above Q4 of fiscal '19, reflecting our expectation that at-home food demand will remain significantly above pre-pandemic level. Considering our strong year-to-date performance and our plans to continue competing effectively in the fourth quarter, we expect full year organic net sales to increase approximately 3.5%. 
On the bottom line, we anticipate that our better-than-expected first half adjusted operating profit margin results will be offset by higher input cost inflation and higher logistics costs than we expected in the second half. As a result, we now expect our full year fiscal '21 adjusted operating profit margin to be approximately in line with fiscal 2020 level, consistent with the guidance we outlined at the beginning of the year.
Finally, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet and have resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to Q4 and fiscal 2022 when we'll be comparing against pandemic driven results that included unprecedented global at-home food demand, we plan to introduce a 2-year compound growth metric into our quarterly communications. This will enable investors to compare our results against pre-pandemic periods and give you better visibility into the underlying momentum in our business. In other words, you'll be able to better see how much demand is sticking.
For example, as you can see on Slide 42, on a 2-year basis, our compound annual organic net sales growth improved from down 2% in fiscal '18 to flat in fiscal '19 and then stepped up to 2% growth in fiscal '20 when the pandemic hit. Our full year fiscal '21 guidance implies that this positive momentum will continue with an estimated 2-year organic net sales compound annual growth rate of approximately 4%. We'll continue to leverage this statistic as we move into fiscal 2022, and we'll look to sunset it once the current and comparison years reflect a less volatile operating environment.
And before I wrap up, let me share a few details about our proposed Yoplait Europe divestiture. We've entered into a memorandum of understanding to sell our 51% interest in Yoplait S.A.S. to Sodiaal. Net sales for the businesses that would become fully owned by Sodiaal totaled $740 million in fiscal '20. In return, General Mills will receive noncash consideration, including Sodiaal's 49% interest in Yoplait Canada, which generated $290 million in net sales in fiscal '20 as well as a royalty-free license for the use of Yoplait and Liberte brands in the U.S. and Canada.
The transaction enhances our growth profile. For example, our total company compound annual net sales growth between fiscal '18 and fiscal '20 would have been approximately 25 basis points higher without the Yoplait Europe business. We do not expect a material impact to leverage, allowing us to maintain our balance sheet flexibility for future potential acquisitions and share repurchase activity. And we expect the transaction to be minimally dilutive, roughly 1% to 2% dilutive to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months, excluding transaction costs and any gain or loss on the sale. We anticipate the deal to close by the end of the calendar year, subject to labor consultations, regulatory filings and other customary closing conditions.
Let me close with a few thoughts. The General Mills team has risen to the challenges presented by the pandemic, making food the world loves and needs. We continue to make progress towards achieving our fiscal '21 priorities. We are back to fully leveraging all our capital allocation tools, including dividend growth, share repurchases and portfolio shaping. And as we look ahead, we expect to emerge from the pandemic a stronger company, well-positioned to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value as we execute our accelerate strategy.

And it is -- from a demand perspective, it's still as volatile. And even if mentally many consumers are getting beyond COVID, the demand environment is volatile not only with respect to at-home versus away-from-home consumption but also what is the impact of pricing going to be and what does that mean for elasticity? So I would say the demand environment is still volatile, as is the cost environment. And so whether that's input costs on manufacturing or whether that's transportation or whether those are commodities, it is a pretty volatile environment. 
What I'm proud of is over the past year, and we've been able to navigate that well and do what we said we're going to do. In fact, each of the last 3 years, we've done what we said we're going to do. And now we still have to face this year. And -- but I feel good about our guidance. I don't think it's so conservative, and I don't think we're on over our SKUs. We're trying to tell you here's what we think we will do. And is it easy in this kind of environment? No. But I feel good about our capabilities and how we're executing right now, and we're very clear on our path forward.

So it hasn't been volatile in the recent past. The question is what's going to happen for the remainder of the year as pricing kicks in, as we -- as kids go back to school as we had in the fall.

And in fact, what we're doing is pushing operating responsibility for the near term and more closely align to the businesses, which is really important. So we are doing that. In terms of the strategy area itself, we are centralizing some of the capabilities because you don't want to do modeling, for example, in many different places. You want to be able to do that in one central location. But then it's up to the businesses themselves to use that modeling and then to decide what's best for their businesses. So you want some centralized capabilities so you can develop scale and expertise, but then you want to use those models to be in the businesses who are responsible for the P&L. So that's where we're doing that. 
The other thing we're doing, I would say, is that similar to what we've done with strategic revenue management over time, we're at one point in time many years ago, it was something we did periodically was thinking about pricing and we turned into it always-on kind of function. The same would be true of our strategy function. We're kind of beefing up our strategy function as well as M&A. As we look to the future, and certainly, what we need to do to hit our sustainable top line growth targets is we need to keep competing effectively, but we also need to do more portfolio shaping. And so in that sense, we have an always-on strategy group that is maybe different than what we have done in the recent past."

But I think if I can give you -- what's underlying the assumption as to why we think this is going to happen. In our human food business -- and I'm going to separate pet. But in our human food business, what I would say is that there are a couple of factors underlying our belief that we'll continue to see demand that's above prepandemic levels. The first is that more people are going to work from home more often than go into the office every day. And we're fairly certain that, that is here to stay. So there will be a new normal and where people work. 
The second is that consumers, many millennials have really gained cooking skills and baking skills and new found confidence in the kitchen and they can find that they can save money by doing it. And so while they -- we're not saying people won't want to still go out to eat, we believe that there's a younger generation that maybe not have done this before. Our penetration day, we show this, especially in the U.S. that we have a whole new group of consumers that have elevated demand. 
The third would be that our e-commerce business has grown rapidly over time. In fact, it's now 11% of our sales, up from 5% 18 months ago. And while the continued growth may not be linear over the next period of time, many people have found shopping in grocery stores become much easier than it was before. And any time you got a convenience to someone's lives, it tends to stack. So for all of those reasons on our common food business, -- we believe -- even as people go out to restaurants more, even as kids start to go back to school, there will be some of the demand that is sticky for food at home. 
The other thing I would say for pet is a little bit more straightforward, and frankly, there are more pets than they were before. And that is certainly true here in the U.S., it's true in other parts of the world as well. But particularly in the U.S., that 85% of those new pets are in homes that already contained one pet. And so these are people who are used to having pets. And so the amount of pet food that's going to be consumed over the next few years, we think, is going to be elevated. In addition to the fact that the fastest-growing part of pet continues to be the natural segment, which is where Blue Buffalo competes. And so we would anticipate that the category itself will be above what it has been the last couple of years, and that natural will remain ahead of the category in terms of growth."

I just think for us to talk about future pricing is probably not something we should do too much other than to say, I think one of the keys to our success as we look ahead as it has been recently, is our agility. And we've proven ourselves pretty agile during that last year, including with recent pricing we've taken into the marketplace relatively quickly. And I attribute that to the fact that we have an always-on capability. And so in a volatile market, trying to be certain is not a good place to be. What you need to be as thoughtful and you need to be fast. And I think for both of those things, and we're going to try to continue to do both of those things. So you raised a good question. We're not going to answer directly because we usually don't talk about pricing. But I do believe that the key challenge in the volatile environment is to be clear and to be agile. And we will certainly endeavor to do that and we feel good about our ability to do that."

Pancakes grow more quickly than cereal. We do believe cereal will continue growing in the future. And again, as we look over that 2-year period, the category did grow. We grew even more aggressively than that. So again, we increased 60 basis points of share in fiscal '21, that's 31 consecutive months of share growth, 10 consecutive quarters, 4 consecutive years.

We've tied together an omnichannel approach in China with our shops in our retail, which is yielding some good insights, great results. We like what we're seeing there. 
And even on the cost side, as we look at our global sourcing efforts, we've tied data and analytics into that to help us with our costing and HMM.

In terms of how we're going to grow, this digital capability will certainly be a big piece of that, but so with innovation.

We under-indexed in Canada, the margins in that segment are good, and we're highly confident Blue Buffalo can play a role in that. We've recently launched some innovation in snacking and the bone loss, and we're excited about what that can be. In addition then to clearly bringing online this Tyson acquisition, which we hope to close shortly. And so we're going to grow Blue Buffalo organically, continue to do that.

I'd also say volatile so we can throw that one in, too, right? And it is -- from a demand perspective, it still is volatile. And even if mentally, many consumers are getting beyond COVID, the demand environment is volatile not only with respect to at-home versus away-from-home consumption but also what is the impact of pricing going to be and what does that mean for elasticity. So I would say the demand environment is still volatile and as is the cost environment. And so whether that's input costs on manufacturing or whether that's transportation or whether those are commodities, it is a pretty volatile environment.
What I'm proud of is over the past year, we've been able to navigate that well and do what we said we're going to do. In fact, each of the last 3 years, we've done what we said we're going to do. And now we still have to face this year. And -- but I feel good about our guidance. I don't think it's so conservative, and I don't think we're out over our skis. We're kind -- we're trying to tell you here's what we think we will do. And is it easy in this kind of environment? No. But I feel good about our capabilities and how we're executing right now. And we're very clear on our path forward. So all of those things give me confidence that we can do what we said we're going to do. But it's a tricky environment, and I think that it will be."

I think this is exhibit A when you have a group of -- one group thinking one thing, another, another. Just shows that there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility. That would be the first point.
The second is that if you look at our guidance for the year, we said we'd be down modestly on sale, minus 1% to minus 3%. And I can tell you that we're in lockstep with our retail customers, and we have good partnerships with them, and we're pretty well aligned with what they think. And so -- but I can understand why there are differences. Because it is a volatile environment, by -- varies by category as well as geography.
So we're very well aligned with our customers, not only on the demand environment, but also the cost environment. They see the same cost pressures we do. And we've instituted pricing in the vast majority of our categories and markets throughout the world. And while no one wants to increase prices, we've had to do that because the cost environment is what it is. And we have found them to be understanding because they're in the same kind of boat that we are."

And we've been talking for quite some time that although in some corners, people thought demand would kind of fall off a cliff when people started going back to the office and got returning to normal pre-pandemic, we said we think actually some of these behaviors will be sticky, and that's what we have seen. So it hasn't been volatile in the recent past.
The question is what's going to happen for the remainder of the year as pricing kicks in, as we -- as kids go back to school as we hit the fall. And I think it will be a volatile environment. We're calling it the best we can, given our assumptions. But you are correct. It hasn't been volatile in the recent past. But as we look ahead 3 months and 6 months, I think that will be what we're going to be dealing with. And I would note during that -- and yes, I would note, during that period, Rob, we still expect at-home food consumption to be above prepandemic levels, even if it's below -- slightly below a year ago."

It's a -- I would say it's a decent-sized change, but what we're not doing is taking operating responsibility out of the businesses. In fact, what we're doing is pushing operating responsibility for the near term and more closely aligned to the businesses, which is really important. So we are doing that.
In terms of the strategy area itself, we are centralizing some of the capabilities because you don't want to do modeling, for example, in many different places. You want to be able to do that in one central location, but then it's up to the businesses themselves to use that modeling and then to decide what's best for their businesses. So you want some centralized capabilities so you can develop scale and expertise, but then you want to use those models to be in the businesses who are responsible for the P&L. So that's what we're -- we're doing that.
The other thing we're doing, I would say, is that similar to what we've done with Strategic Revenue Management over time, we're -- at one point in time many years ago, it was -- something we did periodically was think about pricing, and we turned it to an always-on kind of function.
The same would be true of our strategy function. We're kind of beefing up our strategy function as well as M&A. As we look to the future, and certainly, what we need to do to hit our sustainable top line growth targets is we need to keep competing effectively, but we also need to do more portfolio shaping. And so in that sense, we have an always-on strategy group that is maybe different than what we have done in the recent past."

But I think -- if I can give you -- what's underlying the assumption as to why we think this is going to happen. In our human food business -- and I'm going to separate pet. But in our human food business, what I would say is that there are a couple of factors underlying our belief that we'll continue to see demand that's above prepandemic levels. The first is that more people are going to work from home more often than go into the office every day. And we're fairly certain that, that is here to stay. So there will be a new normal in where people work.
The second is that consumers, many millennials have really gained cooking skills and baking skills and newfound confidence in the kitchen, and they can find that they can save money by doing it. And so while they -- we're not saying people won't want to still go out to eat. We believe that there's a younger generation that maybe not have done this before. Our penetration data would show this, especially in the U.S., that we have a whole new group of consumers that have elevated demand.
The third would be that our e-commerce business has grown rapidly over time. In fact, it's now 11% of our sales, up from 5% 18 months ago. And while the continued growth may not be linear over the next period of time, many people have found shopping in grocery stores become much easier than it was before. And any time you got a convenience to someone's lives, it tends to stick. So for all of those reasons in our human food business, we believe, even as people go out to restaurants more, even as kids start to go back to school, there will be some of the demand that is sticky for food at home.
The other thing I would say for pet is a little bit more straightforward, and frankly, there are more pets than there were before. And that is certainly true here in the U.S., it's true in other parts of the world as well, but particularly in the U.S., that 85% of those new pets are in homes that already contained one pet. And so these are people who are used to having pets. And so the amount of pet food that's going to be consumed over the next few years, we think, is going to be elevated. In addition to the fact that the fastest-growing part of pet continues to be the natural segment, which is where Blue Buffalo competes. And so we would anticipate that the category itself will be above what it has been the last couple of years and that natural will remain ahead of the category in terms of growth."

In terms of Yoplait, we launched Oui, a plant-based product, several years ago that has continued to do quite well. We're actually looking at launching a Yoplait plant-based product in the coming year as well. So it's still relatively small in yogurt in the U.S., growing quickly.

What you need to be is thoughtful, and you need to be fast. And I think we're both of those things, and we're going to try to continue to be both of those things.
So you raised a good question. We're not going to answer directly because we usually don't talk about pricing.

It's used, obviously, for breakfast. It's used for snacking throughout the day. We've got some great innovation coming this past -- this coming year.

We've tied together an omnichannel approach in China with our shops and our retail, which is yielding some good insights, great results. We like what we're seeing there.
And even on the cost side, as we look at our global sourcing efforts, we've tied data and analytics into that to help us with our costing and HMM. And so you can see -- you'll see us continue to invest in our data and analytics capabilities because we really like what we have seen so far.

During today's presentation, I will provide a summary of our fourth quarter and full year performance, share how we are reshaping our portfolio and organizational structure to drive stronger and more profitable growth and outline our priorities and guidance for fiscal '22. Then Kofi will walk through our fiscal '21 financial performance in more detail as well as provide some color on the assumptions that frame our expectations for fiscal '22. 
Let's begin with today's key messages on Slide 4. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have seen dramatic changes in consumer behavior. These changes, including how we shop, where we eat and work, how often we travel and more have required us to adapt. Throughout this time, we focus on what is most important, prioritizing the health and safety of our people and our consumers above all else. I'm proud of our team's focus and perseverance not only to deliver for our consumers and our communities but also to achieve our fiscal '21 priorities. 
Now as we emerge from the pandemic, it's clear that consumer behaviors are not returning to what they once were. The rapid growth in e-commerce, the likelihood that many office workers will have some degree of remote work and the increased appreciation consumers have gained for cooking and baking over the past 18 months will have lasting impacts and will create opportunity. Simply put, we are ending 1 period of significant consumer disruption only to start another. 
As we look ahead to our fiscal '22, we will continue to execute our Accelerate strategy, focusing on 3 priorities that will be critical to our success: continuing to compete effectively, successfully navigating the dynamic cost environment and executing our portfolio and organizational reshaping efforts without disruption. 
Slide 5 summarizes our headline financial performance metrics for fiscal 2021. We delivered strong performance for the full year, including 4% organic net sales growth, 2% constant-currency growth and adjusted operating profit and 4% growth in adjusted diluted EPS in constant currency, driven by our ability to meet the strong demand for food at home, find new solutions for our away-from-home customers and outperform our competition. 
Our fourth quarter results were slightly ahead of our expectations, though down versus last year's unprecedented fourth quarter that included the initial surge in at-home food demand, the 53rd week for our legacy segments and an extra month of results for our Pet segment. Relative to fiscal '19 fourth quarter, which did not have the same unusual comparisons, our 2-year compound growth was up 4% on organic net sales, up 1% on constant currency adjusted operating profit and up 4% on constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. It is absolutely clear from these results that General Mills will exit the pandemic a stronger company than we entered it. I'm extremely proud of our team for their tireless work in making that happen. 
Looking back at the year, we accomplished what we set out to do, competing effectively everywhere we play, driving efficiency to fuel investments in our brands and capabilities and reducing our debt leverage. Our consistent focus on these priorities shaped our decisions throughout the year and were instrumental in driving our financial performance. Let me share if a few highlights of our fiscal '21 performance on each of these priorities. 
As we outlined back in February, one of the focus areas of our Accelerate strategy is to win in our 8 core markets and 5 global platforms where we believe our competitive advantages will drive differential growth. Our efforts in these areas are paying off. We delivered broad-based net sales growth in fiscal '21 in our largest markets, including the U.S., Canada, France, the U.K., China and Brazil. We gained market share in all 5 of our global platforms including our fourth consecutive year of share growth in the U.S. cereal, good gains in snack bars, pet food and ice cream and more than 1 point of share growth for Old El Paso Mexican food. And relative pre-pandemic period, we've grown household penetration and increased repeat rates across 7 of our top 10 U.S. categories. This gives us confidence that as consumers transition to their new normal they will continue to seek out the General Mills brands they know and trust. 
We also successfully achieved our second priority, which was to drive efficiency to fuel investments in our brands and capabilities. We delivered another strong year of Holistic Margin Management productivity savings at 4% of cost of goods sold, which enabled us to increase brand-building investments even as we dealt with higher cost to service elevated demand. In fact, we increased our media investment at an 11% compounded rate over the past 2 years, including strong support for differentiated campaigns on brands such as Cheerios, Nature Valley, Old El Paso, BLUE, Häagen-Dazs, Pillsbury and many more. 
We also continue investing in strategic capabilities that will be critical to our future success, including digital, data and analytics, e-commerce, HMM and strategic revenue management. These investments are already paying off as evidenced by our continued outperformance in e-commerce, which now makes up 11% of our worldwide net sales. Our e-commerce net sales were up 45% in fiscal '21, and we continue to see our brands holding higher market shares online than in brick-and-mortar outlets. 
Finally, our strong financial discipline allowed us to further reduce our leverage to 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal '21. With our balance sheet in a solid position, we were able to activate each of our long-term capital allocation priorities during fiscal '21, including continuing healthy level of capital investment in the business to fuel growth and drive HMM cost savings, increasing our quarterly dividend rate by 4% per share in the second quarter; announcing in May, the acquisition of the Tyson pet treats business, which will be our first acquisition since the addition of Blue Buffalo in fiscal '18 and resuming share repurchase activity by buying back $301 million of stock in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we'll continue to use our balance sheet as a strategic asset by investing to improve our growth profile while returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In addition to delivering on our key priorities in fiscal '21, we also announced a few important actions that will be critical to enhancing our future growth in line with our acceleration. They include 2 portfolio reshaping transactions that will enhance the growth and margin profile of our enterprise. First, as we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in March to sell our interest in our European Yoplait operations to Sodiaal, a leading French dairy cooperative and our current joint venture partner in the business in exchange for full ownership of Yoplait Canada, and a reduced royalty on our North American yogurt licenses. The work on this proposed transaction is going as planned, and we remain on track to sign a definitive agreement and close the sale by the end of calendar 2021.
More recently, in May, we reached an agreement to acquire Tyson's pet treat business, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. The Tyson portfolio, which includes the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands is the leader in natural meat treats and is highly complementary to our existing pet treat portfolio under the brand. Annual net sales for the Tyson pet treat business totaled more than $240 million and have grown at nearly a 20% compound rate over the past 3 years. We see significant opportunities to drive future growth by expanding awareness and availability of these products, and we expect to unlock production and other cost synergies with the rest of our pet business, all of which will result in substantial value creation. We have now cleared nearly all of the key closing conditions for this transaction, including HSR review, so we expect the deal to close shortly. 
These 2 transactions represent significant steps in our effort to reshape our portfolio to drive faster and more profitable growth. At the same time, there is still more work to do, and we'll look for additional opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and/or divestitures.
In addition to our portfolio actions, we recently announced a significant initiative to reshape our organization to better align with our Accelerate strategy and ensure we can deliver on the consumer behavior changes that were established or accelerated during the pandemic. We're making meaningful changes to simplify and streamline parts of our structure to bring our functions and capabilities closer to the business. At the same time, we're establishing a new strategy and growth organization focused on advancing our Accelerate strategy with responsibility for areas including M&A, strategy, consumer insights, brand experience, strategic revenue management and our 301 Inc. minority investment arm. 
This change is not simply a cost-cutting exercise. It's allowed us to free up resources to continue to invest in growth-facing capabilities. Our priority areas include digital, data and analytics, e-commerce, SRM and strategy, M&A and other capabilities that are critical to our future success. Overall, we expect these changes to our portfolio and organization will result in stronger, more profitable growth, enabling us to better deliver on the goals of our Accelerate strategy. 
As we turn to fiscal '22, let me reiterate our 3 key priorities that will be critical to our success this year outlined on Slide 12. 
First, we will continue to compete effectively, prioritizing our core markets, global platforms and local gem brands and leveraging our brand building, innovation, strategic capabilities and force for good work to deliver competitive performance. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic cost environment, leveraging our HMM productivity program, SRM pricing actions and other efficiency efforts to address input cost inflation and other cost headwinds. And third, we will execute our portfolio and organization reshaping actions without disrupting our base business. 
We know we must meet consumers where they are and with the products they want to be successful in fiscal '22. Our key initiatives for this year are aligned with our accelerated strategic pillars including continued investment behind bold brand building campaigns. For example, Cheerios is celebrating 80 years of putting heart-healthy oats on millions of breakfast tables every morning by reintroducing its original name and packaging, CheeriOats. The retro limited edition box will be hitting store sales in July, and we'll be asking fans to enter into a contest by sharing their favorite Cheerios memories on social media. Also, our Häagen-Dazs Mix It Up campaign is live across Europe and Asia now, highlighting the combination of contrasting flavors and textures to create an elevated taste experience. Finally, as our Tastefuls cat food line enters its second year, we're making sure pet parents know about a superior taste with an integrated One Taste Is All It Takes campaign. 
We're also investing in exciting and relevant renovation and innovation news for consumers. For example, we're launching new flavors and textures with Häagen-Dazs Twist and Crunch in Asia and Latin America and Nature Valley Soft Baked Muffin Bars in the U.S. We're doubling down on successful losses from last year with new additions to those product lines including new multipacks on Ratio Keto yogurt and kits for Old El Paso Tortilla Pockets in Europe. And increasingly, these initiatives are also weaving in our force for good efforts, including new Annie's compostable Mac ‘n’ Cheese cups, which you can find on shelves today. 
The next few months will be especially critical for our brands as the world transition to a new normal. As consumers reestablish routine, it's important that we deliver solutions for a lunchtime and away from home snacking, leveraging trusted brands like Nature Valley, Gogurt, Dunkaroos and Annie's. 
We will also continue investing in strategic capabilities across our business in fiscal '22 to better enable us to compete, including digital, data and analytics, strategic revenue management, connected commerce and our Holistic Margin Management program. Fiscal '22 is expected to bring the highest level of input cost inflation that we've seen in 10 years. The combination of our HMM productivity program and broad-based SRM initiatives will be required to offset inflation and protect our profitability in fiscal '22, In fact, we've taken SRM actions across the vast majority of our categories and in all of our core markets around the world, leveraging all 4 elements of our SRM toolkit, list pricing, mix management, pack-price architecture changes and promotion optimization. 
In addition, as we see consumers increasingly move online, ramping up our connected commerce efforts with some exciting initiatives coming out this year. For example, our Häagen-Dazs China business, we're expanding on successful connected commerce initiatives that we kicked off in fiscal '21, leveraging digital engagement, our shops network and other omnichannel interactions to strengthen our connections with consumers and accelerate our growth. In our Pet segment, we are launching a new initiative later this year that will allow pet parents to connect with each other and with the BLUE brand in a differential way. and we'll continue to leverage our existing assets, including Box Tops for Education, Pillsbury.com and bettycrocker.com to cultivate a connected ecosystem for consumers online. 
With clear priorities and a strong set of plans, we've outlined goals for fiscal '22 that we expect will represent competitive performance in the context of a changing demand and cost environment. We expect that consumer demand for food at home in fiscal '22 will decline from elevated fiscal '21 levels as more vaccines are distributed, offices and schools reopen and the broader economic recovery continues. Conversely, we expect away-from-home food demand to be above last year but do not expect either at-home or away-from-home demand to return to pre-pandemic levels. And with roughly 85% of our net sales in at-home food occasions, we anticipate these dynamics will result in lower aggregate consumer demand in our categories in fiscal '22. With this demand outlook, we expect organic net sales to decline 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted operating profit to decline 2% to 4% in constant currency, and we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to range between flat and down 2% from the base of $3.79 earned in fiscal '21. And we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings. 
Importantly, when compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '19 levels,, The midpoint of our fiscal '22 guidance ranges equate to 3-year compounded growth rates of approximately 2%, 2% and 5%, respectively, for organic net sales, constant currency adjusted operating and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. This level of top line growth represents a meaningful step-up from our performance in the prior 3 years ending in fiscal '19. 
I want to be very clear, but I am excited about where General Mills is today and where we are headed. We view fiscal '22 as a continuation of the momentum we built in fiscal '21 by making food the world loves and needs. We will emerge a stronger company with exciting opportunities to accelerate growth and create sustainable values for our shareholders. 
With that, I pass it over to Kofi."

I'll be providing more details on our fourth quarter financial performance, starting with our enterprise results on Slide 17. 
Net sales of $4.5 billion were down 10%, including the impact to reported net sales from the 53rd week last year's Q4. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter, reflecting a tough comparison to the 16% organic net sales growth a year ago when we saw the initial surge in pandemic-driven at-home demand as well as the extra month of results in our Pet segment. 
Adjusted operating profit decreased 18% in constant currency, driven primarily by lower net sales and higher input costs, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.91 in the quarter and were down 19% in constant currency, driven by lower adjusted operating profit, partially offset by a lower adjusted effective tax rate. 
Given the unusual nature of last year's fourth quarter, we included a 2-year compound growth rate across these measures, which reflects the comparison against pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '19. On a 2-year compound growth basis, fourth quarter organic net sales were up 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 1% in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% in constant currency. 
Slide 18 summarizes the components of our net sales growth in the fourth quarter. Organic net sales were down 6%, driven by lower organic pound volume. Foreign exchange added 2 points of growth in the quarter and the comparison to the 53rd week last year was a 5-point headwind to net sales. 
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America Retail, Slide 19. Fourth quarter organic net sales decreased 13%, reflecting the comparison against the pandemic-driven surge in consumer demand in Q4 of last year. On a 2-year compound growth basis, fourth quarter organic net sales were up 6%. Fourth quarter constant currency segment operating profit was down 31%, driven by lower net sales and higher input costs, including fixed cost deleverage in the supply chain. For the full year, North America Retail organic net sales were up 4%, including broad-based growth in U.S. Meals & Baking, Canada, U.S. Cereal and U.S. Yogurt. We grew or held market share in roughly 50% of U.S. retail sales, and we drove stronger gains in Canada. 
Fiscal '21 segment operating profit was flat to last year. driven by input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher media and other SG&A expenses, offset by HMM cost savings and higher volume. Segment operating profit margin of 23.9% was 100 basis points out of the pre-pandemic result in fiscal '19. 
Organic net sales for our Pet segment declined 20% in the fourth quarter, driven by the comparison to the extra month of results in last year's Q4, as we aligned the segment to our May fiscal year-end, as well as the comparison against the pandemic-driven stock-up purchases we saw a year ago. As you can see on the chart on Slide 20, Q4 of fiscal '20 was a significant outlier in terms of net sales. And except for that quarter, net sales for our pet segment have generally been on a strong upward trend. Importantly, retail sales for BLUE in the fourth quarter were up mid-teens in measured channels, reflecting the underlying strength of our business. On the bottom line, the Pet segment's fourth quarter operating profit declined 24%, driven by lower volume and higher input costs, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and positive price mix. 
For the full year, Pet's organic sales were up 2%, driven by the comparison to the extra month of results in fiscal '20. On a 2-year compound growth basis, Pet segment organic net sales were up 10%. In fiscal '21, BLUE generated double-digit retail sales growth and grew market share in measured channels. The brand will grow further household penetration gains and increased pet parent awareness with our omnichannel growth model. Full year operating profit for the Pet segment was up 6%, primarily driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher input costs. Segment operating profit margin was up 100 basis points to 24% of net sales. 
Turning to Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment results on Slide 21. Fourth quarter organic net sales grew 33%, primarily driven by the comparison to significantly reduced away-from-home food demand a year ago. We have seen sequential improvement in consumer traffic to away-from-home food channels, including schools, restaurants and lodging throughout fiscal '21. On a 2-year compound growth basis, Q4 organic net sales declined 3%. Fourth quarter segment operating profit increased 143% in the quarter, driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses. Over the full year, Convenience Stores & Foodservice organic net sales declined 3%, driven by reduced demand in away-from-home food channels amid the pandemic. Segment operating profit was down 9%, primarily driven by lower net sales and higher input costs, partly offset by lower SG&A expenses. 
In Europe and Australia, fourth quarter organic net sales declined 2%, driven by the comparison to pandemic-driven increased at-home food demand a year ago. On a 2-year compound growth basis, Fourth quarter organic net sales grew 1%. Fourth quarter segment operating profit decreased 16% in constant currency, driven by higher input costs and lower net sales partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. For the full year, organic net sales increased 3%, primarily driven by Old El Paso Mexican food and Häagen-Dazs ice cream. We competed effectively in fiscal '21, growing market share in ice cream and snack bars. And full year segment operating profit increased 24%, primarily driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by higher input costs. 
In Asia and Latin America, organic net sales grew 22% in the fourth quarter due to pandemic-driven at-home food demand in Latin America and improved away-from-home demand in Asia, driving strong growth in Häagen-Dazs shops. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales increased 7% in the fourth quarter. Segment operating profit totaled $23 million compared to a loss of $24 million a year ago, driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher input costs. Full year organic net sales were up 15% in fiscal '21. 
Net sales growth was broad-based, including double-digit growth in Latin America, driven by strong at-home demand for Yoki meals and snacks and Kitano seasonings in Brazil amid the pandemic. Net sales were also up double digits in Asia in the full year, led by China and India with notable growth for Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Betty Crocker dessert mixes. Full year segment operating profit was up $67 million to $86 million, primarily driven by higher net sales and favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by higher input costs. 
Slide 24 summarizes our joint venture results. In the fourth quarter, constant currency net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were down 2%, reflecting the comparison to elevated pandemic-driven demand a year ago. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 12% in constant currency in the quarter, driven by successful new product launches and strong growth on the core. For the full year, CPW constant currency net sales were up 5%, driven by broad-based volume growth led by Brazil, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by positive category trends and strong new product offerings. Fiscal '21 combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 29% and to $118 million, driven by net sales growth for both CPW and Häagen-Dazs Japan. 
Turning to total company margin results. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin were roughly in line with our expectations at down 160 basis points and down 140 basis points, respectively, driven primarily by fixed cost deleverage in the supply chain as we compare against significant volume leverage a year ago during the initial surge in pandemic-related demand. For the full year, adjusted gross margin decreased 40 basis points, primarily driven by input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs partially offset by HMM cost savings and fixed cost bridge in the supply chain. Fiscal '21 adjusted operating profit margin increased 10 basis points, driven by favorable price/mix and lower admin expenses, partially offset by higher input costs. 
Slide 26 summarizes other noteworthy Q4 income statement items. Unallocated corporate expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparable decreased $53 million in the quarter, driven by lower compensation and benefits expenses. Fourth quarter net interest expense decreased $16 million from a year ago, driven by lower rates and lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5% compared to 19.1% a year ago, primarily driven by certain nonrecurring discrete tax benefits. And average diluted shares outstanding were flat in the quarter, with our share repurchase activity offsetting the impact of option exercises. 
Our full year fiscal '21 results are summarized on Slide 27. Net sales of $18.1 billion were up 3% driven by higher organic net sales and 1 point of favorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by a 2-point headwind from the extra week of results in last year's fourth quarter. Organic net sales increased 4%, reflecting strong execution and broad-based market share gains amid elevated at-home food demand. Full year adjusted operating profit of $3.2 billion increased 2% in constant currency, primarily driven by higher constant currency adjusted gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, including increased investment in media and capabilities. Fiscal '21 adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $3.79 and grew 4% in constant currency, driven by higher adjusted operating profit, lower net interest expense and higher after-tax earnings from joint ventures, partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate and higher average diluted shares outstanding. 
On a 2-year compound growth basis, relative to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '19, organic net sales were up 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4% in constant currency and adjusted diluted EPS grew 8% in constant currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Full year operating cash flow totaled $3 billion, down 19% from last year, primarily driven by a change in current assets and liabilities, partially offset by a change in deferred income taxes and an increase in net earnings. As a reminder, operating cash flow in fiscal '20 included timing benefits related to pandemic-driven volume increases in last year's fourth quarter, which we expected to unwind in fiscal '21. Relative to fiscal '19's pre-pandemic results, fiscal '21 operating cash flow was up 6%. 
Our core working capital balance increased 6% from a year ago, driven by an increase in inventory balances, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Capital investments of $531 million increased $70 million from a year ago, including higher spending on growth capital. Full year free cash flow totaled $2.4 billion, and free cash flow conversion was 103% for the year. 
Total cash returned to shareholders increased 29% to $1.5 billion, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $301 million in share repurchases. As Jeff said earlier, we ended the year with a leverage ratio of 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to our expectations for fiscal '22. We've outlined our key top line assumptions on Slide 29. One of the largest factors impacting our performance this year will be the relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home demand as consumers adjust to the new normal. As Jeff mentioned, we continue to expect to compete effectively in fiscal '22 within the context of this evolving demand picture. While the environment remains highly uncertain, provided our current assumptions for consumer demand across our key business segments. We expect our North America Retail and Europe and Australia segments will see headwinds from lower consumer demand for food at home relative to fiscal '21 though we expect that demand will remain above pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, we expect our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment to benefit from increased demand for away from home food relative to fiscal '21 though we don't expect demand to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. 
Finally, we anticipate demand for our Pet and Asia and Latin America segment will be up in fiscal '22 on top of growth in the prior year. In aggregate, that translates into consumer demand headwinds across roughly 70% of our net sales base with tailwinds in the remaining 30% of our net sales. 
Slide 23 summarizes our other key financial assumptions in fiscal '22. On adjusted operating profit, we expect headwinds, including input cost inflation lower volumes, supply chain deleverage and continued growth investments in our global capabilities. Our current assumption for input cost inflation across our total cost of goods sold is approximately 7%. This includes logistics costs up double digits, raw and packaging materials up high single digits and manufacturing costs up low single digits. 
We are currently covered on roughly half of our raw and packaging material requirements for fiscal '22. On the other hand, we expect tailwinds to adjusted operating profit will include HMM cost savings of roughly 4% cost of goods sold, positive price/mix from our SRM actions, lower administrative expenses, reflecting our streamlined organizational structure and a reduction in COVID-related expenses, including external manufacturing, health and safety costs. While these items reflect our current assumption, it is important to acknowledge that this is a highly dynamic environment, and we'll make to stay close to the cost picture and ensure we're taking appropriate actions based on how the situation evolves over the course of the year. 
From a phasing standpoint, we expect adjusted operating profit to be down in the first half of our fiscal '22 and up in the second half due to the comparison to the prior year. which saw notably higher adjusted operating profit in the first half and due to the timing of net price realization relative to inflation. Remember that we posted a first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 19.1% in fiscal '21, which was nearly 200 basis points ahead of our full year results, driven by elevated demand and supply chain leverage. Largely due to this difficult comparison, we expect constant currency adjusted operating profit to be down double digits in the first quarter of fiscal '22. 
Looking below operating profit, we expect net interest expense to total approximately $370 million. We anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, and we expect to reduce our average diluted shares outstanding by 1% in fiscal '22. Finally, we expect to fund capital investments of approximately 3.5% of net sales. 
Based on these assumptions, Slide 31 reiterates the fiscal '22 outlook that Jeff shared earlier. I'll note that this book does not include any impact from the proposed Yoplait Europe divestiture and or the Tyson pet treats acquisition since those transactions have yet to close. 
Let me close with a few thoughts. The General Mills team has risen to the challenges presented by the pandemic, making food the world loves and needs. We achieved our fiscal '21 priorities, and we're back to fully leveraging all of our capital allocation tools including dividend growth, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. And as we look ahead, we expect to emerge from the pandemic a stronger company, well positioned to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value as we execute our Accelerate strategy.

During today's presentation, I will provide a summary of our fourth quarter and full year performance, share how we are reshaping our portfolio and organizational structure to drive stronger and more profitable growth and outline our priorities and guidance for fiscal '22. Then Kofi will walk through our fiscal '21 financial performance in more detail as well as provide some color on the assumptions that frame our expectations for fiscal '22. 
Let's begin with today's key messages on Slide 4. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have seen dramatic changes in consumer behavior. These changes, including how we shop, where we eat and work, how often we travel and more, have required us to adapt. Throughout this time, we focus on what is most important, prioritizing the health and safety of our people and our consumers above all else. I'm proud of our team's focus and perseverance not only to deliver for our consumers and our communities but also to achieve our fiscal '21 priorities. 
Now as we emerge from the pandemic, it's clear that consumer behaviors are not returning to what they once were. The rapid growth in e-commerce, the likelihood that many office workers will have some degree of remote work and the increased appreciation consumers have gained for cooking and baking over the past 18 months will have lasting impacts and will create opportunity. Simply put, we are ending 1 period of significant consumer disruption only to start another. 
As we look ahead to our fiscal '22, we will continue to execute our Accelerate strategy, focusing on 3 priorities that will be critical to our success: continuing to compete effectively, successfully navigating the dynamic cost environment and executing our portfolio and organizational reshaping efforts without disruption. 
Slide 5 summarizes our headline financial performance metrics for fiscal 2021. We delivered strong performance for the full year, including 4% organic net sales growth, 2% constant currency growth and adjusted operating profit and 4% growth in adjusted diluted EPS in constant currency, driven by our ability to meet the strong demand for food at home, find new solutions for our away-from-home customers and outperform our competition. 
Our fourth quarter results were slightly ahead of our expectations, though down versus last year's unprecedented fourth quarter that included the initial surge in at-home food demand, the 53rd week for our legacy segments and an extra month of results for our Pet segment. Relative to fiscal '19 fourth quarter, which did not have the same unusual comparisons, our 2-year compound growth was up 4% on organic net sales, up 1% on constant currency adjusted operating profit and up 4% on constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. It is absolutely clear from these results that General Mills will exit the pandemic a stronger company than we entered it. I am extremely proud of our team for their tireless work in making that happen. 
Looking back at the year, we accomplished what we set out to do, competing effectively everywhere we play, driving efficiency to fuel investments in our brands and capabilities and reducing our debt leverage. Our consistent focus on these priorities shaped our decisions throughout the year and were instrumental in driving our financial performance. Let me share briefly a few highlights of our fiscal '21 performance on each of these priorities. 
As we outlined back in February, one of the focus areas of our Accelerate strategy is to win in our 8 core markets and 5 global platforms where we believe our competitive advantages will drive differential growth. Our efforts in these areas are paying off. We delivered broad-based net sales growth in fiscal '21 in our largest markets, including the U.S., Canada, France, the U.K., China and Brazil. We gained market share in all 5 of our global platforms including our fourth consecutive year of share growth in the U.S. cereal, good gains in snack bars, pet food and ice cream and more than 1 point of share growth for Old El Paso Mexican food. And relative to the pre-pandemic period, we've grown household penetration and increased repeat rates across 7 of our top 10 U.S. categories. This gives us confidence that as consumers transition to their new normal, they will continue to seek out the General Mills brands they know and trust. 
We also successfully achieved our second priority, which was to drive efficiency to fuel investments in our brands and capabilities. We delivered another strong year of Holistic Margin Management productivity savings at 4% of cost of goods sold, which enabled us to increase brand-building investments even as we dealt with higher costs to service elevated demand. In fact, we increased our media investment at an 11% compounded rate over the past 2 years, including strong support for differentiated campaigns on brands such as Cheerios, Nature Valley, Old El Paso, BLUE, Haagen-Dazs, Pillsbury and many more. 
We also continue investing in strategic capabilities that will be critical to our future success, including digital, data and analytics, e-commerce, HMM and strategic revenue management. These investments are already paying off as evidenced by our continued outperformance in e-commerce, which now makes up 11% of our worldwide net sales. Our e-commerce net sales were up 45% in fiscal '21, and we continue to see our brands holding higher market shares online than in brick-and-mortar outlets. 
Finally, our strong financial discipline allowed us to further reduce our leverage to 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal '21. With our balance sheet in a solid position, we were able to activate each of our long-term capital allocation priorities during fiscal '21, including: continuing healthy levels of capital investment in the business to fuel growth and drive HMM cost savings; increasing our quarterly dividend rate by 4% per share in the second quarter; announcing in May, the acquisition of the Tyson pet treats business, which will be our first acquisition since the addition of Blue Buffalo in fiscal '18; and resuming share repurchase activity by buying back $301 million of stock in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we'll continue to use our balance sheet as a strategic asset by investing to improve our growth profile while returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In addition to delivering on our key priorities in fiscal '21, we also announced a few important actions that will be critical to enhancing our future growth in line with our Accelerate strategy. They include 2 portfolio reshaping transactions that will enhance the growth and margin profile of our enterprise. 
First, as we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we entered into a memorandum of understanding in March to sell our interest in our European Yoplait operations to Sodiaal, a leading French dairy cooperative and our current joint venture partner in the business, in exchange for full ownership of Yoplait Canada, and a reduced royalty on our North American yogurt licenses. The work on this proposed transaction is going as planned, and we remain on track to sign a definitive agreement and close the sale by the end of calendar 2021.
More recently, in May, we reached an agreement to acquire Tyson's pet treat business, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. The Tyson portfolio, which includes the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands is the leader in natural meat treats and is highly complementary to our existing pet treat portfolio under the BLUE brand. Annual net sales for the Tyson pet treat business totaled more than $240 million and have grown at nearly a 20% compound rate over the past 3 years. We see significant opportunities to drive future growth by expanding awareness and availability of these products, and we expect to unlock production and other cost synergies with the rest of our Pet business, all of which will result in substantial value creation. We have now cleared nearly all of the key closing conditions for this transaction, including HSR review, so we expect the deal to close shortly. 
These 2 transactions represent significant steps in our effort to reshape our portfolio to drive faster and more profitable growth. At the same time, there is still more work to do, and we'll look for additional opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and/or divestitures.
In addition to our portfolio actions, we recently announced a significant initiative to reshape our organization to better align with our Accelerate strategy and ensure we can deliver on the consumer behavior changes that were established or accelerated during the pandemic. We're making meaningful changes to simplify and streamline parts of our structure to bring our functions and capabilities closer to the business. At the same time, we're establishing a new strategy and growth organization focused on advancing our Accelerate strategy with responsibility for areas including M&A, strategy, consumer insights, brand experience, strategic revenue management and our 301 Inc. minority investment arm. This change is not simply a cost-cutting exercise. It's allowing us to free up resources to continue to invest in growth-facing capabilities. Our priority areas include digital, data and analytics, e-commerce, SRM, strategy, M&A and other capabilities that are critical to our future success. Overall, we expect these changes to our portfolio and organization will result in stronger, more profitable growth, enabling us to better deliver on the goals of our Accelerate strategy. 
As we turn to fiscal '22, let me reiterate our 3 key priorities that will be critical to our success this year outlined on Slide 12. First, we will continue to compete effectively, prioritizing our core markets, global platforms and local gem brands and leveraging our brand building, innovation, strategic capabilities and force for good work to deliver competitive performance. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic cost environment, leveraging our HMM productivity program, SRM pricing actions and other efficiency efforts to address input cost inflation and other cost headwinds. And third, we will execute our portfolio and organization reshaping actions without disrupting our base business. 
We know we must meet consumers where they are and with the products they want to be successful in fiscal '22. Our key initiatives for this year are aligned with our accelerated strategic pillars, including continued investment behind bold, brand-building campaigns. For example, Cheerios is celebrating 80 years of putting heart-healthy oats on millions of breakfast tables every morning by reintroducing its original name and packaging, Cheerioats. The retro, limited-edition box will be hitting store sales in July, and we'll be asking fans to enter into a contest by sharing their favorite Cheerios memories on social media. Also, our Haagen-Dazs Mix It Up campaign is live across Europe and Asia now, highlighting the combination of contrasting flavors and textures to create an elevated taste experience. Finally, as our Tastefuls cat food line enters its second year, we're making sure pet parents know about a superior taste with an integrated One Taste Is All It Takes campaign. 
We're also investing in exciting and relevant renovation and innovation news for consumers. For example, we're launching new flavors and textures with Haagen-Dazs Twist and Crunch in Asia and Latin America and Nature Valley Soft Baked Muffin Bars in the U.S. We're doubling down on successful losses from last year with new additions to those product lines including new multipacks on :ratio keto yogurt and kits for Old El Paso Tortilla Pockets in Europe. And increasingly, these initiatives are also weaving in our force for good efforts, including new Annie's compostable mac and cheese cups, which you can find on shelves today. 
The next few months will be especially critical for our brands as the world transition to a new normal. As consumers reestablish routine, it's important that we deliver solutions for a lunchtime and away-from-home snacking, leveraging trusted brands like Nature Valley, Gogurt, Dunkaroos and Annie's. 
We will also continue investing in strategic capabilities across our business in fiscal '22 to better enable us to compete, including digital, data and analytics, strategic revenue management, connected commerce and our Holistic Margin Management program. Fiscal '22 is expected to bring the highest level of input cost inflation that we've seen in 10 years. The combination of our HMM productivity program and broad-based SRM initiatives will be required to offset this level of inflation and protect our profitability in fiscal '22, In fact, we've taken SRM actions across the vast majority of our categories and in all of our core markets around the world, leveraging all 4 elements of our SRM toolkit, list pricing, mix management, pack price architecture changes and promotion optimization. 
In addition, as we see consumers increasingly move online, we are ramping up our connected commerce efforts with some exciting initiatives coming out this year. For example, our Haagen-Dazs China business, we're expanding on successful connected commerce initiatives that we kicked off in fiscal '21, leveraging digital engagement, our shops network and other omnichannel interactions to strengthen our connections with consumers and accelerate our growth. 
In our Pet segment, we are launching a new initiative later this year that will allow pet parents to connect with each other and with the BLUE brand in a differential way, and we'll continue to leverage our existing assets, including Box Tops for Education, Pillsbury.com and bettycrocker.com to cultivate a connected ecosystem for consumers online. 
With clear priorities and a strong set of plans, we've outlined goals for fiscal '22 that we expect will represent competitive performance in the context of a changing demand and cost environment. We expect that consumer demand for food at home in fiscal '22 will decline from elevated fiscal '21 levels as more vaccines are distributed, offices and schools reopen and the broader economic recovery continues. Conversely, we expect away-from-home food demand to be above last year, but we do not expect either at-home or away-from-home demand to return to pre-pandemic levels. And with roughly 85% of our net sales in at-home food occasions, we anticipate these dynamics will result in lower aggregate consumer demand in our categories in fiscal '22. With this demand outlook, we expect organic net sales to decline 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted operating profit to decline 2% to 4% in constant currency, and we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to range between flat and down 2% from the base of $3.79 earned in fiscal '21. And we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings. 
Importantly, when compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '19 levels, the midpoints of our fiscal '22 guidance ranges equate to 3-year compounded growth rates of approximately 2%, 2% and 5%, respectively, for organic net sales, constant currency adjusted operating and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. This level of top line growth represents a meaningful step-up from our performance in the prior 3 years ending in fiscal '19. 
I want to be very clear, but I am excited about where General Mills is today and where we are headed. We view fiscal '22 as a continuation of the momentum we built in fiscal '21 by making food the world loves and needs. We will emerge a stronger company with exciting opportunities to accelerate growth and create sustainable values for our shareholders. 
With that, I pass it over to Kofi."

I'll be providing more details on our fourth quarter financial performance, starting with our enterprise results on Slide 17. 
Net sales of $4.5 billion were down 10%, including the impact to reported net sales from the 53rd week last year's Q4. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter, reflecting a tough comparison to the 16% organic net sales growth a year ago when we saw the initial surge in pandemic-driven at-home demand as well as the extra month of results in our Pet segment. 
Adjusted operating profit decreased 18% in constant currency driven primarily by lower net sales and higher input costs partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.91 in the quarter and were down 19% in constant currency driven by lower adjusted operating profit partially offset by a lower adjusted effective tax rate. 
Given the unusual nature of last year's fourth quarter, we've also included a 2-year compound growth rate across these measures, which reflects the comparison against pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '19. On a 2-year compound growth basis, fourth quarter organic net sales were up 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 1% in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% in constant currency. 
Slide 18 summarizes the components of our net sales growth in the fourth quarter. Organic net sales were down 6% driven by lower organic pound volume. Foreign exchange added 2 points of growth in the quarter and the comparison to the 53rd week last year was a 5-point headwind to net sales. 
Now let's turn to segment results beginning with North America Retail on Slide 19. Fourth quarter organic net sales decreased 13%, reflecting the comparison against the pandemic-driven surge in consumer demand in Q4 of last year. On a 2-year compound growth basis, fourth quarter organic net sales were up 6%. Fourth quarter constant currency segment operating profit was down 31% driven by lower net sales and higher input costs, including fixed cost deleverage in the supply chain. For the full year, North America Retail organic net sales were up 4%, including broad-based growth in U.S. Meals & Baking, Canada, U.S. Cereal and U.S. Yogurt. We grew or held market share in roughly 50% of U.S. retail sales, and we drove stronger gains in Canada. 
Fiscal '21 segment operating profit was flat to last year driven by input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher media and other SG&A expenses, offset by HMM cost savings and higher volume. Segment operating profit margin of 23.9% was 100 basis points ahead of the pre-pandemic result in fiscal '19. 
Organic net sales for our Pet segment declined 20% in the fourth quarter driven by the comparison to the extra month of results in last year's Q4 as we aligned the segment to our May fiscal year-end as well as the comparison against the pandemic-driven stock-up purchases we saw a year ago. As you can see on the chart on Slide 20, Q4 of fiscal '20 was a significant outlier in terms of net sales. And except for that quarter, net sales for our Pet segment have generally been on a strong upward trend. Importantly, retail sales for BLUE in the fourth quarter were up mid-teens in measured channels, reflecting the underlying strength of our business. On the bottom line, the Pet segment's fourth quarter operating profit declined 24% driven by lower volume and higher input costs partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and positive price mix. 
For the full year, Pet's organic sales were up 2% driven by the comparison to the extra month of results in fiscal '20. On a 2-year compound growth basis, Pet segment organic net sales were up 10%. In fiscal '21, BLUE generated double-digit retail sales growth and grew market share in measured channels. The brand also drove further household penetration gains and increased pet parent awareness with our omnichannel growth model. Full year operating profit for the Pet segment was up 6% primarily driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by higher input costs. Segment operating profit margin was up 100 basis points to 24% of net sales. 
Turning to Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment results on Slide 21. Fourth quarter organic net sales grew 33% primarily driven by the comparison to significantly reduced away-from-home food demand a year ago. We have seen sequential improvement in consumer traffic to away-from-home food channels, including schools, restaurants and lodging throughout fiscal '21. On a 2-year compound growth basis, Q4 organic net sales declined 3%. Fourth quarter segment operating profit increased 143% in the quarter driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses. For the full year, Convenience Stores & Foodservice organic net sales declined 3% driven by reduced demand in away-from-home food channels amid the pandemic. Segment operating profit was down 9% primarily driven by lower net sales and higher input costs, partly offset by lower SG&A expenses. 
In Europe and Australia, fourth quarter organic net sales declined 2% driven by the comparison to pandemic-driven increased at-home food demand a year ago. On a 2-year compound growth basis, fourth quarter organic net sales grew 1%. Fourth quarter segment operating profit decreased 16% in constant currency driven by higher input costs and lower net sales partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. For the full year, organic net sales increased 3% primarily driven by Old El Paso Mexican food and Haagen-Dazs ice cream. We competed effectively in fiscal '21, growing market share in ice cream and snack bars. And full year segment operating profit increased 24% primarily driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by higher input costs. 
In Asia and Latin America, organic net sales grew 22% in the fourth quarter due to pandemic-driven at-home food demand in Latin America and improved away-from-home demand in Asia, driving strong growth in Haagen-Dazs shops. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales increased 7% in the fourth quarter. Segment operating profit totaled $23 million compared to a loss of $24 million a year ago driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by higher input costs. Full year organic net sales were up 15% in fiscal '21. 
Net sales growth was broad-based, including double-digit growth in Latin America driven by strong at-home demand for Yoki meals and snacks and Kitano seasonings in Brazil amid the pandemic. Net sales were also up double digits in Asia in the full year, led by China and India with notable growth for Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Betty Crocker dessert mixes. Full year segment operating profit was up $67 million to $86 million primarily driven by higher net sales and favorable foreign currency exchange partially offset by higher input costs. 
Slide 24 summarizes our joint venture results. In the fourth quarter, constant currency net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were down 2%, reflecting the comparison to elevated pandemic-driven demand a year ago. Haagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 12% in constant currency in the quarter driven by successful new product launches and strong growth on the core. For the full year, CPW constant currency net sales were up 5% driven by broad-based volume growth led by Brazil, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Haagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 6% in constant currency primarily driven by positive category trends and strong new product offerings. Fiscal '21 combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 29% and to $118 million driven by net sales growth for both CPW and Haagen-Dazs Japan. 
Turning to total company margin results. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin were roughly in line with our expectations at down 160 basis points and down 140 basis points, respectively, driven primarily by fixed cost deleverage in the supply chain as we compared against significant volume leverage a year ago during the initial surge in pandemic-related demand. For the full year, adjusted gross margin decreased 40 basis points primarily driven by input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs partially offset by HMM cost savings and fixed cost leverage in the supply chain. Fiscal '21 adjusted operating profit margin increased 10 basis points driven by favorable price/mix and lower admin expenses partially offset by higher input costs. 
Slide 26 summarizes other noteworthy Q4 income statement items. Unallocated corporate expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability decreased $53 million in the quarter driven by lower compensation and benefits expenses. Fourth quarter net interest expense decreased $16 million from a year ago driven by lower rates and lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5% compared to 19.1% a year ago primarily driven by certain nonrecurring discrete tax benefits. And average diluted shares outstanding were flat in the quarter, with our share repurchase activity offsetting the impact of option exercises. 
Our full year fiscal '21 results are summarized on Slide 27. Net sales of $18.1 billion were up 3% driven by higher organic net sales and 1 point of favorable foreign currency exchange partially offset by a 2-point headwind from the extra week of results in last year's fourth quarter. Organic net sales increased 4%, reflecting strong execution and broad-based market share gains amid elevated at-home food demand. Full year adjusted operating profit of $3.2 billion increased 2% in constant currency primarily driven by higher constant currency adjusted gross profit dollars partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, including increased investment in media and capabilities. Fiscal '21 adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $3.79 and grew 4% in constant currency driven by higher adjusted operating profit, lower net interest expense and higher after-tax earnings from joint ventures partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate and higher average diluted shares outstanding. 
On a 2-year compound growth basis, relative to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '19, organic net sales were up 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4% in constant currency and adjusted diluted EPS grew 8% in constant currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Full year operating cash flow totaled $3 billion, down 19% from last year primarily driven by a change in current assets and liabilities partially offset by a change in deferred income taxes and an increase in net earnings. As a reminder, operating cash flow in fiscal '20 included timing benefits related to pandemic-driven volume increases in last year's fourth quarter, which we expected to unwind in fiscal '21. Relative to fiscal '19's pre-pandemic results, fiscal '21 operating cash flow was up 6%. 
Our core working capital balance increased 6% from a year ago driven by an increase in inventory balances partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Capital investments of $531 million increased $70 million from a year ago, including higher spending on growth capital. Full year free cash flow totaled $2.4 billion and free cash flow conversion was 103% for the year. 
Total cash returned to shareholders increased 29% to $1.5 billion, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $301 million in share repurchases. As Jeff said earlier, we ended the year with a leverage ratio of 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to our expectations for fiscal '22. We've outlined our key top line assumptions on Slide 29. One of the largest factors impacting our performance this year will be the relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home demand as consumers adjust to the new normal. As Jeff mentioned, we continue to expect to compete effectively in fiscal '22 within the context of this evolving demand picture. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we've provided our current assumptions for consumer demand across our key business segments. We expect our North America Retail and Europe and Australia segments will see headwinds from lower consumer demand for food at home relative to fiscal '21, though we expect that demand will remain above pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, we expect our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment to benefit from increased demand for away-from-home food relative to fiscal '21, though we don't expect demand to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. 
Finally, we anticipate demand for our Pet and Asia and Latin America segments will be up in fiscal '22 on top of growth in the prior year. In aggregate, that translates into consumer demand headwinds across roughly 70% of our net sales base with tailwinds on the remaining 30% of our net sales. 
Slide 23 summarizes our other key financial assumptions in fiscal '22. On adjusted operating profit, we expect headwinds, including input cost inflation, lower volumes, supply chain deleverage and continued growth investments in our global capabilities. Our current assumption for input cost inflation across our total cost of goods sold is approximately 7%. This includes logistics costs up double digits, raw and packaging materials up high single digits and manufacturing costs up low single digits. 
We are currently covered on roughly half of our raw and packaging material requirements for fiscal '22. On the other hand, we expect tailwinds to adjusted operating profit will include: HMM cost savings of roughly 4% cost of goods sold; positive price/mix from our SRM actions; lower administrative expenses, reflecting our streamlined organizational structure; and a reduction in COVID-related expenses, including external manufacturing, health and safety costs. While these items reflect our current assumption, it is important to acknowledge that this is a highly dynamic environment, and we'll need to stay close to the cost picture and ensure we're taking appropriate actions based on how the situation evolves over the course of the year. 
From a phasing standpoint, we expect adjusted operating profit to be down in the first half of our fiscal '22 and up in the second half due to the comparison to the prior year, which saw notably higher adjusted operating profit in the first half and due to the timing of net price realization relative to inflation. Remember that we posted a first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 19.1% in fiscal '21, which was nearly 200 basis points ahead of our full year results driven by elevated demand and supply chain leverage. Largely due to this difficult comparison, we expect constant currency adjusted operating profit to be down double digits in the first quarter of fiscal '22. 
Looking below operating profit, we expect net interest expense to total approximately $370 million. We anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, and we expect to reduce our average diluted shares outstanding by 1% in fiscal '22. Finally, we expect to fund capital investments of approximately 3.5% of net sales. 
Based on these assumptions, Slide 31 reiterates the fiscal '22 outlook that Jeff shared earlier. I'll note that this outlook does not include any impact from the proposed Yoplait Europe divestiture or the Tyson pet treats acquisition since those transactions have yet to close. 
Let me close with a few thoughts. The General Mills team has risen to the challenges presented by the pandemic, making food the world loves and needs. We achieved our fiscal '21 priorities, and we're back to fully leveraging all of our capital allocation tools including dividend growth, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. And as we look ahead, we expect to emerge from the pandemic a stronger company, well positioned to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value as we execute our Accelerate strategy.

During today's presentation, I will provide a summary of our fourth quarter and full year performance, share how we are reshaping our portfolio and organizational structure to drive stronger and more profitable growth and outline our priorities and guidance for fiscal '22. Then Kofi will walk through our fiscal '21 financial performance in more detail as well as provide some color on the assumptions that frame our expectations for fiscal '22. 
Let's begin with today's key messages on Slide 4. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have seen dramatic changes in consumer behavior. These changes, including how we shop, where we eat and work, how often we travel and more, have required us to adapt. Throughout this time, we focus on what is most important, prioritizing the health and safety of our people and our consumers above all else. I'm proud of our team's focus and perseverance not only to deliver for our consumers and our communities but also to achieve our fiscal '21 priorities. 
Now as we emerge from the pandemic, it's clear that consumer behaviors are not returning to what they once were. The rapid growth in e-commerce, the likelihood that many office workers will have some degree of remote work and the increased appreciation consumers have gained for cooking and baking over the past 18 months will have lasting impacts and will create opportunity. Simply put, we are ending 1 period of significant consumer disruption only to start another. 
As we look ahead to our fiscal '22, we will continue to execute our Accelerate strategy, focusing on 3 priorities that will be critical to our success: continuing to compete effectively, successfully navigating the dynamic cost environment and executing our portfolio and organizational reshaping efforts without disruption. 
Slide 5 summarizes our headline financial performance metrics for fiscal 2021. We delivered strong performance for the full year, including 4% organic net sales growth, 2% constant currency growth and adjusted operating profit and 4% growth in adjusted diluted EPS in constant currency, driven by our ability to meet the strong demand for food at home, find new solutions for our away-from-home customers and outperform our competition. 
Our fourth quarter results were slightly ahead of our expectations, though down versus last year's unprecedented fourth quarter that included the initial surge in at-home food demand, the 53rd week for our legacy segments and an extra month of results for our Pet segment. Relative to fiscal '19 fourth quarter, which did not have the same unusual comparisons, our 2-year compound growth was up 4% on organic net sales, up 1% on constant currency adjusted operating profit and up 4% on constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. It is absolutely clear from these results that General Mills will exit the pandemic a stronger company than we entered it. I am extremely proud of our team for their tireless work in making that happen. 
Looking back at the year, we accomplished what we set out to do, competing effectively everywhere we play, driving efficiency to fuel investments in our brands and capabilities and reducing our debt leverage. Our consistent focus on these priorities shaped our decisions throughout the year and were instrumental in driving our financial performance. Let me share briefly a few highlights of our fiscal '21 performance on each of these priorities. 
As we outlined back in February, one of the focus areas of our Accelerate strategy is to win in our 8 core markets and 5 global platforms where we believe our competitive advantages will drive differential growth. Our efforts in these areas are paying off. We delivered broad-based net sales growth in fiscal '21 in our largest markets, including the U.S., Canada, France, the U.K., China and Brazil. We gained market share in all 5 of our global platforms including our fourth consecutive year of share growth in the U.S. cereal, good gains in snack bars, pet food and ice cream and more than 1 point of share growth for Old El Paso Mexican food. And relative to the pre-pandemic period, we've grown household penetration and increased repeat rates across 7 of our top 10 U.S. categories. This gives us confidence that as consumers transition to their new normal, they will continue to seek out the General Mills brands they know and trust. 
We also successfully achieved our second priority, which was to drive efficiency to fuel investments in our brands and capabilities. We delivered another strong year of Holistic Margin Management productivity savings at 4% of cost of goods sold, which enabled us to increase brand-building investments even as we dealt with higher costs to service elevated demand. In fact, we increased our media investment at an 11% compounded rate over the past 2 years, including strong support for differentiated campaigns on brands such as Cheerios, Nature Valley, Old El Paso, BLUE, Haagen-Dazs, Pillsbury and many more. 
We also continue investing in strategic capabilities that will be critical to our future success, including digital, data and analytics, e-commerce, HMM and strategic revenue management. These investments are already paying off as evidenced by our continued outperformance in e-commerce, which now makes up 11% of our worldwide net sales. Our e-commerce net sales were up 45% in fiscal '21, and we continue to see our brands holding higher market shares online than in brick-and-mortar outlets. 
Finally, our strong financial discipline allowed us to further reduce our leverage to 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal '21. With our balance sheet in a solid position, we were able to activate each of our long-term capital allocation priorities during fiscal '21, including: continuing healthy levels of capital investment in the business to fuel growth and drive HMM cost savings; increasing our quarterly dividend rate by 4% per share in the second quarter; announcing in May, the acquisition of the Tyson pet treats business, which will be our first acquisition since the addition of Blue Buffalo in fiscal '18; and resuming share repurchase activity by buying back $301 million of stock in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we'll continue to use our balance sheet as a strategic asset by investing to improve our growth profile while returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
In addition to delivering on our key priorities in fiscal '21, we also announced a few important actions that will be critical to enhancing our future growth in line with our Accelerate strategy. They include 2 portfolio reshaping transactions that will enhance the growth and margin profile of our enterprise. 
First, as we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we entered into a memorandum of understanding in March to sell our interest in our European Yoplait operations to Sodiaal, a leading French dairy cooperative and our current joint venture partner in the business, in exchange for full ownership of Yoplait Canada, and a reduced royalty on our North American yogurt licenses. The work on this proposed transaction is going as planned, and we remain on track to sign a definitive agreement and close the sale by the end of calendar 2021.
More recently, in May, we reached an agreement to acquire Tyson's pet treat business, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. The Tyson portfolio, which includes the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands is the leader in natural meat treats and is highly complementary to our existing pet treat portfolio under the BLUE brand. Annual net sales for the Tyson pet treat business totaled more than $240 million and have grown at nearly a 20% compound rate over the past 3 years. We see significant opportunities to drive future growth by expanding awareness and availability of these products, and we expect to unlock production and other cost synergies with the rest of our Pet business, all of which will result in substantial value creation. We have now cleared nearly all of the key closing conditions for this transaction, including HSR review, so we expect the deal to close shortly. 
These 2 transactions represent significant steps in our effort to reshape our portfolio to drive faster and more profitable growth. At the same time, there is still more work to do, and we'll look for additional opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and/or divestitures.
In addition to our portfolio actions, we recently announced a significant initiative to reshape our organization to better align with our Accelerate strategy and ensure we can deliver on the consumer behavior changes that were established or accelerated during the pandemic. We're making meaningful changes to simplify and streamline parts of our structure to bring our functions and capabilities closer to the business. At the same time, we're establishing a new strategy and growth organization focused on advancing our Accelerate strategy with responsibility for areas including M&A, strategy, consumer insights, brand experience, strategic revenue management and our 301 Inc. minority investment arm. This change is not simply a cost-cutting exercise. It's allowing us to free up resources to continue to invest in growth-facing capabilities. Our priority areas include digital, data and analytics, e-commerce, SRM, strategy, M&A and other capabilities that are critical to our future success. Overall, we expect these changes to our portfolio and organization will result in stronger, more profitable growth, enabling us to better deliver on the goals of our Accelerate strategy. 
As we turn to fiscal '22, let me reiterate our 3 key priorities that will be critical to our success this year outlined on Slide 12. First, we will continue to compete effectively, prioritizing our core markets, global platforms and local gem brands and leveraging our brand building, innovation, strategic capabilities and force for good work to deliver competitive performance. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic cost environment, leveraging our HMM productivity program, SRM pricing actions and other efficiency efforts to address input cost inflation and other cost headwinds. And third, we will execute our portfolio and organization reshaping actions without disrupting our base business. 
We know we must meet consumers where they are and with the products they want to be successful in fiscal '22. Our key initiatives for this year are aligned with our accelerated strategic pillars, including continued investment behind bold, brand-building campaigns. For example, Cheerios is celebrating 80 years of putting heart-healthy oats on millions of breakfast tables every morning by reintroducing its original name and packaging, Cheerioats. The retro, limited-edition box will be hitting store sales in July, and we'll be asking fans to enter into a contest by sharing their favorite Cheerios memories on social media. Also, our Haagen-Dazs Mix It Up campaign is live across Europe and Asia now, highlighting the combination of contrasting flavors and textures to create an elevated taste experience. Finally, as our Tastefuls cat food line enters its second year, we're making sure pet parents know about a superior taste with an integrated One Taste Is All It Takes campaign. 
We're also investing in exciting and relevant renovation and innovation news for consumers. For example, we're launching new flavors and textures with Haagen-Dazs Twist and Crunch in Asia and Latin America and Nature Valley Soft Baked Muffin Bars in the U.S. We're doubling down on successful losses from last year with new additions to those product lines including new multipacks on :ratio keto yogurt and kits for Old El Paso Tortilla Pockets in Europe. And increasingly, these initiatives are also weaving in our force for good efforts, including new Annie's compostable mac and cheese cups, which you can find on shelves today. 
The next few months will be especially critical for our brands as the world transition to a new normal. As consumers reestablish routine, it's important that we deliver solutions for a lunchtime and away-from-home snacking, leveraging trusted brands like Nature Valley, Gogurt, Dunkaroos and Annie's. 
We will also continue investing in strategic capabilities across our business in fiscal '22 to better enable us to compete, including digital, data and analytics, strategic revenue management, connected commerce and our Holistic Margin Management program. Fiscal '22 is expected to bring the highest level of input cost inflation that we've seen in 10 years. The combination of our HMM productivity program and broad-based SRM initiatives will be required to offset this level of inflation and protect our profitability in fiscal '22, In fact, we've taken SRM actions across the vast majority of our categories and in all of our core markets around the world, leveraging all 4 elements of our SRM toolkit, list pricing, mix management, pack price architecture changes and promotion optimization. 
In addition, as we see consumers increasingly move online, we are ramping up our connected commerce efforts with some exciting initiatives coming out this year. For example, our Haagen-Dazs China business, we're expanding on successful connected commerce initiatives that we kicked off in fiscal '21, leveraging digital engagement, our shops network and other omnichannel interactions to strengthen our connections with consumers and accelerate our growth. 
In our Pet segment, we are launching a new initiative later this year that will allow pet parents to connect with each other and with the BLUE brand in a differential way, and we'll continue to leverage our existing assets, including Box Tops for Education, Pillsbury.com and bettycrocker.com to cultivate a connected ecosystem for consumers online. 
With clear priorities and a strong set of plans, we've outlined goals for fiscal '22 that we expect will represent competitive performance in the context of a changing demand and cost environment. We expect that consumer demand for food at home in fiscal '22 will decline from elevated fiscal '21 levels as more vaccines are distributed, offices and schools reopen and the broader economic recovery continues. Conversely, we expect away-from-home food demand to be above last year, but we do not expect either at-home or away-from-home demand to return to pre-pandemic levels. And with roughly 85% of our net sales in at-home food occasions, we anticipate these dynamics will result in lower aggregate consumer demand in our categories in fiscal '22. With this demand outlook, we expect organic net sales to decline 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted operating profit to decline 2% to 4% in constant currency, and we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to range between flat and down 2% from the base of $3.79 earned in fiscal '21. And we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings. 
Importantly, when compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '19 levels, the midpoints of our fiscal '22 guidance ranges equate to 3-year compounded growth rates of approximately 2%, 2% and 5%, respectively, for organic net sales, constant currency adjusted operating and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. This level of top line growth represents a meaningful step-up from our performance in the prior 3 years ending in fiscal '19. 
I want to be very clear, but I am excited about where General Mills is today and where we are headed. We view fiscal '22 as a continuation of the momentum we built in fiscal '21 by making food the world loves and needs. We will emerge a stronger company with exciting opportunities to accelerate growth and create sustainable values for our shareholders. 
With that, I pass it over to Kofi."

I'll be providing more details on our fourth quarter financial performance, starting with our enterprise results on Slide 17. 
Net sales of $4.5 billion were down 10%, including the impact to reported net sales from the 53rd week last year's Q4. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter, reflecting a tough comparison to the 16% organic net sales growth a year ago when we saw the initial surge in pandemic-driven at-home demand as well as the extra month of results in our Pet segment. 
Adjusted operating profit decreased 18% in constant currency driven primarily by lower net sales and higher input costs partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.91 in the quarter and were down 19% in constant currency driven by lower adjusted operating profit partially offset by a lower adjusted effective tax rate. 
Given the unusual nature of last year's fourth quarter, we've also included a 2-year compound growth rate across these measures, which reflects the comparison against pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '19. On a 2-year compound growth basis, fourth quarter organic net sales were up 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 1% in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% in constant currency. 
Slide 18 summarizes the components of our net sales growth in the fourth quarter. Organic net sales were down 6% driven by lower organic pound volume. Foreign exchange added 2 points of growth in the quarter and the comparison to the 53rd week last year was a 5-point headwind to net sales. 
Now let's turn to segment results beginning with North America Retail on Slide 19. Fourth quarter organic net sales decreased 13%, reflecting the comparison against the pandemic-driven surge in consumer demand in Q4 of last year. On a 2-year compound growth basis, fourth quarter organic net sales were up 6%. Fourth quarter constant currency segment operating profit was down 31% driven by lower net sales and higher input costs, including fixed cost deleverage in the supply chain. For the full year, North America Retail organic net sales were up 4%, including broad-based growth in U.S. Meals & Baking, Canada, U.S. Cereal and U.S. Yogurt. We grew or held market share in roughly 50% of U.S. retail sales, and we drove stronger gains in Canada. 
Fiscal '21 segment operating profit was flat to last year driven by input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher media and other SG&A expenses, offset by HMM cost savings and higher volume. Segment operating profit margin of 23.9% was 100 basis points ahead of the pre-pandemic result in fiscal '19. 
Organic net sales for our Pet segment declined 20% in the fourth quarter driven by the comparison to the extra month of results in last year's Q4 as we aligned the segment to our May fiscal year-end as well as the comparison against the pandemic-driven stock-up purchases we saw a year ago. As you can see on the chart on Slide 20, Q4 of fiscal '20 was a significant outlier in terms of net sales. And except for that quarter, net sales for our Pet segment have generally been on a strong upward trend. Importantly, retail sales for BLUE in the fourth quarter were up mid-teens in measured channels, reflecting the underlying strength of our business. On the bottom line, the Pet segment's fourth quarter operating profit declined 24% driven by lower volume and higher input costs partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and positive price mix. 
For the full year, Pet's organic sales were up 2% driven by the comparison to the extra month of results in fiscal '20. On a 2-year compound growth basis, Pet segment organic net sales were up 10%. In fiscal '21, BLUE generated double-digit retail sales growth and grew market share in measured channels. The brand also drove further household penetration gains and increased pet parent awareness with our omnichannel growth model. Full year operating profit for the Pet segment was up 6% primarily driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by higher input costs. Segment operating profit margin was up 100 basis points to 24% of net sales. 
Turning to Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment results on Slide 21. Fourth quarter organic net sales grew 33% primarily driven by the comparison to significantly reduced away-from-home food demand a year ago. We have seen sequential improvement in consumer traffic to away-from-home food channels, including schools, restaurants and lodging throughout fiscal '21. On a 2-year compound growth basis, Q4 organic net sales declined 3%. Fourth quarter segment operating profit increased 143% in the quarter driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses. For the full year, Convenience Stores & Foodservice organic net sales declined 3% driven by reduced demand in away-from-home food channels amid the pandemic. Segment operating profit was down 9% primarily driven by lower net sales and higher input costs, partly offset by lower SG&A expenses. 
In Europe and Australia, fourth quarter organic net sales declined 2% driven by the comparison to pandemic-driven increased at-home food demand a year ago. On a 2-year compound growth basis, fourth quarter organic net sales grew 1%. Fourth quarter segment operating profit decreased 16% in constant currency driven by higher input costs and lower net sales partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. For the full year, organic net sales increased 3% primarily driven by Old El Paso Mexican food and Haagen-Dazs ice cream. We competed effectively in fiscal '21, growing market share in ice cream and snack bars. And full year segment operating profit increased 24% primarily driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by higher input costs. 
In Asia and Latin America, organic net sales grew 22% in the fourth quarter due to pandemic-driven at-home food demand in Latin America and improved away-from-home demand in Asia, driving strong growth in Haagen-Dazs shops. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales increased 7% in the fourth quarter. Segment operating profit totaled $23 million compared to a loss of $24 million a year ago driven by higher net sales and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by higher input costs. Full year organic net sales were up 15% in fiscal '21. 
Net sales growth was broad-based, including double-digit growth in Latin America driven by strong at-home demand for Yoki meals and snacks and Kitano seasonings in Brazil amid the pandemic. Net sales were also up double digits in Asia in the full year, led by China and India with notable growth for Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Betty Crocker dessert mixes. Full year segment operating profit was up $67 million to $86 million primarily driven by higher net sales and favorable foreign currency exchange partially offset by higher input costs. 
Slide 24 summarizes our joint venture results. In the fourth quarter, constant currency net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were down 2%, reflecting the comparison to elevated pandemic-driven demand a year ago. Haagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 12% in constant currency in the quarter driven by successful new product launches and strong growth on the core. For the full year, CPW constant currency net sales were up 5% driven by broad-based volume growth led by Brazil, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Haagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 6% in constant currency primarily driven by positive category trends and strong new product offerings. Fiscal '21 combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 29% and to $118 million driven by net sales growth for both CPW and Haagen-Dazs Japan. 
Turning to total company margin results. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin were roughly in line with our expectations at down 160 basis points and down 140 basis points, respectively, driven primarily by fixed cost deleverage in the supply chain as we compared against significant volume leverage a year ago during the initial surge in pandemic-related demand. For the full year, adjusted gross margin decreased 40 basis points primarily driven by input cost inflation, cost to secure incremental capacity and higher logistics costs partially offset by HMM cost savings and fixed cost leverage in the supply chain. Fiscal '21 adjusted operating profit margin increased 10 basis points driven by favorable price/mix and lower admin expenses partially offset by higher input costs. 
Slide 26 summarizes other noteworthy Q4 income statement items. Unallocated corporate expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability decreased $53 million in the quarter driven by lower compensation and benefits expenses. Fourth quarter net interest expense decreased $16 million from a year ago driven by lower rates and lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5% compared to 19.1% a year ago primarily driven by certain nonrecurring discrete tax benefits. And average diluted shares outstanding were flat in the quarter, with our share repurchase activity offsetting the impact of option exercises. 
Our full year fiscal '21 results are summarized on Slide 27. Net sales of $18.1 billion were up 3% driven by higher organic net sales and 1 point of favorable foreign currency exchange partially offset by a 2-point headwind from the extra week of results in last year's fourth quarter. Organic net sales increased 4%, reflecting strong execution and broad-based market share gains amid elevated at-home food demand. Full year adjusted operating profit of $3.2 billion increased 2% in constant currency primarily driven by higher constant currency adjusted gross profit dollars partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, including increased investment in media and capabilities. Fiscal '21 adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $3.79 and grew 4% in constant currency driven by higher adjusted operating profit, lower net interest expense and higher after-tax earnings from joint ventures partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate and higher average diluted shares outstanding. 
On a 2-year compound growth basis, relative to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '19, organic net sales were up 4%, adjusted operating profit increased 4% in constant currency and adjusted diluted EPS grew 8% in constant currency. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Full year operating cash flow totaled $3 billion, down 19% from last year primarily driven by a change in current assets and liabilities partially offset by a change in deferred income taxes and an increase in net earnings. As a reminder, operating cash flow in fiscal '20 included timing benefits related to pandemic-driven volume increases in last year's fourth quarter, which we expected to unwind in fiscal '21. Relative to fiscal '19's pre-pandemic results, fiscal '21 operating cash flow was up 6%. 
Our core working capital balance increased 6% from a year ago driven by an increase in inventory balances partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Capital investments of $531 million increased $70 million from a year ago, including higher spending on growth capital. Full year free cash flow totaled $2.4 billion and free cash flow conversion was 103% for the year. 
Total cash returned to shareholders increased 29% to $1.5 billion, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $301 million in share repurchases. As Jeff said earlier, we ended the year with a leverage ratio of 2.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to our expectations for fiscal '22. We've outlined our key top line assumptions on Slide 29. One of the largest factors impacting our performance this year will be the relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home demand as consumers adjust to the new normal. As Jeff mentioned, we continue to expect to compete effectively in fiscal '22 within the context of this evolving demand picture. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we've provided our current assumptions for consumer demand across our key business segments. We expect our North America Retail and Europe and Australia segments will see headwinds from lower consumer demand for food at home relative to fiscal '21, though we expect that demand will remain above pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, we expect our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment to benefit from increased demand for away-from-home food relative to fiscal '21, though we don't expect demand to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. 
Finally, we anticipate demand for our Pet and Asia and Latin America segments will be up in fiscal '22 on top of growth in the prior year. In aggregate, that translates into consumer demand headwinds across roughly 70% of our net sales base with tailwinds on the remaining 30% of our net sales. 
Slide 23 summarizes our other key financial assumptions in fiscal '22. On adjusted operating profit, we expect headwinds, including input cost inflation, lower volumes, supply chain deleverage and continued growth investments in our global capabilities. Our current assumption for input cost inflation across our total cost of goods sold is approximately 7%. This includes logistics costs up double digits, raw and packaging materials up high single digits and manufacturing costs up low single digits. 
We are currently covered on roughly half of our raw and packaging material requirements for fiscal '22. On the other hand, we expect tailwinds to adjusted operating profit will include: HMM cost savings of roughly 4% cost of goods sold; positive price/mix from our SRM actions; lower administrative expenses, reflecting our streamlined organizational structure; and a reduction in COVID-related expenses, including external manufacturing, health and safety costs. While these items reflect our current assumption, it is important to acknowledge that this is a highly dynamic environment, and we'll need to stay close to the cost picture and ensure we're taking appropriate actions based on how the situation evolves over the course of the year. 
From a phasing standpoint, we expect adjusted operating profit to be down in the first half of our fiscal '22 and up in the second half due to the comparison to the prior year, which saw notably higher adjusted operating profit in the first half and due to the timing of net price realization relative to inflation. Remember that we posted a first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 19.1% in fiscal '21, which was nearly 200 basis points ahead of our full year results driven by elevated demand and supply chain leverage. Largely due to this difficult comparison, we expect constant currency adjusted operating profit to be down double digits in the first quarter of fiscal '22. 
Looking below operating profit, we expect net interest expense to total approximately $370 million. We anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, and we expect to reduce our average diluted shares outstanding by 1% in fiscal '22. Finally, we expect to fund capital investments of approximately 3.5% of net sales. 
Based on these assumptions, Slide 31 reiterates the fiscal '22 outlook that Jeff shared earlier. I'll note that this outlook does not include any impact from the proposed Yoplait Europe divestiture or the Tyson pet treats acquisition since those transactions have yet to close. 
Let me close with a few thoughts. The General Mills team has risen to the challenges presented by the pandemic, making food the world loves and needs. We achieved our fiscal '21 priorities, and we're back to fully leveraging all of our capital allocation tools including dividend growth, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. And as we look ahead, we expect to emerge from the pandemic a stronger company, well positioned to drive long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value as we execute our Accelerate strategy.

I guess, specifically, it sounds like the company has not made meaningful adjustments to its original net sales outlook for the remainder of the year. But it seems like consumption still remains elevated even into your fiscal 2Q. Volume elasticity in response to pricing admittedly early, is almost nonexistent so far. And the company obviously has taken additional pricing actions as well. So I guess at a high level, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of guidance sort of builds in a sales deceleration and cost increases that you're already seeing versus just trying to be prudent in what's clearly still a very fluid sort of environment."

And let me start by just kind of reiterating what's kind of in our guidance and what's not. And then I'll provide some clarity on kind of what lies ahead, even in an uncertain market, and I find the clarity beat certainty in terms of how we think about these things.
And the guidance, important, you kind of hit on it that our updated guidance for the year would reflect the beat we had in sales in the first quarter, which we just announced but really didn't have any change in our sales performance for the balance of the year. And mean it probably raises the question then if our remains elevated as it has for the first quarter, would that indicate that there's a possibility that our sales could be higher. And the answer is yes, there is that possibility.
The -- and our second quarter has certainly started out well, particularly in North America. As you look at the retail sales and you look at past or second quarter is off to a nice start. But there's certainly -- there is a lot of uncertainty in our -- the revised guidance we have do not contemplate yet, revised demand guidance, but I think we'll have a much better view as Q2 unfolds. And as we announce earnings in Q2, we have a better view, not only in the quarter, but then how does demand look for the rest of the year.
The other piece of it is really on the bottom line. And our guidance, not only contemplates what happened in the first quarter, but also the elevated inflation that we're going to see for the balance of the year. We said it was 7% at the beginning year is clearly going to be between 7% and 8% now as we go on the year. It also contemplates some pricing actions that we have taken in order to help address that rising inflation. And how our profit comes in will be determined, I think about how much exactly does inflation go up. And exactly when does was pricing hit.
In terms of as we look forward, I think the important thing is that there are a couple of things that are really clear to us. One is that inflation is going to continue through the balance of our fiscal year, which is to say, the first half of calendar '22. That much is clear. And it's going to be broad. The second thing as clear is that we've done a really nice job with pricing so far. And we -- our prices are going to go up for the remainder of the year as we see inflation going up. And so you started to see that at the end of Q1. And by hitting Q2, you'll see more pricing.
And our job is to, as we've done for the last 3 or 4 years, is just kind of stay in the middle of both, which is to say, we're not going to chase sales growth, the expense of profitability nor are we going to be slaves to profit margin at the expense of things like driving our brands. And this balance of driving sales growth and profitability has served us well over the last few years. And I would argue during the pandemic has served us especially well and we're still in the midst of it. So I think I'll stop there. Otherwise, it will probably be a filibuster, but appreciate the starting question."

And it really is, I'll probably use that word 15 times this morning, but dynamic market. And so people understand the need to revise plans and make sure that we're staying current.
And we're all seeing the same cost, whether it's transportation costs or labor costs or ingredient costs. I mean we're all seeing the same kind of cost, whether it's GPG companies or retailers. So it's never easy, but I think there is an understanding that we're in a market that is continuing to change. Jon Nudi, any color you'd like to add to that?"

When you come to retailers with a rationale that makes sense, in fact, they tend to listen. And we're really leveraging the entire restaurant tool kit as well. So obviously, we've taken some list price increases, but we continue to look at promotional optimization and mix of PPA and leveraging all of those different tools.
So far, so good. We like the way that the conversations have gone. We've gotten the majority of our pricing accepted and more importantly, reflected in the market. So that's a trick as well. So we're really working well with retailers, and we'll continue to take the inflation and deal with it as we move throughout the year."

And it's almost whackable right now.
So we have literally hundreds of disruptions in our supply chain and it really changes on a daily and weekly basis. So we've gone back to some of the practices that served us well at the beginning of pandemic, we stood up, the control towers at the working level on a daily basis, on a weekly basis at the more senior level to really dig in and work with our teams to solve these issues. And we do expect these issues to persist throughout the year. what I like is the way that we're performing and I think we're outperforming versus many of our competitors in this space.
So we are probably somewhere in the 80s in terms of total service levels. And what I would tell you is that it varies widely across categories. And the majority of our categories were actually in the '90s and then performing well. And we have a few that -- We have capacity issues we have a few that have ingredient issues that are really dragging us down.
So we continue to work closely with retailers. In fact, the bulk of our discussions right now with retailers are really around service and making sure that we can ship the product that our consumers are ultimately looking for. So our legs as we continue to move throughout the rest of the year."

On Blue Buffalo, the first thing I would say is that our organic business on Blue Buffalo performed quite well in the first quarter. I mean we were up 20% and gaining market share really across all the different segments. Having said that, I think it's important also to reflect that for pets, we probably had our easiest comp in the year this past quarter. We only grew about 6% in the first quarter last year and 18% in the second quarter. And so as good as I feel about Blue Buffalo, I feel great about it.
I wouldn't model 20% growth for us from here on out because the comparisons get quite a bit steeper as the year goes on. Blue Buffalo and it is performing quite well. really have opportunities across the segment. We over-index and dry dog food, and we basically under-index in every other subsegment of the category. So there is a broad opportunity.
And I would say with the Tyson acquisition, when we first looked at it several months ago we liked it. Once we had bought it, we get a closer look. We really like it now that we have it, we like it even more. And what I can tell you is that the growth of 20% is has kind of exceeded our initial expectations, and it's got a good management team. And they're -- we've not only bought some nice brand, a good portfolio, but a good team.
And with that acquisition really helps us to do is cement our leadership in the treats part of the dog category and something we wouldn't have been able to get to by ourselves. And so it's very complementary, both in product form and customers where Blue Buffalo sits. So the more we've got to see it, the more we feel good after spending that kind of money to make an acquisition.

And I think that speaks to what Jon Nudi was talking about earlier in our strategic revenue management capability and the fact that our capability is significantly better across our company than it was 4 years ago. And you see that in the market. We got out to market fast, and we've been out there effectively. As we look at -- you talk about elasticity of demand, it is still early. We don't have a tremendous amount of data points yet. Having said that, it seemed to us as if demand is holding up quite well, it's holding up a little bit better than we had thought.
And if I think through the logic of that, particularly here in the U.S., you see that restaurant traffic is still down the food cost from away-from-home eating are going up at least as fast as they are in an at-home meeting because of the labor piece of that, and they face the same pressures we do from an ingredient standpoint. So when you see broad-based inflation not only in at-home eating, but also perhaps even more so in away-from-home eating where restaurants, many of them not only do they see inflation, but they're having trouble staffing all of their restaurants.
It seems to us that this is an environment where elasticity at least so far, has seemed us, are a little bit lower than what we have said. Now the sample size is small, and we'll continue to monitor that. But that's what we see in the world right now and pretty much true across the world, whether it's here in the U.K. or in China or Brazil."

And I'll give you fruit snacks as an example of that here in the U.S., where we grew share, massive amounts of share 2 years in a row.
Demand was high before the pandemic has been high during the pandemic. It's certainly higher right now. And so we've had to go out and add more capacity, which we're going to do late, which we signed off on a year ago and which we come to market a year, but that takes a long time to get to. So fruits snacks would be a great example of one of those places. And the deers right now would be another example where the desserts category, we have capacity constraints.
When it comes to ingredients, it's a little bit here and a little bit there. It's not 1 particular ingredient all around the world. It's really a combination of small things, as I think Jon Nudi ably describe it as whackable, I mean there's a little -- there's ingredient shortage here and a little bit there and on labor shorage here and a truck that's not out there.

And people talk about strategy all the time, but execution is pretty important. And we're executing really, really well. And it's because we're addressing all the things that you just talked about.
Now the question is how to address it. Capital may be one area in some places, automation maybe an area in some cases. But I would also tell you that the coordination amongst your supply chain and your marketing functions and your sales functions, that's as important as adding capital expenditures or automation or things like that. And so I do believe that the challenges that we see right now are -- I think they are the new normal for the foreseeable future.

As we look at the logistics side, obviously, we do have long-haul and short-haul trucking contracts in our network.

And frankly, even labor to load trucks and shipping containers on the other side.
So that -- we are covered partially through the contracts that we have.

And then the conversation was relentlessly data versus relationships. It was all about elasticity and private label shares and retailers getting smarter omnichannel, creating more data. And it's basically forcing retailers to change their shelf set more frequently based on all this maybe more quantitative factors than qualitative.
And -- but in the past 6 months, it seems like there's this narrative in the industry that it seems that retailers are unhappy with case fill rates. It's difficult to -- and the industry pricing-wise, like there was a very good performance to have a minor -- relative performance to have a minor gross margin decrement year-over-year, but some others are much worse. It feels to me like the pendulum has swung, and now it's -- well, that data is less important. I mean elasticities, to your point earlier, are excellent, private label shares are in free fall in most of these categories. I mean, supply is short.
You would think if this were you look at the inflation of I lived through in '07 and 2011, like these kinds of indicators would have suggested dramatically more pricing, protecting and maybe even expanding gross margin on a 2-year basis, certainly, versus pre-pandemic levels and better utilization, et cetera.
So I guess I wanted your comment about-- is that -- am I wrong about the analytics, first of all? Is that right about that kind of pendulum and the conversation between you and your retail customer and it swings back to where, hey, more people buying your products, elasticities are good, and that suggest more pricing power over time?"

And I would say, first of all, consumers like our brands, and we continue to build them and innovate and build our brands, and that's worked for us. The other thing I would say, they can -- a retailer can make call to us, and we operate across 25 different categories in the U.S. And that's helpful on the supply chain side. We can work in all those categories and really drive scale and make sure that we're operating well to service their shelves.
And at the same time, we can focus on capabilities, whether that be connected commerce and digital marketing or e-commerce. So I think retailers are recognizing or have recognized that having powerful partnerships with some big manufacturers is beneficial to them, really streamlines their work. It's good for us and it's good for them as well."

At the same time, though, you're saying for home demand remains a bit elevated. So then we also see cereal meals and baking decline a bit, which, obviously, isn't shocking relative to the year ago quarter.
I'm just curious, as you sit down and you think about the guide and you dissected or category, is it fair to say as we move forward over the next few quarters or so or as mobility increases that it's rational to think that maybe Nielsen Baking and Cereal are still a bit more pressured relative to kind of fluid coming rates versus snacks and maybe the snacking part of the portfolio actually continued to perform despite shifts in mobility.

And there's big important categories like cereal where, again, over a 2-year basis, we are growing, which is great.
And we think there's some dynamics with kids getting back to school and focus on convenience, we'll see that category continue to accelerate, which we sell in August. So we like how we're competing broadly in the U.S. We've grown share in greater than 50% of our business in Q1, and we've done it for 4 years in a row. So again, this wasn't just a pandemic-driven performance. We like the way that we're competing, and we'll continue to focus on that as we move forward."

So we feel good about those things. I would view our portfolio shaping as kind of an always-on capability. I mean, similar we view strategic revenue management.

I'm really proud of what we've done in our base business, not only this quarter, but the last few years. But it's also clear to me that we need to do that. And to the extent that we think that investments are better spent in priority categories versus those that aren't prioritized. We'll look at additional divestment opportunities as well. And so we'll continue to compete effectively in the categories we're in and we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities.
I think one of the things I've been most pleased about over the last couple of years is that we've been able to do both effectively. And whether it's the start of Tyson or whether the way we've done with Blue Buffalo, we're keeping our eye on the ball as we've divested Yoplait. We've done all of that.

I guess, specifically, it sounds like the company has not made meaningful adjustments to its original net sales outlook for the remainder of the year. But it seems like consumption still remains elevated even into your fiscal 2Q. Volume elasticity in response to pricing, while admittedly early, is almost nonexistent so far. And the company obviously has taken additional pricing actions as well. So I guess at a high level, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of guidance sort of builds in a sales deceleration and cost increases that you're already seeing versus just trying to be prudent in what's clearly still a very fluid sort of environment."

And then I'll provide some clarity on kind of what lies ahead. Even in an uncertain market, I find that clarity beats certainty in terms of how we think about these things. And the guidance, important, you kind of hit on it that our updated guidance for the year would reflect the beat we had in sales in the first quarter, which we just announced, but really didn't have any change in our sales performance for the balance of the year. And I mean it probably raises the question then if our [ sales ] remains elevated as it has for the first quarter, would that indicate that there's a possibility that our sales could be higher. And the answer is yes, there is that possibility.
The -- and our second quarter has certainly started out well, particularly in North America. As you look at the retail sales and as you look in past or second quarter, we're off to a nice start. But there's certainly -- there is a lot of uncertainty in our -- the revised guidance we have does not contemplate yet revised demand guidance, but I think we'll have a much better view as Q2 unfolds. And as we announce earnings in Q2, we'll have a better view, not only in the quarter, but then how does demand look for the rest of the year.
The other piece of it is really on the bottom line. And our guidance not only contemplates what happened in the first quarter, but also the elevated inflation that we're going to see for the balance of the year. We said it was 7% at the beginning year. It's clearly going to be between 7% and 8% now as we go on the year. It also contemplates some pricing actions that we have taken in order to help address that rising inflation. And how our profit comes in will be determined -- I think about how much exactly does inflation go up and exactly when does -- was pricing hit.
In terms of as we look forward, I think the important thing is that there are a couple of things that are really clear to us. One is that inflation is going to continue through the balance of our fiscal year, which is to say, the first half of calendar '22. That much is clear. And it's going to be broad. The second thing that's clear is that we've done a really nice job with pricing so far. And we -- our prices are going to go up for the remainder of the year as we see inflation going up. And so you started to see that at the end of Q1. And by -- hitting Q2, you'll see more pricing.
And our job is to, as we've done for the last 3 or 4 years, is just kind of stay in the middle of both, which is to say, we're not going to chase sales growth at the expense of profitability nor are we going to be slaves to profit margin at the expense of things like driving our brands. And this balance of driving sales growth and profitability has served us well over the last few years and, I would argue, during the pandemic has served us especially well, and we're still in the midst of it. So I think I'll stop there. Otherwise, it will probably be a filibuster, but appreciate the starting question."

So far, so good. We like the way that conversations have gone. We've gotten the majority of our pricing accepted and more importantly, reflected in the market. So that's a trick as well.

And it's almost whack-a-mole right now. So we have literally hundreds of disruptions in our supply chains, and it really changes on a daily and weekly basis. So we've gone back to some of the practices that served us well at the beginning of the pandemic. We've stood up the control towers at the working level on a daily basis, on a weekly basis at, I mean, more senior level to really dig in and work with our teams to solve these issues. And we do expect these issues to persist throughout the year.
What I like is the way that we're performing, and I think we're outperforming versus many of our competitors in this space. So we are probably somewhere in the 80s in terms of total service levels. And what I would tell you is that it varies widely across categories. And the majority of our categories were actually in the 90s and then performing well. We have a few that -- we have capacity issues. We have a few ingredient issues that are really dragging us down.
So we continue to work closely with retailers.

On Blue Buffalo, the first thing I would say is that our organic business on Blue Buffalo performed quite well in the first quarter. I mean we were up 20% and gaining market share really across all the different segments. Having said that, I think it's important also to reflect that for pet, we probably had our easiest comp in the year this past quarter. We're going -- grew about 6% in the first quarter last year and 18% in the second quarter. And so as good as I feel about Blue Buffalo, I feel great about it.
I wouldn't model 20% growth for us from here on out because the comparisons get quite a bit steeper as the year goes on. But Blue Buffalo in itself is performing quite well. We really have opportunities across the segment. We over-index in dry dog food, and we basically under-index in every other subsegment of the category. So there is broad opportunity.
And I would say with the Tyson acquisition, when we first looked at it several months ago, we liked it. And once we had bought it, we got a closer look. We really liked it. Now that we have it, we like it even more. And what I can tell you is that the growth of 20% is -- kind of exceeded our initial expectations, and it's got a good management team. And they're -- we've not only bought some nice brand, a good portfolio, but a good team.
And what that acquisition really helps us to do is cement our leadership in the treats part of the dog category and something we wouldn't have been able to get to by ourselves. And so it's very complementary, both in product form and in customers where Blue Buffalo sits. So the more we've got to see it, the more we feel good after spending that kind of money to make an acquisition. But we feel good both about Blue and about this recent acquisition of the Tyson pet food business."

And I think that speaks to what Jon Nudi was talking about earlier in our Strategic Revenue Management capability and the fact that our capability is significantly better across our company than it was 4 years ago. And you see that in the market. We got out to market fast, and we've been out there effectively.
As we look at -- as -- you talk about elasticity of demand, it is still early. We don't have a tremendous amount of data points yet. Having said that, it seemed to us as if demand is holding up quite well, it's holding up a little bit better than we had thought.
And if I think through the logic of that, particularly here in the U.S., you see that restaurant traffic is still down, the food cost from away-from-home eating are going up at least as fast as they are in at-home eating because of the labor piece of that, and they face the same pressures we do from an ingredient standpoint. So when you see broad-based inflation not only in at-home eating, but also perhaps even more so in away-from-home eating where restaurants, many of them not only do they see inflation, but they're having trouble staffing all of their restaurants.
It seems to us that this is an environment where elasticity, at least so far, has seemed to us, are a little bit lower than what we have said. Now the sample size is small, and we'll continue to monitor that. But that's what we see in the world right now and pretty much true across the world, whether it's here, in the U.K. or in China or Brazil."

And I'll give you fruit snacks as an example of that here in the U.S., where we grew share, massive amounts of share 2 years in a row.

And so we've had to go out and add more capacity, which we're going to do -- which we signed off on a year ago and which we come to market a year, but that takes a long time to get to. So fruit snacks would be a great example of one of those places. And desserts right now would be another example where the desserts category has been really strong for us. And so we have capacity constraints.
When it comes to ingredients, it's a little bit here and a little bit there. It's not one particular ingredient all around the world. It's really a combination of small things, as I think Jon Nudi aptly described it as whack-a-mole. I mean there's a little -- there's ingredient shortage here and a little bit there. There's labor shortage here, and a truck that's not out there. And so it is not a geography or a category where we see it. It's a little bit of everything.

And people talk about strategy all the time, but execution is pretty important. And we're executing really, really well. And it's because we're addressing all the things that you just talked about.
Now the question is how to address it. Capital may be one area. In some places, automation be -- maybe an area in some cases. But I would also tell you that the coordination amongst your supply chain and your marketing functions and your sales functions, that's as important as adding capital expenditures or automation or things like that.

We're at about 66%, so roughly 2/3 covered on the year at our present demand and volume expectations. So I think to your question about what we cover, I think, generally, in the ingredients on commodity side, we'll be able to hedge where there are markets. Some of those ingredients cover the long-term contracts, which gets you effectively the same thing.
As we look at the logistics side, obviously, we do have long-haul and short-haul trucking contracts in our network. Obviously, with the labor pressures, there is upward price pressure on that entire complex just as a result of the shortage of drivers to get to drive trucks and, frankly, I think, even labor to unload trucks and shipping containers on the other side.
So that -- we are covered partially through the contracts that we have. The key is making sure that we continue to execute most of our routes on contract, and we are seeing a little bit of pressure as a result of having to do more sort of off-contract and off-network as a result of the labor shortage and the environment."

And I think the conversation was relentlessly data versus relationships. It was all about elasticity and private label shares and retailers getting smarter, omnichannel, creating more data. And it's basically forcing retailers to change their shelf set more frequently based on all this maybe more quantitative factors than qualitative.
And -- but in the past 6 months, it seems like there's this narrative in the industry that it seems that retailers are unhappy with case fill rates. It's difficult to -- and the industry pricing-wise, like it was a very good performance to have a minor -- relative performance to have a minor gross margin decrement year-over-year, but some others are much worse. It feels to me like the pendulum has swung, and now it's -- well, that data is less important. I mean elasticities, to your point earlier, are excellent. Private label shares are in free fall in most of these categories. I mean supply is short.
You would think if this were -- you look at the inflations of -- that I lived through in '07 and 2011, like these kinds of indicators would have suggested dramatically more pricing protecting and maybe even expanding gross margin on a 2-year basis, certainly, versus prepandemic levels and better utilization, et cetera.
So I guess I wanted your comment about-- is that -- am I wrong about the analytics, first of all? Is that right about that kind of pendulum and the conversation between you and your retail customers? And do you think that in a more normal environment, it swings back to where, hey, more people buying your products, elasticities are good, and that suggest more pricing power over time?"

When I think about the data versus relationships when it comes to retail customers, I think about it the same way as I think about brick-and-mortar retail and e-commerce, which is at the end. And especially in food, where yes, we have [ e-commerce, ] but a lot -- 85% of our e-commerce goes through stores. And so you need to be good at e-commerce, and you need to be good at the physical distribution of products as well, which is why we've talked about connected commerce.
The same is true of what we're going through with retail customers right now. Yes, data is important. It will be coming -- it will remain important. Data keeps getting better for our retailers. It keeps getting better for us. That will certainly play a role, but you only trust the data of people you actually trust. And so the retail relationships we have are also important because as we go to market and talk about what's going on in the environment, we need to make sure we have those relationships. So they are both important.
As we think about elasticity of demand, we'll see. We're kind of an uncharted territory, to be honest with you. And that's why all elasticity models are always based on historical data, which is usual to a point, but only to a point.
And that's why I made the commentary earlier about we're seeing inflation broadly, not only across our products, but also across restaurants as well. And that's why I made the comment about service levels of restaurants and the ability to get labor because it seems like in that environment, it feels like elasticity should hold out pretty well, and they have so far, but we'll see what is to come. Jon Nudi, anything you want to add on either of those topics?"

The other thing I would say is for retailers, there's power in having scale. So they can -- a retailer can make a call to us, and we operate across 25 different categories in the U.S. And that's helpful on the supply chain side. We can work in all those categories and really drive scale and make sure that we're operating well to service their shelves.
And at the same time, we can focus on capabilities, whether that be connected commerce and digital marketing or e-commerce. So I think retailers are recognizing or have recognized that having powerful partnerships with some big manufacturers is beneficial to them, really streamlines their work.

I'm really proud of what we've done in our base business, not only this quarter, but the last few years. But it's also clear to me that we need to do that and continue to reshape our portfolio. And some of that will be through acquisitions, and I think this Tyson acquisition is a great example of that. And to the extent that we think that investments are better spent in priority categories versus those that aren't prioritized, we'll look at additional divestment opportunities as well. And so we'll continue to compete effectively in the categories we're in, and we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities.
I think one of the things I've been most pleased about over the last couple of years is that we've been able to do both effectively. And whether it's the start of Tyson or the way we've done with Blue Buffalo, we're keeping our eye on the ball as we've divested Yoplait. We've done all of that.

Let me kick off our remarks by summarizing today's key messages. General Mills delivered first quarter financial results that were above our expectations in a very dynamic and challenging operating environment.",2388,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me kick off our remarks by summarizing today's key messages. General Mills delivered first quarter financial results that were above our expectations in a very dynamic and challenging operating environment. I'm pleased to say that we're delivering on our fiscal '22 priorities. We were focused on competing effectively, successfully navigating the challenging supply chain environment and executing our portfolio and organization reshaping actions without disruption. 
Amid these near-term opportunities and challenges, we continue to advance our Accelerate strategy. I'll share some examples today of further progress we've made in reshaping our portfolio, expanding our connected commerce capabilities and being a Force For Good. Finally, as we communicated 2 weeks ago, we now expect to deliver full year fiscal '22 financial results at the higher end of our previous announced guidance ranges. 
We expected this year to be dynamic, and that has certainly been the case through the first quarter. The global consumer landscape continues to evolve as we face new variants and see another broad rise in COVID case rates. While the magnitude varies by market and by month, what has remained constant is that at-home food demand remains notably elevated around the world relative to pre-pandemic levels. 
The supply chain environment also remains dynamic and challenging. We, like the rest of the industry, are facing rising input cost inflation globally. Our North American market basket has reached its highest point in recent history, and we're seeing significant inflationary pressures across our international markets as well. We now expect total input cost inflation in fiscal '22 will be roughly 7% to 8%, up from our prior estimate of 7%, driven by volatile weather, supply and demand imbalances and constrained transportation and labor markets. 
To add to the challenge, industry-wide shortages in the labor market, in particular, in North America, are impacting not only our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, but also raw material supply and external production capacity. As a result, we're facing service challenges and elevated costs. Within this context, I'm proud of the way that General Mills team is competing, leveraging the strength of our brands and our advantaged supply chain and sales capabilities to meet customer and consumer needs as well or better than our competition. 
Slide 6 summarizes our financial performance for the first quarter. We delivered organic net sales growth of 2%, while adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS were both down 2% in constant currency. Remember that these results compare against double-digit growth across each of these metrics a year ago and on a 2-year compound basis relative to pre-pandemic levels, our results were up 6% on organic sales, up 9% on adjusted operating profit and up 12% on adjusted diluted EPS. These results exceeded our expectations in each of our 5 operating segments, reflecting our strong execution and elevated demand. 
Back in June, we outlined 3 priorities that will be critical for our success in fiscal '22. First, we will continue to compete effectively by executing our Accelerate strategy; second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic supply chain environment with a focus on managing both customer service and margins; and third, we will execute our portfolio and organization reshaping actions without disrupting our base business. I'm pleased to say that we're off to a strong start in each of these areas. Let me show you a few examples of where we're delivering and driving results across these 3 priorities. 
We competed effectively yet again in Q1, holding or growing market share and 66% of our priority businesses. This includes the 11th consecutive quarter of share growth in U.S. Cereal, an 80 basis point gain in the quarter and nearly 5 full share points in the past 3 years in refrigerated dough in the U.S. 40 basis points of share growth in Nielsen-measured U.S. pet food channels and a 120 basis point gain in global Mexican food. This solid performance is a continuation of a multiyear improvement we made in our end market competitiveness. In fact, we've gained or held share in more than [ 60 ] of our priority businesses in each of the past 3 fiscal years. These results have been founded on great execution on the fundamentals. In particular, more compelling brand building and innovation supported by stronger levels of investment. 
As I mentioned earlier, the current operating environment is as dynamic as we've experienced in at least the last decade, resulting in significant input cost inflation, labor shortages and challenges servicing the business. In the face of these challenges, we've stepped up our agility and responsiveness to our customers and consumers can access the food they need while taking action to manage costs and protect our margins. For example, as we began to see labor shortages affecting the supply chain, we quickly reinstituted control tower meetings that we had established during the height of the pandemic to better align resources and enable faster decision-making. We're adapting our supply chain network to manage labor shortages. For instance, we're working with suppliers to extend lead times, use supplemental labor and encouraging more full pallet orders. And we're providing holistic incentives to encourage presenteeism in our logistics and manufacturing facilities. 
Overall, while our service levels aren't where we'd like them to be, we believe our advantaged supply chain is holding up as well or better than our competitors. To address elevated costs, our first line of defense is always our HMM productivity program. This year, we expect to generate HMM cost savings of roughly 4% of cost of goods sold. We've also stepped up our significant and broad-based SRM efforts across our portfolio, including new actions we've announced since our Q4 earnings call. And we're starting to see those actions translated to increases at the shelf. 
In U.S. retail, our average unit price in Nielsen-measured channels was up mid-single digits in Q1 and accelerated throughout the quarter. We saw a similar trend in Pet, where we're seeing shelf prices move in our international markets as well. It's important to note that we only saw a partial benefit of these pricing actions in Q1, and we'll see more significant benefit in our results in Q2 and beyond. We'll stay close to the cost picture and if we see more cost headwinds come our way, we'll be prepared to take additional actions to protect our profit outlook. 
Shifting gears to portfolio reshaping, we completed 2 major milestones in the first quarter. On July 6, we closed on the acquisition of the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews Dog treats brands from Tyson Foods, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. Dog treats is the second largest segment in pet food at $7 billion in retail sales and growing at a high single-digit rate. 
Our newly acquired brands are the leaders in natural meat treats with differentiated natural products that are aligned to our true Blue promise. No corn, wheat or soy, no artificial ingredients and meat as the first ingredient, making them a great fit in our portfolio. 
We are now 2 months into the business integration and we're more confident than ever about the growth and value creation opportunities ahead. In fact, retail sales for Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews were up 20% in Nielsen-measured outlets in the first quarter and we haven't even begun to plug them into our Blue Buffalo go-to-market model. 
With our expanded portfolio, we are now the leading natural player in the dog treats segment, and we've strengthened our position as the #1 overall natural pet food brand in the category. Our Pet segment now generates $2 billion in net sales with attractive margins and significant growth ahead. 
The second piece of portfolio reshaping news in Q1 relates to the divestiture of our interest in European Yoplait operations, which we first announced back in March. We signed a definitive agreement on August 27, formalizing the terms of the transaction with Sodiaal. With the agreement in hand, our teams are moving at full speed to close the transaction by the end of calendar 2021.
Overall, these 2 transactions represent significant steps in our effort to reshape our portfolio to drive faster and more profitable growth. At the same time, there is still more work to do, and we continue to look for additional opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and/or divestitures. 
In addition to our portfolio reshaping actions, we continue to advance our Accelerate strategy through investments in our connected commerce capability. Over the last year, you've heard us talk about the concept of connected commerce, -- which is about building brands across both physical and digital worlds. Connected Commerce is powered by data, digital capabilities, measurement and execution to enable General Mills to be part of the consumer journey, creating strong one-to-one relationships and drive differential growth for our brands. 
One of our first significant initiatives under the Connected Commerce banner was the digitization of our Box Tops for Education program. By moving Box Tops to a mobile app platform, we've saved schools the time and hassle of collecting and shipping physical eclipse. Increased the number of participating schools made it easier for consumers to find and support schools in need and create a unique one-to-one relationship with our consumers. These relationships provide us with receipt-level first-party data which we can use with consumer privacy safeguards to spot patterns, experiment, scale up winning tests and launch new capabilities. For the back-to-school season this year, we've launched a new Box Tops campaign entitled to unlock Brighter Futures, focused on unlocking the door to more opportunities for families and school communities to get what is needed for every child to achieve their potential. This campaign is building awareness of the Box Tops' mobile app while strengthening our role as a Force For Good in our communities. 
Another example of how we're strengthening our connected commerce capability across General Mills is our new mobile platform, Buddies by Blue Buffalo. Buddies allows pet parents to connect to a community of other pet parents and pet experts, consolidates information about their pet across their whole family and provides them with valuable rewards. This new platform allows us to meet pet parents where they are and strengthen our engagement with them throughout their pet's life. Buddies is not just an app. It's a relationship centered on the moments that matter to pet parents. 
We're also driving Connected Commerce in our Häagen-Dazs business in China, where we're using technology to contemporize the consumer experience. The Häagen-Dazs Smart Shop creates an ecosystem and provides consumers with a connected digital experience, both in-store and virtually via a mobile app and integration with WeChat. The entire consumer journey from finding a store, browsing the digital menu, placing an order, payment and signing up for a loyalty program can now take place on a mobile phone. The Smart Shop is helping us engage with new younger Häagen-Dazs consumers and the data is generating enables us to optimize our personalized marketing efforts and refine our promotions. 
Connected Commerce is an important way we will boldly build our brands in the future. We're encouraged by our first steps to create a differentiated Connected Commerce capability and we know there's much more to do. So we'll continue to invest and advance in this space. 
At General Mills, it's never just been about the food we make, it's also about how we make it. That's why we innovate and renovate our products to meet consumer needs and why we're advancing regenerative agriculture to support the soil from which our ingredients are grown. We believe being a Force For Good is not just good for the world, it's also good for business. That's why being a Force For Good is a central element of our Accelerate strategy. Because of its important to our strategy and with the increased interest we hear from you, our investors on this topic, plan to highlight different aspects of our Force for Good work on our earnings calls this year. 
Over the course of the year, we'll highlight examples that touch on our 4 priority areas: regenerating our planet, improving food security, protecting our people and strengthening our communities. Given that we recently passed the 1-year anniversary of our racial equity commitments, we wanted to take a moment to provide an update on our efforts in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
General Mills has a long history of supporting this work. And while we are very proud of that history, we also know that we can't rely on that history to create the kind of change we need in our world. A year ago, we took a step toward creating that change by making new commitments to equitable food access, equity in education and equity in representation. Given the location of our worldwide headquarters, we took the additional step of establishing the Minnesota Business Coalition for racial equity to push for structural changes that can have a true impact on systemic racism in the state of Minnesota. 
I'm proud to report that we've made progress against each of our key focus areas. For example, we partnered with leading national anti-hunger organizations such as the NAACP, you need us and share our strength, and we've invested in local organizations, and we're working to improve government programs to address food and security that disproportionately impacts communities of color. 
We also donated the 2 Minnesota-based nonprofit organization, [indiscernible] and Reimagine Education that partnered nationally with the LeBron James Family Foundation to create greater equity and education for kids of color so they can each reach their full potential. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on equity and representation in General Mills by focusing on leadership accountability, transparency and allyship. Over the last year, we've increased representation for people of color across all job bands. And for the first time, we can say that 25% of our officers are people of color. I'm proud of the progress we're making on these important commitments. And at the same time, there is still more work to be done. I look forward to updating you on other aspects of our Force For Good work over the course of this year. 
With that, I will pass it over to Kofi to review our financial performance in the first quarter."

Let's start with our first quarter financial results on Slide 15. Net sales of $4.5 billion were up 4%. Organic net sales grew 2% in the quarter, with results ahead of our expectations across all 5 operating segments. Ad",1491,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Let's start with our first quarter financial results on Slide 15. Net sales of $4.5 billion were up 4%. Organic net sales grew 2% in the quarter, with results ahead of our expectations across all 5 operating segments. Adjusted operating profit of $819 million was down 2% in constant currency, primarily driven by higher input partially offset by favorable price mix and lower administrative expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the quarter and were also down 2% in constant currency. And as Jeff mentioned earlier, on a 2-year compound growth basis, first quarter organic net sales were up 6%, adjusted operating profit increased 9% in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 12% in constant currency. 
Slide 16 summarizes the components of our net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 2% with 1% growth in organic pound volume and 2 points of positive organic price/mix. Foreign exchange was a 1 point benefit in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America retail on Slide 17. First quarter organic net sales were down 3%, driven by lower at-home demand as well as the comparison to last year's Q1 when our net sales benefited from retailers rebuilding inventory that have been drawn down at the onset of the pandemic. Net sales declines in U.S. Meals and Baking and U.S. Cereal were partially offset by increases in U.S. Snacks and Canada. On a 2-year compound growth basis, first quarter organic net sales were up 5%. We continue to compete effectively, growing our holding market share in more than 50% of our U.S. retail sales, and we drove strong share gains in Canada. 
First quarter constant currency segment operating profit decreased 12%, primarily driven by higher input costs and lower volume, partially offset by favorable price mix and lower administrative expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 4%. Organic net sales for our pet segment increased 20% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in both dog food and cat food. This quarter's organic net sales growth benefited from a comparison against last year's first quarter that was negatively impacted by a reduction in at-home food inventory. 
On a 2-year compound growth basis, first quarter organic net sales were up 13%. the Blue Buffalo brand continued to drive strong retail sales growth and market share gains in measured channels. In addition, retail sales for the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands collectively grew 20% in measured channels in the quarter. 
On the bottom line, first quarter segment operating profit grew 28%, driven by favorable price/mix and higher volume, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 28%. 
Turning to Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment results on Slide 19. Organic net sales grew 23% in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and a partial recovery in away-from-home food demand in the U.S., including stronger consumer traffic in schools, restaurants, lodging and C stores. On a 2-year compound growth basis, first quarter organic net sales were up 4%. Segment operating profit increased 47% in the quarter, driven by favorable net price realization and mix and higher volume, partially offset by higher input costs. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 6%. 
In Europe and Australia, first quarter organic net sales flat with growth in snack bars and yogurt, offset by a decline in ice cream. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales increased 3%. First quarter segment operating profit declined 22% in constant currency, driven by input cost inflation and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by HMM cost savings. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 21%. 
In Asia and Latin America, first quarter organic net sales grew 6% and were up 11% on a 2-year compound basis. Net sales were up high single digits in Latin America, primarily driven by continued strong performance for Yoki Meals in Brazil and were up mid-single digits in Asia led by good growth for Häagen-Dazs ice cream in China. First quarter segment operating profit decreased 26% in constant currency, driven by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by favorable price mix. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 11%. 
Turning to our joint venture results on Slide 22. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were down 5% in constant currency, reflecting a difficult comparison against elevated at-home demand in the early stages of the pandemic last year. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 14% in constant currency, including strong new product contributions from our decorations Mini Cup line. First quarter combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled [ $20 ] million compared to $41 million a year ago, primarily driven by lower net sales and increased investment at CPW. On a 2-year compound growth basis, combined after-tax earnings were up 15%. 
Turning to total company margin results on Slide 23. Our first quarter margin performance was below last year but ahead of our expectations driven by administrative expenses and net pricing that were better than our plan, offset by higher-than-expected supply chain costs in the quarter. First quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 150 basis points, primarily due to inflation, other supply chain costs and deleverage, partially offset by HMM and favorable price mix. Adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter was down 110 basis points, driven by lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower administrative expense. 
Slide 24 summarizes other noteworthy Q1 income statement items. Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $19 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $15 million, driven by lower rates and lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.7% compared to 21.9% a year ago, driven by favorable changes in earnings mix. And average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%, reflecting our net share purchase activity. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First quarter operating cash flow totaled $370 million compared to $584 million a year ago, primarily driven by timing relating us in accounts payable and accounts receivable. Capital investments in the quarter totaled $104 million, and we returned more than $460 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. 
On Slide 26, we provided an update of a few key financial assumptions for fiscal '22. On the cost side, Jeff mentioned that we expect input cost inflation and other supply chain costs will be more of a headwind in fiscal '22 than compared to our initial outlook where we shared on our Q4 earnings call. We expect input cost inflation will be between 7% and 8% for the year, up from our original outlook of roughly 7%. And we expect labor shortages will drive higher-than-planned costs across the supply chain, from sourcing to internal and external manufacturing and distribution. To offset these costs, we expect to deliver HMM cost savings at 4% cost of goods sold. And we've taken some incremental SRM actions on top of broad-based pricing we discussed on our Q4 earnings call. We expect our price/mix to step up in Q2 compared to the 2 points of positive price/mix we generated in Q1. 
With a portion of our free cash flow being used to fund the pet treats acquisition, we expect our share repurchase activity will be somewhat less than we assumed in our initial outlook, but we will expect an average net shares reduction of about 1% for the year. And net of that change in our share repurchase activity, we expect the Pet Treats acquisition will add roughly $0.02 to our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
With these assumptions in mind, our fiscal 2022 financial outlook, which we updated 2 weeks ago can be seen on Slide [ 27 ]. We expect organic net sales to be towards the higher end of our original range of down 1% to 3%, reflecting stronger-than-expected net sales performance in the first quarter. Given the uncertainty in the demand environment caused by the evolving state of the virus, we have not made meaningful adjustments to our original net sales outlook for the remainder of the year.  constant currency adjusted operating profit and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS to be toward the higher end of our original range of down 2% to 4% and flat to down 2%, respectively, largely due to the impact of the Pet Treats acquisition. 
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion will be approximately 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings. And it's important to note that this outlook excludes the impact of our European Yoplait divestiture. We'll plan to update our guidance to include the impact of that transaction after it closes later in this calendar year. 
Let me now turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks."

Let me kick off our remarks by summarizing today's key messages. General Mills delivered first quarter financial results that were above our expectations in a very dynamic and challenging operating environment.",2384,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me kick off our remarks by summarizing today's key messages. General Mills delivered first quarter financial results that were above our expectations in a very dynamic and challenging operating environment. I'm pleased to say that we're delivering on our fiscal '22 priorities. We remain focused on competing effectively, successfully navigating the challenging supply chain environment and executing our portfolio and organization-reshaping actions without disruption.
Amid these near-term opportunities and challenges, we continue to advance our Accelerate strategy. I'll share some examples today of further progress we've made in reshaping our portfolio, expanding our connected commerce capabilities and being a Force for Good. Finally, as we communicated 2 weeks ago, we now expect to deliver full year fiscal '22 financial results at the higher end of our previous announced guidance ranges.
We expected this year to be dynamic, and that has certainly been the case through the first quarter. The global consumer landscape continues to evolve as we face new variants and see another broad rise in COVID case rates. While the magnitude varies by market and by month, what has remained constant is that at-home food demand remains notably elevated around the world relative to pre-pandemic levels.
The supply chain environment also remains dynamic and challenging. We, like the rest of the industry, are facing rising input cost inflation globally. Our North American market basket has reached its highest point in recent history. And we're seeing significant inflationary pressures across our international markets as well. We now expect total input cost inflation in fiscal '22 will be roughly 7% to 8%, up from our prior estimate of 7% driven by volatile weather, supply and demand imbalances and constrained transportation and labor markets.
To add to the challenge, industry-wide shortages in the labor market, in particular in North America, are impacting not only our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, but also raw material supply and external production capacity. As a result, we're facing service challenges and elevated costs. Within this context, I'm proud of the way that the General Mills team is competing, leveraging the strength of our brands and our advantaged supply chain and sales capabilities to meet customer and consumer needs as well or better than our competition.
Slide 6 summarizes our financial performance for the first quarter. We delivered organic net sales growth of 2%, while adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS were both down 2% in constant currency. Remember that these results compared against double-digit growth across each of these metrics a year ago, and on a 2-year compound basis relative to pre-pandemic levels, our results were up 6% on organic sales, up 9% on adjusted operating profit and up 12% on adjusted diluted EPS. These results exceeded our expectations in each of our 5 operating segments, reflecting our strong execution and elevated demand.
Back in June, we outlined 3 priorities that will be critical for our success in fiscal '22. First, we will continue to compete effectively by executing our Accelerate strategy. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic supply chain environment with a focus on managing both customer service and margins. And third, we will execute our portfolio and organization-reshaping actions without disrupting our base business. I'm pleased to say that we're off to a strong start in each of these areas. Let me show you a few examples of where we're delivering and driving results across these 3 priorities.
We competed effectively yet again in Q1, holding or growing market share and 66% of our priority businesses. This includes the 11th consecutive quarter of share growth in U.S. Cereal, an 80 basis point gain in the quarter and nearly 5 full share points in the past 3 years in Refrigerated Dough in the U.S., 40 basis points of share growth in Nielsen-measured U.S. pet food channels and a 120 basis point gain in global Mexican food. This solid performance is a continuation of a multiyear improvement we made in our end market competitiveness. In fact, we've gained or held share in more than 60% of our priority businesses in each of the past 3 fiscal years. These results have been founded on great execution on the fundamentals, in particular more compelling brand-building and innovation, supported by stronger levels of investment.
As I mentioned earlier, the current operating environment is as dynamic as we've experienced in at least the last decade, resulting in significant input cost inflation, labor shortages and challenges servicing the business. In the face of these challenges, we've stepped up our agility and responsiveness to ensure our customers and consumers can access the food they need, while taking action to manage costs and protect our margins.
For example, as we began to see labor shortages affecting the supply chain, we quickly reinstituted control tower meetings that we had established during the height of the pandemic to better align resources and enable faster decision-making. We're adapting our supply chain network to manage labor shortages. For instance, we're working with suppliers to extend lead times, use supplemental labor and encouraging more full pallet orders. And we're providing holistic incentives to encourage presenteeism in our logistics and manufacturing facilities.
Overall, while our service levels aren't where we would like them to be, we believe our advantaged supply chain is holding up as well or better than our competitors.
To address elevated costs, our first line of defense is always our HMM productivity program. This year, we expect to generate HMM cost savings of roughly 4% of cost of goods sold. We've also stepped up our significant and broad-based SRM efforts across our portfolio, including new actions we've announced since our Q4 earnings call. And we're starting to see those actions translated to increases at the shelf.
In U.S. Retail, our average unit price in Nielsen-measured channels was up mid-single digits in Q1 and accelerated throughout the quarter. We saw a similar trend in Pet, where we're seeing shelf prices move in our international markets as well. It's important to note that we only saw a partial benefit of these pricing actions in Q1, and we'll see more significant benefit in our results in Q2 and beyond. We'll stay close to the cost picture, and if we see more cost headwinds come our way, we'll be prepared to take additional actions to protect our profit outlook.
Shifting gears to portfolio-reshaping, we completed 2 major milestones in the first quarter. On July 6, we closed on the acquisition of the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews dog treats brands from Tyson Foods, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. Dog treats is the second largest segment in pet food at $7 billion in retail sales and growing at a high single-digit rate.
Our newly acquired brands are the leaders in natural meat treats, with differentiated natural products that are aligned to our True Blue Promise, no corn, wheat or soy, no artificial ingredients, and meat as the first ingredient, making them a great fit in our portfolio.
We are now 2 months into the business integration and we're more confident than ever about the growth and value-creation opportunities ahead. In fact, retail sales for Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews were up 20% in Nielsen-measured outlets in the first quarter, and we haven't even begun to plug them into our Blue Buffalo go-to-market model.
With our expanded portfolio, we are now the leading natural player in the dog treats segment, and we've strengthened our position as the #1 overall natural pet food brand in the category. Our Pet segment now generates $2 billion in net sales, with attractive margins and significant growth ahead.
The second piece of portfolio-reshaping news in Q1 relates to the divestiture of our interest in our European Yoplait operations, which we first announced back in March. We signed a definitive agreement on August 27, formalizing the terms of the transaction with Sodiaal. With the agreement in hand, our teams are moving at full speed to close the transaction by the end of calendar 2021.
Overall, these 2 transactions represent significant steps in our effort to reshape our portfolio to drive faster and more profitable growth. At the same time, there is still more work to do, and we continue to look for additional opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and/or divestitures.
In addition to our portfolio-reshaping actions, we continue to advance our Accelerate strategy through investments in our connected commerce capability. Over the last year, you've heard us talk about the concept of connected commerce, which is about building brands across both physical and digital worlds. Connected commerce is powered by data, digital capabilities, measurement and execution to enable General Mills to be part of the consumer journey, creating strong one-to-one relationships and drive differential growth for our brands.
One of our first significant initiatives under the connected commerce banner was the digitization of our Box Tops for Education program. By moving Box Tops to a mobile app platform, we've saved schools the time and hassle of collecting and shipping physical clips, increased the number of participating schools and made it easier for consumers to find and support schools in need and create a unique one-to-one relationship with our consumers. These relationships provide us with receipt-level first-party data, which we can use with appropriate consumer privacy safeguards to spot patterns, experiment, scale up winning tests and launch new capabilities.
For the back-to-school season this year, we've launched a new Box Tops campaign entitled ""Unlock Brighter Futures,"" focused on unlocking the door to more opportunities for families and school communities to get what is needed for every child to achieve their potential. This campaign is building awareness of the Box Tops' mobile app while strengthening our role as a Force for Good in our communities.
Another example of how we're strengthening our connected commerce capability across General Mills is our new mobile platform, Buddies by Blue Buffalo. Buddies allows pet parents to connect to a community of other pet parents and pet experts, consolidates information about their pet across their whole family and provides them with valuable rewards. This new platform allows us to meet pet parents where they are and strengthen our engagement with them throughout their pet's life. Buddies is not just an app, it's a relationship centered on the moments that matter to pet parents.
We're also driving connected commerce in our HÃ¤agen-Dazs business in China, where we're using technology to contemporize the consumer experience. The HÃ¤agen-Dazs smart shop creates an ecosystem and provides consumers with a connected digital experience, both in-store and virtually, via a mobile app and integration with WeChat. The entire consumer journey, from finding a store, browsing the digital menu, placing an order, payment and signing up for a loyalty program can now take place on a mobile phone. The smart shop is helping us engage with new, younger HÃ¤agen-Dazs consumers, and the data its generating enables us to optimize our personalized marketing efforts and refine our promotions.
Connected commerce is an important way we will boldly build our brands in the future. We're encouraged by our first steps to create a differentiated connected commerce capability. And we know there's much more to do, so we'll continue to invest and advance in this space.
At General Mills, it's never just been about the food we make, it's also about how we make it. That's why we innovate and renovate our products to meet consumer needs and why we're advancing regenerative agriculture to support the soil from which our ingredients are grown. We believe being a Force for Good is not just good for the world, it's also good for business. That's why being a Force for Good is a central element of our Accelerate strategy. Because of its importance to our strategy and with the increased interest we hear from you, our investors, on this topic, we plan to highlight different aspects of our Force for Good work on our earnings calls this year.
Over the course of the year, we'll highlight examples that touch on our 4 priority areas: regenerating our planet; improving food security; protecting our people; and strengthening our communities. Given that we recently passed the 1-year anniversary of our racial equity commitments, we wanted to take a moment to provide an update on our efforts in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion.
General Mills has a long history of supporting this work, and while we are very proud of that history, we also know that we can't rely on that history to create the kind of change we need in our world. A year ago, we took a step toward creating that change by making new commitments to equitable food access, equity in education and equity in representation. Given the location of our worldwide headquarters, we took the additional step of establishing the Minnesota Business Coalition for Racial Equity, to push for structural changes that can have a true impact on systemic racism in the State of Minnesota.
I'm proud to report that we've made progress against each of our key focus areas. For example, we partnered with leading national anti-hunger organizations such as the NAACP, Unidos and Share Our Strength. And we've invested in local organizations and we're working to improve government programs to address food and security that disproportionately impacts communities of color.
We also donated to 2 Minnesota-based nonprofit organizations, Black Men Teach and Reimagine Education, that partnered nationally with the LeBron James Family Foundation to create greater equity and education for kids of color, so they can each reach their full potential.
Finally, we continue to make progress on equity and representation in General Mills by focusing on leadership accountability, transparency and allyship. Over the last year, we've increased representation for people of color across all job bands. And for the first time, we can say that 25% of our officers are people of color.
I'm proud of the progress we're making on these important commitments. And at the same time, there is still more work to be done. I look forward to updating you on other aspects of our Force for Good work over the course of this year.
With that, I will pass it over to Kofi to review our financial performance in the first quarter."

First quarter operating cash flow totaled $370 million compared to $584 million a year ago primarily driven by timing-related changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable. Capital investments in the quarter totaled $104 million, and we returned more than $460 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases.
On Slide 26, we provided an update of a few key financial assumptions for fiscal '22. On the cost side, Jeff mentioned that we expect input cost inflation and other supply chain costs will be more of a headwind in fiscal '22 than compared to our initial outlook, where we shared on our Q4 earnings call. We expect input cost inflation will be between 7% and 8% for the year, up from our original outlook of roughly 7%. And we expect labor shortages will drive higher-than-planned costs across the supply chain, from sourcing, to internal and external manufacturing and distribution.
To offset these costs, we expect to deliver HMM cost savings at 4% cost of goods sold. And we've taken some incremental SRM actions on top of broad-based pricing we discussed on our Q4 earnings call. We expect our price/mix to step up in Q2 compared to the 2 points of positive price/mix we generated in Q1.
With a portion of our free cash flow being used to fund the pet treats acquisition, we expect our share repurchase activity will be somewhat less than we assumed in our initial outlook, but we will expect an average net shares reduction of about 1% for the year. And net of that change in our share repurchase activity, we expect the pet treats acquisition will add roughly $0.02 to our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share.
With these assumptions in mind, our fiscal 2022 financial outlook, which we updated 2 weeks ago, can be seen on Slide 27. We expect organic net sales to be towards the higher end of our original range of down 1% to 3%, reflecting stronger-than-expected net sales performance in the first quarter. Given the uncertainty in the demand environment caused by the evolving state of the virus, we have not made meaningful adjustments to our original net sales outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect constant currency adjusted operating profit and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS to be toward the higher end of our original ranges of down 2% to 4% and flat to down 2%, respectively, largely due to the impact of the pet treats acquisition.
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion will be approximately 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings. And it's important to note that this outlook excludes the impact of our European Yoplait divestiture. We'll plan to update our guidance to include the impact of that transaction after it closes later in this calendar year.
Let me now turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks."

As you can obviously see, we gave a little bit wider guidance on operating profit than we did on the top line and EPS as a result of the operating profit-cutting. So it reflects I think what you're alluding to, which is the underlying volatility in this environment, right? So at the root cause of this, we see about an eight to tenfold increase in the amount of disruptions in our supply chain. So the predictability has been on the core, but what we provision and expect in the back half is is not much of an improvement to be candid. 
So as you think about it in relation to last year, we saw a ramp-up in external supply chain costs in the back half of the year. We don't expect the -- these costs that we're seeing for disruptions to really materially change in the balance of our year, the just to replace the ramp-up in most external supply chain costs.

What I would say in this environment, there isn't a huge trade-off -- I'm not sure there is a trade-off between higher service levels and cost. And that's because if we were to take our foot off the gas on service, what we would find is that we create more deleverage and we would incur fines because -- and we'd be more inefficient. 
We get fine from a retail customer because we're more inefficient, and then we'd be shipping truckload stuff, that were probably less efficient. And so there really isn't a cost trade-off. So I don't -- we would not be making more money if we look less at our service. We feel like our responsibility at the end of the day is to the end consumer and making sure they have the products they want and to our retail customers. And by filling that, we're doing our job.

So in some cases, it's user construction is really not any category. In other cases where capacity constrained, obviously, for logistics challenge for all of our businesses. I'd say probably the one area that we do believe we'll get better has moved to the back half and these material disruptions and the to the actions that we're taking or bringing on a alternative suppliers, where in the past, we might have been a single source or particular ingredient, we'll now have options to move to the back half. Our sourcing team has been doing a great job, really identifying solutions, and we'll see some of those things come online for some key ingredients that really hurt us through Q2. 
So I'd say that's the one area that we do expect to get a bit better. We don't expect our service levels to remain challenged through the back half of the year, with the Q3 will look a lot like Q2.

So our service levels during the quarter were in the low to mid-80s versus high 90s at the targets. As a resolve, we couldn't ship all the demand that we saw. So to resolve, retailers drew down a little bit of inventory in the quarter and that was the gap that you talked about. As you look at the back half, we do expect our service levels to be similar to the front half. So we wouldn't expect to materially close that gap as we move through the back half of our fiscal year. 
Clearly, our goal is to continue to strengthen our supply chain as we get into fiscal '23 and beyond. We believe we'll be in better shape and be able to serve a solid bot and that it's there. One of the things that we pivoted to is a new metric on shelf availability, I think that's really important. And while it's certainly not where we want them to be, it is better than our competition. Our share of sales that we're losing due to not being on the shelf is lower than our competition as well, and that's really a testament to our supply chain and the bridge that we're doing and the communication that we have with our customers."

We're leveraging that in a way. It's one of the things Jeff's been committed to for a long period of time, it's really increasing our investments and our capabilities there. And that's starting to bear us fruit. 
So if you think about the number of trucks we have running across North America, if we can ensure that they're move full as they are currently, and that's good for us. It's good for our business, good for our customers, good for our margins. We're starting to leverage some of that technology. We have a host of other initiatives from a data set on analytics standpoint on the supply chain that will help us over time. 
And we're also taking a look at our distribution centers, and there's probably some opportunities to only some of those facilities where we're challenged right now from a labor standpoint. So we have a host of things happening. At the end of the day, communication is probably one of the most important things, communication with our vendors to make sure that we get ingredients when we need them to keep our plants running.

But I think going forward, what you can expect as you move into the back half is a step-up starting in Q3 and the contribution from price mix. I'd expect inflation to be roughly equal front half, back half. So it's pretty evenly spread across the quarter. So it's nothing material there. And then in easing in the drag of a headwind from the other supply chain disruption costs, not because the costs themselves are easing, but because as you think about comparison to last year, we saw a ramp-up in other costs primarily driven by our step into greater external supply chain costs. 
So we don't expect these costs to ease, we expect them to replace a lot of those costs we saw last year. So effectively, that's kind of how we think about the back half of the year and what drives the margin improvement as we step from Q3 to Q4."

So which we're now estimating to be 8% to 9% for the full year, and that implies that obviously, double digits in the back half. The other half is really related to those factors in the disruption in the supply chain, so most of which is driven by the direct costs, the things that Jon alluded to, inefficiency and trade, alternative supply all of the things that we're doing in this environment to ensure that we keep customer service levels high."

You highlighted that your actions to offset supply disruptions and logistics issues -- that they're starting to bear fruit.

So at the root cause of this, we see about an eight to tenfold increase in the amount of disruptions in our supply chain. So the predictability is at -- has been at the core, but what we provision and expect in the back half is not much of an improvement, to be candid.
So as you think about it in relation to last year, we saw a ramp-up in external supply chain costs in the back half of the year. We don't expect the -- these costs that we're seeing for disruptions to really materially change in the balance of our year. They're just to replace the ramp-up in those external supply chain costs.

What I would say, in this environment, there isn't a huge trade-off -- I'm not sure there is a trade-off between higher service levels and cost. And that's because if we were to take our foot off the gas on service, what we would find is that we create more deleverage and we would incur fines because -- I mean, we'd be more inefficient. We'd get fine from a retail customer because we're more inefficient, and then we'd be shipping truckloads of stuff that were probably less efficient.
And so there really isn't a cost trade-off. So I don't -- we would not be making more money if we lessened our service. We feel like our responsibility at the end of the day is to the end consumer and making sure they have the products they want and to our retail customers. And by fulfilling that, we're doing our job.

We would expect our service levels to remain challenged through the back half of the year, with the Q3 looking a lot like Q2. But in Q4, we get a bit better, but look more like Q1. So on average, we think our service will look similar in the back half, in the first half."

We're leveraging data analytics. It's one of the things Jeff's been committed to for a long period of time. It's really increasing our investments and our capabilities there.
And that's starting to bear some fruit. So if you think about the number of trucks we have running across North America, we can ensure that they're more full. And they are currently, and that's good for us. It's good for our business, good for our customers, good for our margins. We're starting to leverage some of that technology.

And we're also taking a look at our distribution centers, and there's probably some opportunities to automate some of those facilities where we're challenged right now from a labor standpoint. So we have a host of things happening.

I'd expect inflation to be roughly equal front half/back half. So it's pretty evenly spread across the quarter. So it's nothing material there. And then an easing in the drag of a headwind from the other supply chain disruption costs, not because the costs themselves are easing, but because as you think about comparison to last year, we saw a ramp-up in other costs, primarily driven by our step into greater external supply chain costs.
So we don't expect these costs to ease. We expect them to replace a lot of those costs we saw last year. So effectively, that's kind of how we think about the back half of the year and what drives the margin improvement as we step from Q3 to Q4."

We continue to compete effectively and execute well in the second quarter in an increasingly challenging operating environment. In the face of an unprecedented combination of input cost inflation and supply chain disruption, we moved quickly to keep our trusted brands in front of consumers. We saw additional cost headwinds come our way during the quarter, and we responded with incremental pricing actions that will go into effect in Q3. 
We also took further steps in Q2 to reshape our portfolio for stronger or profitable growth, in line with our Accelerate strategy. Finally, amid so much volatility. I'm pleased to say that with our updated fiscal '22 guidance, we now expect to meet or exceed each of our key financial targets for the year. Slide 5 summarizes our financial performance for the second quarter and first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, our solid execution, competitive service levels and net price realization contributed to organic net sales growth of 5%. While high single-digit input cost inflation and elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions outstripped our pricing and productivity efforts resulting in a 6% decline in constant currency adjusted operating profit. 
Constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share was down 7% in the quarter. First half results were similar to Q2 with an organic net sales up 4% and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share each down 4% in constant currency. And you can see the strength of our top and bottom line performance through the pandemic. 
with 2-year compound growth rates of 6%, 4% and 6% in the first half, respectively, for organic net sales, constant currency adjusted operating profit and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. When we started fiscal '22, we outlined 3 priorities that will be critical to our success this year. First, we will continue to compete effectively by executing our Accelerate strategy. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic supply chain environment. And third, we will execute our portfolio reshaping actions without disrupting our base business. 
Let me share a few examples of how we're delivering and driving strong results across these 3 priorities thus far this year. General Mills is winning in the marketplace. We're competing effectively in fiscal '22, holding or growing market share in 62% of our priority businesses year-to-date. This includes important global platforms such as cereal, pet, ice cream and Mexican food as well as local gem brands like Pillsbury Refrigerated Dough. Wanchai Ferry frozen dumplings in China and our fruit snacks business in the U.S. This performance has been driven by our continued focus on brand building, innovation and execution, supported with strong levels of investment and is the continuation of an ongoing multiyear story of improved competitiveness that started before the pandemic and continues through the pandemic. The current operating environment is as dynamic and challenging, as I've seen in my 27-plus years in the industry. At-home food demand remained elevated, input cost inflation is at a 10-year high, and labor shortages and other issues are causing disruptions across our supply chain, from our suppliers to manufacturing to distribution. These disruptions are driving down service levels and driving up costs above and beyond inflation throughout the industry. 
In the face of these challenges, we stepped up our agility and responsiveness to ensure our customers and consumers can access the food they need. We've also taken actions to manage costs and support our profitability, including leveraging our strategic revenue management capability to execute significant pricing actions across our portfolio, resulting in organic price/mix stepping up from Q1 to Q2. And we expect a further increase in price/mix in the back half of the year. Later in the presentation, Jon Nudi will share examples of how we're addressing these challenges in North America where inflation and supply chain disruptions have been particularly acute. 
Shifting gears to portfolio reshaping. We executed several strategic moves in the first half of the year. In July, we completed the acquisition of Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews dog treat brands from Tyson Foods, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. Dog treats is the second largest segment in pet food at an estimated $7 billion in retail sales and growing at a high single-digit rate. Combining our newly acquired brands with our Blue Buffalo treats business gives us a powerful treats portfolio that is primed to deliver on pet parents' increasing interest in wholesome natural treating. 
As we continue to integrate these brands into our Pet segment, we are confident in the growth and the value creation opportunities ahead. In fact, retail sales for Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews were up 22% in measured channels in the first half of the year, adding to the 16% growth for our legacy Blue Buffalo treats business. 
Our second significant portfolio reshaping action this year was the completion of our European Yoplait divestiture, which closed at the end of November. This transaction improves our enterprise growth profile, enhances our margin and allows us to focus our resources on our faster-growing priority businesses. 
Yoplait will remain 1 of our local gem brands in the U.S. and in Canada, where we'll now operate on a wholly owned basis. Kofi will share additional detail on the financial impact of this transaction later in the presentation. Also at the end of November, we announced the sale of our dough business in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland to Cérélia. These businesses which represent less than 5% of our Europe and Australia segment net sales include the Knack & Back and Jus-Rol brands. We expect to close these transactions by the end of fiscal 2022 subject to competition approvals. 
Overall, these 3 transactions represent further progress on our Accelerate strategy which include clear priorities on where to play across geographies as well as platforms and brands to drive long-term, superior shareholder returns. We made significant progress here, and there is still more work to do. We continue to look for opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. Another critical element of our accelerated strategy is our focus on being a force for good in the world as a company and through our brands. 
As I mentioned last quarter, we plan to regularly highlight different aspects of our Force for Good work on our earnings calls this year, touching on 4 priority areas: regenerating our planet, improving food security, protecting our people and strengthening our communities. As we enter an important season of giving for many around the world, we thought it would be a good opportunity to highlight General Mills impact on our communities and in particular, our commitment to charitable giving. 
In fiscal 2021, General Mills donated approximately $100 million to charitable causes across our key global markets. Roughly 60% of that was in the form of food donations to the world's leading food bank networks, including Feeding America and the Global Food Banking Network, translating into 41 million meals for families and individuals. During the last school year, more than 80,000 schools in the U.S. benefited from our Box Tops for Education program, which has provided more than $940 million to schools since the program began in 1996. In addition, we recently increased our focus and funding on closing racial disparity gaps in household food security and improving equitable food access. 
And even as a pandemic has continued to disrupt communities and organizations everywhere, General Mills employees continue to give back through COVID-friendly volunteerism events as well as through our workplace giving program. I am proud of our company's long-standing commitment to supporting communities and using our charitable giving to advance key social and environmental outcomes. Not only are these actions good for people and the planet, they are also good for our business. 
With that, I pass it to Jon Nudi, who will cover our North America Retail segment."

I appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on our North American retail business today. Let me begin with a quick overview of our segment, which generated $11 billion in net sales last year. We operate a broad por",1676,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on our North American retail business today. Let me begin with a quick overview of our segment, which generated $11 billion in net sales last year. We operate a broad portfolio of trusted leading brands across more than 25 categories in the U.S. and Canada. We serve millions of consumers every day, and our products are enjoyed by around 95% of households each year. 
North America retail has driven strong growth in net sales and operating profit over the past 2 years. While the rise of at-home demand from the pandemic has been a key contributor, we've also outperformed our competition during this time due to improved execution, stronger support behind brand building and innovation and greater alignment of our people and structure with our strategy. Top priorities of the company in recent years has been to compete effectively. 
I'm tremendously proud of the way that we've improved our competitiveness in North American retail over the past 4 years, leveraging stronger brand building and innovation that meets consumers' needs. Consumer demand remains elevated relative to prepandemic levels. Our second quarter U.S. retail sales were up 4% versus last year and up 6% on a 2-year compound basis, acceleration from the trend in the previous 4 quarters. We continue to compete well amid this demand picture as we have for the past several years. 
Before the pandemic started, we are holding or growing share in 55% of our U.S. retail business. When the pandemic started, that metric improved to 65%, and our strong performance has continued in fiscal '22 with more than 60% of our U.S. retail sales base holding or growing share year-to-date. These results have been led by long-term share gains in key categories, including cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks and Mexican Foods. Strong focus on the fundamentals has fueled a multiyear success story in U.S. cereal where General Mills has posted market share gains for 37 consecutive months, 12 consecutive quarters and 4 consecutive years strengthening our position as the #1 player in the category. 
To be clear, our performance is not driven by short-term competitive supply chain dislocations. It's a result of consistently bringing compelling consumer ideas, relevant innovation, strong levels of investment and excellent execution to the best brands in the category. On product innovation that exemplifies this is Cheerios Oat Crunch. We first launched this subline, a cinnamon variety 2 years ago, bringing a more complex taste and texture to the largest franchise in the category, appealing to older children and adults. 
Oat Crunch has proven to be highly incremental to Materials franchise and the category and now it represents 1% market share in the U.S. cereal category across 3 great-tasting varieties. Our track record in Pillsbury refrigerated dough is equally compelling. Retail sales for this business have grown 30% in the last 4 years. We're working on our fourth consecutive year of expanding our category leadership. Our market share is now at 72% and household penetration has reached 58%, which is up almost 5 points versus prepandemic levels. 
Consumers are consistently finding that Pillsbury delivers what they need for meal and holiday solutions, something comforting, delicious, convenient and affordable. [indiscernible] memories you'll make messaging is resonating with consumers during this key baking season. 
One critical way [indiscernible] to continue future growth on Pillsbury is to increase our relevance with Hispanic consumers. We're shifting our activation plans and doing a better job of intentionally reaching out to this growing cohort. We've seen an increase of almost 4 points in Pillsbury Hispanic household penetration over the past 2 years. 
We're excited about continuing to provide products and solutions for these new consumers and solidifying our growth for years to come. In fruit snacks, we've expanded our U.S. share leadership in recent years, driven by our breadth and depth of products that serve the needs of all ages from tots to teens. This includes our Mott’s real fruit and veggie juice shakes, winning kid [indiscernible] like Space Jam shakes, fun new varieties on our Annie's line and differentiated brands like Fruit Roll-Ups, Fruit by the Foot and Gushers. 
Before the pandemic, our fruit snacks business was driving growth by expanding into new formats and into the seasonal aisle to capture new usage occasions. When the pandemic hit, we responded quickly and continued our momentum by delivering our consumers' desires for frictionless all family snacking. These efforts have helped unlock terrific results, including year-to-date retail sales growth of 18%. We significantly increased our capacity in recent years to keep pace with a nearly 40% increase in retail sales since fiscal 2018. 
As we look ahead, we expect to invest further in capacity to support what we see a long runway of continued growth for this attractive business. Finally, Old El Paso has led the Mexican food category with 3-plus years of share gains through compelling consumer news and innovation. We've introduced exciting product innovations like bold flavored stand-up taco shells, street Taco Kits and squeeze sauces. We're also bringing taco pockets to North American retail in 2022 after a hugely successful launch in Europe and Australia last year. 
Old El Paso has been leveraging our connected commerce capability, utilizing data-driven personalized messaging with shoppable media to drive improved ROIs. It's not only driven share gains, it has helped drive nearly 4 points of increased household penetration, 39% growth in retail sales over the past 4 years. Shifting gears, the consumer landscape continues to evolve as we face new variants and see ongoing fluctuations in COVID case rates. While the magnitude varies by market and by month, what has remained constant is that at-home food demand remains elevated relative to prepandemic levels. 
As Jeff mentioned earlier, the supply chain environment is as challenging as we've seen in decades. We, like the rest of the industry, are facing rising input cost inflation. In fact, our North American market basket has reached its highest point in recent history. To add to the challenge, industry-wide shortages in the labor market are impacting every part of the supply chain at a significant costs that are above and beyond inflation. We're seeing record levels of disruptions across our raw material suppliers, internal and external production facilities, our own distribution centers, our customers' warehouses and the logistics networks required to connect each of these elements of the supply chain. 
These disruptions are resulting in service challenges and elevated costs across the industry. For example, when suppliers' labor shortages limit their ability to deliver a key ingredient to one of our factories, we either need to shut down our lines or reposition that ingredient from another manufacturing location, both of which increase costs. Another example, we may be able to procure ingredients, manufacture the product and have it ready to ship. 
But if a carrier can't make the scheduled pickup because of a driver shortage, we run the risk of missing our customers on time and in full delivery window, thus leading to fines and fees. These examples are just a few of the many challenges we and the rest of the industry are facing daily. In the face of labor shortages and disruptions across the supply chain, our teams are focused on remaining agile to secure supply and ensure our customers and consumers can get access to the food they need. For example, so far this year, we've reinstituted control tower teams that we set up at the outset of the pandemic helping to facilitate quicker decision-making. We've secured alternative sources of supply and increased internal inventory levels on some constrained raw materials. 
We've developed new risk metrics and alerts to proactively identify challenges. We've increased the frequency of our communication with our vendors and our customers to ensure that we're working as one supply chain. I'm pleased to say these actions are making a difference and are enabling us to service our customers better than our competition, which we can see in Nielsen measured data. 
In the second quarter, our on-shelf availability in the U.S. outpaced our categories. Our service is better than the leading competitor in 7 of our top 10 categories. We under-indexed on lost sales from out of stocks by almost 20%. We have also seen our share of distribution grow every month since the onset of the pandemic. While our service levels remain in the mid-80% range compared to the high 90s that we would typically deliver in a normal environment, we hear from our customers that our performance during pandemic has been consistently leading among food manufacturers. At the same time, we are leveraging our enhanced SRM capabilities to address the significant inflation and costs related to supply chain disruptions. Already this fiscal year, we have announced multiple rounds of pricing across our portfolio, utilizing all 4 SRM levers: list pricing, promotion optimization, pack price architecture and mix management. 
We're seeing the impact of these actions flowing through in the market with our average unit prices rising steadily over the course of the year. As I look at the business today, I am struck by the advancements we've made in North America and retail in recent years. 
And I am confident we are a stronger business today than we were before the pandemic. Our brands are more relevant with consumers. Our household penetration is up, strength in critical capabilities like connected commerce and SRM and our team is more agile today than has ever been before. As we enter the holiday season, I'm reminded of the importance of our work. Families across the U.S. and Canada are able enjoy holiday staples such as the Pillsbury Crescent rolls, Betty Crocker cookies and Chex party mix because of what we do every day. I'm proud of the progress we've made in North America retail over the past few years, and I'm excited about our opportunity to build on that momentum and drive profitable growth in the years ahead. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Kofi to review our financial performance in the quarter."

Let's start with our second quarter financial results on Slide 24. Net sales of $5 billion were up 6%. And organic net sales grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting our strong execution, broad-based SRM actions and continued elevated demand versus the pre-pandemic period. 
Adjusted operating profit of $821 million was down 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by input cost inflation and higher other cost of goods sold, including costs related to supply chain disruptions, partially offset by favorable price/mix, holistic margin management, cost savings and lower SG&A expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the quarter, down 7% in constant currency. 
On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 6%.  Adjusted operating profit was flat in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 1% in constant currency. Slide 25 summarizes the components of net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 5%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Foreign exchange was a 1 point benefit in the quarter and our acquisition and divestiture activity added 1 point to reported net sales growth. 
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America retail on Slide 26. The Second quarter organic net sales were up 1%, driven primarily by favorable price mix, partially offset by lower volume. 
Because of the service challenges caused by the current supply chain environment, our net sales lagged retail sales growth by roughly 2 points in the quarter. Net sales growth in U.S. Snacks and U.S. Cereal were partially offset by a decline in U.S. meals and baking. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 5%. As Jon mentioned, we continue to compete effectively in NAR. Fiscal year-to-date, we grew or held market share in 62% of our U.S. retail sales, and we posted solid share gains in Canada. 
Second quarter constant currency segment operating profit decreased 8%, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume, partially offset by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was flat. Second quarter net sales for our pet segment increased 29%, including 15 points of benefit from the pet treats acquisition. Organic net sales were up 14% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in both dog food and cat food. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 16%. 
In the first half of the fiscal year, the Blue Buffalo brand continued to drive strong retail sales growth and market share gains in measured channels. And as Jeff mentioned, the nudges, True Choose and Top Cheese brands generated year-to-date retail sales growth of 22%. On the bottom line, segment operating profit increased 10% to $132 million, driven primarily by higher volume and favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses. Profit results in the quarter included a onetime inventory adjustment and other acquisition-related expenses totaling $11 million. 
On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 28%. Turning to Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment results on Slide 28. Organic net sales grew 23% in the quarter, reflecting increased away-from-home food demand in the U.S. including higher year-over-year consumer traffic in schools, restaurants, lodging and C-stores as well as market index pricing on bakery flour. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 3%. 
Segment operating profit increased 20% in the quarter, driven primarily by positive price mix and higher volume partially offset by higher input costs. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit decreased 10%. In Europe and Australia, second quarter organic net sales were down 2% due to declines in yogurt and dough. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were flat. We continue to compete effectively, growing year-to-date market share in Mexican food and snack bars. 
Second quarter segment operating profit totaled $16 million compared to $36 million a year ago, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was down 35%. In Asia and Latin America, second quarter organic net sales increased 5%, driven by Yoki Meals and Snacks in Brazil. On a 2-year compound basis, net sales were up 7% and second quarter segment operating profit increased 40% in constant currency, driven primarily by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 23%. 
Slide 31 summarizes our joint venture results in the second quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were down 2% in constant currency, reflecting a difficult comparison against elevated at-home demand a year ago. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 8% in constant currency, including strong contributions from innovation. Second quarter after-tax earnings from joint ventures of $33 million were down 9%, driven by lower profit at CPW. On a 2-year compound growth basis, combined after-tax earnings were up 15%. 
Now let's turn to total company margin results on Slide 32. While significant benefits from positive price/mix and HMM cost savings were sufficient to offset high single-digit input cost inflation in the quarter, the large step-up in costs due to supply chain disruptions, combined with volume deleverage drove adjusted gross margin down by 3 points. Adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter was down 200 basis points, driven by lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. 
As Jeff and Jon mentioned, we're moving quickly to address the increasing cost environment, including announcing incremental SRM actions that will take effect in January, providing a partial benefit in Q3 and a full benefit in Q4. Slide 33 summarizes other noteworthy Q2 income statement items. Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased by $12 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $8 million, driven primarily by lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with last year at 22.3%. And average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%, reflecting our share repurchase activity. 
Our fiscal 2022 first half results are summarized on Slide 34. The Net sales of $9.6 billion were up 5%. Organic net sales increased 4%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Year-to-date, adjusted operating profit of $1.6 billion decreased 4% in constant currency. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.98 were also down 4% in constant currency. And on a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were up 6%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit was up 4% and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was up 6%. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First half operating cash flow increased 5% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by changes in inventory, partially offset by changes in accounts payable. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $224 million. And we returned nearly $1 billion in cash to shareholders in the first half of the year through dividends and net share repurchases. 
Slide 36 provides a brief summary of the financial impact of the Yoplait Europe divestiture, which closed on November 30. We expect the transaction will reduce reported net sales by approximately $700 million on a 12-month basis. Taking into consideration the associated reduction in operating profit, partially offset by lower interest expense and noncontrolling interest, we expect the divestiture to reduce adjusted diluted EPS by roughly 1% in the first 12 months after the close. From a portfolio standpoint, this transaction significantly increases our Europe and Australia segments focus on our faster-growing, higher-margin platforms, including Mexican food, ice cream and snack bars. 
On Slide 37, we provided an update on some key financial assumptions for the second half of fiscal '22. First, we expect price mix to step up further in the second half, reflecting additional SRM actions that will take effect in January. On the cost side, we expect double-digit input cost inflation in the back half. I should note that at this point in the year, we are more than 80% covered on our raw and packaging material spend for fiscal 2022. On a full year basis, we are now estimating cost of goods sold headwinds be approximately $500 million higher than what was assumed in our initial fiscal 2022 outlook. This includes full year input cost inflation. We now estimate to be 8% to 9% as well as elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions. While it's difficult to forecast, we expect the operating environment will continue to be challenged by labor shortages and other disruptions in the back half, and we expect our second half customer service levels will be generally in line with first half. 
Finally, from a phasing standpoint, we expect these assumptions to result in back half adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted more heavily to Q4. With these assumptions in mind, our updated fiscal 2022 financial outlook can be seen on Slide 38. Organic net sales are now expected to increase 4% to 5% compared to the previous guidance that was toward the higher end of the range of down 1% to 3%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit is expected to be down 1% to 4%, which now includes a 1-point drag from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of down 2% to 4%. We expect constant currency adjusted diluted EPS to range between down 2% and up 1%, including a 1-point headwind from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of flat to down 2%. We expect free cash flow conversion will be at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings. 
Finally, the net impact of divestitures, acquisitions and foreign currency exchange is expected to reduce full year reported net sales growth by approximately 1% and foreign currency is not expected to have a material impact on adjusted operating profit or adjusted diluted EPS. 
Let me now turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks."

We continued to compete effectively and execute well in the second quarter in an increasingly challenging operating environment. 
In the face of an unprecedented combination of input cost inflation and supply chain disruption, we moved quickly to keep our trusted brands in front of consumers. We saw additional cost headwinds come our way during the quarter, and we responded with incremental pricing actions that will go into effect in Q3. We also took further steps in Q2 to reshape our portfolio for stronger, more profitable growth, in line with our Accelerate strategy. Finally, amid so much volatility, I'm pleased to say that with our updated fiscal '22 guidance, we now expect to meet or exceed each of our key financial targets for the year. 
Slide 5 summarizes our financial performance for the second quarter and first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, our solid execution, competitive service levels and net price realization contributed to organic net sales growth of 5%, while high single-digit input cost inflation and elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions outstripped our pricing and productivity efforts, resulting in a 6% decline in constant currency adjusted operating profit. Constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share was down 7% in the quarter. 
First half results were similar to Q2, with an organic net sales up 4% and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share each down 4% in constant currency. And you can see the strength of our top and bottom line performance through the pandemic, with 2 year compound growth rates of 6%, 4% and 6% in the first half, respectively, for organic net sales, constant currency adjusted operating profit and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS. 
When we started fiscal '22, we outlined 3 priorities that will be critical to our success this year. First, we will continue to compete effectively by executing our Accelerate strategy. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic supply chain environment. And third, we will execute our portfolio reshaping actions without disrupting our base business. Let me share a few examples of how we're delivering and driving strong results across these 3 priorities thus far this year. 
General Mills is winning in the marketplace. We're competing effectively in fiscal '22, holding or growing market share and 62% of our priority businesses year-to-date. This includes important global platforms, such as cereal, pet, ice cream and Mexican food; as well as local gem brands like Pillsbury refrigerated dough, Wanchai Ferry frozen dumplings in China and our fruit snacks business in the U.S. This performance has been driven by our continued focus on brand building, innovation and execution, supported with strong levels of investment, and is the continuation of an ongoing multiyear story of improved competitiveness that started before the pandemic and continues through the pandemic. 
The current operating environment is as dynamic and challenging as I've seen in my 27-plus years in the industry. At-home food demand remained elevated, input cost inflation is at a 10-year high and labor shortages and other issues are causing disruptions across our supply chain, from our suppliers to manufacturing to distribution. These disruptions are driving down service levels and driving up costs above and beyond inflation throughout the industry. 
In the face of these challenges, we stepped up our agility and responsiveness to ensure our customers and consumers can access the food they need. We've also taken actions to manage cost and support our profitability, including leveraging our strategic revenue management capability to execute significant pricing actions across our portfolio, resulting in organic price/mix stepping up from Q1 to Q2, and we expect a further increase in price/mix in the back half of the year. 
Later in the presentation, Jon Nudi will share examples of how we're addressing these challenges in North America, where inflation and supply chain disruptions have been particularly acute. 
Shifting gears to portfolio reshaping. We executed several strategic moves in the first half of the year. In July, we completed the acquisition of Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews dog treat brands from Tyson Foods, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. Dog treats is the second-largest segment in pet food at an estimated $7 billion in retail sales and growing at a high single-digit rate. Combining our newly acquired brands with our Blue Buffalo treats business gives us a powerful treats portfolio that is primed to deliver on pet parents' increasing interest in wholesome, natural treating. 
As we continue to integrate these brands into our Pet segment, we are confident in the growth and the value creation opportunities ahead. In fact, retail sales for Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews were up 22% in measured channels in the first half of the year, adding to the 16% growth for our legacy Blue Buffalo treats business. 
Our second significant portfolio reshaping action this year was the completion of our European Yoplait divestiture which closed at the end of November. This transaction improves our enterprise growth profile, enhances our margin and allows us to focus our resources on our faster-growing priority businesses. Yoplait will remain one of our local gem brands in the U.S. and in Canada, where we'll now operate on a wholly owned basis. Kofi will share additional detail on the financial impact of this transaction later in the presentation. 
Also at the end of November, we announced the sale of our dough business in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland to o Cérélia. These businesses, which represent less than 5% of our Europe & Australia segment net sales, include the Knack & Back and Jus-Rol brands. We expect to close these transactions by the end of fiscal 2022, subject to competition approvals. 
Overall, these 3 transactions represent further progress on our Accelerate strategy, which include clear priorities on where to play across geographies, as well as platforms and brands, to drive long-term superior shareholder returns. We've made significant progress here, and there is still more work to do. We continue to look for opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. 
Another critical element of our Accelerate strategy is our focus on being a Force for Good in the world, as a company and through our brands. As I mentioned last quarter, we plan to regularly highlight different aspects of our Force for Good work on our earnings calls this year, touching on 4 priority areas: Regenerating our planet, improving food security, protecting our people and strengthening our communities. 
As we enter an important season of giving for many around the world, we thought it would be a good opportunity to highlight General Mills' impact on our communities, and in particular, our commitment to charitable giving. In fiscal 2021, General Mills donated approximately $100 million to charitable causes across our key global markets. Roughly 60% of that was in the form of food donations to the world's leading food bank networks, including Feeding America and the Global FoodBanking Network, translating into 41 million meals for families and individuals. 
During the last school year, more than 80,000 schools in the U.S. benefited from our Box Tops for Education program, which has provided more than $940 million to schools since the program began in 1996. 
In addition, we recently increased our focus and funding on closing racial disparity gaps in household food security and improving equitable food access. And even as the pandemic has continued to disrupt communities and organizations everywhere, General Mills employees continued to give back through COVID-friendly volunteerism events as well as through our workplace giving program. 
I am proud of our company's long-standing commitment to supporting communities and using our charitable giving to advance key social and environmental outcomes. Not only are these actions good for people and the planet, they are also good for our business. 
With that, I pass it to Jon Nudi, who will cover our North America Retail segment."

Let me begin with a quick overview of our segment, which generated $11 billion in net sales last year. We operate a broad portfolio of trusted, leading brands across more than 25 categories in the U.S. and Canada. We serve millions of consumers every day, and our products are enjoyed by around 95% of households each year. 
North America Retail has driven strong growth in net sales and operating profit over the past 2 years. While the rise of at-home demand from the pandemic has been a key contributor, we've also outperformed our competition during this time due to improved execution, stronger support behind brand building and innovation and greater alignment of our people and structure with our strategy. 
Top priority as a company in recent years has been to compete effectively. I'm tremendously proud of the way that we've improved our competitiveness in North America Retail over the past 4 years, leveraging stronger brand building and innovation that meets consumers' needs. 
Consumer demand remains elevated relative to pre pandemic levels. Our second quarter U.S. retail sales were up 4% versus last year and up 6% on a 2-year compound basis, acceleration from the trend in the previous 4 quarters. 
We continue to compete well amid this demand picture, as we have for the past several years. Before the pandemic started, we were holding or growing share at 55% of our U.S. retail business. The pandemic started, that metric improved to 65%. And our strong performance has continued in fiscal '22, with more than 60% of our U.S. retail sales base holding or growing share year-to-date. These results have been led by long-term share gains in key categories, including cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks and Mexican foods. 
Strong focus on the fundamentals has fueled a multiyear success story in U.S. cereal, where General Mills has posted market share gains for 37 consecutive months, 12 consecutive quarters and 4 consecutive years, strengthening our position as the #1 player in the category. 
To be clear, our performance is not driven by short-term competitive supply chain dislocations, it's the result of consistently bringing compelling consumer ideas, relevant innovation, strong levels of investment and excellent execution to the best brands in the category. 
One product innovation that exemplifies this is Cheerios Oat Crunch. We first launched this subline, the cinnamon variety, 2 years ago, bringing more complex taste and texture to the largest franchise in the category, appealing to older children and adults. Oat Crunch has proven to be highly incremental to the Cheerios franchise and the category and now represents a 1% market share in the U.S. cereal category across 3 great-tasting varieties. 
Our track record in Pillsbury refrigerated dough is equally compelling. Retail sales for this business have grown 30% in the last 4 years. We're working on our fourth consecutive year of expanding our category leadership. Our market share is now at 72%, and household penetration has reached 58%, which is up almost 5 points versus pre-pandemic levels. 
Consumers are consistently finding that Pillsbury delivers what they need for meal and holiday solutions, something comforting, delicious, convenient and affordable. And our Imagine the Memories You'll Make messaging is resonating with consumers during this key baking season. 
One critical way we're working to continue future growth in Pillsbury is to increase our relevance with Hispanic consumers. We're shifting our activation plans and doing a better job of intentionally reaching out to this growing cohort. We've seen an increase of almost 4 points in Pillsbury's Hispanic household penetration over the past 2 years. We are excited about continuing to provide products and solutions for these new consumers and solidifying our growth for years to come. 
On fruit snacks, we've expanded our U.S. share leadership in recent years, driven by our breadth and depth of products that serve the needs of all ages, from tots to teens. This includes our Mott's real fruit and veggie juice shakes; winning kid equities like Space Jam shakes; fun new varieties on our Annie's line; and differentiated brands like Fruit Roll-Ups, Fruit by the Foot and Gushers. 
Before the pandemic, our fruit snacks business was driving growth by expanding into new formats and into the seasonal aisle to capture new usage occasions. When the pandemic hit, we responded quickly and continued our momentum by delivering on consumers' desires for frictionless, all-family snacking. These efforts have helped unlock terrific results, including year-to-date retail sales growth of 18%. 
We significantly increased our capacity in recent years to keep pace with a nearly 40% increase in retail sales since fiscal 2018. And as we look ahead, we expect to invest further in capacity to support what we is a long runway of continued growth for this attractive business. 
Finally, Old El Paso has led the Mexican food category with 3-plus years of share gains through compelling consumer news and innovation. We've introduced exciting product innovations, like bold-flavored stand-up taco shells, street taco kits and squeeze sauces. We're also bringing taco pockets to North American retail in 2022 after a hugely successful launch in Europe and Australia last year. 
Old El Paso has been leveraging our connected commerce capability, utilizing data-driven, personalized messaging with shoppable media to drive improved ROIs. It's not only driven share gains, it has helped drive nearly 4 points of increased household penetration and 39% growth in retail sales over the past 4 years. 
Shifting gears. The consumer landscape continues to evolve as we face new variants and see ongoing fluctuations in COVID case rates. While the magnitude varies by market and by month, what has remained constant is that at-home food demand remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. 
As Jeff mentioned earlier, the supply chain environment is as challenging as we've seen in decades. We, like the rest of the industry, are facing rising input cost inflation. In fact, our North American market basket has reached its highest point in recent history. To add to the challenge, industry-wide shortages in the labor market are impacting every part of the supply chain, adding significant costs that are above and beyond inflation. 
We're seeing record levels of disruptions across our raw material suppliers, internal and external production facilities, our own distribution centers, our customers' warehouses and the logistics networks required to connect each of these elements of the supply chain. These disruptions are resulting in service challenges and elevated costs across the industry. 
For example, when a supplier's labor shortages limit their ability to deliver a key ingredient to one of our factories, we either need to shut down our lines or reposition that ingredient from another manufacturing location, both of which increase costs. 
Another example. We may be able to procure ingredients, manufacture the product and have it ready to ship. But if our carrier can't make the scheduled pickup because of a driver shortage, we run the risk of missing our customers' on time and in full delivery window, thus leading to fines and fees. These examples are just a few of the many challenges we and the rest of the industry are facing daily. 
In the face of labor shortages and disruptions across the supply chain, our teams are focused on remaining agile to secure supply and ensure our customers and consumers can get access to the food they need. For example, so far this year, we've reinstituted control tower teams that we set up at the outset of the pandemic, helping to facilitate quicker decision making. We've secured alternative sources of supply and increased internal inventory levels on some constrained raw materials. We've developed new risk metrics in order to proactively identify challenges. We've increased the frequency of our communication with our vendors and our customers to ensure that we're working as one supply chain. 
I'm pleased to say these actions are making a difference and are enabling us to service our customers better than our competition, which we can see in Nielsen measured data. In the second quarter, our on-shelf availability in the U.S. outpaced our categories. Our service was better than a leading competitor in 7 of our top 10 categories. And we under-indexed on lost sales from out-of-stocks by almost 20%. We have also seen our share of distribution grow every month since the onset of the pandemic. 
And while our service levels remain in the mid-80% range compared to the high 90s that we would typically deliver in a normal environment, we hear from our customers that our performance during the pandemic has been consistently leading among food manufacturers. 
At the same time, we are leveraging our enhanced SRM capabilities to address the significant inflation and costs related to supply chain disruptions. Already this fiscal year, we have announced multiple rounds of pricing across our portfolio, utilizing all 4 SRM levers: list pricing, promotion optimization, pack price architecture and mix management. And we're seeing the impact of these actions flowing through in the market, with our average unit prices rising steadily over the course of the year. 
As I look at the business today, I am struck by the advancements we've made in North American retail in recent years, and I am confident we are a stronger business today than we were before the pandemic. Our brands are more relevant with consumers; our household penetration is up; we've strengthened critical capabilities, like connected commerce and SRM; and our team is more agile today than it's ever been before. 
As we enter the holiday season, I'm reminded of the importance of our work. Families across the U.S. and Canada are able to enjoy holiday staples, such as Pillsbury crescent rolls, Betty Crocker cookies and Chex party mix because of what we do every day. I'm proud of the progress we've made in North America Retail over the past few years, and I'm excited about our opportunity to build on that momentum and drive profitable growth in the years ahead. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Kofi to review our financial performance in the quarter."

Organic net sales grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting our strong execution, broad-based SRM actions and continued elevated demand versus the pre-pandemic period. 
Adjusted operating profit of $821 million was down 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by input cost inflation and higher other cost of goods sold, including costs related to supply chain disruptions, partially offset by favorable price/mix, holistic margin management cost savings and lower SG&A expenses. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the quarter, down 7% in constant currency. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 6%. Adjusted operating profit was flat in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 1% in constant currency. 
Slide 25 summarizes the components of net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 5%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Foreign exchange was a 1 point benefit in the quarter, and our acquisition and divestiture activity added 1 point to reported net sales growth. 
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America Retail on Slide 26. Second quarter organic net sales were up 1%, driven primarily by favorable price/mix, partially offset by lower volume. Because of the service challenges caused by the current supply chain environment, our net sales lagged retail sales growth by roughly 2 points in the quarter. Net sales growth in U.S. Snacks and U.S. Cereal were partially offset by a decline in U.S. Meals & Baking. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 5%. 
As Jon mentioned, we continue to compete effectively in NAR. Fiscal year-to-date, we grew or held market share in 62% of our U.S. retail sales, and we posted solid share gains in Canada. Second quarter constant currency segment operating profit decreased 8%, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume, partially offset by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was flat. 
Second quarter net sales for our Pet segment increased 29%, including 15 points of benefit from the pet treat acquisition. Organic net sales were up 14% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in both dog food and cat food. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 16%. 
In the first half of the fiscal year, the Blue Buffalo brand continued to drive strong retail sales growth and market share gains in measured channels. And as Jeff mentioned, the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands generated year-to-date retail sales growth of 22%. 
On the bottom line, segment operating profit increased 10% to $132 million, driven primarily by higher volume and favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses. 
Profit results in the quarter included a onetime inventory adjustment and other acquisition-related expenses totaling $11 million. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 28%. 
Turning to Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment results on Slide 28. Organic net sales grew 23% in the quarter, reflecting increased away-from-home food demand in the U.S., including higher year-over-year consumer traffic in schools, restaurants, lodging and C-stores as well as market index pricing on bakery flour. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 3%. 
Segment operating profit increased 20% in the quarter, driven primarily by positive price/mix and higher volume, partially offset by higher input costs. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit decreased 10%. 
In Europe & Australia, second quarter organic net sales were down 2% due to declines in yogurt and dough. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were flat. 
We continue to compete effectively, growing year-to-date market share in Mexican Food and Snack Bars. Second quarter segment operating profit totaled $16 million compared to $36 million a year ago, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was down 35%. 
In Asia & Latin America, second quarter organic net sales increased 5%, driven by Yoki meals and snacks in Brazil. On a 2-year compound basis, net sales were up 7%. Second quarter segment operating profit increased 40% in constant currency, driven primarily by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 23%. 
Slide 31 summarizes our joint venture results in the second quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were down 2% in constant currency, reflecting a difficult comparison against elevated at-home demand a year ago. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 8% in constant currency, including strong contributions from innovation. Second quarter after-tax earnings from joint ventures of $33 million were down 9%, driven by lower profit at CPW. On a 2-year compound growth basis, combined after-tax earnings were up 15%. 
Now let's turn to total company margin results on Slide 32. While significant benefits from positive price/mix and HMM cost savings were sufficient to offset high single-digit input cost inflation in the quarter; the large step-up in costs due to supply chain disruptions, combined with volume deleverage, drove adjusted gross margin down by 3 points. 
Adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter was down 200 basis points, driven by lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. As Jeff and Jon mentioned, we're moving quickly to address the increasing cost environment, including announcing incremental SRM actions that will take effect in January, providing a partial benefit in Q3 and a full benefit in Q4. 
Slide 33 summarizes other noteworthy Q2 income statement items. Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased by $12 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $8 million, driven primarily by lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with last year at 22.3%. And average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%, reflecting our share repurchase activity. 
Our fiscal 2022 first half results are summarized on Slide 34. Net sales of $9.6 billion were up 5%. Organic net sales increased 4%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit of $1.6 billion decreased 4% in constant currency. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.98 were also down 4% in constant currency. And on a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were up 6%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit was up 4%, and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was up 6%. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First half operating cash flow increased 5% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by changes in inventory, partially offset by changes in accounts payable. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $224 million. And we returned nearly $1 billion in cash to shareholders in the first half of the year through dividends and net share repurchases. 
Slide 36 provides a brief summary of the financial impact of the Yoplait Europe divestiture which closed on November 30. We expect the transaction will reduce reported net sales by approximately $700 million on a 12-month basis. Taking into consideration the associated reduction in operating profit, partially offset by lower interest expense and noncontrolling interest, we expect the divestiture to reduce adjusted diluted EPS by roughly 1% in the first 12 months after the close. 
From a portfolio standpoint, this transaction significantly increases our Europe & Australia segment's focus on our faster-growing, higher-margin platforms, including Mexican food, ice cream and snack bars. 
On Slide 37, we provided an update on some key financial assumptions for the second half of fiscal '22. First, we expect price/mix to step up further in the second half, reflecting additional SRM actions that will take effect in January. On the cost side, we expect double-digit input cost inflation in the back half. I should note that at this point in the year, we are more than 80% covered on our raw and packaging material spend for fiscal 2022. On a full year basis, we are now estimating cost of goods sold headwinds to be approximately $500 million higher than what was assumed in our initial fiscal 2022 outlook. This includes full year input cost inflation we now estimate to be 8% to 9% as well as elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions. 
While it's difficult to forecast, we expect the operating environment will continue to be challenged by labor shortages and other disruptions in the back half, and we expect our second half customer service levels will be generally in line with first half. Finally, from a phasing standpoint, we expect these assumptions to result in back half adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted more heavily to Q4. 
With these assumptions in mind, our updated fiscal 2022 financial outlook can be seen on Slide 38. Organic net sales are now expected to increase 4% to 5% compared to the previous guidance that was toward the higher end of the range of down 1% to 3%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit is expected to be down 1% to 4%, which now includes a 1 point drag from the Yoplait Europe divestiture.. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of down 2% to 4%. 
We expect constant currency adjusted diluted EPS to range between down 2% and up 1%, including a 1 point headwind from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of flat to down 2%. 
We expect free cash flow conversion will be at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings. 
Finally, the net impact of divestitures, acquisitions and foreign currency exchange is expected to reduce full year reported net sales growth by approximately 1%. And foreign currency is not expected to have a material impact on adjusted operating profit or adjusted diluted EPS. 
Let me now turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks."

You highlighted that your actions to offset supply disruptions and logistics issues -- that they're starting to bear fruit. Great to hear, obviously, but we've sort of been seeing a similar pattern from the whole sector for a while now, right, where these, I guess, ""hidden costs"" are rising, management teams think the worst is over, and then the next quarter, unfortunately, the pattern repeats.
So I guess my question is, in the wake of these exogenous issues continuing to crop up, does your guidance have any sort of bigger cushion in it, bigger than usual, to kind of account for the potential that some of these logistics and supply shortages worsen once again in the back half of the year?"

As you can obviously see, we gave a little bit wider guidance on operating profit than we did on the top line and EPS as a result of the operating profit guidance. So it reflects, I think, what you're alluding to, which is the underlying volatility in this environment, right?
So at the root cause of this, we see about an eight to tenfold increase in the amount of disruptions in our supply chain. So the predictability is at -- has been at the core, but what we provision and expect in the back half is not much of an improvement, to be candid.
So as you think about it in relation to last year, we saw a ramp-up in external supply chain costs in the back half of the year. We don't expect the -- these costs that we're seeing for disruptions to really materially change in the balance of a year just to replace the ramp-up in those external supply chain costs. And the wider guidance reflects the volatility on the call."

And we probably try to make sure we play the long game in looking at these things. We've been around for 155 years because we play the long game.
What I would say, in this environment, there isn't a huge trade-off -- I'm not sure there is a trade-off between higher service levels and cost. And that's because if we were to take our foot off the gas on service, what we would find is that we create more deleverage and we would incur fines because -- I mean, we'd be more inefficient. We'd get fined from a retail customer because we're more inefficient, and then we'd be shipping truckloads of stuff that were probably less efficient.
And so there really isn't a cost trade-off. So I don't -- we would not be making more money if we lessened our service. We feel like our responsibility at the end of the day is to the end consumer and making sure they have the products they want and to our retail customers. And by fulfilling that, we're doing our job.
The only thing we would gain by lessening service, our margins would look a little bit better, but our sales will be down. But we wouldn't make any more money for General Mills' shareholders and we certainly wouldn't generate more cash than we're generating now either."

Certainly, retailers are very aware of some of the short-term supply chain costs that we're incurring because they're incurring the same costs.

Our sourcing team has been doing a great job, really identifying solutions, and we'll see some of those things come online for some key ingredients that really hurt us through Q2. So I'd say that's the one area that we do expect to get a bit better.
We would expect our service levels to remain challenged through the back half of the year, with Q3 looking a lot like Q2. And in Q4, we get a bit better, but look more like Q1. So on average, we think our service will look similar in the back half compared to the first half."

We do believe that we'll be in better shape and be able to service all of the demand that's there.
One of the things that we pivoted to is a new metric, on-shelf availability, I think that's really important. And while it's certainly not where we want it to be, it is better than our competition.

We're leveraging data analytics. One of the things Jeff's been committed to for a long period of time is really increasing our investments and our capabilities there. And that's starting to bear some fruit.
So if you think about the number of trucks we have running across North America, we can ensure that they're more full than they are currently. That's good for us, it's good for our business, good for our customers, good for our margins. We're starting to leverage some of that technology.

And we're also taking a look at our distribution centers, and there's probably some opportunities to automate some of those facilities where we're challenged right now from a labor standpoint. So we have a host of things happening.

But I think going forward, what you can expect as you move into the back half is a step-up starting in Q3 in the contribution from price/mix. I'd expect inflation to be roughly equal front half/back half. So it's pretty evenly spread across the quarter. So it's nothing material there.
And then an easing in the drag or the headwind from the other supply chain disruption costs, not because the costs themselves are easing, but because as you think about comparison to last year, we saw a ramp-up in other costs, primarily driven by our step into greater external supply chain costs.
So we don't expect these costs to ease. We expect them to replace a lot of those costs we saw last year. So effectively, that's kind of how we think about the back half of the year and what drives the margin improvement as we step from Q3 to Q4."

You highlighted that your actions to offset supply disruptions and logistics issues -- that they're starting to bear fruit. Great to hear, obviously, but we've sort of been seeing a similar pattern from the whole sector for a while now, right, where these, I guess, ""hidden costs"" are rising, management teams think the worst is over, and then the next quarter, unfortunately, the pattern repeats.
So I guess my question is, in the wake of these exogenous issues continuing to crop up, does your guidance have any sort of bigger cushion in it, bigger than usual, to kind of account for the potential that some of these logistics and supply shortages worsen once again in the back half of the year?"

As you can obviously see, we gave a little bit wider guidance on operating profit than we did on the top line and EPS as a result of the operating profit guidance.

So at the root cause of this, we see about an eight to tenfold increase in the amount of disruptions in our supply chain. So the predictability is at -- has been at the core, but what we provision and expect in the back half is not much of an improvement, to be candid.
So as you think about it in relation to last year, we saw a ramp-up in external supply chain costs in the back half of the year. We don't expect the -- these costs that we're seeing for disruptions to really materially change in the balance of a year just to replace the ramp-up in those external supply chain costs.

And we probably try to make sure we play the long game in looking at these things. We've been around for 155 years because we play the long game.
What I would say, in this environment, there isn't a huge trade-off -- I'm not sure there is a trade-off between higher service levels and cost. And that's because if we were to take our foot off the gas on service, what we would find is that we create more deleverage and we would incur fines because -- I mean, we'd be more inefficient. We'd get fined from a retail customer because we're more inefficient, and then we'd be shipping truckloads of stuff that were probably less efficient.
And so there really isn't a cost trade-off. So I don't -- we would not be making more money if we lessened our service. We feel like our responsibility at the end of the day is to the end consumer and making sure they have the products they want and to our retail customers. And by fulfilling that, we're doing our job.

Certainly, retailers are very aware of some of the short-term supply chain costs that we're incurring because they're incurring the same costs. But at this point, we really don't think this is the conversation. So again, really focusing on some of the more macro factors in inflation to justify the pricing."

Our sourcing team has been doing a great job, really identifying solutions, and we'll see some of those things come online for some key ingredients that really hurt us through Q2. So I'd say that's the one area that we do expect to get a bit better.
We would expect our service levels to remain challenged through the back half of the year, with Q3 looking a lot like Q2. And in Q4, we get a bit better, but look more like Q1. So on average, we think our service will look similar in the back half compared to the first half."

We do believe that we'll be in better shape and be able to service all of the demand that's there.
One of the things that we pivoted to is a new metric, on-shelf availability, I think that's really important. And while it's certainly not where we want it to be, it is better than our competition.

We're leveraging data analytics. One of the things Jeff's been committed to for a long period of time is really increasing our investments and our capabilities there. And that's starting to bear some fruit.
So if you think about the number of trucks we have running across North America, we can ensure that they're more full than they are currently. That's good for us, it's good for our business, good for our customers, good for our margins. We're starting to leverage some of that technology.

There's no numbers on some of those steps in the chart, but it looks like the supply chain disruptions, deleverage and other is a large part of the -- or the majority of the decline, if you net out everything else.
In other words, about 300 basis points. Maybe you can confirm if that's at least ballpark correct. But also, obviously, these effects are not new to the quarter. I mean how would you think about that same line item, supply chain disruptions, deleverage and other through the year and what's implied in the guidance for the second half?"

But I think going forward, what you can expect as you move into the back half is a step-up starting in Q3 in the contribution from price/mix. I'd expect inflation to be roughly equal front half/back half. So it's pretty evenly spread across the quarter. So it's nothing material there.
And then an easing in the drag or the headwind from the other supply chain disruption costs, not because the costs themselves are easing, but because as you think about comparison to last year, we saw a ramp-up in other costs, primarily driven by our step into greater external supply chain costs.
So we don't expect these costs to ease. We expect them to replace a lot of those costs we saw last year. So effectively, that's kind of how we think about the back half of the year and what drives the margin improvement as we step from Q3 to Q4."

Let me start our remarks by summarizing today's key messages. We continued to compete effectively and execute well in the second quarter in an increasingly challenging operating environment.
In the face of an unprecedented combination of input cost inflation and supply chain disruption, we moved quickly to keep our trusted brands in front of consumers. We saw additional cost headwinds come our way during the quarter, and we responded with incremental pricing actions that will go into effect in Q3. We also took further steps in Q2 to reshape our portfolio for stronger, more profitable growth, in line with our Accelerate strategy. Finally, amid so much volatility, I'm pleased to say that with our updated fiscal '22 guidance, we now expect to meet or exceed each of our key financial targets for the year.
Slide 5 summarizes our financial performance for the second quarter and first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, our solid execution, competitive service levels and net price realization contributed to organic net sales growth of 5%, while high single-digit input cost inflation and elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions outstripped our pricing and productivity efforts, resulting in a 6% decline in constant currency adjusted operating profit. Constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share was down 7% in the quarter.
First half results were similar to Q2 with an organic net sales up 4% and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share each down 4% in constant currency. And you can see the strength of our top and bottom line performance through the pandemic, with 2-year compound growth rates of 6%, 4% and 6% in the first half, respectively, for organic net sales, constant currency adjusted operating profit and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS.
When we started fiscal '22, we outlined 3 priorities that will be critical to our success this year. First, we will continue to compete effectively by executing our Accelerate strategy. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic supply chain environment. And third, we will execute our portfolio reshaping actions without disrupting our base business.
Let me share a few examples of how we're delivering and driving strong results across these 3 priorities thus far this year. General Mills is winning in the marketplace. We're competing effectively in fiscal '22, holding or growing market share and 62% of our priority businesses year-to-date. This includes important global platforms, such as cereal, pet, ice cream and Mexican food; as well as local gem brands like Pillsbury refrigerated dough, Wanchai Ferry frozen dumplings in China and our fruit snacks business in the U.S. This performance has been driven by our continued focus on brand building, innovation and execution, supported with strong levels of investment and is the continuation of an ongoing multiyear story of improved competitiveness that started before the pandemic and continues through the pandemic.
The current operating environment is as dynamic and challenging as I've seen in my 27-plus years in the industry. At-home food demand remained elevated, input cost inflation is at a 10-year high and labor shortages and other issues are causing disruptions across our supply chain, from our suppliers to manufacturing to distribution. These disruptions are driving down service levels and driving up costs above and beyond inflation throughout the industry.
In the face of these challenges, we stepped up our agility and responsiveness to ensure our customers and consumers can access the food they need. We've also taken actions to manage cost and support our profitability, including leveraging our strategic revenue management capability to execute significant pricing actions across our portfolio, resulting in organic price/mix stepping up from Q1 to Q2, and we expect a further increase in price/mix in the back half of the year.
Later in the presentation, Jon Nudi will share examples of how we're addressing these challenges in North America where inflation and supply chain disruptions have been particularly acute.
Shifting gears to portfolio reshaping. We executed several strategic moves in the first half of the year. In July, we completed the acquisition of Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews dog treat brands from Tyson Foods, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. Dog treats is the second-largest segment in pet food at an estimated $7 billion in retail sales and growing at a high single-digit rate. Combining our newly acquired brands with our Blue Buffalo treats business gives us a powerful treats portfolio that is primed to deliver on pet parents' increasing interest in wholesome, natural treating.
As we continue to integrate these brands into our Pet segment, we are confident in the growth and the value creation opportunities ahead. In fact, retail sales for Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews were up 22% in measured channels in the first half of the year, adding to the 16% growth for our legacy Blue Buffalo treats business.
Our second significant portfolio reshaping action this year was the completion of our European Yoplait divestiture, which closed at the end of November. This transaction improves our enterprise growth profile, enhances our margin and allows us to focus our resources on our faster-growing priority businesses. Yoplait will remain one of our local gem brands in the U.S. and in Canada, where we'll now operate on a wholly owned basis. Kofi will share additional detail on the financial impact of this transaction later in the presentation.
Also at the end of November, we announced the sale of our dough business in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland to Cérélia. These businesses, which represent less than 5% of our Europe & Australia segment net sales, include the Knack & Back and Jus-Rol brands. We expect to close these transactions by the end of fiscal 2022, subject to competition approvals.
Overall, these 3 transactions represent further progress on our Accelerate strategy, which include clear priorities on where to play across geographies as well as platforms and brands to drive long-term superior shareholder returns. We've made significant progress here, and there is still more work to do. We continue to look for opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures.
Another critical element of our Accelerate strategy is our focus on being a Force for Good in the world, as a company and through our brands. As I mentioned last quarter, we plan to regularly highlight different aspects of our Force for Good work on our earnings calls this year, touching on 4 priority areas: regenerating our planet, improving food security, protecting our people and strengthening our communities.
As we enter an important season of giving for many around the world, we thought it would be a good opportunity to highlight General Mills' impact on our communities, and in particular, our commitment to charitable giving. In fiscal 2021, General Mills donated approximately $100 million to charitable causes across our key global markets. Roughly 60% of that was in the form of food donations to the world's leading food bank networks, including Feeding America and the Global FoodBanking Network, translating into 41 million meals for families and individuals.
During the last school year, more than 80,000 schools in the U.S. benefited from our Box Tops for Education program, which has provided more than $940 million to schools since the program began in 1996.
In addition, we recently increased our focus and funding on closing racial disparity gaps in household food security and improving equitable food access. And even as the pandemic has continued to disrupt communities and organizations everywhere, General Mills employees continued to give back through COVID-friendly volunteerism events as well as through our workplace giving program.
I am proud of our company's long-standing commitment to supporting communities and using our charitable giving to advance key social and environmental outcomes. Not only are these actions good for people and the planet, they are also good for our business.
With that, I pass it to Jon Nudi, who will cover our North America Retail segment."

We operate a broad po",3349,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on our North American retail business today.
Let me begin with a quick overview of our segment, which generated $11 billion in net sales last year. We operate a broad portfolio of trusted, leading brands across more than 25 categories in the U.S. and Canada. We serve millions of consumers every day, and our products are enjoyed by around 95% of households each year.
North America Retail has driven strong growth in net sales and operating profit over the past 2 years. While the rise of at-home demand from the pandemic has been a key contributor, we've also outperformed our competition during this time due to improved execution, stronger support behind brand building and innovation and greater alignment of our people and structure with our strategy.
Top priority as a company in recent years has been to compete effectively. I'm tremendously proud of the way that we've improved our competitiveness in North America Retail over the past 4 years, leveraging stronger brand building and innovation that meets consumers' needs.
Consumer demand remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Our second quarter U.S. retail sales were up 4% versus last year and up 6% on a 2-year compound basis, acceleration from the trend in the previous 4 quarters.
We continue to compete well amid this demand picture, as we have for the past several years. Before the pandemic started, we were holding or growing share at 55% of our U.S. retail business. The pandemic started, that metric improved to 65%. And our strong performance has continued in fiscal '22, with more than 60% of our U.S. retail sales base holding or growing share year-to-date. These results have been led by long-term share gains in key categories, including cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks and Mexican foods.
Strong focus on the fundamentals has fueled a multiyear success story in U.S. cereal where General Mills has posted market share gains for 37 consecutive months, 12 consecutive quarters and 4 consecutive years, strengthening our position as the #1 player in the category.
To be clear, our performance is not driven by short-term competitive supply chain dislocations, it's the result of consistently bringing compelling consumer ideas, relevant innovation, strong levels of investment and excellent execution to the best brands in the category.
One product innovation that exemplifies this is Cheerios Oat Crunch. We first launched this subline, the cinnamon variety, 2 years ago, bringing more complex taste and texture to the largest franchise in the category, appealing to older children and adults. Oat Crunch has proven to be highly incremental to the Cheerios franchise and the category and now represents a 1% market share in the U.S. cereal category across 3 great-tasting varieties.
Our track record in Pillsbury refrigerated dough is equally compelling. Retail sales for this business have grown 30% in the last 4 years. We're working on our fourth consecutive year of expanding our category leadership. Our market share is now at 72%, and household penetration has reached 58%, which is up almost 5 points versus pre-pandemic levels.
Consumers are consistently finding that Pillsbury delivers what they need for meal and holiday solutions, something comforting, delicious, convenient and affordable. And our Imagine the Memories You'll Make messaging is resonating with consumers during this key baking season.
One critical way we're working to continue future growth in Pillsbury is to increase our relevance with Hispanic consumers. We're shifting our activation plans and doing a better job of intentionally reaching out to this growing cohort. We've seen an increase of almost 4 points in Pillsbury's Hispanic household penetration over the past 2 years. We are excited about continuing to provide products and solutions for these new consumers and solidifying our growth for years to come.
On fruit snacks, we've expanded our U.S. share leadership in recent years, driven by our breadth and depth of products that serve the needs of all ages, from tots to teens. This includes our Mott's real fruit and veggie juice shakes; winning Kid Equities like Space Jam shakes; fun new varieties on our Annie's line; and differentiated brands like Fruit Roll-Ups, Fruit by the Foot and Gushers.
Before the pandemic, our fruit snacks business was driving growth by expanding into new formats and into the seasonal aisle to capture new usage occasions. When the pandemic hit, we responded quickly and continued our momentum by delivering on consumers' desires for frictionless, all-family snacking. These efforts have helped unlock terrific results, including year-to-date retail sales growth of 18%.
We significantly increased our capacity in recent years to keep pace with a nearly 40% increase in retail sales since fiscal 2018. As we look ahead, we expect to invest further in capacity to support what we see as a long runway of continued growth for this attractive business.
Finally, Old El Paso has led the Mexican food category with 3-plus years of share gains through compelling consumer news and innovation. We've introduced exciting product innovations, like bold-flavored stand-up taco shells, street taco kits and squeeze sauces. We're also bringing taco pockets to North American retail in 2022 after a hugely successful launch in Europe and Australia last year.
Old El Paso has been leveraging our connected commerce capability, utilizing data-driven, personalized messaging with shoppable media to drive improved ROIs. It's not only driven share gains, it has helped drive nearly 4 points of increased household penetration and 39% growth in retail sales over the past 4 years.
Shifting gears. The consumer landscape continues to evolve as we face new variants and see ongoing fluctuations in COVID case rates. While the magnitude varies by market and by month, what has remained constant is that at-home food demand remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.
As Jeff mentioned earlier, the supply chain environment is as challenging as we've seen in decades. We, like the rest of the industry, are facing rising input cost inflation. In fact, our North American market basket has reached its highest point in recent history. To add to the challenge, industry-wide shortages in the labor market are impacting every part of the supply chain, adding significant costs that are above and beyond inflation.
We're seeing record levels of disruptions across our raw material suppliers, internal and external production facilities, our own distribution centers, our customers' warehouses and the logistics networks required to connect each of these elements of the supply chain. These disruptions are resulting in service challenges and elevated costs across the industry.
For example, when a supplier's labor shortages limit their ability to deliver a key ingredient to one of our factories, we either need to shut down our lines or reposition that ingredient from another manufacturing location, both of which increase costs.
Another example. We may be able to procure ingredients, manufacture the product and have it ready to ship. But if our carrier can't make the scheduled pickup because of a driver shortage, we run the risk of missing our customers' on-time and in-full delivery window, thus leading to fines and fees. These examples are just a few of the many challenges we and the rest of the industry are facing daily. 
In the face of labor shortages and disruptions across the supply chain, our teams are focused on remaining agile to secure supply and ensure our customers and consumers can get access to the food they need. For example, so far this year, we've reinstituted control tower teams that we set up at the outset of the pandemic, helping to facilitate quicker decision making. We've secured alternative sources of supply and increased internal inventory levels on some constrained raw materials. We've developed new risk metrics in order to proactively identify challenges. We've increased the frequency of our communication with our vendors and our customers to ensure that we're working as one supply chain. 
I'm pleased to say these actions are making a difference and are enabling us to service our customers better than our competition, which we can see in Nielsen measured data. In the second quarter, our on-shelf availability in the U.S. outpaced our categories. Our service was better than a leading competitor in 7 of our top 10 categories. And we under-indexed on lost sales from out-of-stocks by almost 20%. We have also seen our share of distribution grow every month since the onset of the pandemic. While our service levels remain in the mid-80% range compared to the high 90s that we would typically deliver in a normal environment, we hear from our customers that our performance during the pandemic has been consistently leading among food manufacturers.
At the same time, we are leveraging our enhanced SRM capabilities to address the significant inflation and costs related to supply chain disruptions. Already this fiscal year, we have announced multiple rounds of pricing across our portfolio, utilizing all 4 SRM levers: list pricing, promotion optimization, pack price architecture and mix management. We're seeing the impact of these actions flowing through in the market, with our average unit prices rising steadily over the course of the year.
As I look at the business today, I am struck by the advancements we've made in North American retail in recent years, and I am confident we are a stronger business today than we were before the pandemic. Our brands are more relevant with consumers; our household penetration is up; we've strengthened critical capabilities, like connected commerce and SRM; and our team is more agile today than it's ever been before.
As we enter the holiday season, I'm reminded of the importance of our work. Families across the U.S. and Canada are able to enjoy holiday staples, such as Pillsbury crescent rolls, Betty Crocker cookies and Chex party mix because of what we do every day. I'm proud of the progress we've made in North America Retail over the past few years, and I'm excited about our opportunity to build on that momentum and drive profitable growth in the years ahead.
With that, I'll pass it over to Kofi to review our financial performance in the quarter.
:p id=""104803604"" name=""Kofi Bruce"" type=""E"" />
Thanks, Jon, and hello, everyone. Let's start with our second quarter financial results on Slide 24. Net sales of $5 billion were up 6%. Organic net sales grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting our strong execution, broad-based SRM actions and continued elevated demand versus the pre-pandemic period.
Adjusted operating profit of $821 million was down 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by input cost inflation and higher other cost of goods sold, including costs related to supply chain disruptions, partially offset by favorable price/mix, holistic margin management cost savings and lower SG&A expenses.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the quarter, down 7% in constant currency. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 6%. Adjusted operating profit was flat in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 1% in constant currency.
Slide 25 summarizes the components of net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 5%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Foreign exchange was a 1-point benefit in the quarter, and our acquisition and divestiture activity added 1 point to reported net sales growth.
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America Retail on Slide 26. Second quarter organic net sales were up 1%, driven primarily by favorable price/mix, partially offset by lower volume. Because of the service challenges caused by the current supply chain environment, our net sales lagged retail sales growth by roughly 2 points in the quarter. Net sales growth in U.S. Snacks and U.S. Cereal were partially offset by a decline in U.S. Meals & Baking. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 5%.
As Jon mentioned, we continue to compete effectively in NAR. Fiscal year-to-date, we grew or held market share in 62% of our U.S. retail sales, and we posted solid share gains in Canada. Second quarter constant currency segment operating profit decreased 8%, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume, partially offset by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was flat.
Second quarter net sales for our Pet segment increased 29%, including 15 points of benefit from the pet treat acquisition. Organic net sales were up 14% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in both dog food and cat food. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 16%.
In the first half of the fiscal year, the Blue Buffalo brand continued to drive strong retail sales growth and market share gains in measured channels. And as Jeff mentioned, the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands generated year-to-date retail sales growth of 22%.
On the bottom line, segment operating profit increased 10% to $132 million, driven primarily by higher volume and favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses.
Profit results in the quarter included a onetime inventory adjustment and other acquisition-related expenses totaling $11 million. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 28%.
Turning to Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment results on Slide 28. Organic net sales grew 23% in the quarter, reflecting increased away-from-home food demand in the U.S., including higher year-over-year consumer traffic in schools, restaurants, lodging and C-stores as well as market index pricing on bakery flour. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 3%. Segment operating profit increased 20% in the quarter, driven primarily by positive price/mix and higher volume, partially offset by higher input costs. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit decreased 10%.
In Europe & Australia, second quarter organic net sales were down 2% due to declines in yogurt and dough. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were flat. We continue to compete effectively, growing year-to-date market share in Mexican Food and Snack Bars. Second quarter segment operating profit totaled $16 million compared to $36 million a year ago, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was down 35%.
In Asia & Latin America, second quarter organic net sales increased 5%, driven by Yoki meals and snacks in Brazil. On a 2-year compound basis, net sales were up 7%. Second quarter segment operating profit increased 40% in constant currency, driven primarily by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 23%.
Slide 31 summarizes our joint venture results in the second quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were down 2% in constant currency, reflecting a difficult comparison against elevated at-home demand a year ago. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 8% in constant currency, including strong contributions from innovation. Second quarter after-tax earnings from joint ventures of $33 million were down 9%, driven by lower profit at CPW. On a 2-year compound growth basis, combined after-tax earnings were up 15%.
Now let's turn to total company margin results on Slide 32. While significant benefits from positive price/mix and HMM cost savings were sufficient to offset high single-digit input cost inflation in the quarter, the large step-up in costs due to supply chain disruptions, combined with volume deleverage, drove adjusted gross margin down by 3 points. Adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter was down 200 basis points, driven by lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.
As Jeff and Jon mentioned, we're moving quickly to address the increasing cost environment, including announcing incremental SRM actions that will take effect in January, providing a partial benefit in Q3 and a full benefit in Q4.
Slide 33 summarizes other noteworthy Q2 income statement items. Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased by $12 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $8 million, driven primarily by lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with last year at 22.3%. And average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%, reflecting our share repurchase activity.
Our fiscal 2022 first half results are summarized on Slide 34. Net sales of $9.6 billion were up 5%. Organic net sales increased 4%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit of $1.6 billion decreased 4% in constant currency. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.98 were also down 4% in constant currency. And on a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were up 6%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit was up 4%, and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was up 6%.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First half operating cash flow increased 5% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by changes in inventory, partially offset by changes in accounts payable. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $224 million. And we returned nearly $1 billion in cash to shareholders in the first half of the year through dividends and net share repurchases.
Slide 36 provides a brief summary of the financial impact of the Yoplait Europe divestiture, which closed on November 30. We expect the transaction will reduce reported net sales by approximately $700 million on a 12-month basis. Taking into consideration the associated reduction in operating profit, partially offset by lower interest expense and noncontrolling interest, we expect the divestiture to reduce adjusted diluted EPS by roughly 1% in the first 12 months after the close.
From a portfolio standpoint, this transaction significantly increases our Europe & Australia segment's focus on our faster-growing, higher-margin platforms, including Mexican food, ice cream and snack bars.
On Slide 37, we provided an update on some key financial assumptions for the second half of fiscal '22. First, we expect price/mix to step up further in the second half, reflecting additional SRM actions that will take effect in January. On the cost side, we expect double-digit input cost inflation in the back half. I should note that at this point in the year, we are more than 80% covered on our raw and packaging material spend for fiscal 2022. On a full year basis, we are now estimating cost of goods sold headwinds to be approximately $500 million higher than what was assumed in our initial fiscal 2022 outlook. This includes full year input cost inflation we now estimate to be 8% to 9% as well as elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions.
While it's difficult to forecast, we expect the operating environment will continue to be challenged by labor shortages and other disruptions in the back half, and we expect our second half customer service levels will be generally in line with first half. Finally, from a phasing standpoint, we expect these assumptions to result in back half adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted more heavily to Q4.
With these assumptions in mind, our updated fiscal 2022 financial outlook can be seen on Slide 38. Organic net sales are now expected to increase 4% to 5% compared to the previous guidance that was toward the higher end of the range of down 1% to 3%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit is expected to be down 1% to 4%, which now includes a 1-point drag from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of down 2% to 4%.
We expect constant currency adjusted diluted EPS to range between down 2% and up 1%, including a 1-point headwind from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of flat to down 2%. We expect free cash flow conversion will be at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings.
Finally, the net impact of divestitures, acquisitions and foreign currency exchange is expected to reduce full year reported net sales growth by approximately 1%. And foreign currency is not expected to have a material impact on adjusted operating profit or adjusted diluted EPS.
Let me now turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks."

Let me start our remarks by summarizing today's key messages. We continued to compete effectively and execute well in the second quarter in an increasingly challenging operating environment.
In the face of an unprecedented combination of input cost inflation and supply chain disruption, we moved quickly to keep our trusted brands in front of consumers. We saw additional cost headwinds come our way during the quarter, and we responded with incremental pricing actions that will go into effect in Q3. We also took further steps in Q2 to reshape our portfolio for stronger, more profitable growth, in line with our Accelerate strategy. Finally, amid so much volatility, I'm pleased to say that with our updated fiscal '22 guidance, we now expect to meet or exceed each of our key financial targets for the year.
Slide 5 summarizes our financial performance for the second quarter and first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, our solid execution, competitive service levels and net price realization contributed to organic net sales growth of 5%, while high single-digit input cost inflation and elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions outstripped our pricing and productivity efforts, resulting in a 6% decline in constant currency adjusted operating profit. Constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share was down 7% in the quarter.
First half results were similar to Q2 with an organic net sales up 4% and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share each down 4% in constant currency. And you can see the strength of our top and bottom line performance through the pandemic, with 2-year compound growth rates of 6%, 4% and 6% in the first half, respectively, for organic net sales, constant currency adjusted operating profit and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS.
When we started fiscal '22, we outlined 3 priorities that will be critical to our success this year. First, we will continue to compete effectively by executing our Accelerate strategy. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic supply chain environment. And third, we will execute our portfolio reshaping actions without disrupting our base business.
Let me share a few examples of how we're delivering and driving strong results across these 3 priorities thus far this year. General Mills is winning in the marketplace. We're competing effectively in fiscal '22, holding or growing market share and 62% of our priority businesses year-to-date. This includes important global platforms, such as cereal, pet, ice cream and Mexican food; as well as local gem brands like Pillsbury refrigerated dough, Wanchai Ferry frozen dumplings in China and our fruit snacks business in the U.S. This performance has been driven by our continued focus on brand building, innovation and execution, supported with strong levels of investment and is the continuation of an ongoing multiyear story of improved competitiveness that started before the pandemic and continues through the pandemic.
The current operating environment is as dynamic and challenging as I've seen in my 27-plus years in the industry. At-home food demand remained elevated, input cost inflation is at a 10-year high and labor shortages and other issues are causing disruptions across our supply chain, from our suppliers to manufacturing to distribution. These disruptions are driving down service levels and driving up costs above and beyond inflation throughout the industry.
In the face of these challenges, we stepped up our agility and responsiveness to ensure our customers and consumers can access the food they need. We've also taken actions to manage cost and support our profitability, including leveraging our strategic revenue management capability to execute significant pricing actions across our portfolio, resulting in organic price/mix stepping up from Q1 to Q2, and we expect a further increase in price/mix in the back half of the year.
Later in the presentation, Jon Nudi will share examples of how we're addressing these challenges in North America where inflation and supply chain disruptions have been particularly acute.
Shifting gears to portfolio reshaping. We executed several strategic moves in the first half of the year. In July, we completed the acquisition of Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews dog treat brands from Tyson Foods, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. Dog treats is the second-largest segment in pet food at an estimated $7 billion in retail sales and growing at a high single-digit rate. Combining our newly acquired brands with our Blue Buffalo treats business gives us a powerful treats portfolio that is primed to deliver on pet parents' increasing interest in wholesome, natural treating.
As we continue to integrate these brands into our Pet segment, we are confident in the growth and the value creation opportunities ahead. In fact, retail sales for Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews were up 22% in measured channels in the first half of the year, adding to the 16% growth for our legacy Blue Buffalo treats business.
Our second significant portfolio reshaping action this year was the completion of our European Yoplait divestiture, which closed at the end of November. This transaction improves our enterprise growth profile, enhances our margin and allows us to focus our resources on our faster-growing priority businesses. Yoplait will remain one of our local gem brands in the U.S. and in Canada, where we'll now operate on a wholly owned basis. Kofi will share additional detail on the financial impact of this transaction later in the presentation.
Also at the end of November, we announced the sale of our dough business in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland to Cérélia. These businesses, which represent less than 5% of our Europe & Australia segment net sales, include the Knack & Back and Jus-Rol brands. We expect to close these transactions by the end of fiscal 2022, subject to competition approvals.
Overall, these 3 transactions represent further progress on our Accelerate strategy, which include clear priorities on where to play across geographies as well as platforms and brands to drive long-term superior shareholder returns. We've made significant progress here, and there is still more work to do. We continue to look for opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures.
Another critical element of our Accelerate strategy is our focus on being a Force for Good in the world, as a company and through our brands. As I mentioned last quarter, we plan to regularly highlight different aspects of our Force for Good work on our earnings calls this year, touching on 4 priority areas: regenerating our planet, improving food security, protecting our people and strengthening our communities.
As we enter an important season of giving for many around the world, we thought it would be a good opportunity to highlight General Mills' impact on our communities, and in particular, our commitment to charitable giving. In fiscal 2021, General Mills donated approximately $100 million to charitable causes across our key global markets. Roughly 60% of that was in the form of food donations to the world's leading food bank networks, including Feeding America and the Global FoodBanking Network, translating into 41 million meals for families and individuals.
During the last school year, more than 80,000 schools in the U.S. benefited from our Box Tops for Education program, which has provided more than $940 million to schools since the program began in 1996.
In addition, we recently increased our focus and funding on closing racial disparity gaps in household food security and improving equitable food access. And even as the pandemic has continued to disrupt communities and organizations everywhere, General Mills employees continued to give back through COVID-friendly volunteerism events as well as through our workplace giving program.
I am proud of our company's long-standing commitment to supporting communities and using our charitable giving to advance key social and environmental outcomes. Not only are these actions good for people and the planet, they are also good for our business.
With that, I pass it to Jon Nudi, who will cover our North America Retail segment."

We operate a broad po",1678,"Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on our North American retail business today.
Let me begin with a quick overview of our segment, which generated $11 billion in net sales last year. We operate a broad portfolio of trusted, leading brands across more than 25 categories in the U.S. and Canada. We serve millions of consumers every day, and our products are enjoyed by around 95% of households each year.
North America Retail has driven strong growth in net sales and operating profit over the past 2 years. While the rise of at-home demand from the pandemic has been a key contributor, we've also outperformed our competition during this time due to improved execution, stronger support behind brand building and innovation and greater alignment of our people and structure with our strategy.
Top priority as a company in recent years has been to compete effectively. I'm tremendously proud of the way that we've improved our competitiveness in North America Retail over the past 4 years, leveraging stronger brand building and innovation that meets consumers' needs.
Consumer demand remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Our second quarter U.S. retail sales were up 4% versus last year and up 6% on a 2-year compound basis, acceleration from the trend in the previous 4 quarters.
We continue to compete well amid this demand picture, as we have for the past several years. Before the pandemic started, we were holding or growing share at 55% of our U.S. retail business. The pandemic started, that metric improved to 65%. And our strong performance has continued in fiscal '22, with more than 60% of our U.S. retail sales base holding or growing share year-to-date. These results have been led by long-term share gains in key categories, including cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks and Mexican foods.
Strong focus on the fundamentals has fueled a multiyear success story in U.S. cereal where General Mills has posted market share gains for 37 consecutive months, 12 consecutive quarters and 4 consecutive years, strengthening our position as the #1 player in the category.
To be clear, our performance is not driven by short-term competitive supply chain dislocations, it's the result of consistently bringing compelling consumer ideas, relevant innovation, strong levels of investment and excellent execution to the best brands in the category.
One product innovation that exemplifies this is Cheerios Oat Crunch. We first launched this subline, the cinnamon variety, 2 years ago, bringing more complex taste and texture to the largest franchise in the category, appealing to older children and adults. Oat Crunch has proven to be highly incremental to the Cheerios franchise and the category and now represents a 1% market share in the U.S. cereal category across 3 great-tasting varieties.
Our track record in Pillsbury refrigerated dough is equally compelling. Retail sales for this business have grown 30% in the last 4 years. We're working on our fourth consecutive year of expanding our category leadership. Our market share is now at 72%, and household penetration has reached 58%, which is up almost 5 points versus pre-pandemic levels.
Consumers are consistently finding that Pillsbury delivers what they need for meal and holiday solutions, something comforting, delicious, convenient and affordable. And our Imagine the Memories You'll Make messaging is resonating with consumers during this key baking season.
One critical way we're working to continue future growth in Pillsbury is to increase our relevance with Hispanic consumers. We're shifting our activation plans and doing a better job of intentionally reaching out to this growing cohort. We've seen an increase of almost 4 points in Pillsbury's Hispanic household penetration over the past 2 years. We are excited about continuing to provide products and solutions for these new consumers and solidifying our growth for years to come.
On fruit snacks, we've expanded our U.S. share leadership in recent years, driven by our breadth and depth of products that serve the needs of all ages, from tots to teens. This includes our Mott's real fruit and veggie juice shakes; winning Kid Equities like Space Jam shakes; fun new varieties on our Annie's line; and differentiated brands like Fruit Roll-Ups, Fruit by the Foot and Gushers.
Before the pandemic, our fruit snacks business was driving growth by expanding into new formats and into the seasonal aisle to capture new usage occasions. When the pandemic hit, we responded quickly and continued our momentum by delivering on consumers' desires for frictionless, all-family snacking. These efforts have helped unlock terrific results, including year-to-date retail sales growth of 18%.
We significantly increased our capacity in recent years to keep pace with a nearly 40% increase in retail sales since fiscal 2018. As we look ahead, we expect to invest further in capacity to support what we see as a long runway of continued growth for this attractive business.
Finally, Old El Paso has led the Mexican food category with 3-plus years of share gains through compelling consumer news and innovation. We've introduced exciting product innovations, like bold-flavored stand-up taco shells, street taco kits and squeeze sauces. We're also bringing taco pockets to North American retail in 2022 after a hugely successful launch in Europe and Australia last year.
Old El Paso has been leveraging our connected commerce capability, utilizing data-driven, personalized messaging with shoppable media to drive improved ROIs. It's not only driven share gains, it has helped drive nearly 4 points of increased household penetration and 39% growth in retail sales over the past 4 years.
Shifting gears. The consumer landscape continues to evolve as we face new variants and see ongoing fluctuations in COVID case rates. While the magnitude varies by market and by month, what has remained constant is that at-home food demand remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.
As Jeff mentioned earlier, the supply chain environment is as challenging as we've seen in decades. We, like the rest of the industry, are facing rising input cost inflation. In fact, our North American market basket has reached its highest point in recent history. To add to the challenge, industry-wide shortages in the labor market are impacting every part of the supply chain, adding significant costs that are above and beyond inflation.
We're seeing record levels of disruptions across our raw material suppliers, internal and external production facilities, our own distribution centers, our customers' warehouses and the logistics networks required to connect each of these elements of the supply chain. These disruptions are resulting in service challenges and elevated costs across the industry.
For example, when a supplier's labor shortages limit their ability to deliver a key ingredient to one of our factories, we either need to shut down our lines or reposition that ingredient from another manufacturing location, both of which increase costs.
Another example. We may be able to procure ingredients, manufacture the product and have it ready to ship. But if our carrier can't make the scheduled pickup because of a driver shortage, we run the risk of missing our customers' on-time and in-full delivery window, thus leading to fines and fees. These examples are just a few of the many challenges we and the rest of the industry are facing daily. 
In the face of labor shortages and disruptions across the supply chain, our teams are focused on remaining agile to secure supply and ensure our customers and consumers can get access to the food they need. For example, so far this year, we've reinstituted control tower teams that we set up at the outset of the pandemic, helping to facilitate quicker decision making. We've secured alternative sources of supply and increased internal inventory levels on some constrained raw materials. We've developed new risk metrics in order to proactively identify challenges. We've increased the frequency of our communication with our vendors and our customers to ensure that we're working as one supply chain. 
I'm pleased to say these actions are making a difference and are enabling us to service our customers better than our competition, which we can see in Nielsen measured data. In the second quarter, our on-shelf availability in the U.S. outpaced our categories. Our service was better than a leading competitor in 7 of our top 10 categories. And we under-indexed on lost sales from out-of-stocks by almost 20%. We have also seen our share of distribution grow every month since the onset of the pandemic. While our service levels remain in the mid-80% range compared to the high 90s that we would typically deliver in a normal environment, we hear from our customers that our performance during the pandemic has been consistently leading among food manufacturers.
At the same time, we are leveraging our enhanced SRM capabilities to address the significant inflation and costs related to supply chain disruptions. Already this fiscal year, we have announced multiple rounds of pricing across our portfolio, utilizing all 4 SRM levers: list pricing, promotion optimization, pack price architecture and mix management. We're seeing the impact of these actions flowing through in the market, with our average unit prices rising steadily over the course of the year.
As I look at the business today, I am struck by the advancements we've made in North American retail in recent years, and I am confident we are a stronger business today than we were before the pandemic. Our brands are more relevant with consumers; our household penetration is up; we've strengthened critical capabilities, like connected commerce and SRM; and our team is more agile today than it's ever been before.
As we enter the holiday season, I'm reminded of the importance of our work. Families across the U.S. and Canada are able to enjoy holiday staples, such as Pillsbury crescent rolls, Betty Crocker cookies and Chex party mix because of what we do every day. I'm proud of the progress we've made in North America Retail over the past few years, and I'm excited about our opportunity to build on that momentum and drive profitable growth in the years ahead.
With that, I'll pass it over to Kofi to review our financial performance in the quarter."

Let's start with our second quarter financial results on Slide 24. Net sales of $5 billion were up 6%. Organic net sales grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting our strong execution, broad-based SRM actions and continued elevated demand versus the pre-pandemic period.
Adjusted operating profit of $821 million was down 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by input cost inflation and higher other cost of goods sold, including costs related to supply chain disruptions, partially offset by favorable price/mix, holistic margin management cost savings and lower SG&A expenses.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the quarter, down 7% in constant currency. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 6%. Adjusted operating profit was flat in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 1% in constant currency.
Slide 25 summarizes the components of net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 5%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Foreign exchange was a 1-point benefit in the quarter, and our acquisition and divestiture activity added 1 point to reported net sales growth.
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America Retail on Slide 26. Second quarter organic net sales were up 1%, driven primarily by favorable price/mix, partially offset by lower volume. Because of the service challenges caused by the current supply chain environment, our net sales lagged retail sales growth by roughly 2 points in the quarter. Net sales growth in U.S. Snacks and U.S. Cereal were partially offset by a decline in U.S. Meals & Baking. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 5%.
As Jon mentioned, we continue to compete effectively in NAR. Fiscal year-to-date, we grew or held market share in 62% of our U.S. retail sales, and we posted solid share gains in Canada. Second quarter constant currency segment operating profit decreased 8%, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume, partially offset by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was flat.
Second quarter net sales for our Pet segment increased 29%, including 15 points of benefit from the pet treat acquisition. Organic net sales were up 14% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in both dog food and cat food. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 16%.
In the first half of the fiscal year, the Blue Buffalo brand continued to drive strong retail sales growth and market share gains in measured channels. And as Jeff mentioned, the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands generated year-to-date retail sales growth of 22%.
On the bottom line, segment operating profit increased 10% to $132 million, driven primarily by higher volume and favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses.
Profit results in the quarter included a onetime inventory adjustment and other acquisition-related expenses totaling $11 million. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 28%.
Turning to Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment results on Slide 28. Organic net sales grew 23% in the quarter, reflecting increased away-from-home food demand in the U.S., including higher year-over-year consumer traffic in schools, restaurants, lodging and C-stores as well as market index pricing on bakery flour. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 3%. Segment operating profit increased 20% in the quarter, driven primarily by positive price/mix and higher volume, partially offset by higher input costs. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit decreased 10%.
In Europe & Australia, second quarter organic net sales were down 2% due to declines in yogurt and dough. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were flat. We continue to compete effectively, growing year-to-date market share in Mexican Food and Snack Bars. Second quarter segment operating profit totaled $16 million compared to $36 million a year ago, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was down 35%.
In Asia & Latin America, second quarter organic net sales increased 5%, driven by Yoki meals and snacks in Brazil. On a 2-year compound basis, net sales were up 7%. Second quarter segment operating profit increased 40% in constant currency, driven primarily by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 23%.
Slide 31 summarizes our joint venture results in the second quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were down 2% in constant currency, reflecting a difficult comparison against elevated at-home demand a year ago. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 8% in constant currency, including strong contributions from innovation. Second quarter after-tax earnings from joint ventures of $33 million were down 9%, driven by lower profit at CPW. On a 2-year compound growth basis, combined after-tax earnings were up 15%.
Now let's turn to total company margin results on Slide 32. While significant benefits from positive price/mix and HMM cost savings were sufficient to offset high single-digit input cost inflation in the quarter, the large step-up in costs due to supply chain disruptions, combined with volume deleverage, drove adjusted gross margin down by 3 points. Adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter was down 200 basis points, driven by lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.
As Jeff and Jon mentioned, we're moving quickly to address the increasing cost environment, including announcing incremental SRM actions that will take effect in January, providing a partial benefit in Q3 and a full benefit in Q4.
Slide 33 summarizes other noteworthy Q2 income statement items. Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased by $12 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $8 million, driven primarily by lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with last year at 22.3%. And average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%, reflecting our share repurchase activity.
Our fiscal 2022 first half results are summarized on Slide 34. Net sales of $9.6 billion were up 5%. Organic net sales increased 4%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit of $1.6 billion decreased 4% in constant currency. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.98 were also down 4% in constant currency. And on a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were up 6%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit was up 4%, and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was up 6%.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First half operating cash flow increased 5% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by changes in inventory, partially offset by changes in accounts payable. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $224 million. And we returned nearly $1 billion in cash to shareholders in the first half of the year through dividends and net share repurchases.
Slide 36 provides a brief summary of the financial impact of the Yoplait Europe divestiture, which closed on November 30. We expect the transaction will reduce reported net sales by approximately $700 million on a 12-month basis. Taking into consideration the associated reduction in operating profit, partially offset by lower interest expense and noncontrolling interest, we expect the divestiture to reduce adjusted diluted EPS by roughly 1% in the first 12 months after the close.
From a portfolio standpoint, this transaction significantly increases our Europe & Australia segment's focus on our faster-growing, higher-margin platforms, including Mexican food, ice cream and snack bars.
On Slide 37, we provided an update on some key financial assumptions for the second half of fiscal '22. First, we expect price/mix to step up further in the second half, reflecting additional SRM actions that will take effect in January. On the cost side, we expect double-digit input cost inflation in the back half. I should note that at this point in the year, we are more than 80% covered on our raw and packaging material spend for fiscal 2022. On a full year basis, we are now estimating cost of goods sold headwinds to be approximately $500 million higher than what was assumed in our initial fiscal 2022 outlook. This includes full year input cost inflation we now estimate to be 8% to 9% as well as elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions.
While it's difficult to forecast, we expect the operating environment will continue to be challenged by labor shortages and other disruptions in the back half, and we expect our second half customer service levels will be generally in line with first half. Finally, from a phasing standpoint, we expect these assumptions to result in back half adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted more heavily to Q4.
With these assumptions in mind, our updated fiscal 2022 financial outlook can be seen on Slide 38. Organic net sales are now expected to increase 4% to 5% compared to the previous guidance that was toward the higher end of the range of down 1% to 3%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit is expected to be down 1% to 4%, which now includes a 1-point drag from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of down 2% to 4%.
We expect constant currency adjusted diluted EPS to range between down 2% and up 1%, including a 1-point headwind from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of flat to down 2%. We expect free cash flow conversion will be at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings.
Finally, the net impact of divestitures, acquisitions and foreign currency exchange is expected to reduce full year reported net sales growth by approximately 1%. And foreign currency is not expected to have a material impact on adjusted operating profit or adjusted diluted EPS.
Let me now turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks."

Let me start our remarks by summarizing today's key messages. We continued to compete effectively and execute well in the second quarter in an increasingly challenging operating environment.
In the face of an unprecedented combination of input cost inflation and supply chain disruption, we moved quickly to keep our trusted brands in front of consumers. We saw additional cost headwinds come our way during the quarter, and we responded with incremental pricing actions that will go into effect in Q3. We also took further steps in Q2 to reshape our portfolio for stronger, more profitable growth, in line with our Accelerate strategy. Finally, amid so much volatility, I'm pleased to say that with our updated fiscal '22 guidance, we now expect to meet or exceed each of our key financial targets for the year.
Slide 5 summarizes our financial performance for the second quarter and first half of the fiscal year. In Q2, our solid execution, competitive service levels and net price realization contributed to organic net sales growth of 5%, while high single-digit input cost inflation and elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions outstripped our pricing and productivity efforts, resulting in a 6% decline in constant currency adjusted operating profit. Constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share was down 7% in the quarter.
First half results were similar to Q2 with an organic net sales up 4% and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share each down 4% in constant currency. And you can see the strength of our top and bottom line performance through the pandemic, with 2-year compound growth rates of 6%, 4% and 6% in the first half, respectively, for organic net sales, constant currency adjusted operating profit and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS.
When we started fiscal '22, we outlined 3 priorities that will be critical to our success this year. First, we will continue to compete effectively by executing our Accelerate strategy. Second, we will successfully navigate the dynamic supply chain environment. And third, we will execute our portfolio reshaping actions without disrupting our base business.
Let me share a few examples of how we're delivering and driving strong results across these 3 priorities thus far this year. General Mills is winning in the marketplace. We're competing effectively in fiscal '22, holding or growing market share and 62% of our priority businesses year-to-date. This includes important global platforms, such as cereal, pet, ice cream and Mexican food; as well as local gem brands like Pillsbury refrigerated dough, Wanchai Ferry frozen dumplings in China and our fruit snacks business in the U.S. This performance has been driven by our continued focus on brand building, innovation and execution, supported with strong levels of investment and is the continuation of an ongoing multiyear story of improved competitiveness that started before the pandemic and continues through the pandemic.
The current operating environment is as dynamic and challenging as I've seen in my 27-plus years in the industry. At-home food demand remained elevated, input cost inflation is at a 10-year high and labor shortages and other issues are causing disruptions across our supply chain, from our suppliers to manufacturing to distribution. These disruptions are driving down service levels and driving up costs above and beyond inflation throughout the industry.
In the face of these challenges, we stepped up our agility and responsiveness to ensure our customers and consumers can access the food they need. We've also taken actions to manage cost and support our profitability, including leveraging our strategic revenue management capability to execute significant pricing actions across our portfolio, resulting in organic price/mix stepping up from Q1 to Q2, and we expect a further increase in price/mix in the back half of the year.
Later in the presentation, Jon Nudi will share examples of how we're addressing these challenges in North America where inflation and supply chain disruptions have been particularly acute.
Shifting gears to portfolio reshaping. We executed several strategic moves in the first half of the year. In July, we completed the acquisition of Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews dog treat brands from Tyson Foods, strengthening our position in the fast-growing U.S. pet food category. Dog treats is the second-largest segment in pet food at an estimated $7 billion in retail sales and growing at a high single-digit rate. Combining our newly acquired brands with our Blue Buffalo treats business gives us a powerful treats portfolio that is primed to deliver on pet parents' increasing interest in wholesome, natural treating.
As we continue to integrate these brands into our Pet segment, we are confident in the growth and the value creation opportunities ahead. In fact, retail sales for Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews were up 22% in measured channels in the first half of the year, adding to the 16% growth for our legacy Blue Buffalo treats business.
Our second significant portfolio reshaping action this year was the completion of our European Yoplait divestiture, which closed at the end of November. This transaction improves our enterprise growth profile, enhances our margin and allows us to focus our resources on our faster-growing priority businesses. Yoplait will remain one of our local gem brands in the U.S. and in Canada, where we'll now operate on a wholly owned basis. Kofi will share additional detail on the financial impact of this transaction later in the presentation.
Also at the end of November, we announced the sale of our dough business in Germany, the U.K. and Ireland to Cérélia. These businesses, which represent less than 5% of our Europe & Australia segment net sales, include the Knack & Back and Jus-Rol brands. We expect to close these transactions by the end of fiscal 2022, subject to competition approvals.
Overall, these 3 transactions represent further progress on our Accelerate strategy, which include clear priorities on where to play across geographies as well as platforms and brands to drive long-term superior shareholder returns. We've made significant progress here, and there is still more work to do. We continue to look for opportunities to further reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures.
Another critical element of our Accelerate strategy is our focus on being a Force for Good in the world, as a company and through our brands. As I mentioned last quarter, we plan to regularly highlight different aspects of our Force for Good work on our earnings calls this year, touching on 4 priority areas: regenerating our planet, improving food security, protecting our people and strengthening our communities.
As we enter an important season of giving for many around the world, we thought it would be a good opportunity to highlight General Mills' impact on our communities, and in particular, our commitment to charitable giving. In fiscal 2021, General Mills donated approximately $100 million to charitable causes across our key global markets. Roughly 60% of that was in the form of food donations to the world's leading food bank networks, including Feeding America and the Global FoodBanking Network, translating into 41 million meals for families and individuals.
During the last school year, more than 80,000 schools in the U.S. benefited from our Box Tops for Education program, which has provided more than $940 million to schools since the program began in 1996.
In addition, we recently increased our focus and funding on closing racial disparity gaps in household food security and improving equitable food access. And even as the pandemic has continued to disrupt communities and organizations everywhere, General Mills employees continued to give back through COVID-friendly volunteerism events as well as through our workplace giving program.
I am proud of our company's long-standing commitment to supporting communities and using our charitable giving to advance key social and environmental outcomes. Not only are these actions good for people and the planet, they are also good for our business.
With that, I pass it to Jon Nudi, who will cover our North America Retail segment."

Let me begin with a quick overview of our segment, which generated $11 billion in net sales last year. We operate a broad portfolio of trusted, leading brands across more than 25 categories in the U.S. and Canada. We serve millions of consumers every day, and our products are enjoyed by around 95% of households each year.
North America Retail has driven strong growth in net sales and operating profit over the past 2 years. While the rise of at-home demand from the pandemic has been a key contributor, we've also outperformed our competition during this time due to improved execution, stronger support behind brand building and innovation and greater alignment of our people and structure with our strategy.
Top priority as a company in recent years has been to compete effectively. I'm tremendously proud of the way that we've improved our competitiveness in North America Retail over the past 4 years, leveraging stronger brand building and innovation that meets consumers' needs.
Consumer demand remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Our second quarter U.S. retail sales were up 4% versus last year and up 6% on a 2-year compound basis, acceleration from the trend in the previous 4 quarters.
We continue to compete well amid this demand picture, as we have for the past several years. Before the pandemic started, we were holding or growing share at 55% of our U.S. retail business. The pandemic started, that metric improved to 65%. And our strong performance has continued in fiscal '22, with more than 60% of our U.S. retail sales base holding or growing share year-to-date. These results have been led by long-term share gains in key categories, including cereal, refrigerated dough, fruit snacks and Mexican foods.
Strong focus on the fundamentals has fueled a multiyear success story in U.S. cereal where General Mills has posted market share gains for 37 consecutive months, 12 consecutive quarters and 4 consecutive years, strengthening our position as the #1 player in the category.
To be clear, our performance is not driven by short-term competitive supply chain dislocations, it's the result of consistently bringing compelling consumer ideas, relevant innovation, strong levels of investment and excellent execution to the best brands in the category.
One product innovation that exemplifies this is Cheerios Oat Crunch. We first launched this subline, the cinnamon variety, 2 years ago, bringing more complex taste and texture to the largest franchise in the category, appealing to older children and adults. Oat Crunch has proven to be highly incremental to the Cheerios franchise and the category and now represents a 1% market share in the U.S. cereal category across 3 great-tasting varieties.
Our track record in Pillsbury refrigerated dough is equally compelling. Retail sales for this business have grown 30% in the last 4 years. We're working on our fourth consecutive year of expanding our category leadership. Our market share is now at 72%, and household penetration has reached 58%, which is up almost 5 points versus pre-pandemic levels.
Consumers are consistently finding that Pillsbury delivers what they need for meal and holiday solutions, something comforting, delicious, convenient and affordable. And our Imagine the Memories You'll Make messaging is resonating with consumers during this key baking season.
One critical way we're working to continue future growth in Pillsbury is to increase our relevance with Hispanic consumers. We're shifting our activation plans and doing a better job of intentionally reaching out to this growing cohort. We've seen an increase of almost 4 points in Pillsbury's Hispanic household penetration over the past 2 years. We are excited about continuing to provide products and solutions for these new consumers and solidifying our growth for years to come.
On fruit snacks, we've expanded our U.S. share leadership in recent years, driven by our breadth and depth of products that serve the needs of all ages, from tots to teens. This includes our Mott's real fruit and veggie juice shakes; winning Kid Equities like Space Jam shakes; fun new varieties on our Annie's line; and differentiated brands like Fruit Roll-Ups, Fruit by the Foot and Gushers.
Before the pandemic, our fruit snacks business was driving growth by expanding into new formats and into the seasonal aisle to capture new usage occasions. When the pandemic hit, we responded quickly and continued our momentum by delivering on consumers' desires for frictionless, all-family snacking. These efforts have helped unlock terrific results, including year-to-date retail sales growth of 18%.
We significantly increased our capacity in recent years to keep pace with a nearly 40% increase in retail sales since fiscal 2018. As we look ahead, we expect to invest further in capacity to support what we see as a long runway of continued growth for this attractive business.
Finally, Old El Paso has led the Mexican food category with 3-plus years of share gains through compelling consumer news and innovation. We've introduced exciting product innovations, like bold-flavored stand-up taco shells, street taco kits and squeeze sauces. We're also bringing taco pockets to North American retail in 2022 after a hugely successful launch in Europe and Australia last year.
Old El Paso has been leveraging our connected commerce capability, utilizing data-driven, personalized messaging with shoppable media to drive improved ROIs. It's not only driven share gains, it has helped drive nearly 4 points of increased household penetration and 39% growth in retail sales over the past 4 years.
Shifting gears. The consumer landscape continues to evolve as we face new variants and see ongoing fluctuations in COVID case rates. While the magnitude varies by market and by month, what has remained constant is that at-home food demand remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.
As Jeff mentioned earlier, the supply chain environment is as challenging as we've seen in decades. We, like the rest of the industry, are facing rising input cost inflation. In fact, our North American market basket has reached its highest point in recent history. To add to the challenge, industry-wide shortages in the labor market are impacting every part of the supply chain, adding significant costs that are above and beyond inflation.
We're seeing record levels of disruptions across our raw material suppliers, internal and external production facilities, our own distribution centers, our customers' warehouses and the logistics networks required to connect each of these elements of the supply chain. These disruptions are resulting in service challenges and elevated costs across the industry.
For example, when a supplier's labor shortages limit their ability to deliver a key ingredient to one of our factories, we either need to shut down our lines or reposition that ingredient from another manufacturing location, both of which increase costs.
Another example. We may be able to procure ingredients, manufacture the product and have it ready to ship. But if our carrier can't make the scheduled pickup because of a driver shortage, we run the risk of missing our customers' on-time and in-full delivery window, thus leading to fines and fees. These examples are just a few of the many challenges we and the rest of the industry are facing daily. 
In the face of labor shortages and disruptions across the supply chain, our teams are focused on remaining agile to secure supply and ensure our customers and consumers can get access to the food they need. For example, so far this year, we've reinstituted control tower teams that we set up at the outset of the pandemic, helping to facilitate quicker decision making. We've secured alternative sources of supply and increased internal inventory levels on some constrained raw materials. We've developed new risk metrics in order to proactively identify challenges. We've increased the frequency of our communication with our vendors and our customers to ensure that we're working as one supply chain. 
I'm pleased to say these actions are making a difference and are enabling us to service our customers better than our competition, which we can see in Nielsen measured data. In the second quarter, our on-shelf availability in the U.S. outpaced our categories. Our service was better than a leading competitor in 7 of our top 10 categories. And we under-indexed on lost sales from out-of-stocks by almost 20%. We have also seen our share of distribution grow every month since the onset of the pandemic. While our service levels remain in the mid-80% range compared to the high 90s that we would typically deliver in a normal environment, we hear from our customers that our performance during the pandemic has been consistently leading among food manufacturers.
At the same time, we are leveraging our enhanced SRM capabilities to address the significant inflation and costs related to supply chain disruptions. Already this fiscal year, we have announced multiple rounds of pricing across our portfolio, utilizing all 4 SRM levers: list pricing, promotion optimization, pack price architecture and mix management. We're seeing the impact of these actions flowing through in the market, with our average unit prices rising steadily over the course of the year.
As I look at the business today, I am struck by the advancements we've made in North American retail in recent years, and I am confident we are a stronger business today than we were before the pandemic. Our brands are more relevant with consumers; our household penetration is up; we've strengthened critical capabilities, like connected commerce and SRM; and our team is more agile today than it's ever been before.
As we enter the holiday season, I'm reminded of the importance of our work. Families across the U.S. and Canada are able to enjoy holiday staples, such as Pillsbury crescent rolls, Betty Crocker cookies and Chex party mix because of what we do every day. I'm proud of the progress we've made in North America Retail over the past few years, and I'm excited about our opportunity to build on that momentum and drive profitable growth in the years ahead.
With that, I'll pass it over to Kofi to review our financial performance in the quarter."

Adjusted operating profit of $821 million was down 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by input cost inflation and higher other cost of goods sold, including costs related to supply chain disruptions, partially offset by favorable price/mix, holistic margin management cost savings and lower SG&A expenses.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.99 in the quarter, down 7% in constant currency. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 6%. Adjusted operating profit was flat in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 1% in constant currency.
Slide 25 summarizes the components of net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 5%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Foreign exchange was a 1-point benefit in the quarter, and our acquisition and divestiture activity added 1 point to reported net sales growth.
Now let's turn to segment results, beginning with North America Retail on Slide 26. Second quarter organic net sales were up 1%, driven primarily by favorable price/mix, partially offset by lower volume. Because of the service challenges caused by the current supply chain environment, our net sales lagged retail sales growth by roughly 2 points in the quarter. Net sales growth in U.S. Snacks and U.S. Cereal were partially offset by a decline in U.S. Meals & Baking. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 5%.
As Jon mentioned, we continue to compete effectively in NAR. Fiscal year-to-date, we grew or held market share in 62% of our U.S. retail sales, and we posted solid share gains in Canada. Second quarter constant currency segment operating profit decreased 8%, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume, partially offset by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was flat.
Second quarter net sales for our Pet segment increased 29%, including 15 points of benefit from the pet treat acquisition. Organic net sales were up 14% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in both dog food and cat food. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 16%.
In the first half of the fiscal year, the Blue Buffalo brand continued to drive strong retail sales growth and market share gains in measured channels. And as Jeff mentioned, the Nudges, True Chews and Top Chews brands generated year-to-date retail sales growth of 22%.
On the bottom line, segment operating profit increased 10% to $132 million, driven primarily by higher volume and favorable net price realization and mix, partially offset by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses.
Profit results in the quarter included a onetime inventory adjustment and other acquisition-related expenses totaling $11 million. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 28%.
Turning to Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment results on Slide 28. Organic net sales grew 23% in the quarter, reflecting increased away-from-home food demand in the U.S., including higher year-over-year consumer traffic in schools, restaurants, lodging and C-stores as well as market index pricing on bakery flour. On a 2-year compound growth basis, second quarter organic net sales were up 3%. Segment operating profit increased 20% in the quarter, driven primarily by positive price/mix and higher volume, partially offset by higher input costs. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit decreased 10%.
In Europe & Australia, second quarter organic net sales were down 2% due to declines in yogurt and dough. On a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were flat. We continue to compete effectively, growing year-to-date market share in Mexican Food and Snack Bars. Second quarter segment operating profit totaled $16 million compared to $36 million a year ago, driven primarily by higher input costs and lower volume. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit was down 35%.
In Asia & Latin America, second quarter organic net sales increased 5%, driven by Yoki meals and snacks in Brazil. On a 2-year compound basis, net sales were up 7%. Second quarter segment operating profit increased 40% in constant currency, driven primarily by positive price/mix and lower SG&A expenses. On a 2-year compound growth basis, constant currency segment operating profit increased 23%.
Slide 31 summarizes our joint venture results in the second quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were down 2% in constant currency, reflecting a difficult comparison against elevated at-home demand a year ago. Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 8% in constant currency, including strong contributions from innovation. Second quarter after-tax earnings from joint ventures of $33 million were down 9%, driven by lower profit at CPW. On a 2-year compound growth basis, combined after-tax earnings were up 15%.
Now let's turn to total company margin results on Slide 32. While significant benefits from positive price/mix and HMM cost savings were sufficient to offset high single-digit input cost inflation in the quarter, the large step-up in costs due to supply chain disruptions, combined with volume deleverage, drove adjusted gross margin down by 3 points. Adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter was down 200 basis points, driven by lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.
As Jeff and Jon mentioned, we're moving quickly to address the increasing cost environment, including announcing incremental SRM actions that will take effect in January, providing a partial benefit in Q3 and a full benefit in Q4.
Slide 33 summarizes other noteworthy Q2 income statement items. Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses increased by $12 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $8 million, driven primarily by lower average debt balances. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with last year at 22.3%. And average diluted shares outstanding were down 1%, reflecting our share repurchase activity.
Our fiscal 2022 first half results are summarized on Slide 34. Net sales of $9.6 billion were up 5%. Organic net sales increased 4%, driven by positive organic price/mix. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit of $1.6 billion decreased 4% in constant currency. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.98 were also down 4% in constant currency. And on a 2-year compound growth basis, organic net sales were up 6%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit was up 4%, and constant currency adjusted diluted EPS was up 6%.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. First half operating cash flow increased 5% to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by changes in inventory, partially offset by changes in accounts payable. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $224 million. And we returned nearly $1 billion in cash to shareholders in the first half of the year through dividends and net share repurchases.
Slide 36 provides a brief summary of the financial impact of the Yoplait Europe divestiture, which closed on November 30. We expect the transaction will reduce reported net sales by approximately $700 million on a 12-month basis. Taking into consideration the associated reduction in operating profit, partially offset by lower interest expense and noncontrolling interest, we expect the divestiture to reduce adjusted diluted EPS by roughly 1% in the first 12 months after the close.
From a portfolio standpoint, this transaction significantly increases our Europe & Australia segment's focus on our faster-growing, higher-margin platforms, including Mexican food, ice cream and snack bars.
On Slide 37, we provided an update on some key financial assumptions for the second half of fiscal '22. First, we expect price/mix to step up further in the second half, reflecting additional SRM actions that will take effect in January. On the cost side, we expect double-digit input cost inflation in the back half. I should note that at this point in the year, we are more than 80% covered on our raw and packaging material spend for fiscal 2022. On a full year basis, we are now estimating cost of goods sold headwinds to be approximately $500 million higher than what was assumed in our initial fiscal 2022 outlook. This includes full year input cost inflation we now estimate to be 8% to 9% as well as elevated costs related to supply chain disruptions.
While it's difficult to forecast, we expect the operating environment will continue to be challenged by labor shortages and other disruptions in the back half, and we expect our second half customer service levels will be generally in line with first half. Finally, from a phasing standpoint, we expect these assumptions to result in back half adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted more heavily to Q4.
With these assumptions in mind, our updated fiscal 2022 financial outlook can be seen on Slide 38. Organic net sales are now expected to increase 4% to 5% compared to the previous guidance that was toward the higher end of the range of down 1% to 3%. Constant currency adjusted operating profit is expected to be down 1% to 4%, which now includes a 1-point drag from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of down 2% to 4%.
We expect constant currency adjusted diluted EPS to range between down 2% and up 1%, including a 1-point headwind from the Yoplait Europe divestiture. This compares to the previous guidance that was towards the higher end of the range of flat to down 2%. We expect free cash flow conversion will be at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings.
Finally, the net impact of divestitures, acquisitions and foreign currency exchange is expected to reduce full year reported net sales growth by approximately 1%. And foreign currency is not expected to have a material impact on adjusted operating profit or adjusted diluted EPS.
Let me now turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks."
