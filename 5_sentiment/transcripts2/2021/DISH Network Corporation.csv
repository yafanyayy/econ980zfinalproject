Paul and I are going to keep our comments brief and leave plenty of time for your questions. 
This year has been a trying year for everyone in the face of the pandemic. And I'm proud of how the DISH team has responded and turned obstacles into opportunities. I'm also proud of how we've kept the safety of our team, our customers and our communities we serve top of mind as we execute against our goals throughout the year. 
We've accomplished a lot in 2020, and we've entered the retail wireless business with the acquisition of Boost Mobile, and we partnered with Tucows to utilize their mobile services solutions, and we acquired the Ting Mobile subscriber base. 
Now over the past 6 months, we've worked to implement the same discipline we have on the pay-TV side of the business to our retail wireless business. We've introduced new plans, offers, shed unprofitable customers and have been making plans to grow the business in 2021. In addition, we made great strides on building the nation's first cloud-native OpenRAN-based 5G broadband network. 
In 2020, we signed significant contracts with software partners, fiber providers, equipment manufacturers and tower companies. We've charted a course for a great 2021, and we look forward to sharing updates throughout the year on progress on our network. 
We also had a solid year in pay-TV despite the headwinds presented by the pandemic. This was driven by our continued discipline and better execution in both DISH TV and SLING TV. We're focused on providing products and services with the best technology, outstanding customer service and a great value. We strive to offer our customers with a better price-to-value relationship and those available from our pay-TV subscription providers. And through our efforts, we were recognized by our customers for the third year in a row as being #1 in customer satisfaction with J.D. Power in 2020. 
We reported strong revenue numbers for the year and brought in more than $3 billion in OIBDA. And we've increased our revenue more than $2.5 billion from 2019, and our net income by nearly $400 million. 
With that, I'd like to highlight a few items across several key lines of business for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we continued to advance our wireless efforts. Retail wireless net subscribers decreased by approximately 363,000 for the fourth quarter, largely due to our ongoing efforts to integrate our retail wireless operations, shed unprofitable customers and make operational changes to enhance profitability. As I mentioned last quarter, our profitability is determined in part by what we pay to access the network as an MVNO. As we roll out our own network, we'll begin to benefit from owner economics. That's going to drive profitability that allow us to be more disruptive and drive better competition in the retail wireless space. In addition, we made great strides in Q4 with our wireless network efforts. 
Since our last call, we've enlisted fiber providers like Everstream, Zayo, Crown, Segra and Uniti for fronthaul and backhaul network support. We reached an agreement with Crown Castle and wireless towers. And just last month, we signed a similar agreement with Vertical Bridge. 
We've announced an agreement with Aviat for 5G microwave transport services and signed a deal with Mavenir for cloud-based messaging and Qualcomm to utilize our 5G RAN platforms. 
We've also completed our first 5G validation in December. 2021 is going to be a landmark year for us in wireless, and Charlie, Tom and Mark are here with us today and are available to talk more in-depth about our wireless progress in a few minutes. 
With regard to the quarter, DISH TV performed well, given the current environment, with gross activations of nearly 235,000. They're down year-over-year primarily due to COVID and our approach to it. As I stated before, the crisis has impacted our customers' willingness to respond to some marketing tactics like opening direct mail or event-based sales, and in some cases, allowing technicians to perform services in their home. As a result, we reduced our marketing expenditures and our gross new TV subscribers have decreased. However, our DISH TV strategy has been anchored in acquiring and retaining long-term profitable customers. We've been focused on a more rural and higher credit quality customer base, and we remain committed to that path. 
In the quarter, we saw DISH TV net subscriber loss of 149,000. Our losses are primarily the result of a lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, partially offset by lower DISH TV churn rate. Paul is going to have a few -- a bit more detail on that in a moment. 
Turning to SLING TV. In the quarter, we gained approximately 16,000 subscribers. And while we still have considerable room to grow, we're encouraged that we added subs in the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year. This is primarily due to the return of sports, and it was also helped by the improvements we made to the platform. We launched Sling Watch Party to enhance the collaborative viewing experience, add a new programming like the Big 10 and increased our on-demand library to over 150,000 titles. And most recently, we added 50 hours of free DVR storage. 
With that said, we continue to focus on acquiring and retaining profitable customers and delivering a great experience for both DISH TV and SLING TV. 
2021 is going to be an exciting and transformative year for many -- on many fronts, and we've got a lot of work to do, but we've got the focus and resolve to realize our vision. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul for a little comment -- commentary on the numbers."

As a reminder, we made changes to our financial reporting in the third quarter. We now disclose operating results for both our pay-TV and wireless segments. In addition, we'll report results for our 2 wireless business units, retail wireless and 5G network deployment. Since we now report segment operating results, we're disclosing segment OIBDA as a measure of profitability for each segment. 
Erik addressed the overall subscriber trends, but I'll add a little color on our commercial subscribers for DISH TV. The COVID pandemic has significantly impacted our commercial subscribers. As discussed in previous quarters, 250,000 of these accounts were put on pause and/or received temporary rate relief. They were removed from our Q1 ending DISH TV subscriber count. 
During 2020, 80,000 of those subscribers restored service or had temporary rate relief end. These subscribers came back with minimal or no cost. They were added to our ending subscriber count without being counted as a gross activation. 
Of the remaining commercial accounts, 69,000 of these accounts disconnected during the year. We are hopeful of the remaining 100,000 commercial accounts will restore service in the coming quarters. However, we cannot be certain of this. 
Companies in the hospitality and the airline industries continue to evaluate the amenities provided to their customers, and that includes pay-TV. 
Turning to the financials. In the fourth quarter, compared to last year, our consolidated revenue and OIBDA are both up significantly. Revenue increased due to the Boost acquisition. The OIBDA increase was driven by pay-TV generating over $1 billion and retail wireless generated $188 million during the quarter. 
Let's dig into the details of each segment. Our pay-TV revenue in the fourth quarter increased due to higher ARPU, partially offset by a lower subscriber base. The increase in pay-TV ARPU was mainly driven by price increases for both DISH and SLING. 
Our subscriber margins for the quarter were positively impacted by the ARPU increases just discussed, and our cost-cutting initiatives related to COVID. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter decreased compared to last year as a result of fewer subscriber additions and our cost-cutting initiatives related to COVID. 
We settled our telemarketing litigation for $210 million, which was $70 million, less than what we had accrued, benefiting SG&A expenses in the quarter. DISH TV SAC per activation decreased slightly from $850 last year to $842, largely due to lower equipment cost per activation. 
Now let's turn to our retail wireless business unit. Service revenue was almost $1.1 billion, down slightly from Q3, and OIBDA was $188 million for the quarter. Consistent with DISH and SLING, we're focusing on acquiring long-term profitable retail wireless subscribers. We are currently in the process of making changes to our marketing, sales and operations to further enhance our profitability given our MVNO economics. 
And lastly, let's look at our 5G network deployment group. We invested over $50 million in OpEx and CapEx during the fourth quarter. We expect CapEx to increase substantially throughout 2021 as we ramp up our 5G network deployment. 
During Q4, we generated $357 million of free cash flow and made the final payment of $730 million to the FCC for our licenses to acquire -- for our licenses acquired in Auction 105. 
Finally, in December, we issued $2 billion of our 0% convertible notes due in 2025. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Charlie for some comments."

But I did want to point out something that I think sometimes gets lost. And when you analyze at DISH, obviously, we don't talk a lot, we don't get a lot of conferences, and we remain focused on really building our business. But 2020 was a transition year for us. It's a very successful transition year for us. And it's the third time that we've had a transition in my 40 years in business. And I've always felt that the transition year -- the transition time is always the toughest. And if you can get through the transition, then you can really jump-start -- you can really grow your business in a dramatic way. 
So in 1980, when we started the business, the transition really was to survive. Most companies go out of business, probably 90% of the companies go out of business because they just don't have a good idea of running out of funds. And for us, it was -- it took us about 3 years to make the transition from a retail company to a distribution company and actually get past the survival stage. 
Second transition was when -- it took us over a decade, which is we realized that the technology -- there was a technology -- experimental technology called DBS. And we were in the big dish business and that, that was going to transform big dishes into little dishes. And so in 1995, with the launch of our first satellite, that year was a transition year for us because we had put all the pieces in place with spectrum, satellite construction launch and digital technology to go compete with the cable industry. 
And 2020 was over a decade-long transition of accumulating spectrum and getting critical mass with spectrum to go and compete in the wireless world. And we finalized our long-term executive team, which took years to do. We were able to enter the retail market in wireless in an unexpected way with the acquisition of Boost, and a 7-year MVNO term with T-Mobile who's quietly or not-so-quietly building probably the finest network in the United States. The -- we purchased 14 megahertz of low-band spectrum in 800. We purchased approximately 20 megahertz of CBRS spectrum nationwide, the only nationwide provider and over -- around 600 megahertz of millimeter wave all last year. We solidify key vendor relationships who -- and have a number of companies that are helping us on our quest to build the world's best network. And we have over $4 billion of cash in our balance sheet. So that all leads to the fact that as we enter 2021, we have everything that we need to build this one-of-a-kind 5G network. And now it's -- now, for us, it's execution. 
So once you get through the transition stage, you have to focus on -- it's all about execution. And there are certainly significant risk for us as we go execute. We have to deploy our network. And then we've got to put it all together to work -- to make it work. And there certainly will be substantial risk. There's certainly going to be lots of problems, but we have the team and the focus to overcome that. And our company, it has always  been a company that can execute. So I have a degree of confidence that we're going to execute in 2021. That means that we're going to build our first major cities by the end of the third quarter and more to come. We're going to round out our team. The really, really great engineers, wireless engineers, where they want to come work for this company because we're building something special. And we're going to continue with rounding out our vendor partners and making sure that we have -- we still have cloud. We still have transport. We still have orchestration, just to name a few. So we'll continue to do that. 
And at the end of the day, we're going to have this really, really special 5G cloud native, OpenRAN virtualized network that really doesn't exist in the world today. So it's not our first rodeo. It's very similar to building the digital video when the world was analog. Wireless networks really haven't been upgraded from an architecture point of view in the last 30 years. And we're confident that with our focus will actually help the United States, actually start leading again in wireless and hopefully continue to bring -- most of our partners are American companies with American ingenuity. And there's no reason that America can't lead as an example, nobody has better cloud companies in the United States. Nobody had a better -- when you virtualize the network, you know what you write, you do it with software, not hardware. Nobody has better software than the United States. And this is a company that has 2 main operating systems in the world today, and Apple's iOS and Google's Android in the handset side. So there's no reason that this country can't lead, and there's no reason that DISH isn't going to be a part of that and probably will be upfront in some of those things. 
The reason the transition is important is in 1995, we went to the little dish business, we had 2 other competitors. We had a cable company and we had DIRECTV. Today, we probably have over 20 competitors in that very same business. In fact, we compete with our very own suppliers. So that market is very competitive. You've obviously seen the trends in our industry in the last 4 or 5 years. We expect that those trends will probably continue. The world is becoming an a la carte world with vendors going directly to their customers. 
But in the wireless world, we're 1 of 4 competitors. So there's 3 $200 million companies that are out there and we're entering their business with a better network to go compete. And it's not just about competition for consumers or handsets. It's about what a 5G network can do, which includes a lot more than just consumers. 
So with that, we'll open it up for questions."

First, on the 5G side, I was curious if you could just provide some additional context of how you're seeing the emerging addressable market in dollars for the business side of what you're focused on versus the consumer wholesale side for the wireless business plan? 
And secondly, on the Sling business, with the cord-cutting trends in the industry, are you surprised not to see Sling grab more share of that video distribution market? And is there something that's holding it back that could be unleashed over the next 12 months?"

Look, cord cutting has accelerated as Charlie mentioned in his opening comments. I mean, we are now competing with some of our largest partners on the distribution side. 
We feel like Sling is well positioned, not only from a value perspective and maintaining kind of that lowest price point. But also from delivering a good customer experience and technology. And we have work to do on the latter two, which we've made good progress on at the end of last year, and we'll continue to make progress on this year. 
But Sling is in a unique position based on our packages and services that we provide in order to be a very complementary service to some of your larger SVOD services, whether it'd be a Disney, Netflix, Peacock, et cetera. 
So I think that, obviously, we have work to do on the swing side. I think customers, as Charlie mentioned, there is a bit of a la carte world happening. I think there'll be some aggregation back. We're well positioned to fulfill the unique proposition, providing a kind of a bundle of cable nets with quality SVOD services from some of the competitors out there. 
I think the other thing that we do very well is we're giving customers choice, right? And choice and how they acquire the content that is important to them, most uniquely on the local front, right? 
And if you look at expenses, retrans is obviously one of the expenses that's going up at the highest rate, those local channels. And Sling is well positioned to provide services, whether it'd be an off-air antenna that's integrated to one of our set-top boxes. Or a service like low cast or a service like CVSL access, which will now become Paramount. So our strategy there is to really partner and become complementary and with that, I think we can continue to make progress on the acquisition front."

We should have more market share there. We really were first to market. We stumbled a little bit with our -- with just the quality of the user experience. And technically, as we -- our network was the best first, but we maybe got a little complacent. It's taken a while to upgrade it, but that's all being done the first half of this year. So we'll see how it goes. But it -- we have room to improve that. That's for sure. And we should have gotten more market share. 
On the business side, we don't have a dollar amount to give you today on where the business. But our network is designed. Let's talk about the 3 things that we do different from current networks. First of all, our network will be an O-RAN network. So it means that we separate the baseband and the radio. So it gives a lot more flexibility in terms of mix and matching off-the-shelf parts and radios and lower cost and more flexibility, more American content and vendors and not 1 company that controls us end-to-end like current networks have. 
We're virtual -- we're more virtual. We do a lot more with software than hardware. So it means a lot of big boxes that use a lot of power, those things become those things become software. And we're cloud native, which means our network runs in the cloud. Now why is that important? That's important because we can use modern techniques like machine learning and artificial intelligence, so we can actually analyze our network real time, we can make our network better, but we can also -- we also opens up our ability on an automated basis to what we call slice our networks so that we can open up our network to private networks and companies and what we call enterprise business, so that they can have what looks like their own network. And they control their own network and they get access to their data in the cloud where they can actually use that data to make a better product, less expensive product and a safer product. And it also marries obviously with private cloud so they so choose to do that. 
So we're changing -- so I think a lot of analysts look at how many handsets you're going to have, what your market share are going to be in handsets and so forth and so on. But your question is well taken in the sense that a part of our business will be the enterprise business that is a fairly nascent business today. And we'll be on the leading edge of that as it grows."

And then -- and perhaps tell us your thinking of when is the ideal time to add that partner? Is it before you've done any of your test markets? Would you rather have a test market in advance? 
And then related to that, you did a convertible security in the December, it wasn't a huge number relative to the overall financing. But I wonder if you could just talk about your thought process of why you decided to go with a convertible rather than debt? And whether we should read anything into that for future financing decisions?"

So I think on strategic partner, Craig, we look at it maybe a little bit different than the Street does, but for our strategic partners or our strategic relationship, we already have the major strategic, whether it'd be VMware or Havanera Altiostar o",560,"Yes. So I think on strategic partner, Craig, we look at it maybe a little bit different than the Street does, but for our strategic partners or our strategic relationship, we already have the major strategic, whether it'd be VMware or Havanera Altiostar or Crown and SBA Vertical Bridge and other tower companies and more to come. 
So what we do there is -- and we're a pretty big R&D project, and all those companies are helping us. They're spending capital that they're not getting the immediate return on in terms of that. And like in the cloud, we've got several companies have been helping us with cloud. And wireless is the next big growth. Telco is the next big growth for cloud. In fact, it's probably the biggest growth over the next decade. That's probably going to be their biggest growth. And yes, it's a little bit different than the normal data that they've been doing today. So there's some things that we have to invent together and change in what they're doing. 
So the way we look at strategic partnerships, there's -- money aside is how do we make their company better? And how do they make our company better? And everybody we're working with, that's our goal is we're their champions to go help make those -- their companies better, whether it'd be provide resources or test beds or our testing on our network, and they're spending a lot of resources to help make us better. 
From a financing point of view, the converged security, we just felt like putting capital on the balance sheet to get us to 2023, where I think there's always a chance more than 0, Craig, that we're out of business. We don't know what that we're doing, and we fail. But I think that the rational bet is that we know what we're doing and that we have a team and partners to help us. And we're going to get there. And then obviously, the world looks at this a little bit differently. And you're probably one of our biggest skeptics and it's our job to -- your stuff is well taken. I read your stuff. I think you're a great writer, and I think you make great points. 
But not one of your points, not one ever, has been something that we haven't thought about here. And that we don't at least believe we have a strategic solution to it. And therefore, I think that our job is to go out and produce is to go out and execute and build this network. And then obviously, internally, we talk about -- we just prove our skeptics wrong. And so we don't really talk -- so we don't spend a lot of time talking external about what we're doing, we just stay focused on what we're doing. And good teams and good companies that do things, they focus. And we focus probably to our detriment. We don't explain what we're doing to everybody every day. But we're going to show you. And that's why I think John's question, I think, earlier, when we can see something, and the third quarter, I think, will be important. 
And then -- so there's -- so the ideal time is when you can show people what you're doing, if you believe in what you're doing."

And what happened was, ultimately, we just got good enough. We just got confident enough and good enough on what we were doing, that it just made sense to keep the equity. And it didn't make sense to give up the equity. 
And so I think we're probably in a similar situation today in the sense that we do have enough capital to build on our balance sheet today to build our network to the point where people can see whether OpenRAN cloud-native networks work. And I know not everybody in this call sees it, but we see it every day. The number of resumes and the quality of people that are applying to come work with us is exponentially higher than it was last year. 
The number of vendors that are putting resources towards us is vastly different than it was last year. The -- I think the whisper confidence level for people in the know is vastly higher. 
We're leading though. Nobody's built a 5G OpenRAN cloud-native network before. We're fortunate that GEO took a first step and Rocky 10 took a second step, but we're going to be the first network that does it and completely. And I don't think -- there's certainly always will be skepticism. But that -- every time we hit a milestone internally with our partners, it -- that goes down. And you saw -- you see it -- you saw with Qualcomm and they put one of our frequencies in their chips. They don't do that for -- that cost them money. That cost them R&D, that cost them space.

We certainly want -- certainly, speeds are important. But certainly, that is -- you don't -- everybody doesn't need a car that got a Lamborghini that goes 280 miles an hour, and I think as long as we make something that goes 100 miles an hour, we'll be pretty good shape. 
So I think we'll look at consistency. And then we look at where all the problems are, where our dead spots, where do we go along in our RF plan? Where did we -- where does our  open rent have issues and how we ever over analyze that and how we're able to sell fuel and self correct. And it's just all those issues. My experience in DBS was. 
I remember when we launched, our pay-per-view didn't work. And -- and then as we started getting customers and being more successful than we thought initially, suddenly, we couldn't actually provision people fast enough. We didn't have enough compute power to do it. And as we learned all those things, and it took us 3 or 4 months to kind of get the right things in place. And then it was clear sailing that we still had problems, but they were kind of one-offs, one at a time. 
So my expectation is that we'll I think everybody on this call will have a pretty good idea where they stand by the end of the year. And some people are going to say, ""We've bit off more than we can chew,"" and some people are going to say, ""well, we always knew they could do it."" And we're good at execution. Transition is tough. Execution is hard work, but there are no law visits. Walt, this is important. There are no law physics to stop us from what we're doing. There is nothing that has to be invented to stop us from what we're doing. People know how to clint towers. We'll be getting radios in. People now had to build radios. People now know how to build broadband DUs. Cloud exists. We don't have to invent the cloud. Handsets exist. We just have to execute. And right now, we're -- it's right to be skeptical about our execution because we got to prove it. 
And -- but this team, we have a team that can do it. And it's just, for me, it's a pleasure to get from the transition stage to the execution stage because it's just hard work. And we never knew tenured I'm looking at Tom here, but 10 years ago, we knew we had to get 100 megahertz of spectrum. We've got 40 megahertz of spectrum. And we said, how are we going to -- we just never knew if we'd get there or not. 
Now we've got well over that. And the -- well, I can't talk about the C-band auction, I think that -- that's a whole another dynamic and a whole other strategy, counter strategy kind of thing that you guys will be writing on in the next -- the rest of the year.

We are working through some very big technology and operational projects with the Boost business. I want to point out, which is new news this quarter is that we have received notice from T-Mobile. The voice CDMA network will be discontinued on or around January 1, 2022. 
So the majority of our retail wireless subscribers receiving services from that network were part of work on planning a big migration. So we can't be certain that the network actually shut down on that time line. But we have to plan and act as if it will, which will be costly for us.

No, I was going to say. So boosts is probable -- so I don't think that this quarter that these kind of margins are probably sustainable to the extent that, in fact, it might not be very good at all in the sense that we look at it from a profit and loss, the boost customers are some of the most economically challenged customers out there, the Boost pays attention to them and they're good customers for Boost. But they're economically challenged. 
And so if they -- it's hard to upgrade to go from a phone that works great and works in their territory, works great and then go to another phone that won't even work on our network because we're 5G. So then we have to upgrade them again. So if you run the numbers on that, and there would be significant fallout from that, in my opinion. 
The second thing is, I don't even think we could get to supply of the phones that we would need. So we just don't -- it's -- you can't order phones and not know that you can move the phones and the supply is somewhat limited for the kind of phones we might need for that. So that's a material risk that's out there on Boost. 
And -- but I think the positive side is the team, the Boost team, John, lead and the team showed they can execute. They showed that they, in a very short period of time, could turn around some past practices from boots that weren't economical. And maybe were to show Wall Street in numbers. We're not into that game here. We're into actually managing your capital and our capital in an efficient manner. 
And so they've shown that they can turn them around in a very short order. I set a goal for them to be profitable by the end of the year. They were profitable in the first quarter, and they became more profitable in the second quarter. So we've got a management team that can execute and they're on own pins and needles and edge there seek to get our first market on our network where we can control own destiny."

And no other network or no other architecture has that capability in the world yet for us.

Obviously, this isn't new, but I'm curious if the tenor of your discussions during the great negotiations is changing? And if so, is it more about fine-tuning pricing and packaging terms with programmers? Or do you expect to take an even harder line with ultimately, I guess, who you're distributing? And if I could have a brief follow-up."

And what are the alternatives to get it. So obviously, to the extent that w",568,"Yes. I don't know that it's a harder line. I think that what -- we value programming is to help -- how many people watch it. So for lack of a better word, cost per viewing hour. And what are the alternatives to get it. 
So obviously, to the extent that we had football exclusively, we had NFL season ticket that within exclusive. That has value to the extent that you can watch it in 10 different places, it has 1/10 of value, right? So when our -- we have a content negotiation and that content is available through other means, it's just less valuable to us. And then the content providers are strategically, I think, in their strategic rooms. They're saying, how do we keep these linear guys paying as much money as possible for as long as possible while we go direct to the consumer and cut them out? 
And oh, by the way, we're making these guys bundle every channel, and we'll go to the consumer and get them a lot more flexibility and be a cart. So obviously, that's a that's going to be a tough business model going forward. We're unique in that Erik maybe speak to this, we've made our viewing -- we look at the viewing as an experience, and we've done a lot of different things to make the experience on DISH network better than the experience might be. And one of these vendors, and we go after people that are more rural and so forth and so on. But look, it's why the -- all I can say is I'm sleeping it and I'm sleeping at night now because we -- I've been through this before. We knew the big Dish business was going to be a business that would be challenged for years before anybody ever wrote the first word about it. We knew that this model would be challenged in video I think we talked about it on a conference call probably, you go back and look the record, probably 7 or 8 years ago, when everybody kind of laughed at us and said, ""why aren't you spending more money to get these customers?"" And we've made that transition that, that it's a mature declining business, and it's a solid business. The cash flows are good. It's not going away, but it's going to decline. And I would expect our cost of programming would go down or would -- or wouldn't go up as much based on customers going direct. And we probably will lose some of our customers -- some of our programming partners we may lose as a result of that. 
But Erik and his team will run it as a business. We have great relationships with our consumers. We found that out with HBO. HBO didn't renew, they wanted minimum guarantees from us and the high prices that we -- that made no sense for us to pay. And obviously, we're a competitor. So they had no -- and they had Game of Thrones coming up, final season to Game of Thrones. We didn't lose -- we didn't lose many customers, let me put it that way because our relationship was strong. And they felt -- they bought Showtime and STARZ and other things in Netflix, and so -- and HBO lost the revenue stream. So do you want to jump in on that?"

And then lastly, sort of just not sure if there's much more fishing I can do here, Charlie, but just adding on to Craig's question. I think I was pretty surprised by you using equity. You certainly have a pretty long history of avoiding equity. I assume you expect a lot of value creation if you execute here. The last couple of years, you mentioned there was a lot of interest in financing and helping you with funding the network and shifting over to equity from that seems like a change in sort of balancing how you might financing. So was the demand by others willing to give you money just sort of too expensive in terms of share of capacity? Or in terms of the rate they wanted to charge you versus equity?

But on the other hand, it's not going to be material in the scheme of things where we're going. So that was 0% interest for 5 years was attractive. And again, I think we didn't quite hit our metric of where we thought we would come in pricing-wise. And had we, in hindsight, maybe knowing if it was going to be conversion in the 40 -- low $40 range, I think maybe we'd have thought about it differently.

Paul and I are going to keep our comments brief and leave plenty of time for your questions.  
This year has been a trying year for everyone in the face of the pandemic. And I'm proud of how the DISH team has responded and turned obstacles into opportunities. I'm also proud of how we've kept the safety of our team, our customers and our communities we serve top of mind as we execute against our goals throughout the year.  
We've accomplished a lot in 2020, and we've entered the retail wireless business with the acquisition of Boost Mobile, and we partnered with Tucows to utilize their mobile services solutions, and we acquired the Ting Mobile subscriber base.  
Now over the past 6 months, we've worked to implement the same discipline we have on the pay-TV side of the business to our retail wireless business. We've introduced new plans, offers, shed unprofitable customers and have been making plans to grow the business in 2021. In addition, we made great strides on building the nation's first cloud-native OpenRAN-based 5G broadband network.  
In 2020, we signed significant contracts with software partners, fiber providers, equipment manufacturers and tower companies. We've charted a course for a great 2021, and we look forward to sharing updates throughout the year on progress on our network.  
We also had a solid year in pay-TV despite the headwinds presented by the pandemic. This was driven by our continued discipline and better execution in both DISH TV and SLING TV. We're focused on providing products and services with the best technology, outstanding customer service and a great value. We strive to offer our customers with a better price-to-value relationship than those available from other pay-TV subscription providers. And through our efforts, we were recognized by our customers for the third year in a row as being #1 in customer satisfaction with J.D. Power in 2020.  
We reported strong revenue numbers for the year and brought in more than $3 billion in OIBDA. And we've increased our revenue more than $2.5 billion from 2019, and our net income by nearly $400 million.  
With that, I'd like to highlight a few items across several key lines of business for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we continued to advance our wireless efforts. Retail wireless net subscribers decreased by approximately 363,000 for the fourth quarter, largely due to our ongoing efforts to integrate our retail wireless operations, shed unprofitable customers and make operational changes to enhance profitability. As I mentioned last quarter, our profitability is determined in part by what we pay to access the network as an MVNO. As we roll out our own network, we'll begin to benefit from owner economics. That's going to drive profitability that allow us to be more disruptive and drive better competition in the retail wireless space. In addition, we made great strides in Q4 with our wireless network efforts.  
Since our last call, we've enlisted fiber providers like Everstream, Zayo, Crown, Segra and Uniti for fronthaul and backhaul network support. We reached an agreement with Crown Castle for wireless towers. And just last month, we signed a similar agreement with Vertical Bridge.  
We've announced an agreement with Aviat for 5G microwave transport services and signed a deal with Mavenir for cloud-based messaging and Qualcomm to utilize our 5G RAN platforms.  
We've also completed our first 5G validation in December. 2021 is going to be a landmark year for us in wireless, and Charlie, Tom and Mark are here with us today and are available to talk more in-depth about our wireless progress in a few minutes.  
With regard to the quarter, DISH TV performed well, given the current environment, with gross activations of nearly 235,000. They're down year-over-year primarily due to COVID and our approach to it. And as stated before, the crisis has impacted our customers' willingness to respond to some marketing tactics like opening direct mail or event-based sales, and in some cases, allowing technicians to perform services in their home. As a result, we reduced our marketing expenditures and our gross new TV subscribers have decreased. However, our DISH TV strategy has been anchored in acquiring and retaining long-term profitable customers. We've been focused on a more rural and higher credit quality customer base, and we remain committed to that path.  
In the quarter, we saw DISH TV net subscriber loss of 149,000. Our losses are primarily the result of a lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, partially offset by lower DISH TV churn rate. Paul is going to have a few -- a bit more detail on that in a moment.  
Turning to SLING TV. In the quarter, we gained approximately 16,000 subscribers. And while we still have considerable room to grow, we're encouraged that we added subs in the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year. This is primarily due to the return of sports, and it was also helped by the improvements we made to the platform. We launched Sling Watch Party to enhance the collaborative viewing experience, added new programming like the Big 10 and increased our on-demand library to over 150,000 titles. And most recently, we added 50 hours of free DVR storage.  
With that said, we continue to focus on acquiring and retaining profitable customers and delivering a great experience for both DISH TV and SLING TV.  
2021 is going to be an exciting and transformative year for many -- on many fronts, and we've got a lot of work to do, but we've got the focus, the resolve to realize our vision.  
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul for a little comment -- commentary on the numbers."

As a reminder, we made changes to our financial reporting in the third quarter. We now disclose operating results for both our pay-TV and wireless segments. In addition, we report results for our 2 wireless business units, retail wireless and 5G network deployment. Since we now report segment operating results, we're disclosing segment OIBDA as a measure of profitability for each segment.  
Erik addressed the overall subscriber trends, but I'll add a little color on our commercial subscribers for DISH TV. The COVID pandemic has significantly impacted our commercial subscribers. As discussed in previous quarters, 250,000 of these accounts were put on pause and/or received temporary rate relief. They were removed from our Q1 ending DISH TV subscriber count.  
During 2020, 80,000 of those subscribers restored service or had temporary rate relief mend. These subscribers came back with minimal or no cost. They were added to our ending subscriber count without being counted as a gross activation.  
Of the remaining commercial accounts, 69,000 of these accounts disconnected during the year. We are hopeful of the remaining 100,000 commercial accounts will restore service in the coming quarters. However, we cannot be certain of this.  
Companies in the hospitality and the airline industries continue to evaluate the amenities provided to their customers, and that includes pay-TV.  
Turning to the financials. In the fourth quarter, compared to last year, our consolidated revenue and OIBDA are both up significantly. Revenue increased due to the Boost acquisition. The OIBDA increase was driven by pay-TV generating over $1 billion and retail wireless generated $188 million during the quarter.  
Let's dig into the details of each segment. Our pay-TV revenue in the fourth quarter increased due to higher ARPU, partially offset by a lower subscriber base. The increase in pay-TV ARPU was mainly driven by price increases for both DISH and SLING.  
Our subscriber margins for the quarter were positively impacted by the ARPU increases just discussed, and our cost-cutting initiatives related to COVID. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter decreased compared to last year as a result of fewer subscriber additions and our cost-cutting initiatives related to COVID.  
We settled our telemarketing litigation for $210 million, which was $70 million less than what we had accrued, benefiting SG&A expenses in the quarter. DISH TV SAC per activation decreased slightly from $850 last year to $842, largely due to lower equipment cost per activation.  
Now let's turn to our retail wireless business unit. Service revenue was almost $1.1 billion, down slightly from Q3, and OIBDA was $188 million for the quarter. Consistent with DISH and SLING, we're focusing on acquiring long-term profitable retail wireless subscribers. We're currently in the process of making changes to our marketing, sales and operations to further enhance our profitability given our MVNO economics.  
And lastly, let's look at our 5G network deployment group. We invested over $50 million in OpEx and CapEx during the fourth quarter. We expect CapEx to increase substantially throughout 2021 as we ramp up our 5G network deployment.  
During Q4, we generated $357 million of free cash flow and made the final payment of $730 million to the FCC for our licenses to acquire -- for our licenses acquired in Auction 105.  
Finally, in December, we issued $2 billion of our 0% convertible notes due in 2025. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash and marketable securities.  
I'm going to turn it over to Charlie for some comments."

But I did want to point out something that I think sometimes gets lost. And when you analyze at DISH, and obviously, we don't talk a lot, we don't go to a lot of conferences, and we remain focused on really building our business. But 2020 was a transition year for us. It's a very successful transition year for us. And it's the third time that we've had a transition in my 40 years in business. And I've always felt that the transition year -- the transition time is always the toughest. And if you can get through the transition, then you can really jump-start -- you can really grow your business in a dramatic way.  
So in 1980, when we started the business, the transition really was to survive. Most companies go out of business, probably 90% of the companies go out of business because they just don't have a good idea and run out of funds. And for us, it was -- it took us about 3 years to make the transition from a retail company to a distribution company and actually get past the survival stage.  
Second transition was when -- it took us over a decade, which is we realized that the technology -- that there was a technology -- experimental technology called DBS. And we were in the big dish business and that, that was going to transform big dishes into little dishes. And so in 1995, with the launch of our first satellite, that year was a transition year for us because we had put all the pieces in place with spectrum, satellite construction launch and digital technology to go compete with the cable industry.  
And 2020 was over a decade-long transition of accumulating spectrum and getting critical mass with spectrum to go and compete in the wireless world. And we finalized our long-term executive team, which took years to do. We were able to enter the retail market in wireless in an unexpected way with the acquisition of Boost, and a 7-year MVNO term with T-Mobile who's quietly or not-so-quietly building probably the finest network in the United States. The -- we purchased 14 megahertz of low-band spectrum in 800. We purchased approximately 20 megahertz of CBRS spectrum nationwide, the only nationwide provider, and over -- around 600 megahertz of millimeter wave, all last year. We solidified key vendor relationships who -- and have a number of companies that are helping us on our quest to build the world's best network. And we have over $4 billion of cash in our balance sheet. So that all leads to the fact that as we enter 2021, we have everything that we need to build this one-of-a-kind 5G network. And now it's -- now, for us, it's execution.  
So once you get through the transition stage, you have to focus on -- it's all about execution. And there are certainly significant risks for us as we go execute. We have to deploy our network. And then we've got to put it all together to work -- to make it work. And there certainly will be substantial risk. There's certainly going to be lots of problems, but we have the team and the focus to overcome that. And our company, it has always been a company that can execute. So I have a high degree of confidence that we're going to execute in 2021. That means that we're going to build our first major cities by the end of the third quarter and more to come. We're going to round out our team. The really, really great engineers, the wireless engine, where they want to come work for this company, because we're building something special. And we're going to continue with rounding out our vendor partners and making sure that we have -- we still have cloud. We still have transport. We still have orchestration, just to name a few. So we'll continue to do that.  
And at the end of the day, we're going to have this really, really special 5G cloud native, OpenRAN virtualized network that really doesn't exist in the world today. So it's not our first rodeo. It's very similar to building the digital video when the world was analog. Wireless networks really haven't been upgraded from an architecture point of view in the last 30 years. And we're confident that with our focus will actually help the United States, actually start leading again in wireless and hopefully continue to bring -- most of our partners are American companies with American ingenuity. And there's no reason that America can't lead as an example, nobody has better cloud companies than the United States. Nobody had a better -- when you virtualize the network, you know what you write, you do it with software, not hardware. Nobody has better software than the United States. And this is a company that has 2 main operating systems in the world today, and Apple's iOS and Google's Android in the handset side. So there's no reason that this country can't lead, and there's no reason that DISH isn't going to be a part of that and probably will be up front in some of those things.  
The reason the transition is important, is in 1995, we went to the little dish business, we had 2 other competitors. We had a cable company and we had DIRECTV. Today, we probably have over 20 competitors in that very same business. In fact, we compete with our very own suppliers. So that market is very competitive. You've obviously seen the trends in our industry in the last 4 or 5 years. We expect that those trends will probably continue.  
The world is becoming an a la carte world with vendors going directly to their customers.  
But in the wireless world, we're 1 of 4 competitors. So there's 3 $200 billion companies that are out there and we're entering their business with a better network to go compete. And it's not just about competition for consumers or handsets. It's about what a 5G network can do, which includes a lot more than just consumers.  
So with that, we'll open it up for questions."

First, on the 5G side, I was curious if you could just provide some additional context of how you're seeing the emerging addressable market in dollars for the business side of what you're focused on versus the consumer wholesale side for the wireless business plan?  
And secondly, on the Sling business, with the cord-cutting trends in the industry, are you surprised not to see Sling grab more share of that video distribution market? And is there something that's holding it back that could be unleashed over the next 12 months?"

I'll start with the Sling question, and then I'll turn it over to the team for the 5G question. Look, cord cutting has accelerated, Charlie mentioned it in his opening comments. I mean, we are now competing with some of our largest partners on the distribution side.  
We feel like Sling is well positioned, not only from a value perspective and maintaining kind of that lowest price point. But also from delivering a good customer experience and technology. Now we have work to do on the latter two, which -- we've made good progress on at the end of last year, and we'll continue to make progress on this year.  
But Sling is in a unique position based on our packages and services that we provide in order to be a very complementary service to some of your larger SVOD services, whether it be a Disney, Netflix, Peacock, et cetera.  
So I think that, obviously, we have work to do on the Sling side. I think customers, as Charlie mentioned, there is a bit of a la carte world happening. I think there'll be some aggregation back. But we're well positioned to fulfill the unique proposition, providing a kind of a bundle of cable nets with quality SVOD services from some of the competitors out there.  
I think the other thing that we do very well is we're giving customers choice, right? And choice and how they acquire the content, that is important to them, most uniquely on the local front, right?  
And if you look at expenses, retrans is obviously one of the expenses that's going up at the highest rate, those local channels. And Sling is well positioned to provide services, whether it be an off-air antenna that's integrated to one of our set-top boxes. Or a service like low cast or a service like CVSL access, which will now become Paramount. So our strategy there is to really partner and become complementary and with that, I think we can continue to make progress on the acquisition front."

We should have more market share there. We really were first to market. We stumbled a little bit with our -- with just the quality of the user experience. And technically, as we -- our network was the best at first, but we got -- maybe got a little complacent. It's taken a while to upgrade it, but that's all being done the first half of this year. So we'll see how it goes.  
But it -- we have room to improve that. That's for sure. And we should have gotten more market share.  
On the business side, we don't have a dollar amount to give you today on where the business. But our network is designed. Let's talk about the 3 things that we do different from current networks. First of all, our network will be an ORAN network. So it means that we separate the baseband and the radio. So it gives a lot more flexibility in terms of mix and matching off-the-shelf parts and radios and lower cost and more flexibility, more American content and vendors and not 1 company that controls us end-to-end like current networks have.  
We're virtual -- we're more virtual. We do a lot more with software than hardware. So it means a lot of big boxes that use a lot of power, those things become software. And we're cloud native, which means our network runs in the cloud. Now why is that important? That's important because we can use modern techniques like machine learning and artificial intelligence, so we can actually analyze our network real time, we can make our network better, but we can also -- we also -- it opens up our ability on an automated basis to what we call slicer networks, so we can open up our network to private networks and companies and what we call enterprise business, so that they can have what looks like their own network. And they control their own network and they get access to the data in the cloud where they can actually use that data to make a better product, a less expensive product and a safer product. And it also marries obviously with private cloud should they so choose to do that.  
So we're changing -- so I think a lot of analysts they're going to have any -- how many handsets you're going to have, what your market share are going to be in handsets and so forth and so on. But your question is well taken in the sense that a part of our business will be -- the enterprise business that is a fairly nascent business today. And we'll be on the leading edge of that as it grows."

That's where we'll find out -- my experience has been, as we open up our first city, we'll have problems. We'll drop a call. Something's going to go wrong that we didn't expect. And then that's where we find that our team and our vendors work together to solve those problems. 
So by the end of the third quarter, you'll see that, you'll see the first major city. We'll have other cities. I don't have a number for you year in, but what we'll be doing every month after the third quarter, we'll be doing multiple cities. And focused on a June of 2022 metric of 20% of the population in the United States to meet our first FCC milestone. 
So -- but by the end of the third quarter, you'll be able to take a phone and see whether we work or not and see all the problems, and we'll have them, for sure, and then see if we can fix them. 
And then you'll have a feel for how good we are at execution and how good our architecture is and how good our network is going to be. But realize, we're not going to be running in the first city, we'll be crawling. And then hopefully, we'll get up and be walking by the end of the year."

And then related to that, you did a convertible security in the -- December, it wasn't a huge number relative to the overall financing. But I wonder if you could just talk about your thought process of why you decided to go with a convertible rather than debt? And whether we should read anything into that for future financing decisions?"

So I think on strategic partners, Craig, we look at it maybe a little bit different than the Street does, but for our strategic partners or our strategic relationships, we already have the major strategic -- whether it be VMware or [indiscernible  or Altiostar or Crown, an SBA, Vertical Bridge and other tower companies and more to come. 
So what we do there is -- and we're a pretty big R&D project, and all those companies are helping us. They're spending capital, but they're not getting the immediate return on in terms of that. And like in the cloud, we've got several companies have been helping us with cloud. And wireless is the next big growth. Telco's the next big growth for cloud. In fact, it's probably the biggest growth of the next decade. That's probably going to be their biggest growth. And yet, it's a little bit different than the normal data that they've been doing today. So there's some things that we have to invent together and change in what they're doing. 
So the way we look at strategic partnerships, there's -- money aside is, how do we make their company better? And how do they make our company better? And everybody we're working with, that's our goal, is we're their champions to go help make those -- their companies better, whether it be providing resources or test beds or our testing on our network, and they're spending a lot of resources to help make us better. 
From a financing point of view, the converged security, we just felt like putting capital on the balance sheet to get us to 2023, where I think, there's always a chance more than 0, Craig, that we're out of business. We don't know what the heck we're doing, and we fail. But I think that the rational bet is that we know what we're doing and that we have a team and partners to help us. And we're going to get there. And then obviously, the world looks at this a little bit differently. And you're probably one of our biggest skeptics and it's our job to -- your stuff is well taken. I read your stuff. I think you're a great writer, and I think you make great points. 
But not one of your points, not one ever, has been something that we haven't thought about here. And that we don't at least believe we have a strategic solution to it. And therefore, I think that our job is to go out and produce this, is to go out and execute and build this network. And then obviously, internally, we talk about -- we just prove our skeptics wrong. And so we don't really talk -- so we don't do a bunch -- we don't spend a lot of time talking external about what we're doing, we just stay focused on what we're doing. And good teams and good companies that do things, they focus. And we focus probably to our detriment. We don't explain what we're doing to everybody every day. But we're going to show you.

We had a lot of debt maturities. But I think what -- same thing happened to us in DBS. We always wanted a partner in DBS. We wanted somebody to help us build satellites. And what happened was, ultimately, we just got good enough. We just got confident enough and good enough in what we're doing, that it just made sense to keep the equity. And it didn't make sense to give up the equity. 
And so I think we're probably in a similar situation today in the sense that we do have enough capital to build on our balance sheet today, to build our network to the point where people can see whether OpenRAN cloud-native networks work. And I know not everybody in this call sees it, but we see it every day. The number of resumes and the quality of people that are applying to come work with us is exponentially higher than it was last year. 
The number of vendors that are putting resources towards us is vastly different than it was last year. The -- I think the whisper confidence level for people in the know is vastly higher. 
We're leading though. Nobody's built a 5G OpenRAN cloud-native network before. We're fortunate that GEO took a first step and Rakuten took a second step, but we're going to be the first network that does it and completely. And I don't think -- there's certainly always will be skepticism. But that -- every time we hit a milestone internally with our partners, it -- that goes down. And you saw -- you see it -- you saw with Qualcomm and they put one of our frequencies in their chips. They don't do that for -- that cost them money. That cost them R&D, it cost them space. It costs them antennas, it cost them that radio. They don't do that for companies who aren't going to make it."

We certainly want -- certainly, speeds are important. But certainly, that is -- you don't -- everybody doesn't need a car that -- got a Lamborghini that goes 280 miles an hour, and I think as long as we make something that goes 100 miles an hour, we'll be in pretty good shape. 
So I think we'll look at consistency. And then we look at where all the problems are, where are our dead spots, where do we go along in our RF plan? Where did we -- where does our  open rent have issues and how are we ever to analyze that and how are we able to sell fuel and self-correct. And it's just all those issues. My experience in DBS was, I remember when we launched, our pay-per-view didn't work. And -- and then as we started getting customers and getting more successful than we thought initially, suddenly, we couldn't actually provision people fast enough. We didn't have enough compute power to do it. And as we learned all those things, and it took us 3 or 4 months to kind of get the right things in place. And then it was clear sailing. But we still had problems, but they were kind of one-offs, one at a time. 
So my expectation is that we'll -- I think everybody on this call will have a pretty good idea where this stands by the end of the year. And some people are going to say, we bit off more than we can chew, and some people are going to say, well, we always knew they could do it. And we're good at execution. Transition's tough. Execution is hard work, but there is no law of physics. Walt, this is important. There are no law of physics to stop us from what we're doing. There is nothing that has to be invented to stop us from what we're doing. People know how to climb towers. We'll be getting radios in. People know had to build radios. People now know how to build broadband DUs. Cloud exists. We don't have to invent the cloud. Handsets exist. We just have to execute. And right now, we're -- it's right to be skeptical about our execution because we got to prove it. 
And -- but this team, we have a team that can do it. And it's just -- for me, it's a pleasure to get from the transition stage to the execution stage because it's just hard work. And we never knew tenured I'm looking at Tom here, but 10 years ago, we knew we had to get 100 megahertz of spectrum. We've got 40 megahertz of spectrum. And we said, how are we going to -- we just never knew if we'd get there or not. 
Now we've got well over that. And the -- well, I can't talk about the C-band auction, I think that -- that's a whole another dynamic and a whole another strategy, counter strategy kind of thing that you guys will be writing on in the next -- the rest of the year.

We are focused on building new, more profitable acquisition channels. So you'll see us look to make changes there as we move forward. 
We are working through some very big technology and operational projects with the Boost business. I want to point out, which is new news this quarter, is that we have received notice from T-Mobile. The voice CDMA network will be discontinued on or around January 1, 2022. 
So the majority of our retail wireless subscribers receiving services from that network were part of work on planning a big migration. So we can't be certain that the network will actually shut down on that time line. But we have to plan and act as if it will, which will be costly for us.

No, I was going to say. So Boost is probable -- so I don't think anything -- I don't think that this quarter, that those kind of margins are probably sustainable to the extent that, in fact, it might not be very good at all in the sense that we look at it from a profit and loss, the Boost customers are some of the most economically challenged customers out there, that Boost pays attention to them and they're good customers for Boost. But they're economically challenged. 
And so if they -- it's hard to upgrade, to go from a phone that works great and works in their territory, works great and then go to another phone that won't even work on our network because we're 5G. So then we have to upgrade them again. So you run the numbers on that, and there would be significant fallout from that, in my opinion. 
The second thing is, I don't even think we could get the supply of the phones that we would need. So we just don't -- it's -- you can't order phones and not know that you can move the phones and the supply is somewhat limited for the kind of phones we might need for that. So that's a material risk that's out there on Boost. 
And -- but I think the positive side is the team, the Boost team, John, lead and the team, show them they can execute. They showed that they, in a very short period of time, could turn around some past practices from Boost that weren't economical. And maybe were to show Wall Street some numbers. We're not into that game here. We're into actually managing your capital and our capital in an efficient manner. 
And so they've shown that they can turn that around in very short order. I set a goal for them to be profitable by the end of the year. They were profitable the first quarter, and they became more profitable in the second quarter. So we've got a management team that can execute, and they're on pins and needles and the edge of their seat to get our first market on our network where we can control our own destiny."

When it comes to our software, you remember that we -- the first choice we made was to set at VMware. And the reason was that we wanted to control the software that we use. And VMware has given us, over the last 15 months, has given us this capability to move our software a bit with cloud, but also from the top of the cloud to the edge. And no other network or no other architecture has that capability in the world yet for us. That was very important because when you discuss private networks, different customers want different setups. Some want, do you have a certain type of cloud, some want, you have the private cloud, some want to put the software on their premise, on their factory or on their campus. 
And for us, it has to be automated. And so we spend a lot of time with our cloud partners to be able to do that seamlessly.

I think that what -- we value programming, is to have -- how many people watch it. So for lack of a better word, cost per viewing hour. And what are the alternatives to get it. 
So obviously, to the extent that we had football exclusively, we had NFL season ticket, that was an exclusive. That has value, to the extent that you can watch it in 10 different places, it has 1/10 the value, right? So when our -- we have a content negotiation and our content, that content is available through other means, it's just less valuable to us. And then the content providers are strategically, I think, in their strategic rooms. They're saying, how do we keep these linear guys paying as much money as possible for as long as possible, while we go direct to the consumer and cut them out? 
And oh, by the way, we're making these guys bundle every channel, and we'll go to the consumer and give them a lot more flexibility and be a la carte. So obviously, that's a, that's going to be a tough business model going forward. We're unique in that, Erik, maybe speak to this, we've made our viewing -- we looked at viewing as an experience, and we've done a lot of different things to make the experience on DISH network better than the experience might be. And on one of these vendors, and we go after people that are more rural and so forth and so on. 
But look, it's why the -- all I can say is, I'm sleeping at night now because we -- I've been through this before. We knew the big dish business was going to be a business that would be challenged 40 years before anybody ever wrote the first word about it. We knew that this model would be challenged in video. I think we talked about it on a conference call probably, you go back and look on your records, probably 7 or 8 years ago, when everybody kind of laughed at us and said, why aren't you spending more money to get these customers? 
And we've made that transition that it's a mature, declining business, and it's a solid business. The cash flows are good. It's not going away, but it's going to decline. And I would expect our cost of programming would go down or would -- or wouldn't go up as much, based on customers going direct. And we probably will lose some of our customers -- some of our programming partners we may lose as a result of that. 
But Erik and his team are running it as a business. We have great relationships with our consumers. We found that out with HBO. HBO didn't renew, they wanted minimum guarantees from us and the high prices that we -- that made no sense for us to pay. And obviously, we're a competitor. So they had no -- and they had Game of Thrones coming up, final season to Game of Thrones. We didn't lose -- we didn't lose many customers, let me put it that way, because our relationship was strong. And they felt -- they bought Showtime and STARZ and other things, Netflix, and so -- and HBO lost the revenue stream. So do you want to jump in on that? No. Fine."

I think a jump ball, are -- you guys wanted to give us a sense -- I understand, Charlie, your comments that you can fully fund the network build-out at this point, based on cash flow and cash on hand. But just curious if you're willing to say what the 2021 spending on deploying the network would be? 
And then lastly, sort of just, not sure if there's much more fishing I can do here, Charlie, but just adding on to Craig's question. I think I was pretty surprised by you using equity. You certainly have a pretty long history of avoiding equity. I assume you expect a lot of value creation if you execute here. The last couple of years, you mentioned there was a lot of interest in financing and helping you with funding the network and shifting over to equity from that seems like a change in sort of balancing how you might financing. So was the demand by others willing to give you money just sort of too expensive in terms of share of capacity? Or in terms of the rate they wanted to charge you versus equity? Any more that you could help us with understanding, issuing a convert rather an issuing debt or taking an investment in would be helpful."

The market kind of threw up on it for whatever reason, and we thought we'd get a little bit better execution, so we're disappointed. 
But on the other hand, it's not going to be material in the scheme of things, where we're going. So that was 0% interest for 5 years was attractive. And again, I think we didn't quite hit our metric of where we thought we would come in, pricing-wise. And had we, in hindsight, maybe knowing if it was going to be conversion in the 40 -- low $40 range, I think maybe we'd have thought about it differently.

So the AWS -- but we started in any partnership, particularly when it comes to technology and building a network is you have to start with best-in-class technology. So you would never compromise somebody else's multibillion-dollar investment and take a second -- and take a secondary network. So we've analyzed for I've been working on for 5 years. Marc was a lot more experts than I was, but over the last 18 months, we've really been with all the cloud providers big version. And good news is they're all very good. In the United States is very lucky. There's no question that the United States leads in cloud technology.
But at the end of the day, Amazon had too big of a head start. They jumped in really early. They wanted to get into telco space. It was strategic for them. The cloud infrastructure as it existed a couple of years ago, really didn't handle telco very well. There's been a lot of R&D and investment that they've had to make to transform their network into something that where a telco can operate in the cloud because it's a little bit different than their traditional IT infrastructure. And at the end of the day, they were best-in-class for what we needed. And whether it be their APIs and the documentation and discipline and the community that supports them and their -- the developers and then, of course, obviously, reach into the enterprise business.
So well, it was -- so that's the first and foremost. And then the second thing, I think, is the company committed? And I'm not going to put words in Amazon's mouth. I'll let them talk to their commitment, but they've done a lot of work for us to help us without knowing where they'd have a deal or not, and we're very appreciative of that. And I think it's helpful that Andy will become the CEO because he's owned this project from the start, and he can -- he'll be able to move all the pieces within Amazon to focus on this.
And so I think at the end of the day, I think we're going to be their largest customer in cloud, and I think they're going to -- may be the largest customer in our network. I mean we have to build the network, prove it and they have to build it and prove it. I think that other carriers around the world will, including the United States, we're looking at Amazon as a real leader here because we're just doing something different.
So -- I say this, the simplest example, you got to look at it. We're building Netflix in a blockbuster world. So Netflix -- all Netflix did was put the video on the cloud. That's all they did. When you go into a physical store, you put it in the cloud, right? All the business plans in the world, all the numbers, all the talk, they just did something simple. They put it in the cloud.
The technology was -- they were a little ahead of the technology, but the technology got there. All we're doing is taking all those towers that you're seeing as you drive down the highway, we basically put them in the cloud. And so instead of driving to a physical store and renting a movie, you're going to get all your data and information and automation, everything from the cloud.
And so it's a dramatic paradigm shift in the way a network is built and it should -- and it's an advantage over legacy carriers who have 30-year-old architecture. So they'll slowly get things in the cloud, they'll put pieces of their network in the cloud, but they just can't take -- I think they just can't take a front loader and move everything in the cloud at 1 time.
So with that, I'll turn it over maybe to [indiscernible]"

So just in terms of what the Las Vegas build looks like, I think there are several attributes that are really important to what we're doing to build on Charlie's comment. One is we are building a cloud-native infrastructure. We are using an open radio access architecture, but it's also a 5G native network. We're not trying to put 5G on top of in 2G, 3G and 4G. The infrastructure that we're deploying is optimized for 5G. And the way we've designed in or work from an RF perspective and a deployment perspective is to take advantage of the 5G architecture as well as the 5G platform.
And so what does that look like? It's basically a new network. It's a new infrastructure. It's designed using all of the spectrum bands that we have and the RF is 1 of the lines to take advantage of that. So we're on a path to launching that in the third quarter, but it's 1 of a number of markets we have coming on. We just haven't announced those markets through the end of the year, but it's the first of, obviously, a number that we have in flight today, and we've got activity going on across the country to actually build out this network.
So we'll be the first one that people can touch and feel and get the experience, but it is really a 5G native network. And we've proven that O-RAN from a technology perspective on work compared to that at the end of last year, now we're in the execution phase. Now we're in the deployment phase. And so Vegas will happen to be the first one that it will be a fully deployed market that people will be able to touch and feel and experience."

Yes, we anticipated a cloud-native network from the beginning.

And having been through this kind of scale before, and we just have to fix it and then we find out how -- we find out whether that strategy of picking the vendors who are committed to what we're doing. Is that -- we picked the right team from a vendor community? And do we have the right team internally to overcome the obstacles that we inevitably will face.
And we're all confident today. And then as soon as we light up Las Vegas, we're probably going to be less confident the next day. That's the way my experiences. And then we'll dig in and fix the problems and we'll be patting ourselves in the back, hopefully. But it's execution risk.
And so if you look at guys as investors, that's a serious risk. And -- but we've eliminated what I always thought by far, the more serious risk, probably 10x more risks. Could you architect a network, could you enter the marketplace when there was a paradigm shift so that your technology 1 up, not only the incumbents in the United States, but we're 1 up and what other people around the world are doing, particularly in China.

The other option is that we're building together a next-generation RAN acceleration at what we call a DU, which is the compute part of the O-RAN. We're building that next-generation them, which is upscaled and scale, which will allow us to mix and use that technology in the RAN as well.

I was extremely -- I've always had a high respect for the management of T-Mobile and particularly, their CEO. But I was disappointed when he went on TV and really said, a couple of really untrue things. One was that there was no big deal that he's turned the CDMA network off. Yes, only -- so 10% of people didn't have phones, only 900,000 people no a big deal. First of all, that number was way low as you've seen in our disclosure, I'm not sure exactly. I don't think he's looking at our books, maybe he is, but I don't think he's looking at our books. I don't know how you knew the number.
And the second thing you said because even was shocking was that he had to do it because the FCC was requiring it and demanding it. I mean I don't know exact words, but that was the gist of it. But this is the same company that goes on Twitter and talks about Dumb and Dumber, and how they're for everybody. They love everybody and they're for the consumer. They went to the public utility commission in California under oath and said, it would be 3 years before they turn CDMA off. They forgot about that, once they got their merger done, they became -- they look like every other big company, you as shareholders, should be pretty happy because they're certainly given a good return. There -- they've gone from synergy of $43 billion to now talking about $70 billion of synergy from the -- and they're going to go and turn off millions of customer -- particularly low economic customers. To me, that's a hard loss right?
That's -- and that's just not the T-Mobile that I've seen before. And it's -- they've become the Grinch, right? So we've seen the story before it the Grinch went sold everybody's -- all the kids toys, right? And they're stealing everybody's phone out of their hands have been work anymore. And it was because the branch heart was too small. You get a tiny heart. And so the uncarriers become the uncaring carrier, and that's a shame.
Now the positive is that the grant at the end decided to get the toys back, And its heart grew 3x the size, all right? So I'm hopeful that T-Mobile will -- nobody will work harder than this company to try to make that transition smooth, but it will take -- to answer your question, it'll take more time. If they were to give us several million phones today that we could use, we still couldn't do it in the next 8 months because we don't always have the e-mails. customers don't always have e-mails. They don't -- that addresses, they don't -- they're more transient. They don't always come into our stores. So it's a much more difficult process. Verizon recognized that. They've extended their 3G shutdown, so you may shut down.
I hope that T-Mobile will reconsider that. But if not, it will be -- it will have a material impact on our customers and certainly on our financials."

We have seen an extraordinary investment, especially in the U.S. ecosystem on silicon. In the radio domain, everybody has been dreaming of that for the last 20 years. Silicon has been the weakest point. And what we see now, wow, I mean, it's all over the place. And O-RAN has driven that. I mean you can think of it of all the IT and silicon industry of the U.S. and abroad, investing now to serve that market. I mean I've never seen that.
So what we have in our hands for today, but also for massive MIMO is just incredible, and we're going to leverage that. And you know I'm making a bet that the existing vendors are going to use the same silicon that was brought to the market by the O-RAN because they just don't have the same in-house. So that's forcing them to come to the market as well.
And for massive MIMO, now there is a debate about massive MIMO, and people are confused about O-RAN. One of the debate is that you need to pair the compute with the radio in order to manage the beam forming. And we agree with that. But an allows you to do that as well, right? O-RAN allows you to pair the compute and the software and the radio in order to have advanced being forming. So O-RAN can do exactly the same, if not better."

We just got in that particular auction because of the structure of the auction and the dynamics of the auction that it went far beyond what a reasonable company would bid. And I think we're -- that was a place that -- that was a level that didn't make sense for our company. Obviously, we had hundreds of millions of customers, and you had bet you were telling everybody that millimeter wave was the future, and maybe that technically was a bit of a problem. You had a different strategy. And I think the guys -- in regards to the price, I think they'll do fine on what I think that long term, they're going to do just fine. They're going to be very happy that they have that spectrum. So it will take -- but it doesn't set up very well with the consumer. The $90 billion has to be paid by the consumer unless the government is going to give the money back. So it makes it a less competitive industry out there. So I think it's maybe even more important for DISH to be successful.
And then I think with AWS in cloud, in general, we started. We -- Marc have been looking at for a long time, you may or may not know, but Marc used to be in 1 of the big OEM providers. He's always been frustrated by the pace and the technology, and that's 1 reason he came to work with as DISH because he could start to clean sheet of paper, and it was his dream to do that. It was just had how to do that. And he knew a lot better than we did the issues with legacy. And so I think that at least in the meetings that I've been in and stuff, we always had high hopes for cloud. We knew it would get there. But I do think the scale that investment and the vision of Amazon is maybe a bit larger than I mean you might want to speak to it maybe because you have been working with them before. So."

And same on transport and the redundancy on the size of the compute, the same on the elasticity of the network. When -- one of the things about the telco that is really slowing down telco is that they are over optimized. They never have more capacity than they need. We have unlimited capacity. And for us, it's a luxury because then we can put additional software, we can do automation, we can put things that no telco would dream of because they -- all the hardware is tight.

And then the second -- totally separate question is you've talked about having silicon from Qualcomm and Intel and now, I guess, with the Amazon Graviton silicon. Are you planning to deploy equipment using that to all of those different kinds of silicon? Or are you going to pick 1 and stick with that? Or like how does that work?"

And what's important there is a lot of the traditional radios to date for CBRS have really been LTE and 4G radios or Band 48. And we're actually moving towards in 48. And so being sort of 5G native, we need to see that next generation of radio development to happen.
The other thing that you've probably seen is that we have filed to look at different power levels and increasing the category on the power level up on CBRS as well that would give us far more flexibility and a much more efficient build using that spectrum. And so we're working through that, and that will have an impact in terms of the supply chain.
So with that, I'll just hand it over to Marc."

So we are happy with our Flex run architecture. It's powerful enough. We're using Ice Lake. We can include or the processing, we have good acceleration cards.
Now when we go to massive MIMO, when we go to CBRS, when we go to other banks, we expect to need more acceleration and more integrated silicon, and that's our second generation. That's when we will make the choice for additional silicon.
You were asking about Qualcomm and Graviton. And on top of Flex plan, you have to think about the diversity we're going to use for small cells, for example, or indoor distributed indoor. I'm pretty sure that the type of silicon we need to use will be different for certain very high-density mice MIMO. I'm pretty sure that we will have integrated DU and RU with different type of mass of accelerators.
So I think we will tend to have 1 silicon per use case, right? But when we diversify the use cases, I see different requirements. And we're working very hard with the software vendors to put an abstraction layer on top of the silicon, so that we can pretty much put our software on top without much changes between the different blocks of silicon."

As we've said for, gosh, as long as I've been in conference calls, we view partnerships maybe a little bit different way than other people do. But it's really -- we like to work with committed companies that share our vision and that are helpful in making our company better. And in return, we're going to make their company better. 
So the AWS -- what we start in any partnership, particularly when it comes to technology and building a network, is you have to start with best-in-class technology. So you would never compromise somebody else's multibillion-dollar investment and take a secondary network. So we've analyzed for -- I've been working on it for 5 years. Marc was a lot more expert than I was. But over the last 18 months, we've really been with all the cloud providers, big corporations. And the good news is they're all very good. And United States is very lucky. There's no question that the United States leads in cloud technology. 
But at the end of the day, Amazon had too big of a head start. They jumped in really early. They wanted to get into telco space. It was strategic for them. The cloud infrastructure, as it existed a couple of years ago, really didn't handle telco very well. There's been a lot of R&D and investment that they've had to make to transform their network into something that -- where a telco can operate in the cloud because it's a little bit different than their traditional IT infrastructure. And at the end of the day, they were best-in-class for what we needed. And whether it be their APIs and the documentation, the discipline and vendor -- and the community that supports the and their -- the developers and then, of course, obviously, reach into the enterprise business. So while it was -- so that's the first and foremost. 
And then the second thing, I think, is the company committed? And I'm not going to put words in Amazon's mouth. I'll let them talk to their commitment. But they've done a lot of work for us to help us without knowing where they'd have a deal or not. And we're very appreciative of that. And I think it's helpful that Andy will become the CEO because he's owned this project from the start, and he can -- he'll be able to move all the pieces within Amazon to focus on this. 
And so I think at the end of the day, I think we're going to be their largest customer in cloud, and I think they're going to -- they may be the largest customer in our network. I mean, that we have to build the network, improve it, and they have to build it and improve it. I think that other carriers around the world will, including the United States, will look at Amazon as a real leader here because we're just doing something different. 
So the simplest -- I'll say this, the simplest example, you got to look at it. We're building Netflix in a blockbuster world. So Netflix -- all Netflix did we put the video on the cloud. That's all they did. Instead of going into a physical store, you put it in the cloud, right? All the business plans in the world, all the numbers, all the talk, they just did something simple. They put it in the cloud. The technology was -- they were a little ahead of the technology, but the technology got there. All they're doing is taking all those towers that you see as you drive down the highway, we're basically putting them in the cloud. And so instead of driving to a physical store and renting a movie, you're going to get all your data and information and automation, everything from the cloud. 
And so it's a dramatic paradigm shift in the way a network is built and it should -- and it's an advantage over legacy carriers who have 30-year-old architecture. So they'll slowly get things in the cloud. They'll put pieces of their network in the cloud. But they just can't take it -- they just can't take a front loader and move everything in the cloud at one time. 
So with that, I'll turn it over maybe to..."

So just in terms of what the Las Vegas build looks like, I think there are several attributes that are really important to what we're doing, to build on Charlie's comment. One is we are building a cloud-native infrastructure. We are using an open rad",297,"Yes. So just in terms of what the Las Vegas build looks like, I think there are several attributes that are really important to what we're doing, to build on Charlie's comment. One is we are building a cloud-native infrastructure. We are using an open radio access architecture, but it's also a 5G-native network. We're not trying to put 5G on top of in 2G, 3G and 4G. The infrastructure that we're deploying is optimized for 5G. And the way we've designed in or work from an RF perspective and a deployment perspective is to take advantage of the 5G architecture as well as the 5G platform. 
And so what does that look like? It's basically a new network. It's a new infrastructure. It's designed using all of the spectrum bands that we have, and the RF is up in line to take advantage of that. So -- and we're on a path to launching that in the third quarter, but it's one of a number of markets we have coming on. We just haven't announced those markets through the end of the year, but it's the first of, obviously, a number that we have in flight today, and we've got activity going on across the country to actually build out this network. 
So we'll be the first one that people can touch and feel and get the experience, but it is really a 5G-native network. And we've proven that O-RAN, from a technology perspective can work. Compared to that at the end of last year, now we're in the execution phase. Now we're in the deployment phase. And so Vegas will happen to be the first one that it will be a fully deployed market that people will be able to touch and feel and experience."

Yes, we anticipated a cloud-native network from the beginning. So the $10 billion total build-out cost that we announced a couple of years ago, I think people are probably still skeptical, some people are still skeptical, but you can see where we're headed that most of your models will probably take -- it probably takes a lot -- several to a lot of CapEx off the board when you understand the architecture, and we're not going to go through all the architecture in this call, but it certainly has a material impact on CapEx."

But having said that from that, we still would do it because the technology, what we're doing with the fact that you have your data stored and you can now analyze it, and the fact you can automate and use machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the fact that you can slice the network, those are -- a few people are writing about that now, a few people understand that. 
You're starting to see a bit more visibility to why that makes sense. We've been a few years ahead of the curve. But O-RAN was pie in the sky a couple of years ago. We'll prove that it works in Las Vegas. Cloud-native architecture maybe was pie in the sky a couple of years ago. We're going to prove that it works, and the rest of the world will follow. And you're seeing that. You're seeing O-RAN now being adopted around the world. And the regulators understand it now where they didn't have a great understanding a couple of years ago.

We're going to have some -- some stuff is not going to work. And having been through this kind of scale before, and we just have to fix it, and then we find out how -- we find out whether that strategy of picking the vendors who are committed to what we're doing. Is that -- we picked the right team from a vendor community? And do we have the right team internally to overcome the obstacles that we inevitably will face. 
And we're all confident today. And then as soon as we light up Las Vegas, we're probably going to be less confident the next day. That's the way my experience is. And then we'll dig in and fix the problems and we'll be patting ourselves in the back, hopefully. But it's execution risk. 
And so you guys as investors, that's a serious risk. And -- but we've eliminated what I always thought was, by far, the more serious risk, probably 10x more risk. Was could you architect a network?

So we have that option with AWS, so we can put our software all the way to the edge.
The other option is that we're building together a next-generation RAN acceleration, what we call a DU, which is the compute part of the O-RAN. We're building that next-generation then, which is [ upscaled and scaled ], which will allow us to mix and use that technology in the RAN as well.

I mean, I very rarely get into the politics of this kind of stuff. But the CDMA issue is real. You saw our disclosure. I was extremely -- I've always had high respect for the management of T-Mobile and particularly their CEO. But I was disappointed when he went on TV and really said a couple of really untrue things. 
One was that it was no big deal that he was turning the CDMA network off. Yes, only -- so 10% of people didn't have phones; only 900,000 people, no big deal. First of all, that number is way low, as you've seen in our disclosure, I'm not sure exactly. I don't think he's looking at our books. Maybe he is, but I don't think he's looking at our books. I don't know how he knew the number.
And the second thing he said which was even shocking was that he had to do it because the FCC was requiring it and demanding it. I mean, I don't know the exact words, but that was the gist of it. But this is the same company that goes on Twitter and talks about Dumb and Dumber, and how they're for everybody. They love everybody and they're for the consumer. They went to the Public Utility Commission in California under oath and said it'd be 3 years before they turn CDMA off. They forgot about that. Once they got their merger done, they became -- they look like every other big company. You as shareholders would be pretty happy because they're certainly giving a good return. They're -- they've gone from synergy of $43 billion to now talking about $70 billion of synergy from the -- and they're going to go on and turn off millions of customer -- particularly low economic customers. To me, that's a heartless. That's -- and that's just not the T-Mobile that I've seen before. And it's -- they've become the Grinch, right? So we've seen this story before, right? The Grinch went stole everybody's -- all the kids' toys, right? And they're stealing everybody's phone out of their hands, it doesn't work anymore. And it was because the Grinch's heart was too small. He had a tiny heart. And so the uncarriers become the uncaring carrier, and that's a shame.
Now the positive is that the Grinch, at the end, decided to give the toys back, and its heart grew 3x the size, right? So I'm hopeful that T-Mobile will -- nobody will work harder than this company to try to make that transition smooth, but it will take -- to answer your question, it'll take more time. If they were to give us several million phones today that we could use, we still couldn't do it in the next 8 months because we don't always have the e-mails. Customers don't always have e-mails. They don't have addresses. They don't -- they're more transient. They don't always come into our stores. So it's a much more difficult process. Verizon's recognized that. They've extended their 3G shutdown, CDMA shut down. I hope that T-Mobile will reconsider that. But if not, it will be -- it will have a material impact on our customers and certainly on our financials."

We have seen an extraordinary investment, especially in the U.S. ecosystem, on silicon. In the radio domain, everybody has been dreaming of that for the last 20 years. Silicon has been the weakest point. And what we see now, wow, I mean, it's all over the place. And O-RAN has driven that. I mean you can think of it of all the IT and silicon industry of the U.S. and abroad, investing now to serve that market. I mean I've never seen that.
So what we have in our hands for today, but also for massive MIMO is just incredible, and we're going to leverage that. And you know I'm making a bet that the existing vendors are going to use the same silicon that was brought to the market by the O-RAN because they just don't have the same in-house. So that's forcing them to come to the market as well.
And for massive MIMO, now there is a debate about massive MIMO, and people are confused about O-RAN. One of the debate is that you need to pair the compute with the radio in order to manage the beam forming. And we agree with that. But O-RAN allows you to do that as well, right? O-RAN allows you to pair the compute and the software and the radio in order to have advanced beam forming. So O-RAN can do exactly the same, if not better."

We just got in that particular auction because of the structure of the auction and the dynamics of the auction, that it went far beyond what a reasonable company would bid. And I think we're -- that was a place that -- that was a level that didn't make sense for our company. 
Obviously, we had hundreds of millions of customers, and you had bet -- you were telling everybody that millimeter wave was the future, and maybe that technically was a bit of a problem. You had a different strategy. And I think the guys -- in regards to the price, I think they'll do fine on what -- I think that long term, they're going to do just fine. They're going to be very happy that they have that spectrum. So it will take -- but it doesn't set up very well with the consumer. The $90 billion has to be paid by the consumer, unless the government's going to give the money back. So it makes it a less competitive industry out there. So I think it's maybe even more important for DISH to be successful.
And then I think with AWS in cloud, in general, we started. We -- Marc have been looking at it for a long time. You may or may not know, but Marc used to be in one of the big OEM providers. He's always been frustrated by the pace and the technology, and that's one reason he came to work with us at DISH because he could start with a clean sheet of paper, and it was his dream to do that. It was just he had to do that. And he knew a lot better than we did the issues with legacy. And so I think that, at least in the meetings that I've been in and stuff, we've always had high hopes for cloud and we knew we'd get there. But I do think the scale, that investment and the vision of Amazon is maybe a bit larger than -- I mean you might want to speak to it, because you have been working with them before, so."

It would have taken 10 years to do. And same on transport and the redundancy on the size of the compute. 
The same on the elasticity of the network. When -- one of the things about the telco that is really slowing down telco is that they are over-optimized. They never have more capacity than they need. 
We have unlimited capacity. And for us, it's a luxury, because then, we can put additional software, we can do automation, we can do things that no telco would dream of because they -- all the hardware is tight.

And then on the capital side, the AWS deals should help you on CapEx. And like you said, I guess, it increases your OpEx needs. But when you think about the overall capital needs, I guess it's also a function of the cash burn as you scale the business in the first few years. So the $10 billion probably does not capture that.

And if you have -- if you're connected and you can do that on your own private network, they can make their products better and maybe get a leg up on their competitors.
So all their businesses -- and then they're a video company. So last I looked, video, you need a connection to get it. And whether that means storing it overnight or on the phone or watch from through TV or watching on a tablet or watching on an Alexa device.
So all those things -- and they're making a move into health care. And if you -- the future of health care is people being connected so that we can be monitored without having to go to the emergency rooms, save cost and give better outcomes to patients.
So I don't know. Again, I'm fortunate that I'm not smart enough to figure out all the stuff that you guys figure out. I'm not smart enough to figure out every -- to write a report. Not smart enough -- I can't even speak English. And you got -- all I know is I can see trends. I can see where things are going. I can see what people do. I observe what people do. And you just observe it and you just say, let's go where things are going and let's invent things that people don't even know they need, and let's make it a great product. And so --

Are you planning to deploy equipment using that to all of those different kinds of silicon? Or are you going to pick 1 and stick with that? Or like how does that work?"

And we are working on another generation of radios that will incorporate CBRS as we go forward. 
And what's important there is a lot of the traditional radios to date for CBRS have really been LTE and 4G radios or Band 48. And we're actually moving towards -- in 48. And so being sort of 5G native, we need to see that next generation of radio development to happen.
The other thing that you've probably seen is that we have filed to look at different power levels and increasing the category on the power level up on CBRS as well that would give us far more flexibility and a much more efficient build using that spectrum. And so we're working through that, and that will have an impact in terms of the supply chain.

So we are happy with our Flex RAN architecture. It's powerful enough. We're using Ice Lake. We can include all the processing. We have good acceleration cards.
Now when we go to massive MIMO, when we go to CBRS, when we go to other bands, we expect to need more acceleration and more integrated silicon, and that's our second generation. That's when we will make the choice for additional silicon.
You were asking about Qualcomm and Graviton and on top of Flex plan. You have to think about the diversity we're going to use for small cells, for example, or indoor, distributed indoor. I'm pretty sure that the type of silicon we will need to use will be different. For certain very high-density massive MIMO, I'm pretty sure that we will have integrated DU and RU with different type of massive -- of accelerators.
So I think we will tend to have 1 silicon per use case, right? But when we diversify the use cases, I see different requirements. And we're working very hard with the software vendors to put an abstraction layer on top of the silicon, so that we can pretty much put our software on top without much changes between the different blocks of silicon."

Paul and I are going to keep our comments brief and leave plenty of time for your questions.  
This year has been a trying year for everyone in the face of the pandemic. And I'm proud of how the DISH team has responded and turned obstacles into opportunities. I'm also proud of how we've kept the safety of our team, our customers and our communities we serve top of mind as we execute against our goals throughout the year.  
We've accomplished a lot in 2020, and we've entered the retail wireless business with the acquisition of Boost Mobile, and we partnered with Tucows to utilize their mobile services solutions, and we acquired the T-Mobile subscriber base.  
Now over the past 6 months, we've worked to implement the same discipline we have on the pay-TV side of the business to our retail wireless business. We've introduced new plans, offers, shed unprofitable customers and have been making plans to grow the business in 2021. In addition, we made great strides on building the nation's first cloud-native OpenRAN-based 5G broadband network.  
In 2020, we signed significant contracts with software partners, fiber providers, equipment manufacturers and tower companies. We've charted a course for a great 2021, and we look forward to sharing updates throughout the year on progress on our network.  
We also had a solid year in pay-TV despite the headwinds presented by the pandemic. This was driven by our continued discipline and better execution in both DISH TV and SLING TV. We're focused on providing products and services with the best technology, outstanding customer service and a great value. We strive to offer our customers with a better price-to-value relationship than those available from other pay-TV subscription providers. And through our efforts, we were recognized by our customers for the third year in a row as being #1 in customer satisfaction with J.D. Power in 2020.  
We reported strong revenue numbers for the year and brought in more than $3 billion in OIBDA. And we've increased our revenue more than $2.5 billion from 2019, and our net income by nearly $400 million.  
With that, I'd like to highlight a few items across several key lines of business for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, we continued to advance our wireless efforts. Retail wireless net subscribers decreased by approximately 363,000 for the fourth quarter, largely due to our ongoing efforts to integrate our retail wireless operations, shed unprofitable customers and make operational changes to enhance profitability. As I mentioned last quarter, our profitability is determined in part by what we pay to access the network as an MVNO. As we roll out our own network, we'll begin to benefit from owner economics. That's going to drive profitability that allow us to be more disruptive and drive better competition in the retail wireless space. In addition, we made great strides in Q4 with our wireless network efforts.  
Since our last call, we've enlisted fiber providers like Everstream, Zayo, Crown, Segra and Uniti for fronthaul and backhaul network support. We reached an agreement with Crown Castle for wireless towers. And just last month, we signed a similar agreement with Vertical Bridge.  
We've announced an agreement with Aviat for 5G microwave transport services and signed a deal with Mavenir for cloud-based messaging and Qualcomm to utilize our 5G RAN platforms.  
We've also completed our first 5G validation in December. 2021 is going to be a landmark year for us in wireless, and Charlie, Tom and Mark are here with us today and are available to talk more in-depth about our wireless progress in a few minutes.  
With regard to the quarter, DISH TV performed well, given the current environment, with gross activations of nearly 235,000. They're down year-over-year primarily due to COVID and our approach to it. And as stated before, the crisis has impacted our customers' willingness to respond to some marketing tactics like opening direct mail or event-based sales, and in some cases, allowing technicians to perform services in their home. As a result, we reduced our marketing expenditures and our gross new TV subscribers have decreased. However, our DISH TV strategy has been anchored in acquiring and retaining long-term profitable customers. We've been focused on a more rural and higher credit quality customer base, and we remain committed to that path.  
In the quarter, we saw DISH TV net subscriber loss of 149,000. Our losses were primarily the result of a lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations, partially offset by lower DISH TV churn rate. Paul is going to have a few -- a bit more detail on that in a moment.  
Turning to SLING TV. In the quarter, we gained approximately 16,000 subscribers. And while we still have considerable room to grow, we're encouraged that we added subs in the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year. This is primarily due to the return of sports, and it was also helped by the improvements we made to the platform. We launched Sling Watch Party to enhance the collaborative viewing experience, added new programming like the Big 10 and increased our on-demand library to over 150,000 titles. And most recently, we added 50 hours of free DVR storage.  
With that said, we continue to focus on acquiring and retaining profitable customers and delivering a great experience for both DISH TV and SLING TV.  
2021 is going to be an exciting and transformative year for many -- on many fronts, and we've got a lot of work to do, but we've got the focus, the resolve to realize our vision.  
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul for a little comment -- commentary on the numbers."
110001,704753602,2275553,"DISH Network Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2021",2021-02-22,"Earnings Calls","DISH Network Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Erik. I have some brief remarks on the quarter before we open it up for questions. As a reminder, we made changes to our financial reporting in the third quarter.

As a reminder, we made changes to our financial reporting in the third quarter. We now disclose operating results for both our pay-TV and wireless segments. In addition, we report results for our 2 wireless business units, retail wireless and 5G network deployment. Since we now report segment operating results, we're disclosing segment OIBDA as a measure of profitability for each segment.  
Erik addressed the overall subscriber trends, but I'll add a little color on our commercial subscribers for DISH TV. The COVID pandemic has significantly impacted our commercial subscribers. As discussed in previous quarters, 250,000 of these accounts were put on pause and/or received temporary rate relief. They were removed from our Q1 ending DISH TV subscriber count.  
During 2020, 80,000 of those subscribers restored service or had temporary rate relief end. These subscribers came back with minimal or no cost. They were added to our ending subscriber count without being counted as a gross activation.  
Of the remaining commercial accounts, 69,000 of these accounts disconnected during the year. We are hopeful of the remaining 100,000 commercial accounts will restore service in the coming quarters. However, we cannot be certain of this.  
Companies in the hospitality and the airline industries continue to evaluate the amenities provided to their customers, and that includes pay-TV.  
Turning to the financials. In the fourth quarter, compared to last year, our consolidated revenue and OIBDA are both up significantly. Revenue increased due to the Boost acquisition. The OIBDA increase was driven by pay-TV generating over $1 billion and retail wireless generated $188 million during the quarter.  
Let's dig into the details of each segment. Our pay-TV revenue in the fourth quarter increased due to higher ARPU, partially offset by a lower subscriber base. The increase in pay-TV ARPU was mainly driven by price increases for both DISH and SLING.  
Our subscriber margins for the quarter were positively impacted by the ARPU increases just discussed, and our cost-cutting initiatives related to COVID. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter decreased compared to last year as a result of fewer subscriber additions and our cost-cutting initiatives related to COVID.  
We settled our telemarketing litigation for $210 million, which was $70 million less than what we had accrued, benefiting SG&A expenses in the quarter. DISH TV SAC per activation decreased slightly from $850 last year to $842, largely due to lower equipment cost per activation.  
Now let's turn to our retail wireless business unit. Service revenue was almost $1.1 billion, down slightly from Q3, and OIBDA was $188 million for the quarter. Consistent with DISH and SLING, we're focusing on acquiring long-term profitable retail wireless subscribers. We're currently in the process of making changes to our marketing, sales and operations to further enhance our profitability given our MVNO economics.  
And lastly, let's look at our 5G network deployment group. We invested over $50 million in OpEx and CapEx during the fourth quarter. We expect CapEx to increase substantially throughout 2021 as we ramp up our 5G network deployment.  
During Q4, we generated $357 million of free cash flow and made the final payment of $730 million to the FCC for our licenses to acquire -- for our licenses acquired in Auction 105.  
Finally, in December, we issued $2 billion of our 0% convertible notes due in 2025. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash and marketable securities.

And when you analyze at DISH, and obviously, we don't talk a lot, we don't go to a lot of conferences, and we remain focused on really building our business. But 2020 was a transition year for us. It was a very successful transition year for us. And it's the third time that we've had a transition in my 40 years in business. And I've always felt that the transition year -- the transition time is always the toughest. And if you can get through the transition, then you can really jump-start -- you can really grow your business in a dramatic way.  
So in 1980, when we started the business, the transition really was to survive. Most companies go out of business, probably 90% of the companies go out of business because they just don't have a good idea and run out of funds. And for us, it was -- it took us about 3 years to make the transition from a retail company to a distribution company and actually get past the survival stage.  
Second transition was when -- it took us over a decade, which is we realized that the technology -- that there was a technology -- experimental technology called DBS. And we were in the big dish business and that, that was going to transform big dishes into little dishes. And so in 1995, with the launch of our first satellite, that year was a transition year for us because we had put all the pieces in place with spectrum, satellite construction launch and digital technology to go compete with the cable industry.  
And 2020 was over a decade-long transition of accumulating spectrum and getting critical mass with spectrum to go and compete in the wireless world. And we finalized our long-term executive team, which took years to do. We were able to enter the retail market in wireless in an unexpected way with the acquisition of Boost, and a 7-year MVNO term with T-Mobile who's quietly or not-so-quietly building probably the finest network in the United States. The -- we purchased 14 megahertz of low-band spectrum in 800. We purchased approximately 20 megahertz of CBRS spectrum nationwide, the only nationwide provider, and over -- around 600 megahertz of millimeter wave, all last year. We solidified key vendor relationships who -- and have a number of companies that are helping us on our quest to build the world's best network. And we have over $4 billion of cash in our balance sheet. So that all leads to the fact that as we enter 2021, we have everything that we need to build this one-of-a-kind 5G network. And now it's -- now, for us, it's execution.  
So once you get through the transition stage, you have to focus on -- it's all about execution. And there are certainly significant risks for us as we go execute. We have to deploy our network. And then we've got to put it all together to work -- to make it work. And there certainly will be substantial risk. There's certainly going to be lots of problems, but we have the team and the focus to overcome that. And our company, it has always been a company that can execute. So I have a high degree of confidence that we're going to execute in 2021. That means that we're going to build our first major cities by the end of the third quarter and more to come. We're going to round out our team. The really, really great engineers, the wireless engineers, where they want to come work for this company, because we're building something special. And we're going to continue with rounding out our vendor partners and making sure that we have -- we still have cloud. We still have transport. We still have orchestration, just to name a few. So we'll continue to do that.  
And at the end of the day, we're going to have this really, really special 5G cloud native, OpenRAN virtualized network that really doesn't exist in the world today. So it's not our first rodeo. It's very similar to building the digital video when the world was analog. Wireless networks really haven't been upgraded from an architecture point of view in the last 30 years. And we're confident that with our focus we'll actually help the United States, actually start leading again in wireless and hopefully continue to bring -- most of our partners are American companies with American ingenuity. And there's no reason that America can't lead as an example, nobody has better cloud companies than the United States. Nobody has better -- when you virtualize the network, you know what you write, you do it with software, not hardware. Nobody has better software than the United States. And this is a company that has 2 main operating systems in the world today, and Apple's iOS and Google's Android in the handset side. So there's no reason that this country can't lead, and there's no reason that DISH isn't going to be a part of that and probably will be up front in some of those things.  
The reason the transition is important, is in 1995, we went to the little dish business, we had 2 other competitors. We had a cable company and we had DIRECTV. Today, we probably have over 20 competitors in that very same business. In fact, we compete with our very own suppliers. So that market is very competitive. You've obviously seen the trends in our industry in the last 4 or 5 years. We expect that those trends will probably continue.  
The world is becoming an a la carte world with vendors going directly to their customers.  
But in the wireless world, we're 1 of 4 competitors. So there's 3 $200 billion companies that are out there and we're entering their business with a better network to go compete. And it's not just about competition for consumers or handsets. It's about what a 5G network can do, which includes a lot more than just consumers.  
So with that, we'll open it up for questions."

And secondly, on the Sling business, with the cord-cutting trends in the industry, are you surprised not to see Sling grab more share of that video distribution market? And is there something that's holding it back that could be unleashed over the next 12 months?"

I'll start with the Sling question, and then I'll turn it over to the team for the 5G question. Look, cord cutting has accelerated, Charlie mentioned it in his opening comments. I mean, we are now competing with some of our largest partners on the distribution side.  
We feel like Sling is well positioned, not only from a value perspective and maintaining kind of that lowest price point. But also from delivering a good customer experience and technology. Now we have work to do on the latter two, which we've made good progress on at the end of last year, and we'll continue to make progress on this year.  
But Sling is in a unique position based on our packages and services that we provide in order to be a very complementary service to some of your larger SVOD services, whether it be a Disney, Netflix, Peacock, et cetera.  
So I think that, obviously, we have work to do on the Sling side. I think customers, as Charlie mentioned, there is a bit of a la carte world happening. I think there'll be some aggregation back. But we're well positioned to fulfill the unique proposition, providing a kind of a bundle of cable nets with quality SVOD services from some of the competitors out there.  
I think the other thing that we do very well is we're giving customers choice, right? And choice and how they acquire the content, that is important to them, most uniquely on the local front, right?  
And if you look at expenses, retrans is obviously one of the expenses that's going up at the highest rate, those local channels. And Sling is well positioned to provide services, whether it be an off-air antenna that's integrated to one of our set-top boxes. Or a service like low cast or a service like CVSL access, which will now become Paramount. So our strategy there is to really partner and become complementary and with that, I think we can continue to make progress on the acquisition front."

We should have more market share there. We really were first to market. We stumbled a little bit with our -- with just the quality of the user experience. And technically, as we -- our network was the best at first, but we got -- maybe got a little complacent. It's taken a while to upgrade it, but that's all being done the first half of this year. So we'll see how it goes.  
But it -- we have room to improve that. That's for sure. And we should have gotten more market share.  
On the business side, we don't have a dollar amount to give you today on where the business is. But our network is designed. Let's talk about the 3 things that we do different from current networks. First of all, our network will be an ORAN network. So it means that we separate the baseband and the radio. So it gives a lot more flexibility in terms of mix and matching off-the-shelf parts and radios and lower cost and more flexibility, more American content and vendors and not 1 company that controls us end-to-end like current networks have.  
We're virtual -- we're more virtual. We do a lot more with software than hardware. So it means a lot of big boxes that use a lot of power, those things become software. And we're cloud native, which means our network runs in the cloud. Now why is that important? That's important because we can use modern techniques like machine learning and artificial intelligence, so we can actually analyze our network real time, we can make our network better, but we can also -- we also -- it opens up our ability on an automated basis to what we call slicer networks, so we can open up our network to private networks and companies and what we call enterprise business, so that they can have what looks like their own network. And they control their own network and they get access to the data in the cloud where they can actually use that data to make a better product, a less expensive product and a safer product. And it also marries obviously with private cloud should they so choose to do that.  
So we're changing -- so I think a lot of analysts they're going to have any -- how many handsets you're going to have, what your market share are going to be in handsets and so forth and so on. But your question is well taken in the sense that a part of our business will be -- the enterprise business that is a fairly nascent business today. And we'll be on the leading edge of that as it grows."

I think obviously, we have lots of metrics and milestones internally, and we're not going to go through each and every one of those, because it's just a bit complicated. And then obviously, our focus is on actually doing that. But the big milestone for people is probably going to be our first major city that's up and operational. That's where we'll find out -- my experience has been, as we open up our first city, we'll have problems. We'll drop a call. Something's going to go wrong that we didn't expect. And then that's where we find that our team and our vendors work together to solve those problems. 
So by the end of the third quarter, you'll see that, you'll see the first major city. We'll have other cities. I don't have a number for you year in, but what we'll be doing every month after the third quarter, we'll be doing multiple cities. And focused on a June of 2022 metric of 20% of the population in the United States to meet our first FCC milestone. 
So -- but by the end of the third quarter, you'll be able to take a phone and see whether we work or not and see all the problems, and we'll have them, for sure, and then see if we can fix them. 
And then you'll have a feel for how good we are at execution and how good our architecture is and how good our network is going to be. But realize, we're not going to be running in the first city, we'll be crawling. And then hopefully, we'll get up and be walking by the end of the year."

And then -- and perhaps tell us your thinking of when is the ideal time to add that partner? Is it before you've done any of your test markets? Would you rather have a test market in advance? 
And then related to that, you did a convertible security in the -- December, it wasn't a huge number relative to the overall financing. But I wonder if you could just talk about your thought process of why you decided to go with a convertible rather than debt? And whether we should read anything into that for future financing decisions?"

So I think on strategic partners, Craig, we look at it maybe a little bit different than the Street does, but for our strategic partners or our strategic relationships, we already have the major strategic -- whether it be VMware or [Aviat] or Altiostar or Crown, an SBA, Vertical Bridge and other tower companies and more to come. 
So what we do there is -- and we're a pretty big R&D project, and all those companies are helping us. They're spending capital, but they're not getting the immediate return on in terms of that. And like in the cloud, we've got several companies have been helping us with cloud. And wireless is the next big growth. Telco's the next big growth for cloud. In fact, it's probably the biggest growth of the next decade. That's probably going to be their biggest growth. And yet, it's a little bit different than the normal data that they've been doing today. So there's some things that we have to invent together and change in what they're doing. 
So the way we look at strategic partnerships, there's -- money aside is, how do we make their company better? And how do they make our company better? And everybody we're working with, that's our goal, is we're their champions to go help make those -- their companies better, whether it be providing resources or test beds or our testing on our network, and they're spending a lot of resources to help make us better. 
From a financing point of view, the converged security, we just felt like putting capital on the balance sheet to get us to 2023, where I think, there's always a chance more than 0, Craig, that we're out of business. We don't know what the heck we're doing, and we fail. But I think that the rational bet is that we know what we're doing and that we have a team and partners to help us. And we're going to get there. And then obviously, the world looks at this a little bit differently. And you're probably one of our biggest skeptics and it's our job to -- your stuff is well taken. I read your stuff. I think you're a great writer, and I think you make great points. 
But not one of your points, not one ever, has been something that we haven't thought about here. And that we don't at least believe we have a strategic solution to it. And therefore, I think that our job is to go out and produce this, is to go out and execute and build this network. And then obviously, internally, we talk about -- we just prove our skeptics wrong. And so we don't really talk -- so we don't do a bunch -- we don't spend a lot of time talking external about what we're doing, we just stay focused on what we're doing. And good teams and good companies that do things, they focus. And we focus probably to our detriment. We don't explain what we're doing to everybody every day. But we're going to show you. And that's why I think John's question, I think, earlier, when we can see something, the third quarter, I think, will be important. 
And then -- so there's -- so the ideal time is when you can show people what you're doing, if you believe in what you're doing."

And what happened was, ultimately, we just got good enough. We just got confident enough and good enough in what we're doing, that it just made sense to keep the equity. And it didn't make sense to give up the equity. 
And so I think we're probably in a similar situation today in the sense that we do have enough capital to build on our balance sheet today, to build our network to the point where people can see whether OpenRAN cloud-native networks work. And I know not everybody in this call sees it, but we see it every day. The number of resumes and the quality of people that are applying to come work with us is exponentially higher than it was last year. 
The number of vendors that are putting resources towards us is vastly different than it was last year. The -- I think the whisper confidence level for people in the know is vastly higher. 
We're leading though. Nobody's built a 5G OpenRAN cloud-native network before. We're fortunate that GEO took a first step and Rakuten took a second step, but we're going to be the first network that does it and completely. And I don't think -- there's certainly always will be skepticism. But that -- every time we hit a milestone internally with our partners, it -- that goes down. And you saw -- you see it -- you saw with Qualcomm and they put one of our frequencies in their chips. They don't do that for -- that costs them money. That costs them R&D, it costs them space.

So the foundation is we -- is what can we do compared to what other people do, although we won't have as much -- I mean, we'll be -- it'd be a 100% 5G network, so that will be completely different than other people. 
We certainly want -- certainly, speeds are important. But certainly, that is -- you don't -- everybody doesn't need a car that -- got a Lamborghini that goes 280 miles an hour, and I think as long as we make something that goes 100 miles an hour, we'll be in pretty good shape. 
So I think we'll look at consistency. And then we look at where all the problems are, where are our dead spots, where do we go along in our RF plan? Where did we -- where does our  open rent have issues and how are we ever to analyze that and how are we able to sell fuel and self-correct. And it's just all those issues. My experience in DBS was, I remember when we launched, our pay-per-view didn't work. And -- and then as we started getting customers and getting more successful than we thought initially, suddenly, we couldn't actually provision people fast enough. We didn't have enough compute power to do it. And as we learned all those things, and it took us 3 or 4 months to kind of get the right things in place. And then it was clear sailing. But we still had problems, but they were kind of one-offs, one at a time. 
So my expectation is that we'll -- I think everybody on this call will have a pretty good idea where this stands by the end of the year. And some people are going to say, we bit off more than we can chew, and some people are going to say, well, we always knew they could do it. And we're good at execution. Transition's tough. Execution is hard work, but there is no law of physics. Walt, this is important. There are no law of physics to stop us from what we're doing. There is nothing that has to be invented to stop us from what we're doing. People know how to climb towers. We'll be getting radios in. People know had to build radios. People now know how to build broadband DUs. Cloud exists. We don't have to invent the cloud. Handsets exist. We just have to execute. And right now, we're -- it's right to be skeptical about our execution because we got to prove it. 
And -- but this team, we have a team that can do it. And it's just -- for me, it's a pleasure to get from the transition stage to the execution stage because it's just hard work. And we never knew ten years --  I'm looking at Tom here, but 10 years ago, we knew we had to get 100 megahertz of spectrum. We've got 40 megahertz of spectrum. And we said, how are we going to -- we just never knew if we'd get there or not. 
Now we've got well over that. And the -- well, I can't talk about the C-band auction, I think that -- that's a whole another dynamic and a whole another strategy, counter strategy kind of thing that you guys will be writing on in the next -- the rest of the year.

We are focused on building new, more profitable acquisition channels. So you'll see us look to make changes there as we move forward. 
We are working through some very big technology and operational projects with the Boost business. I want to point out, which is new news this quarter, is that we have received notice from T-Mobile. The voice CDMA network will be discontinued on or around January 1, 2022. 
So the majority of our retail wireless subscribers receiving services from that network were part of work on planning a big migration. So we can't be certain that the network will actually shut down on that time line. But we have to plan and act as if it will, which will be costly for us. And as Charlie mentioned earlier, we're focused heavily on building devices with our partners that will work on our future network. And so we've got some timing and other considerations there that we've got to work through."

No, I was going to say. So Boost is probable -- so I don't think anything -- I don't think that this quarter, that those kind of margins are probably sustainable to the extent that, in fact, it might not be very good at all in the sense that we look at it from a profit and loss, the Boost customers are some of the most economically challenged customers out there, that Boost pays attention to them and they're good customers for Boost. But they're economically challenged. 
And so if they -- it's hard to upgrade, to go from a phone that works great and works in their territory, works great and then go to another phone that won't even work on our network because we're 5G. So then we have to upgrade them again. So you run the numbers on that, and there would be significant fallout from that, in my opinion. 
The second thing is, I don't even think we could get the supply of the phones that we would need. So we just don't -- it's -- you can't order phones and not know that you can move the phones and the supply is somewhat limited for the kind of phones we might need for that. So that's a material risk that's out there on Boost. 
And -- but I think the positive side is the team, the Boost team, John, lead and the team, show them they can execute. They showed that they, in a very short period of time, could turn around some past practices from Boost that weren't economical. And maybe were to show Wall Street some numbers. We're not into that game here. We're into actually managing your capital and our capital in an efficient manner. 
And so they've shown that they can turn that around in very short order. I set a goal for them to be profitable by the end of the year. They were profitable the first quarter, and they became more profitable in the second quarter. So we've got a management team that can execute, and they're on pins and needles and the edge of their seat to get our first market on our network where we can control our own destiny."

And now we have the confidence that the cloud partners in the U.S. have the telco technology that we need. And that's a big thing for us. So we feel very good about that. 
When it comes to our software, you remember that we -- the first choice we made was to set at VMware. And the reason was that we wanted to control the software that we use. And VMware has given us, over the last 15 months, has given us this capability to move our software a bit with cloud, but also from the top of the cloud to the edge. And no other network or no other architecture has that capability in the world yet for us. That was very important because when you discuss private networks, different customers want different setups. Some want, do you have a certain type of cloud, some want, you have the private cloud, some want to put the software on their premise, on their factory or on their campus. 
And for us, it has to be automated. And so we spend a lot of time with our cloud partners to be able to do that seamlessly. And I -- like I said, for the O-RAN, we are now in the deployment mode where we have the capability with VMware and with some cloud partners to move the software east, west, north, south."

I think that what -- we value programming, is to have -- how many people watch it. So for lack of a better word, cost per viewing hour. And what are the alternatives to get it. 
So obviously, to the extent that we had football exclusively, we had NFL Season Ticket, that was an exclusive. That has value, to the extent that you can watch it in 10 different places, it has 1/10 the value, right? So when our -- we have a content negotiation and our content, that content is available through other means, it's just less valuable to us. And then the content providers are strategically, I think, in their strategic rooms. They're saying, how do we keep these linear guys paying as much money as possible for as long as possible, while we go direct to the consumer and cut them out? 
And oh, by the way, we're making these guys bundle every channel, and we'll go to the consumer and give them a lot more flexibility and be a la carte. So obviously, that's a, that's going to be a tough business model going forward. We're unique in that, Erik, maybe speak to this, we've made our viewing -- we looked at viewing as an experience, and we've done a lot of different things to make the experience on DISH network better than the experience might be. And on one of these vendors, and we go after people that are more rural and so forth and so on. 
But look, it's why the -- all I can say is, I'm sleeping at night now because we -- I've been through this before. We knew the big dish business was going to be a business that would be challenged 40 years before anybody ever wrote the first word about it. We knew that this model would be challenged in video. I think we talked about it on a conference call probably, you go back and look on your records, probably 7 or 8 years ago, when everybody kind of laughed at us and said, why aren't you spending more money to get these customers? 
And we've made that transition that it's a mature, declining business, and it's a solid business. The cash flows are good. It's not going away, but it's going to decline. And I would expect our cost of programming would go down or would -- or wouldn't go up as much, based on customers going direct. And we probably will lose some of our customers -- some of our programming partners we may lose as a result of that. 
But Erik and his team are running it as a business. We have great relationships with our consumers. We found that out with HBO. HBO didn't renew, they wanted minimum guarantees from us and the high prices that we -- that made no sense for us to pay. And obviously, we're a competitor. So they had no -- and they had Game of Thrones coming up, final season to Game of Thrones. We didn't lose -- we didn't lose many customers, let me put it that way, because our relationship was strong. And they felt -- they bought Showtime and STARZ and other things, Netflix, and so -- and HBO lost the revenue stream. So do you want to jump in on that? No. Fine."

And for the most part, we're -- we believe, given where we think we're going to go, that we're relatively debt-free on the wireless side. And we thought we'd get better execution. The market kind of threw up on it for whatever reason, and we thought we'd get a little bit better execution, so we're disappointed. 
But on the other hand, it's not going to be material in the scheme of things, where we're going. So that was 0% interest for 5 years was attractive. And again, I think we didn't quite hit our metric of where we thought we would come in, pricing-wise. And had we, in hindsight, maybe knowing if it was going to be conversion in the 40 -- low $40 range, I think maybe we'd have thought about it differently. But you win some, you lose some and our best guess there wasn't quite as good as it should have been, I guess. And so I go back, file that one away and now we're a little smarter.

I was wondering if you could kind of give us a little bit of a road map between now and, say, the first half 2022, what the network build is going to look like? And what we should expect?

And I'm going to make just an opening comment and throw it over to Stephen Bye on the AT&T question. But obviously, we're always looking for ways to improve things for our customers. And it's no secret that the CDMA shut off -- premature shutoff from T-Mobile was not helpful to the relationship. So it was an opportunity for one of their competitors to work with us. And so that led to discussions that probably otherwise might not have happened. But make no mistake, T-Mobile up is still super important to us, and we're happy to have 2 really good companies that we can work with. 
The -- it doesn't help us in the AT&T or T-Mobile, either one of those agreements, do not help us with our -- do not help us in the CDMA shutoff time line, and they don't -- the AT&T doesn't help us in terms of meeting FCC milestones. So -- but it does -- but I do think the agreement with AT&T is from a big picture, certainly moderately -- I'll let AT&T speak for themselves, but I view it as certainly moderately positive for both companies and potentially extremely positive for both companies. And with that, maybe I'll throw it over to Steve and then -- and maybe give you a little more color on it."

So just to add some more color to Charlie's comments, this is, as you've seen, a long-term strategic partnership that we have with AT&T. It really -- we went into it with sort of a win-win approach for both companies. It certainly creates value for both of us, which we feel is very important as companies but also for our customers. And so one of the things that's very important in this relationship is the quality of the AT&T network as it relates to supporting our customers and particularly, our DISH customers that skew -- tend to skew more rural, so they have a much better network and the quality of network and reliable network in that -- in those markets. It allows us to go beyond our existing footprint that we serve with Boost today to broaden our distribution and address a different part of the market, given the quality of the network and the coverage. 
I think the other part of the relationship is beyond being strategic, it is a long-term partnership. And we've been working with them on how we manage the customer migration as well as the support for those customers, both on our network as well as the AT&T network. But in addition to that, also with the T-Mo network. And so it is a good relationship and one that we're working towards operationalizing as we go forward. The other thing to add in the relationship with AT&T is it is a broad running agreement. So it does give us in-market roaming in addition to out-of-market roaming for a long time. As you've seen, it's a 10-year agreement. So that's very important as it helps to support our build but doesn't remove any of our obligations on the build. And so with that, I'll hand it to Dave."

As we've commenced construction on close to 30 markets -- in 30 geographies within those 36 markets. So in some cases, there may be multiple geographies within a market that will -- that we've commenced construction on.

I'll try to take some of those and maybe somebody else will want to jump in. In terms of transition from AT&T, I mean, obviously, AT&T will be our primary partner from an MVNO perspective going forward. But that doesn't mean that we're transitioning our customers off of T-Mobile. They again, remain an important part of what we're doing, to the extent that they want to be an important part of what we're doing. 
So one of the things that we'll do that relate to Las Vegas is obviously we have to be able to provision on AT&T. So that's going to take us a bit of time. But we hope -- maybe somebody else or maybe one of our guys can talk about that. 
And obviously, the -- some customers will want to move to AT&T to get a better network. Some people, the T-Mobile network will be better and they want to stay where they are. And then for new customers, big picture kind of thing is our customers today and for the most part, I think most customers across the United States that we talk to, they really want consistency and coverage as the priority. And the speeds on 4G and LTE are normally fast enough for them. And they don't really see a difference in 5G, when 5G pops up on the phone, so they're a little confused, nobody can charge more for 5G in the United States today. And so obviously, for a new set of customers for us, we think the AT&T network has a tremendous coverage advantage that we don't have today, although T-Mobile is going to be a fast all over there as they build up rural America for their FCC milestones. 
The other part of it is the T-Mobile today probably, arguably has an advantage is certainly a perception of 5G and probably in 5G build out of the 600 megahertz. And while it doesn't really show up as a particular feature on -- the customers can point to, it's still from a marketing perspective, I think they're considered the leader in 5G. And that's where 5G is important for our customers, that's going to be important. 
The key is going to be the 5G development, both our own development, which we think we're doing a little bit differently. But also as you get the big 100 megahertz blocks in C-band or 2.5 that T-Mobile's building out. That's going to be a real race for those guys, and we'll see who does the best job of building something that can differentiate 5G to the consumer. That will be the key. But we're well positioned with both T-Mobile and AT&T, depending on who kind of wins that race plus what we think that we're going to do different within 5G and our architecture that might be different than either one of those two. 
So we're just well positioned. We get the customer the network that they think is the best coverage and quality and value for them. But AT&T is going to get the primary going forward. The -- with AT&T in terms of -- Stephen touched on it, but there's other things beyond -- it's probably moderately positive for both companies, but it could be extremely positive. You mentioned one spectrum we have, we have spectrum -- both have mirror images of 700 megahertz. There might be some interesting things you could do there and save some -- and get scale and save cost if companies are so inclined. We share an interest in the 12 gigahertz spectrum. We have some spectrum that as we build out, we'll lay fallow for a bit until we build it out, and it probably could be put to use sooner rather than later by AT&T. So I think there's a there's technology where things are going that our teams have committed to working together on. And we're buying other services from AT&T, like backhaul, that we have to buy from somebody and since they're a partner now, they get the benefit of the doubt on a lot of those deals. So -- and we're both in the video business, and we have common interest there. 
So you can see this potentially could be a much better deal than the $5 billion that we're committed to. It may not. The companies may not get along, but I think both parties realize that there are things that we can share that are beneficial to both companies and when we can do that, we will -- I'm sure we'll remain frenemies. We'll -- we obviously compete with each other as well. And then as far as -- I forget the question about Las Vegas."

We obviously are doing [ LRANDs ] our baseband and radio vendors have to make sure those things work together. 
And so -- and now we're adding AT&T integration to the network that we hadn't planned on doing in addition to the integration of T-Mobile. So we've got a lot of -- so we think that's going to be at least a 90-day kind of beta integration. Things work in a lab today, but when you take them out of the lab and we get them on Vegas network, that will be deployed by the end of September, we can line up Vegas in total. that goes from the lab to the reality in my experiences, things don't work exactly right the first month or 2, and you've got to integrate that.

Really, there's another party involved in terms of PPG. So whether that's positive or negative, I don't know. But from a regulatory point of view, obviously, there's less and less reality to objections to it because, obviously, the hundreds of billions of dollars of broadband deployment and continued competition from the programmers themselves in the marketplace. So I think that's just -- we'll just have to wait and see whether there's desire on everybody's part to do that. But I think it's a timing issue more than anything else. 
In terms of -- I think the question is CDMA shutoff. Yes. Look, I said early this year that, that was -- that's kind of a false -- T-Mobile had under oath, talked to regulators in California that they would be a minimum of 3 years. I think there's kind of a -- I think it's a false artificial deadline to turn it off in January this year. We view that as a very anticompetitive move because that's a situation where the people that we run, that we pay -- that our partners from an MVNO are actually obviously challenging -- outwardly challenging to get our customers, and that was a convenient way to do it. You may notice that they've got -- and I think they kind of smoked out now, right? They have extraordinary offer in the marketplace for a free upgrade to a 5G phone and 50% off for service for 2 years, extraordinary offer. So that's obviously aimed at  customers to upgrade to their network. 
And I think that -- that's not -- it's -- the bottom line is that they really sort -- what I call sort of winners. It's hard to be a good winner sometime. And they got $70 million of synergy. The government -- $70 billion of synergy the government allowed them to have and now they want $71 billion by getting some customers that we already paid them for. So -- And you all met that guy in great school, who want to brag about himself and brag how good he was and spike the ball in front of you. And that -- sometimes it takes a bit of maturity to be a good winner and they're kind of -- they're a sore winner. And so it's -- but it's good -- on the other hand, it's the fact that a consumer could upgrade, that may not be good for Boost. But at least the customer, our main objective at DISH and Boost is to make sure customers don't lose their service. And to the extent that the customer upgrades, that's -- and doesn't lose their service, I'd much rather have that than the customer loses service. 
So I think that we expect that they'll continue that promotion through January 1. I think that they probably -- they've been in the business. They went on TV and their CEO went on TV and said that nobody would be impacted as everybody was going to be upgraded by January 1. And I expect that they're going to continue that promotion. They're going to upgrade everybody by January 1. And if they do that, then there's probably no controversy other than competition. But we'll have to wait and see how things go."

The majority of our customers that we are making -- we are taking all reasonable efforts to migrate customers, and we've made good progress on that so that people don't suffer from a premerger shutdown. And I think the number is now smaller. 
But I would say this, that our projections show a material amount of customers on January 1 will still have CDMA phones and we'll lose their service. And again, this is the most economically challenged group in America, Boost is not -- these aren't the customers that have bank accounts and high-paying jobs, and these are people that are challenged and so economically challenged.

For a while, you have flagged the enterprise space as a key opportunity for the advanced capabilities of the network you're building, you've talked about network slicing and maybe private networks.

Are you contemplating that, that is a part of how you're going to fund the business going forward? Meaning as you think about that $10 billion budget you outlined, is it plausible that some of that could be financed by enterprise customers?

So adding to Charlie's comments, we're seeing significant traction and interest today in private networks and private 5G networks and the architecture that we're deploying, really enables a level of control and a much deeper level of security that allows the enterprise to utilize that network for their own business operations. So we're seeing significant interest there. We've been responding to multiple RFPs, RFIs. We're working on proof of concepts right now and we're partnering with a number of different SIs as we bring the services to market. And so there are different business models depending on the customer, depending on the geography. And the good thing about these private networks that we're working on is they're not constrained by the geography of building our macro network. So we're able to serve customers in different geographies within that environment. 
And then the other thing, which is also important to highlight, it's across all verticals. There isn't a specific vertical that has an interest in this. We're seeing interest across every vertical and every industrial segment. And we're very well positioned to take the architecture that we're deploying, being cloud native, but also the open architecture, the ability to do slicing, it is distinctively unique compared to what the other operators have in the market today. And so not to say that they can't get there in the future, but we clearly have an advantage today that we're taking advantage of. 
I think it's also important that to add that even in the DISH business today, we do a great business in serving hospitality. And so we're able to partner with the systems integrators we have within that business to augment what we're doing on the video side. And so that's really a terrific model where we can integrate kind of the capabilities and the assets that we have across the whole company to serve other verticals as well that some people may not have on their radar screen today."

But there are clearly national enterprise areas where we wouldn't be competitive today, but there's -- but even within national companies, there's much -- there's very much of it that's localized. So you can imagine the hospitality industry, where that your hospitality is still localized, but in the hospitality industry, you're going to differentiate yourself from your customer service because that's the hospitality industry and you want to -- you're going do that in a market-by-market basis. You can imagine things like mining, right, that aren't -- that need private networks and they probably have to get built, because they're probably not in anybody's footprint today on the other extreme. So there's just a lot of different areas there. 
And I would contend craig, that the profitability on a per bit, on a per dollar of CapEx and the per gig basis is going to be much higher in the enterprise business and global consumer business. The consumer business is quite competitive. And with 3 big players and us entering the marketplace, so -- and with -- so it's quite competitive. Enterprise business, each company is going to have different needs. In some cases, we won't be able to fulfill those needs. One of the other 3 carriers will be able to do it. But in many cases, we're the only guys that can really, in the foreseeable future, fit their needs. And that's going to be a good business for us. And those are long-term contracts. They are long-term sales process. 
So from a revenue perspective, you're not looking for that to be a big revenue item next year. But peripherally, we just know by the interest that there's never a conversation with the company at high levels where they don't want what we're building, I guess, is what I'd say it. We may not be the right company for them. It may be one of our competitors that's better suited, but they want where things are going. And you just can't get there with legacy networks, because you have to automate. And to automate, you have to be in the cloud, and we're going to be there. And then ORAN nobody wants to build last century's network. They want to build the 21st century network, and that's what we're building. And so that's where people are going to spend their money from an enterprise perspective, we're going to want to go."

I'd be curious like, don't they have to treat these separately? I mean, it seems sort of crazy for your customers who don't even have the RSN, this isn't an RSN renewal, it seems like to be forced as part of a retrans renewal to take on channels that cost an extra $4 to $6 a month seems pretty crazy for DISH without a lot of upside.

First of all, I'm disappointed that they put a press release out that they expected the networks to come down since I think we have until August 16. So -- and obviously, many negotiations come down to the wire. So we're still going to bargain in good faith and hope that disappointed that they seem to come to conclusion channels are coming down at this point. But the good news for our customers are -- they have other ways to get their channels. First of all, they watch them less, the network is less and they have other ways to get those networks, but they didn't -- they haven't had all those ways in the past. And -- but we're empathetic to Sinclair because they are having to compete against their own content providers. And we've had a long-term relationship with Sinclair and it's been good. And we've been able to work through the issues at least as tough as this one over the years. 
The regional sports question that realized that Sinclair didn't own the regional sports networks when those networks came up for renewal by the time [ Sinclair Allnet ] was able to negotiate in the part -- our customers that wanted regional sports had left. And so there was no way that in fairness to our customers, we can tax them in a basic package and tax customers who -- almost nobody that was left, no one regional sports was left on our network. They've gone to somewhere else to get them. So I think there's innovative ways to reinvigorate the regional sports networks. Sinclair themselves have talked about it in a direct-to-consumer product. So I think there's other ways to do that. And we'll continue to work with Sinclair to the extent that they want to try to work with us in a win-win situation. But if not, they'll -- I don't -- I'm not going to speak to legalities and regulations, Sinclair pretty savvy about those things. And so they'll work their way through that.

First, curious how you see the opportunities to leverage your 5G network for fixed wireless broadband services over time and how you view the potential funding for broadband in the proposed infrastructure bill as an opportunity in which DISH may want to participate. 
And then just separately, a question on Sling. It returned to positive growth in the quarter. What are your learnings on the customer interest to migrate from legacy video platforms to live streaming platforms? And just curious for your latest views on the opportunities to move a larger portion of your historic DISH video base to your streaming Sling service."

And so I think that's -- as they light up more of their spectrum, certainly places that we can go there. And obviously, I do think you bring up a good point. I think that all of this in the connectivity business are going to have to look and see what the subsidy of the government and infrastructure where the government wants to go and whether you're a particular company or whether you strategically fit into that and whether that's a good business for you. 
So obviously, we continue to really look at that. But I think that's -- I think the infrastructure, the amount of infrastructure that the government is talking about is probably a positive for all connectivity companies and certainly potentially for Americans that don't have service today. With that, I'll give it to you and slide."

I mean, one is the traditional DISH TV satellite business, as you know, for some time, we've really been pointing our efforts towards both acquiring and retaining those profitable customers that are in a more rural geography. And that strategy has been -- they're working well for us. And so the opportunity presents itself as broadband continues to densify, obviously, Sling can be an opportunity for those customers that want to cut the cord there and maybe have a couple SVOD services along with a service like Sling, which can be very complementary to obviously, Netflix or Peacock, et cetera. 
On the Sling side, there's a couple of things we've been talking about over the past few quarters. One is there is a touch of seasonality, obviously, to the OTG business. It is a low barrier but try and it's easy to cancel. But with that said, we also put the onus on ourselves to create a better customer experience. And in Q2, you've seen us deploy now kind of some new technology and a new app to most of the Amazon base and about half the Roku base now. So you're seeing us provide a better customer experience. We're seeing obviously better in the key metrics that you would follow associated with kind of customer engagement, we're seeing those all improve. And so we're optimistic heading into football about our ability to deliver a better customer experience. And then obviously, you had a couple of [indiscernible] events like either Euro 2020 or NBA, which obviously helps on the Sling numbers in Q2. So..."

And it's no secret that the CDMA shut off -- premature shutoff from T-Mobile was not helpful to the relationship. So it was an opportunity for one of their competitors to work with us. And so that led to discussions that probably otherwise might not have happened.  
But make no mistake, T-Mobile is still super important to us, and we're happy to have 2 really good companies that we can work with. The -- it doesn't help us in the AT&T or T-Mobile, either one of those agreements, do not help us with our -- do not help us in the CDMA shutoff time line, and they don't -- the AT&T doesn't help us in terms of meeting SEC milestones. So -- but it does -- but I do think the agreement with AT&T is, from a big picture, certainly moderately -- I'll let AT&T speak for themselves, but I view it as certainly moderately positive for both companies and potentially extremely positive for both companies.

It really -- we went into it with sort of a win-win approach for both companies. It certainly creates value for both of us, which we feel is very important as companies but also for our customers. And so one of the things that's very important in this relationship is the quality of the AT&T network as it relates to supporting our customers and particularly, our DISH customers that skew -- tend to skew more rural, so they have a much better network and the quality of network and reliable network in that -- in those markets.  
It allows us to go beyond our existing footprint that we serve with Boost today, to broaden our distribution and address a different part of the market, given the quality of the network and the coverage. I think the other part of the relationship is beyond being strategic, it is a long-term partnership. And we've been working with them on how we manage the customer migration as well as the support for those customers, both on our network as well as the AT&T network. But in addition to that, also with the T-Mo network. And so it is a good relationship and one that we're working towards operationalizing as we go forward. The other thing to add in the relationship with AT&T is, it is a broad running agreement. So it does give us in-market roaming in addition to out-of-market roaming for a long time. As you've seen, it's a 10-year agreement. So that's very important as it helps to support our build but doesn't remove any of our obligations on the build. And so with that, I'll hand it to Dave."

And so obviously, for a new set of customers for us, we think the AT&T network has a tremendous coverage advantage that we don't have today, although T-Mobile is going to be a fast follower there as they build up rural America for their FCC milestones.  
The other part of it is the T-Mobile today, probably arguably has an advantage is certainly in perception of 5G and probably in 5G build out of the 600 megahertz. And while it doesn't really show up as a particular feature on -- the customers can point to, it's still, from a marketing perspective, I think they're considered the leader in 5G. And that's where 5G is important for our customers, that's going to be important.  
The key is going to be the 5G development, both our own development, which we think we're doing a little bit differently, but also as you get the big 100 megahertz blocks in C-bands or 2.5 that T-Mobile's building out. That's going to be a real race for those guys, and we'll see who does the best job of building something that can differentiate 5G to the consumer. That will be the key. But we're well positioned with both T-Mobile and AT&T, depending on who kind of wins that race, plus what we think that we're going to do different within 5G and our architecture that might be different than either one of those two.  
So we're just well positioned. We get the customer, the network that they think is the best coverage and quality and value for them. But AT&T is going to get the -- be the primary going forward. The -- with AT&T in terms of -- Stephen touched on it, but there's other things beyond -- I said some -- it's probably moderately positive for both companies, but it could be extremely positive. You mentioned one spectrum we have, we have spectrum -- both have mirror images of 700 megahertz. There might be some interesting things you could do there, and save some -- and get scale and save cost if companies are so inclined. We share an interest in the 12 gigahertz spectrum. We have some spectrum that, as we build out, we'll lay fallow for a bit until we build it out, and it probably could be put to use sooner rather than later by AT&T. So I think there's a there's technology where things are going that our teams have committed to working together on. And we're buying other services from AT&T, like backhaul, that we have to buy from somebody and since they're our partner now, they get the benefit of the doubt on a lot of those deals.  
So -- and we're both in the video business, and we have common interest there. So you can see this potentially could be a much better deal than the $5 billion that we're committed to. It may not. The companies may not get along, but I think both parties realize that there are things that we can share that are beneficial to both companies and when we can do that, we will -- I'm sure we'll remain frenemies. We'll -- we obviously compete with each other as well. And then as far as -- I forget the question about Las Vegas."

That goes from the lab to the reality. In my experiences, things don't work exactly right the first month or 2, and you've got to integrate that. But -- and then we'll go from there.

In terms of DIRECTV and DISH, I mean, obviously, I've said it the last year, I think that those 2 companies go together, that's inevitable. Really, there's another party involved in terms of PPG. So whether that's positive or negative, I don't know. But from a regulatory point of view, obviously, there's less and less reality to objections to it because, obviously, the hundreds of billions of dollars for broadband deployment and continued competition from the programmers themselves in the marketplace. So I think that's just -- we'll just have to wait and see whether there's desire on everybody's part to do that. But I think it's a timing issue more than anything else.  
In terms of -- I think the question is CDMA shutoff. Yes, look, I said early this year that, that was -- that's kind of a false -- T-Mobile had under oath, talked to regulators in California that they would be a minimum of 3 years. I think there's kind of a -- I think it's a false, artificial deadline to turn it off in January this year. We view that as a very anticompetitive move because that's a situation where the people that we run, that we pay -- that our partners from an MVNO are actually obviously challenging -- outwardly challenging to get our customers, and that was a convenient way to do it. 
You may notice that they've got -- and I think they kind of smoked out now, right? They have extraordinary offer in the marketplace for a free upgrade to a 5G phone and 50% off for service for 2 years, extraordinary offer. So that's obviously aimed at customers to upgrade to their network. And I think that -- that's not -- it's -- the bottom line is that they really sort -- what I call sort of winners. It's hard to be a good winner sometime. And they got $70 million of synergy. The government -- $70 billion of synergy, the government allowed them to have and now they want $71 billion by getting some customers that we already paid them for, so. 
And you've all met that guy in grade school, who wanted to brag about himself and brag how good he was and spike the ball in front of you. And that -- sometimes it takes a bit of maturity to be a good winner, and they're kind of -- they're a sore winner. And so it's -- but it's good -- on the other hand, it -- the fact that a consumer could upgrade, that may not be good for Boost. But at least the customer, our main objective at DISH and Boost is to make sure customers don't lose their service. And to the extent that the customer upgrades, that's -- and doesn't lose their service, I'd much rather have that than the customer lose a service.  
So I think that we expect that they'll continue that promotion through January 1. I think that they probably -- they've been in the business. They went on TV and their CEO went on TV and said that nobody would be impacted, and everybody was going to be upgraded by January 1. And I expect that they're going to continue that promotion. They're going to upgrade everybody by January 1. And if they do that, then there's probably no controversy other than competition. But we'll have to wait and see how things go."

The majority of our customers that we are making -- we are taking all reasonable efforts to, to migrate customers, and we've made good progress on that, so that people don't suffer from a premerger shutdown.

But I would say this, that our projections show a material amount of customers on January 1 will still have CDMA phones and will lose their service. And again, this is the most economically challenged group in America, Boost is not -- these aren't the customers that have bank accounts and high-paying jobs, and these are people that are challenged and so, economically challenged.

So adding to Charlie's comments, we're seeing significant traction and interest today in private networks and private 5G networks and the architecture that we're deploying really enables a level of control and a much deeper level of security that allows the enterprise to utilize that network for their own business operations. So we're seeing significant interest there. We've been responding to multiple RFPs, RFIs. We're working on proof of concepts right now and we're partnering with a number of different SIs as we bring the services to market. And so there are different business models depending on the customer, depending on the geography. And a good thing about these private networks that we're working on is they're not constrained by the geography of building a macro network. So we're able to serve customers in different geographies within that environment. 
And then the other thing, which is also important to highlight, it's across all verticals. There isn't a specific vertical that has an interest in this. We're seeing interest across every vertical and every industrial segment. And we're very well positioned to take the architecture that we're deploying, being cloud native, but also the open architecture, the ability to do slicing, it is distinctively unique compared to what the other operators have in the market today. And so not just to say that they can't get there in the future, clearly have an advantage today that we're taking advantage of. 
I think it's also important that, to add that even in the DISH business today, we do a great business in serving hospitality. And so we're able to partner with the systems integrators we have within that business to augment what we're doing on the video side.

And which ones in particular, you envision being regional rather than national sales, because I think a lot depends, I guess, on whether companies are interested in buying services that are really on a much more localized or regional basis wirelessly than they are today."

But there are clearly national enterprise areas where we wouldn't be competitive today, but there's -- but even within national companies, there's much -- there's very much of it that's localized.

But there are clearly national enterprise areas where we wouldn't be competitive today, but there's -- but even within national companies, there's much -- there's very much of it that's localized. So you can imagine the hospitality industry, where that -- your hospitality is still localized, but in the hospitality industry, you're going to differentiate yourself from your customer service because that's the hospitality industry and you want to -- you're going do that in a market-by-market basis. You can imagine things like mining, right, that aren't -- that need private networks and they probably have to get built, because they're probably not in anybody's footprint today on the other extreme. So there's just a lot of different areas there. 
And I would contend Craig, that the profitability on a per bit, on a per dollar of CapEx and the per gig basis is going to be much higher in the enterprise business and global consumer business. But the consumer business is quite competitive. And with 3 big players and us entering the marketplace, so -- and with -- so it's quite competitive. Enterprise business, each company is going to have different needs. In some cases, we won't be able to fulfill those needs. One of the other 3 carriers will be able to do it. But in many cases, we're the only guys that can really, in the foreseeable future, fit their needs. And that's going to be a good business for us. And those are long-term contracts. They are a long-term sales process. 
So from a revenue perspective, you're not looking for that to be a big revenue item next year. But peripherally, we just know by the interest that there's never a conversation with the company at high levels where they don't want what we're building, I guess, is how I'd say it. We may not be the right company for them. It may be one of our competitors that's better suited, but they want where things are going. And you just can't get there with legacy networks, because you have to automate. And to automate, you have to be in the cloud, and we're going to be there. And then O-RAN, nobody wants to build last century's network. They want to build the 21st century network, and that's what we're building. And so that's where people are going to spend their money from an enterprise perspective, we're going to want to go."

And they wanted to wholesale from our network because they had an enterprise customer and we had, maybe some architecture that helped them get there, that's an interesting conversation to have, because we both would win. 
And again, I said it for 2 years now, we're interested in working with those companies, but we -- how we define a partner, working with companies who want to help our company get better, and we're going to -- in return, they should expect that we're going to help their company get better. And that's not always the way business works, right? So some companies, it's a zero-sum game, where I win and only if I win and you lose, am I going to do a deal. And I understand that. I fought 30 years ago, that probably sounded like me. But I'm kinder and gentler now, as people around me know. At least I'm more experienced and more mature. Let's put it that way. 
And I think -- I just think that, particularly in capital-intensive industries, I think that where people can -- where people decide that they could take the approach where -- more partnership approach, and I think that's a competitive -- potentially competitive advantage.

So we're still going to bargain in good faith and hope that, disappointed that they seem to come to the conclusion as channels are coming down at this point. But the good news for our customers are -- they have other ways to get their channels. First of all, they watch them less, the network less, and they have other ways to get those networks, but they didn't -- they haven't had all those ways in the past. And -- but we're empathetic to Sinclair because they are having to compete against their own content providers. And we've had a long-term relationship with Sinclair, and it's been good. And we've been able to work through the issues at least as tough as this one over the years. 
The regional sports question that realized that Sinclair didn't own the regional sports networks, when those networks came up for renewal by the time Sinclair [ Allnet ] was able to negotiate in the part -- our customers that wanted regional sports had left. And so there was no way that, in fairness to our customers, we can tax them in a basic package and tax customers who -- almost nobody that was left, who wanted regional sports was left on our network. They've gone to somewhere else to get them. So I think there's innovative ways to reinvigorate the regional sports networks. Sinclair themselves have talked about it in a direct-to-consumer product. 
So I think there's other ways to do that. And we'll continue to work with Sinclair to the extent that they want to try to work with us in a win-win situation. But if not, they'll -- I don't -- I'm not going to speak to all the legalities and regulations, Sinclair is pretty savvy about those things. And so they'll work their way through that.

And as you know, Rich, I mean, there's other ways to get to get the networks, right? Whether -- I mean, we've obviously helped our customers with either offer antennas or new technologies like locast or technologies like CBS All Access, which is now Paramount or Peacock, right? So it just -- it kind of depends on the customers' viewership habits and some of those are changing."

I think that all of this in the connectivity business are going to have to look and see what the subsidy of the government infrastructure, where the government wants to go and whether your particular company or whether -- strategically fit into that and whether that's a good business for you. 
So obviously, we continue to really look at that.

And that strategy's been -- they're working well for us. And so as the opportunity presents itself as broadband continues to densify, obviously, Sling can be an opportunity for those customers that want to cut the cord there and maybe have a couple SVOD services along with a service like Sling, which can be very complementary to obviously, Netflix or Peacock, et cetera. 
On the Sling side, there's a couple of things we've been talking about over the past few quarters. One is, there is a touch of seasonality, obviously, to the OTG business. It is a low barrier of entry and it's easy to cancel. But with that said, we also put the onus on ourselves to create a better customer experience. And in Q2, you've seen us deploy now kind of some new technology and a new app to most of the Amazon base and about half the Roku base now. So you're seeing us provide a better customer experience. We're seeing obviously better in the key metrics that you would follow, associated with kind of customer engagement, we're seeing those all improve. And so we're optimistic heading into football about our ability to deliver a better customer experience. And then obviously, you had a couple of tune in events like either Euro 2020 or NBA, which obviously helps on the Sling numbers in Q2, so."

And as you would expect, it's going to continue to ramp over the course of the first quarter and probably reach kind of a steady state until we finish the 70% in 2023 over the course of the 4 quarters of 2022. So Q1 will ramp up some more and then we'll flatten out just because from a build perspective, we've tried to level below to the fullest extent we can, only because it's really hard to build. We don't want the sawtooth effect because it's difficult for the GCs. It's just difficult to manage. 
So we're on a ramp. I'll give you some color, we had last week, almost 300 construction starts, and that number will continue to grow as we move into the into the first quarter, and then we'll stabilize that midway through the first quarter and then we'll run throughout the balance of 2022 -- or 2022 at that level."

And I know a lot of analysts kind of look at us as its retail handset, but we'll get our fair share of that business. And that will be a very profitable business for us. But obviously, the network and the amount of spectrum that we have from a wholesale perspective, we're willing to wholesale some of that spectrum. 
And particularly on the enterprise side, where that's kind of a jump ball. In other words, I think all the carriers are going to do well in enterprise. It's a new market segment. It's a market segment that can rival the kind of demand you see for consumers, because on the enterprise side, when they can have their own private networks, so to speak, the slice of the network, they can -- they're going to be able to build their products safer, cheaper, better and gain on the competition. So it's going to be a big market. We're well positioned for that because our opinion is that you need to be cloud-based and you need to be automated to do it to slice your network. So we're going to have an advantage there. But the incumbents have an advantage of incumbency and brand recognition and that kind of stuff. So I think everybody is going to do pretty well. But I feel like that's a place where we can get more market share than we will in the handset business.

I'll take the first part of that CDMA and stuff and Stephen maybe take the business side of the question. The CDMA shutoff obviously, we have -- since it's now extended to March 31, we'll still have well over remaining customers on the CDMA network. And if T-Mobile has their way, those customers will lose service on April -- on March 31. And in fact, they won't even -- based on T-Mobile's testimony in California, they won't even be -- many won't be able to make 911 calls. 
So we look at it a little bit different to T-Mobile. We look at it for consumer first and say why in the world do you want to disenfranchise the customers. We realize we're a for-profit company. We realized that T-Mobile is a for-profit company. But we play the long game, and we want to make sure that we're taking care of consumers. And there's not -- despite our best efforts and aggressive efforts, we know that we're not going to -- that too many people will be disenfranchised. And these are more economically-challenged customers for the most part, which is why we're not able to convert them. And it just seems like the wrong thing to do. And I get that -- and despite -- and there's other headwinds such as supply chain and [indiscernible] having enough units to do it. 
I would have preferred to work with T-Mobile, and we're there for them. They want to work with us and work together so that we can make sure we have enough units for customers, and we -- better ways to work together to convert the customers. We want -- we would love to see -- we're not against the CDMA shutdown. We believe technology needs to advance, but you have to do it, you can't do in the back of customers. And so that's something they'll have to live with their whole life. They're going to have to live to the fact that they're anti-consumer, to the extent of profits and that's something that we're going to live with, and we've taken the other approach. And we spent a lot of money, some headwinds in this quarter that you see. We spend a lot of money to upgrade people for the false deadline of January 1, and now we've got maybe another false deadline there. So we'll continue to go as fast as we can. 
But it's disappointing. I'm disappointed in T-Mobile and I wish taking a little bit longer-term approach to it, maybe a little bit higher end consumer approach to it. But we're here to work with them to make sure the consumers aren't disenfranchised. With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen."

It's obviously very strategic, and we are working with them on enterprise opportunities. I won't comment sort of how the split works in terms of how we do that. Each deal is generally a custom deal, as you would expect, depending on the enterprise requirements. 
The other point to probably highlight is the arrangement with AWS is nonexclusive. So we do have customers that have different requirements with -- and different partnerships with other cloud providers as well. And so we'll work with them and complement that solution. We also work with multiple systems integrators and we partner on different opportunities across different verticals based on kind of the solution that those customers are looking for. And I guess my earlier comment about the degrees of freedom we have and the platform that we have allows us to be able to integrate that in different ways depending on what the customer requirement is. 
So -- and just as an example, in some opportunities we are partnering with our sister company, EchoStar and Hughes on certain opportunities that they're in segments that are complement of what we're doing on the terrestrial side as well. So it's a good partnership with AWS. They're a very important partner, both in our network build as well as in the enterprise opportunities that we're exploring, but we are also working with many other SIs as we pursue this market opportunity as well."

When you look at it from a big picture perspective, and this is -- it's hard to model now because we're certainly in the infancy of this. But we do -- the way we look at it from a network perspective, where do we get the highest profitability per bit, right? And we don't -- for the enterprise customers, you don't have some of the customer service to consumers, you don't have the retail stores, you have a lot of cost you bring out of that. And because those bits are so valuable in terms of them being able to make their products better, we think that the enterprise business has more profitability probably, and that's our guess. That has a lot more profitability than kind of a very competitive retail wireless business, where everybody is selling the same thing.
We're the best 5G, we're the fastest 5G. We can differentiate a lot more on the enterprise business, where we can say we're in the cloud -- I don't think a business survives the next decade, if you don't -- if you're not if you don't have automation, you don't have -- you're not using the artificial intelligence and you're not cloud-based. I just don't think you should. There would be rare exception, some old school industries maybe do, but you're just not going to survive. And we're on the leading edge of that. And so we think that we move people there in a way that -- or help move them there in a way with our partners, in a way that they couldn't otherwise get there with the other carriers."

And absent NFL, I don't know if they have a show in the top 100 that gets there, right? So maybe the Oscars or something, I don't know. But there's not much there based on what we see. 
So viewership, we've seen viewership decline 15 years in a row on the networks and retrans go up by 1,000%. That's not sustainable, but we look at it for math. And we know we'll lose customers, so we know we'll lose TEGNA customers. They're not up and we are losing some customers, but not as dramatic as it might have been in the past. And once you do football season and once people find a way to get football next year, that's going to be a permanent loss of viewers for TEGNA. And of course, people also can get it from the networks. They can get Peacock from NBC directly. And maybe TEGNA gets revenue from that, maybe they get more revenue than they do from us, and maybe that makes sense for them. But we look at it economically. 
Sinclair is bigger than TEGNA, and we've had a long-term relationship there. And that -- there's more conversation around that, than there is, and they're bigger and would probably have a little bit more clout and scale in the marketplace. But I said it last time, I think the moves in retrans are down, not up. And I don't know what that does to valuations, but I saw Gray publicly said 50% of their revenues are retrans.

What we're doing hasn't changed a bit as a consequence of the AT&T roaming deal. And when I think about what we're building, it's really the metropolitan areas in any of the given markets. I mean, we've built -- we designed the footprint sufficiently large to minimize the handovers to other networks. So we put -- the networks were built such that the handover back to T-Mobile would be on an interstate outside of town. So that would imply that all of the key suburban areas in all of the geographies will be covered. 
If I think about -- your question was, can you help dimension the 20% and the 70%, and I'd say that with respect to the 70%, that encompasses all of the major metropolitan areas across the country. And if you think about cities of over 0.5 million, they're going to be -- in the Continental U.S., if it's over 0.5 million POPs, it's going to be in the footprint, right? And I'd say if I roll the clock back to the 20%, it will -- similarly, it will be metropolitan areas where they're relatively easy to build. So for example, California that's intrinsically more difficult, is not high on the list in the 20% nor the Northeast, although there are some areas in the Northeast. It's primarily the middle of the country where co-location is prevalent, and we can move very quickly. So I mean, I think that's probably what we're trying to do in the 2022 time frame and we'll attack and address the more difficult areas in the 20 -- to meet the 2023 build objective."

And there is some confusion out there because our commitment number went up this quarter, right? And those commitments are really OpEx, right? So our tower leases are over, on average, 20 years or greater. We have a commitment now to AT&T, which has been publicly disclosed, $5 billion. That's all OpEx. And obviously, there's revenue associated with for sure, AT&T, there's offsetting revenue materially higher than that. So that's not in our $10 billion. That's OpEx.

We can grow that while they're building the network because it's not constrained by geography. 
And so we can actually -- and we are pursuing opportunities that aren't limited by the geographies that footing we're deploying. But as we build that footprint out, then it expands the market opportunity for us.

There isn't a single application that one could point to and say that, that dictates sort of the enterprise opportunity for us. It really depends on the vertical. And really, I would say that if there's a common theme that runs across each of the verticals. It's really about how do they drive their operating efficiency as a business using the technology to facilitate that. And so depending on what vertical it is depending on what solutions they're trying to deploy, what systems they have in place, it drives different requirements. 
There are requirements and some opportunities for very low latency, depending on what they're doing in terms of their control systems and there are others that don't have that same criteria. So each one of these -- and I guess my earlier comment about degrees of freedom you have to have the degrees of freedom within the platform and the architecture to support those different solutions based on what that enterprise need is. So there's no silver bullet, and one application isn't going to win the opportunity here. It's the ability to put it all together on a common platform."

And so we have been focused really kind of on acquisition and retention of profitable customers in rural America. There's no doubt, I think COVID had a unique inflection point where you're seeing a bit less switching. Some of that is obviously impacting our acquisition, and we're managing our spend on acquisition based on the kind of response rates we're seeing. And so it's benefiting obviously subscribers on the retention side. 
But I'll tell you, our strategy of really over the past several years focusing in on attracting and retaining the right customer is starting to pay dividends, and we're starting to pay dividends before COVID. So when that changes, look, there's just a lot of variables, right? You still got COVID, you've got some of our strongest and longest term partners now competing on the D2C side. Obviously, there's a piece of -- a lot of the customers that we reach are in rural America. And as broadband densifies, obviously, customers will have more choice. And so there's just -- there's a lot of variables to try to forecast what's going to happen. But we're so focused in on profitability, providing customers a great customer experience.

So we're working as a team and management to those issues. And Dave and his team have managed through the deployment issues, and we're still on track. We're not -- yes, we -- the FCC in our agreement, you do have supply chain issues as a reason, you could be late, but that has to be a real reason. I mean you wouldn't make that up. And so we're just going to get there. That's just the way we're going to do it. 
On the handset, there's 2 other areas. Labor is an issue that our teams having to work extraordinarily hard because people are -- there's not enough supply of labor out there today. And the handset issue is probably the biggest because we had headwinds in this January 1 shutoff for CDMA. So we had to take handsets and give it to existing customers that would have been a new customer. And so absent supply chain issues on the handset side, where we're getting a fraction of what we've ordered, we would have been -- we would have a growth that we had a lot more growth there. So -- and we don't have the scale that the incumbents have with the vendors. So I don't know that we get our fair share of handsets. And so we worked extraordinarily hard to make sure that we're on the radar -- people's radar screen and our customers aren't -- primarily aren't buying the $1,000 phones. They're more economically challenged. But as we get into postpaid and as we get into owner economics, that changes for us in a very positive way. 
John, you talk about -- if we really have -- retail is important because it's a really positive story for us. And maybe, John, can you talk about in a second?"

We're definitely ramping up our team across retail, national retail and digital, to take the business to growth. We're taking a segmented approach to the different opportunities we see. And access to handsets is a key thing going forward. 
And as Charlie said, we're definitely focused there. And we would anticipate seeing these situations clean up for us some time late next year. We we're not quite sure about Q1, Q2 yet, but we're focused on supply and also making sure that the devices that we do have go towards the most profitable activities. And we talked about it earlier with respect to CDMA, we see there being over 1 million customers still on the CDMA network if the network were to shut off on March 31. So additional handsets is something that we're definitely focused on. And we'd love to be able to partner with T-Mobile on that, as Charlie alluded to earlier.

So -- and obviously, the -- I think we're doing -- I think we should have been a little faster on rollout in Las Vegas. I mean, I think that's fair. But I think other than that, most everything else we're doing is we're doing probably better than we anticipated on. 
And we're not -- we're not exactly understood by the industry that much. And part of it is because we don't spend a lot of time going through really what we're doing, and we spend a little bit more time on just -- it's a complicated story, and it's a little bit easier for us just to do it and then show people as opposed to try to explain it. And just a simple example is we're about more than just a handset business, yet the people who follow us and stuff are -- and we're basically a cloud IT network that we're building, and it's a little bit different thought process on what that looks like than traditional networks. And so we have to do a better job of explaining our story and we have to execute in our markets between now and June of 2022. So I think that's the stuff we'll focus on. 
And the marketplace, they don't always get it right in the short term, and they don't get it right in the long term. And we're 1 of the few companies that has the ability to be able to think long term. The market, if we had thought short term, we would -- we'll try to get DBS up 5 years ago because that's what people wanted us to do. And so I think we know where it's going. We know how the power of this network, we know how special this network is going to be, and we know the opportunity. So it's on us to execute and then give people the road map to see why their investment in DISH is a smart investment. 
And we have certainly work to do there. But we're focused on making sure we get our network up and operate, and then we'll talk about it. And there'll be a little bit in AWS. I think there'll be a little bit in Las Vegas and AWS to reinvent stuff. I think people will start to see it there and start to understand a little bit better because those are the people that actually -- the developers and the people in the cloud, they think they'll have a better feel for it. I mean, last year, this time, people didn't -- say we weren't going to build the network. Now I think it shifted to, okay, we get it to -- I think most people believe we're building the network, now can you make it -- can you stand through your $10 billion long term and can you make it profitable.

How are the pieces of the network working together? And what's the game plan when we do get to market?  
And I guess the second question would be, I just noticed in your filing today, the work in progress CapEx is now about $820 million. That's up $400 million sequentially for about a $1.6 billion annualized run rate, up from about $250 million of CapEx year-to-date in the wireless business. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on where that's going? Is that run rate going to persist? And anything you can tell us about what's happening in wireless would be great."

We've got friendly users, working fantastic -- helping us test the network. We were a little delayed as a consequence of frankly, the Vegas network was -- I think about it as a preproduction environment or a development environment until fairly recently. Just getting in the -- and a little more color is just getting the radio software and the core network software to work well together and be reliable.
We're still working through T-Mobile roaming and specifically handover issues. So Vegas is, I'd say, coming along, we're in the beta test mode and we'll progress that over the course of the next 90 days and look forward to launching Vegas sometime in the first quarter of 2022. 
As it relates more broadly to the development process, we're making great strides and great progress around the leasing and permitting activities associated with the 70% milestone for 2023. And as it relates to the 20% threshold or POP requirement for 2022, as you probably saw, we've -- in the Q, we started 35 markets when we filed or when we -- at the end of the quarter, we're now up to 42 markets that have construction activity. 
And as it relates to the sites that are required to meet the '22 obligation, we have building permits on 2/3 of them, which I feel really good about that. We're months away from the deadline and we've got building permits on 2/3, we started construction on well over 30% of the sites required for 2022. The build's very focused. I mean we're really just building in markets that we plan to launch in 2022, and we'll start the build activity on markets for 2023 in the new year."

So Q1 will ramp up some more and then we'll flatten out just because from a build perspective, we've tried to level below to the fullest extent we can, only because it's really hard to build. We don't want the sawtooth effect because it's difficult for the GCs. It's just difficult to manage. So we're on a ramp. 
I'll give you some color, we had, last week, almost 300 construction starts, and that number will continue to grow as we move into the first quarter, and then we'll stabilize that midway through the first quarter and then we'll run throughout the balance of 2022 -- or 2022 at that level."

But obviously, the network and the amount of spectrum that we have from a wholesale perspective, we're willing to wholesale some of that spectrum.  
And particularly on the enterprise side, where that's kind of a jump ball. In other words, I think all the carriers are going to do well in enterprise. It's a new market segment. It's a market segment that can rival the kind of demand you see for consumers, because on the enterprise side, when they can have their own private networks, so to speak, a slice of the network, they can -- they're going to be able to build their products safer, cheaper, better and gain on the competition. 
So it's going to be a big market. We're well positioned for that because our opinion is that you need to be cloud-based and you need to be automated to do it, to slice your network. So we're going to have an advantage there. But the incumbents have an advantage of incumbency and brand recognition and that kind of stuff. So I think everybody is going to do pretty well. But I feel like that's a place where we can get more market share than we will in the handset business.

I'll take the first part of that CDMA and stuff and Stephen, maybe, take the business side of the question. The CDMA shutoff, obviously, we have -- since it's now extended to March 31, we'll still have well over remaining customers on the CDMA network. And if T-Mobile has their way, those customers will lose service on April -- on March 31. And in fact, they won't even -- based on T-Mobile's testimony in California, they won't even be -- many won't be able to make 911 calls.
So we look at it a little bit different to T-Mobile. We look at it for consumer first and say why in the world do you want to disenfranchise the customers? We realize we're a for-profit company. We realized that T-Mobile is a for-profit company. But we play the long game, and we want to make sure that we're taking care of consumers. And there's not -- despite our best efforts and aggressive efforts, we know that we're not going to -- that too many people will be disenfranchised. 
And these are more economically-challenged customers for the most part, which is why we're not able to convert them. And it just seems like the wrong thing to do. And I get that -- and despite -- and there's other headwinds such as supply chain and having enough units to do it.  
I would have preferred to work with T-Mobile, and we're there for them. They want to work with us and work together so that we can make sure we have enough units for customers, and we -- a better ways to work together to convert the customers. We want -- we would love to see -- we're not against the CDMA shutdown. We believe technology needs to advance, but you have to do it, you can't do in the back of customers. 
And so that's something they'll have to live with their whole life. They're going to have to live with the fact that they're anti-consumer, to the extent of profits and that's something that they're going to live with, and we've taken the other approach. And we spent a lot of money, some headwinds in this quarter that you see. We spent a lot of money to upgrade people for the false deadline of January 1, and now we've got maybe another false deadline there. 
So we'll continue to go as fast as we can. But it's disappointing. I'm disappointed in T-Mobile and I wish they had taken a little bit longer-term approach to it, maybe a little bit higher end consumer approach to it. But we're here to work with them to make sure the consumers aren't disenfranchised.

It's obviously very strategic, and we are working with them on enterprise opportunities. I won't comment sort of how the split works in terms of how we do that. Each deal is generally a custom deal, as you would expect, depending on the enterprise requirements.  
The other point to probably highlight is the arrangement with AWS is nonexclusive. So we do have customers that have different requirements with -- and different partnerships with other cloud providers as well. And so we'll work with them and complement that solution. We also work with multiple systems integrators and we partner on different opportunities across different verticals based on kind of the solution that those customers are looking for.
And I guess my earlier comment about the degrees of freedom we have and the platform that we have allows us to be able to integrate that in different ways depending on what the customer requirement is.  
So -- and just as an example, in some opportunities we are partnering with our sister company, EchoStar and Hughes on certain opportunities that they're in segments that are complement of what we're doing on the terrestrial side as well. So it's a good partnership with AWS. They're a very important partner, both in our network build as well as in the enterprise opportunities that we're exploring, but we are also working with many other SIs as we pursue this market opportunity as well."

When you look at it from a big picture perspective, and this is -- it's hard to model now because we're certainly in the infancy of this.

And because those bits are so valuable in terms of them being able to make their products better, we think that the enterprise business has more profitability, probably, that's our guess. That has a lot more profitability than kind of a very competitive retail wireless business, where everybody is selling the same thing.
We're the best 5G, we're the fastest 5G. We can differentiate a lot more on the enterprise business, where we can say we're in the cloud -- I don't think the business survives the next decade. If you don't -- if you're not -- if you don't have automation, then you don't have -- you're not using the artificial intelligence and you're not cloud-based. I just don't think you should. But rare exception, some old school industries maybe do, but you're just not going to survive.

And absent NFL, I don't know if they have to show in the top 100 that gets there, right? So maybe the Oscars or something, I don't know. But there's not much there based on what we see.  
So viewership, we've seen viewership decline 15 years in a row on the networks and retrans go up by 1,000%. That's not sustainable, but we look at it for math. And we know we'll lose customers, so we know we'll lose TEGNA customers. They're not up and we are losing some customers, but not as dramatic as it might have been in the past. 
And once you do football season and once people find a way to get football next year, that's going to be a permanent loss of viewers for TEGNA. And of course, people also can go get it from the networks. They can get Peacock from NBC directly. And maybe TEGNA gets revenue from that, maybe they get more revenue than they do from us, and maybe that makes sense for them. But we look at it economically.  
Sinclair is bigger than TEGNA, and we've had a long-term relationship there. And that -- there's more conversation around that, than there is, and they're bigger and would probably have a little bit more clout and scale in the marketplace. But I said it last time, I think the moves in retrans are down, not up. And I don't know what that does to valuations, but I saw Gray publicly said 50% of their revenues are retrans.

What we're doing hasn't changed a bit as a consequence of the AT&T roaming deal. And when I think about what we're building, it's really the metropolitan areas in any of the given markets. I mean, we've built -- we designed the footprint sufficiently large to minimize the handovers to other networks. So we put -- the networks were built such that the handover back to T-Mobile would be on an interstate outside of town. So that would imply that all of the key suburban areas in all of the geographies will be covered. 
If I think about -- your question was, can you help dimension the 20% and the 70%? And I'd say that with respect to the 70%, that encompasses all of the major metropolitan areas across the country. And if you think about cities over 0.5 million, they're going to be -- in the Continental U.S., if it's over 0.5 million POPs, it's going to be in the footprint, right? And I'd say if I roll the clock back to the 20%, it will -- similarly, it will be metropolitan areas where they're relatively easy to build. 
So for example, California that's intrinsically more difficult, is not high on the list in the 20% nor is the Northeast, although there are some areas in the Northeast. It's primarily the middle of the country where co-location is prevalent, and we can move very quickly. So I mean, I think that's probably what we're trying to do in the 2022 time frame and we'll attack and address the more difficult areas in the 20 -- to meet the 2023 build objective."

And really, I would say that if there's a common theme that runs across each of the verticals. It's really about how do they drive their operating efficiency as a business using the technology to facilitate that. And so depending on what vertical it is depending on what solutions they're trying to deploy, what systems they have in place, it drives different requirements. 
There are requirements and some opportunities for very low latency, depending on what they're doing in terms of their control systems and there are others that don't have that same criteria. So each one of these -- and I guess my earlier comment about degrees of freedom you have to have the degrees of freedom within the platform and the architecture to support those different solutions based on what that enterprise need is. 
So there's no silver bullet, and one application isn't going to win the opportunity here. It's the ability to put it all together on a common platform."

And so we have been focused really kind of on acquisition and retention of profitable customers in rural America. There's no doubt, I think COVID had a unique inflection point where you're seeing a bit less switching. Some of that is obviously impacting our acquisition, and we're managing our spend on acquisition based on the kind of response rates we're seeing. And so it's benefiting obviously subscribers on the retention side. 
But I'll tell you, our strategy of really over the past several years focusing in on attracting and retaining the right customer is starting to pay dividends, and was starting to pay dividends before COVID. So when that changes, look, there's just a lot of variables, right? You still got COVID, you've got some of our strongest and longest term partners now competing on the D2C side. 
Obviously, there's a piece of -- a lot of the customers that we reach are in rural America. And as broadband densifies, obviously, customers will have more choice. And so there's just -- there's a lot of variables to try to forecast what's going to happen. But we're so focused in on profitability, providing customers a great customer experience.

So we're working as a team and managing to those issues. And Dave and his team have managed through the deployment issues, and we're still on track. We're not -- yes, we -- the FCC, in our agreement, you do have supply chain issues as a reason you could be late, but there has to be a real reason. I mean you wouldn't make that up. And so we're just going to get there. That's just the way we're going to do it. 
On the handset, there's 2 other areas. Labor is an issue that our teams having to work extraordinarily hard because people are -- there's not enough supply of labor out there today. And the handset issue is probably the biggest because we had headwinds in this January 1 shutoff for CDMA. So we had to take handsets and give it to existing customers that would have been a new customer. 
And so absent supply chain issues on the handset side, where we're getting a fraction of what we've ordered, we would have been -- we would have had growth -- we had a lot more growth there. So -- and we don't have the scale that the incumbents have with the vendors. So I don't know that we get our fair share of handsets. And so we worked extraordinarily hard to make sure that we're on the radar -- people's radar screen and our customers aren't -- primarily aren't buying the $1,000 phones. They're more economically challenged. But as we get into postpaid and as we get into owner economics, that changes for us in a very positive way.

We're definitely ramping up our team across retail, national retail and digital, to take the business to growth. We're taking a segmented approach to the different opportunities we see. And access to handsets is a key thing going forward. 
And as Charlie said, we're definitely focused there. And we would anticipate seeing these situations clean up for us sometime late next year. We we're not quite sure about Q1, Q2 yet, but we're focused on supply and also making sure that the devices that we do have go towards the most profitable activities. And we talked about it earlier with respect to the CDMA, we see there being over 1 million customers still on the CDMA network if the network were to shut off on March 31. 
So additional handsets is something that we're definitely focused on. And we'd love to be able to partner with T-Mobile on that as Charlie alluded to earlier. And it's a daily focus here to make sure that we can keep our partners supplied and move the business forward."

So -- and obviously, the -- I think we're doing -- I think we should have been a little faster on rollout in Las Vegas. I mean, I think that's fair. But I think other than that, most everything else we're doing is we're doing probably better than we anticipated on. 
And we're not -- we're not exactly understood by the industry that much. And part of it is because we don't spend a lot of time going through strategically what we're doing, and we spend a little bit more time on just -- it's a complicated story, and it's a little bit easier for us just to do it and then show people as opposed to try to explain it. 
And just a simple example is we're about more than just a handset business, yet the people who follow us and stuff are -- and we're basically a cloud IT network that we're building, and it's a little bit different thought process on what that looks like than traditional networks. And so we have to do a better job of explaining our story and we have to execute in our markets between now and June of 2022. So I think that's the stuff we'll focus on. 
And the marketplace, they don't always get it right in the short term, and don't get it right in the long term. And we're one of the few companies that has the ability to be able to think long term. The market, if we had thought short term, we would -- we'd try to get DBS up 5 years ago because that's what people wanted us to do. 
And so I think we know where it's going. We know how -- the power of this network, we know how special this network is going to be, and we know the opportunity. So it's on us to execute and then give people the road map to see why their investment in DISH is a smart investment. 
And we have certainly work to do there. But we're focused on making sure we get our network up and operating and then we'll talk about it. And there'll be a little bit in AWS. I think there'll be a little bit in Las Vegas and AWS to reinvent stuff. I think people will start to see it there and start to understand a little bit better because those are the people that actually -- the developers and the people in the cloud, they'll have a better feel for it. 
I mean, last year, this time, people didn't -- say we weren't going to build the network. Now I think it shifted to, okay, we get it to -- I think most people believe we're building the network, now can you make it -- can you stand through your $10 billion long term and can you make it profitable.

And I guess the second question would be, I just noticed in your filing today, the work in progress CapEx is now about $820 million. That's up $400 million sequentially for about a $1.6 billion annualized run rate, up from about $250 million of CapEx year-to-date in the wireless business.

We've got friendly users, working -- and test -- helping us test the network. We were a little delayed as a consequence of -- frankly, the Vegas network was -- I think about it as a preproduction environment or a development environment until fairly recently. Just getting in the -- and a little more color is just getting the radio software and the core network software to work well together and be reliable. 
We're still working through T-Mobile roaming and specifically handover issues. So Vegas is, I'd say, coming along. We're in the beta test mode and we'll progress that over the course of the next 90 days and look forward to launching Vegas some time in the first quarter of 2022. 
As it relates more broadly to the development process, we're making great strides and great progress around the leasing and permitting activities associated with the 70% milestone for 2023. And as it relates to the 20% threshold or POP requirement for 2022, as you probably saw, we've -- in the Q, we started 35 markets when we filed or when we -- at the end of the quarter. We're now up to 42 markets that have construction activity. 
And as it relates to the sites that are required to meet the '22 obligation, we have building permits on 2/3 of them, which I feel really good about that. And we're months away from the deadline and we've got building permits on 2/3. We started construction on well over 30% of the sites required for 2022. The build's very focused. I mean we're really just building in markets that we plan to launch in 2022, and we'll start the build activity on markets for 2023 in the new year."

So Q1 will ramp up some more and then will flatten out just because from a build perspective, we've tried to level below to the fullest extent we can, only because it's really hard to build. We don't want the sawtooth effect because it's difficult for the GCs. It's just difficult to manage. So we're on a ramp. 
I'll give you some color. We had last week almost 300 construction starts, and that number will continue to grow as we move into the first quarter, and then we'll stabilize that midway through the first quarter and then we'll run throughout the balance of 2022 -- or 2022 at that level."

And I know a lot of analysts kind of look at us as this retail handset, but we'll get our fair share of that business. And that will be a very profitable business for us. But obviously, the network and the amount of spectrum that we have from a wholesale perspective, we're willing to wholesale some of that spectrum.  
And particularly on the enterprise side, where that's kind of a jump ball. In other words, I think all the carriers are going to do well in enterprise. It's a new market segment. It's a market segment that can rival the kind of demand you see for consumers, because on the enterprise side, when they can have their own private networks, so to speak, a slice of the network, they can -- they're going to be able to build their products safer, cheaper, better and gain on the competition. So it's going to be a big market. 
We're well positioned for that because our opinion is that you need to be cloud-based and you need to be automated to do it, to slice your network. So we're going to have an advantage there. But the incumbents have an advantage of incumbency and brand recognition and that kind of stuff. So I think everybody is going to do pretty well. But I feel like that's a place where we can get more market share than we will in the handset business.

And then more interestingly, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense, Charlie, of how the market splits or maybe this is a question for Stephen, between you -- the enterprise market split between you and the cloud service providers? You're obviously going to market with the likes of Amazon, AWS as partners. How does the enterprises spend on communication services get split between you and them in those kind of deals?"

I'll take the first part of that CDMA and stuff and Stephen, maybe, take the business side of the question. The CDMA shutoff, obviously, we have -- since it's now extended to March 31, we still have well over remaining customers on the CDMA network. And if T-Mobile has their way, those customers will lose service on April -- on March 31. And in fact, they won't even -- based on T-Mobile's testimony in California, they won't even be -- many won't be able to make 911 calls.
So we look at it a little bit different to T-Mobile. We look at it for consumer first and say why in the world do you want to disenfranchise customers? We realize we're a for-profit company. We realize that T-Mobile is a for-profit company. But we play the long game, and we want to make sure that we're taking care of consumers. And there's not -- despite our best efforts and aggressive efforts, we know that we're not going to -- that too many people will be disenfranchised. And these are more economically challenged customers for the most part, which is why we're not able to convert them. And it just seems like the wrong thing to do. And I get that -- and despite -- and there's other headwinds such as supply chain and having enough units to do it.  
I would have preferred to work with T-Mobile, and we're there for them. They want to work with us and work together so that we can make sure we have enough units for customers, and we -- better ways to work together to convert the customers. We want -- we would love to see -- we're not against the CDMA shutdown. We believe technology needs to advance, but you have to do it -- you can't do in the back of customers. 
And so that's something they'll have to live with their whole life. They're going to have to live with the fact that they're anti-consumer, to the extent of profits and that's something that they're going to live with, and we've taken the other approach. And we spent a lot of money, some headwinds in this quarter that you see. We spent a lot of money to upgrade people for the false deadline of January 1, and now we've got maybe another false deadline there. 
So we'll continue to go as fast as we can. But it's disappointing. I'm disappointed in T-Mobile and I wish they had taken a little bit longer-term approach to it, maybe a little bit higher end consumer approach to it. But we're here to work with them to make sure the consumers aren't disenfranchised. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen."

So just on the question as it relates to AWS, we do have a very good partnership with AWS. It's obviously very strategic, and we are working with them on enterprise opportunities. I won't comment sort of how the split works in terms of how we do that",257,"Yes. So just on the question as it relates to AWS, we do have a very good partnership with AWS. It's obviously very strategic, and we are working with them on enterprise opportunities. I won't comment sort of how the split works in terms of how we do that. Each deal is generally a custom deal, as you would expect, depending on the enterprise requirements.  
The other point to probably highlight is the arrangement with AWS is nonexclusive. So we do have customers that have different requirements with -- and different partnerships with other cloud providers as well. And so we'll work with them and complement that solution. We also work with multiple systems integrators and we partner on different opportunities across different verticals based on kind of the solution that those customers are looking for.
And I guess my earlier comment about the degrees of freedom we have and the platform that we have allows us to be able to integrate that in different ways depending on what the customer requirement is.  
So -- and just as an example, in some opportunities we are partnering with our sister company, EchoStar and Hughes on certain opportunities that they're in segments that are complement of what we're doing on the terrestrial side as well. So it's a good partnership with AWS. They're a very important partner, both in our network build as well as in the enterprise opportunities that we're exploring, but we are also working with many other SIs as we pursue this market opportunity as well."

When you look at it from a big picture perspective, and this is -- it's hard to model now because we're certainly in the infancy of this. But we do -- the way we look at it from a network perspective, where do we get the highest profitability per bit, right? 
And we don't -- for the enterprise customers, you don't have some of the customer service to consumers, you don't have the retail stores, you have a lot of cost you bring out of that. And because those bits are so valuable in terms of them being able to make their products better, we think that the enterprise business has more profitability, probably, that's our guess. That has a lot more profitability than kind of a very competitive retail wireless business, where everybody is selling the same thing.
We're the best 5G, we're the fastest 5G. We can differentiate a lot more on the enterprise business, where we can say we're in the cloud -- I don't think the business survives the next decade if you don't -- if you're not -- if you don't have automation, then you don't have -- you're not using the artificial intelligence and you're not cloud-based. I just don't think you should. But rare exception, some old school industries maybe do, but you're just not going to survive. 
And we're on the leading edge of that. And so we think that we move people there in a way that -- or help move them there in a way with our partners, in a way that they couldn't otherwise get there with the other carriers."

And absent NFL, I don't know if they have a show in the top 100 that gets there, right? So maybe the Oscars or something, I don't know. But there's not much there based on what we see. 
So viewership, we've seen viewership decline 15 years in a row on the networks and retrans go up by 1,000%. That's not sustainable, but we look at it for math. And we know we'll lose customers, so we know we'll lose TEGNA customers. They're not up and we are losing some customers, but not as dramatic as it might have been in the past. 
And once you do football season and once people find a way to get football next year, that's going to be a permanent loss of viewers for TEGNA. And of course, people also can go get it from the networks. They can get Peacock from NBC directly. And maybe TEGNA gets revenue from that, maybe they get more revenue than they do from us, and maybe that makes sense for them. But we look at it economically.  
Sinclair is bigger than TEGNA, and we've had a long-term relationship there. And that -- there's more conversation around that than there is, and they're bigger and would probably have a little bit more clout and scale in the marketplace. But I said it last time, I think the moves in retrans are down, not up. And I don't know what that does to valuations, but I saw Gray publicly said 50% of their revenues are retrans. And I think that's going to come under pressure."

What we're doing hasn't changed a bit as a consequence of the AT&T roaming deal. And when I think about what we're building, it's really the metropolitan areas in any of the given markets. I mean we've built -- we designed the footprint sufficiently large to minimize the handovers to other networks. So we put -- the networks were built such that the handover back to T-Mobile would be on an interstate outside of town. So that would imply that all of the key suburban areas in all of the geographies will be covered. 
If I think about -- your question was, can you help dimension the 20% and the 70%? And I'd say that with respect to the 70%, that encompasses all of the major metropolitan areas across the country. And if you think about cities over 0.5 million, they're going to be -- in the Continental U.S., if it's over 0.5 million POPs, it's going to be in the footprint, right? And I'd say if I roll the clock back to the 20%, it will -- similarly, it will be metropolitan areas where they're relatively easy to build. 
So for example, California that's intrinsically more difficult, is not high on the list in the 20% nor is the Northeast, although there are some areas in the Northeast. It's primarily the middle of the country where co-location is prevalent, and we can move very quickly.

And really, I would say that if there's a common theme that runs across each of the verticals, it's really about how do they drive their operating efficiency as a business using the technology to facilitate that. And so depending on what vertical it is, depending on what solutions they're trying to deploy, what systems they have in place, it drives different requirements. 
There are requirements and some opportunities for very low latency, depending on what they're doing in terms of the control systems and there are others that don't have that same criteria. So each one of these -- and I guess my earlier comment about degrees of freedom, you have to have the degrees of freedom within the platform and the architecture to support those different solutions based on what that enterprise need is. 
So there's no silver bullet, and one application isn't going to win the opportunity here. It's the ability to put it all together on a common platform."

Some of that is obviously impacting our acquisition, and we're managing our spend on acquisition based on the kind of response rates we're seeing. And some of it's benefiting obviously subscribers on the retention side. 
But I'll tell you, our strategy of really over the past several years focusing in on attracting and retaining the right customer is starting to pay dividends, and was starting to pay dividends before COVID.

So we're working as a team and managing to those issues. And Dave and his team have managed through the deployment issues, and we're still on track. We're not -- yes, we -- the FCC, in our agreement, you do have supply chain issues as a reason you could be late, but that has to be a real reason. I mean you wouldn't make that up. And so we're just going to get there. That's just the way we're going to do it. 
On the handset, there's 2 other areas. Labor is an issue that our teams having to work extraordinarily hard because people are -- there's not enough supply of labor out there today. And the handset issue is probably the biggest because we had headwinds in this January 1 shutoff for CDMA. So we had to take handsets and give it to existing customers that would have been a new customer. 
And so absent supply chain issues on the handset side, where we're getting a fraction of what we've ordered, we would have been -- we would have had growth -- we had a lot more growth there. So -- and we don't have the scale that the incumbents have with the vendors. So I don't know that we get our fair share of handsets. And so we worked extraordinarily hard to make sure that we're on the radar -- people's radar screen. And our customers aren't -- primarily aren't buying the $1,000 phones. They're more economically challenged. But as we get into postpaid and as we get into owner economics, that changes for us in a very positive way.

We're not quite sure about Q1, Q2 yet, but we're focused on supply and also making sure that the devices that we do have go towards the most profitable activities. And we talked about it earlier. With respect to CDMA, we see there being over 1 million customers still on the CDMA network if the network were to shut off on March 31.

But I think other than that, most everything else we're doing is we're doing probably better than we anticipated on. 
And we're not exactly understood by the industry that much. And part of it is because we don't spend a lot of time going through strategically what we're doing, and we spend a little bit more time on just -- it's a complicated story, and it's a little bit easy for us just to do it and then show people as opposed to try to explain it. 
And just a simple example is we're about more than just a handset business, yet the people who follow us and stuff are -- and we're basically a cloud IT network that we're building, and it's a little bit different thought process on what that looks like than traditional networks. And so we have to do a better job of explaining our story and we have to execute in our markets between now and June of 2022. So I think that's the stuff we'll focus on. 
And the marketplace, they don't always get it right in the short term and don't get it right in the long term. And we're one of the few companies that has the ability to be able to think long term. The -- if we had thought short term, we would -- we tried to get DBS up 5 years ago because that's what people wanted us to do. 
And so I think we know where it's going. We know how -- the power of this network, we know how special this network is going to be, and we know the opportunity. So it's on us to execute and then give people the road map to see why their investment in DISH is a smart investment. 
And we have certainly work to do there. But we're focused on making sure we get our network up and operating, and then we'll talk about it. And there'll be a little bit in AWS. I think there'll be a little bit in Las Vegas and AWS to reinvent stuff. I think people will start to see it there and start to understand a little bit better because those are the people that actually -- the developers and the people in the cloud, they'll have a better feel for it.

We've got friendly users, working -- and test -- helping us test the network. We were a little delayed as a consequence of -- frankly, the Vegas network was -- I think about it as a preproduction environment or a development environment until fairly recently. Just getting in the -- and a little more color is just getting the radio software and the core network software to work well together and be reliable. 
We're still working through T-Mobile roaming and specifically handover issues. So Vegas is, I'd say, coming along. We're in the beta test mode and we'll progress that over the course of the next 90 days and look forward to launching Vegas some time in the first quarter of 2022. 
As it relates more broadly to the development process, we're making great strides and great progress around the leasing and permitting activities associated with the 70% milestone for 2023. And as it relates to the 20% threshold or POP requirement for 2022, as you probably saw, we've -- in the Q, we started 35 markets when we filed or when we -- at the end of the quarter. We're now up to 42 markets that have construction activity. 
And as it relates to the sites that are required to meet the '22 obligation, we have building permits on 2/3 of them, which I feel really good about that. And we're months away from the deadline and we've got building permits on 2/3. We started construction on well over 30% of the sites required for 2022. The build's very focused. I mean we're really just building in markets that we plan to launch in 2022, and we'll start the build activity on markets for 2023 in the new year."

So Q1 will ramp up some more and then will flatten out just because from a build perspective, we've tried to level below to the fullest extent we can, only because it's really hard to build. We don't want the sawtooth effect because it's difficult for the GCs. It's just difficult to manage. So we're on a ramp. 
I'll give you some color. We had last week almost 300 construction starts, and that number will continue to grow as we move into the first quarter, and then we'll stabilize that midway through the first quarter and then we'll run throughout the balance of 2022 -- or 2022 at that level."

And I know a lot of analysts kind of look at us as this retail handset, but we'll get our fair share of that business. And that will be a very profitable business for us. But obviously, the network and the amount of spectrum that we have from a wholesale perspective, we're willing to wholesale some of that spectrum.  
And particularly on the enterprise side, where that's kind of a jump ball. In other words, I think all the carriers are going to do well in enterprise. It's a new market segment. It's a market segment that can rival the kind of demand you see for consumers, because on the enterprise side, when they can have their own private networks, so to speak, a slice of the network, they can -- they're going to be able to build their products safer, cheaper, better and gain on the competition. So it's going to be a big market. 
We're well positioned for that because our opinion is that you need to be cloud-based and you need to be automated to do it, to slice your network. So we're going to have an advantage there. But the incumbents have an advantage of incumbency and brand recognition and that kind of stuff. So I think everybody is going to do pretty well. But I feel like that's a place where we can get more market share than we will in the handset business.

I'll take the first part of that CDMA and stuff and Stephen, maybe, take the business side of the question. The CDMA shutoff, obviously, we have -- since it's now extended to March 31, we still have well over remaining customers on the CDMA network. And if T-Mobile has their way, those customers will lose service on April -- on March 31. And in fact, they won't even -- based on T-Mobile's testimony in California, they won't even be -- many won't be able to make 911 calls.
So we look at it a little bit different to T-Mobile. We look at it for consumer first and say why in the world do you want to disenfranchise customers? We realize we're a for-profit company. We realize that T-Mobile is a for-profit company. But we play the long game, and we want to make sure that we're taking care of consumers. And there's not -- despite our best efforts and aggressive efforts, we know that we're not going to -- that too many people will be disenfranchised. And these are more economically challenged customers for the most part, which is why we're not able to convert them. And it just seems like the wrong thing to do. And I get that -- and despite -- and there's other headwinds such as supply chain and having enough units to do it.  
I would have preferred to work with T-Mobile, and we're there for them. They want to work with us and work together so that we can make sure we have enough units for customers, and we -- better ways to work together to convert the customers. We want -- we would love to see -- we're not against the CDMA shutdown. We believe technology needs to advance, but you have to do it -- you can't do in the back of customers. 
And so that's something they'll have to live with their whole life. They're going to have to live with the fact that they're anti-consumer, to the extent of profits and that's something that they're going to live with, and we've taken the other approach. And we spent a lot of money, some headwinds in this quarter that you see. We spent a lot of money to upgrade people for the false deadline of January 1, and now we've got maybe another false deadline there. 
So we'll continue to go as fast as we can. But it's disappointing. I'm disappointed in T-Mobile and I wish they had taken a little bit longer-term approach to it, maybe a little bit higher end consumer approach to it. But we're here to work with them to make sure the consumers aren't disenfranchised. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen."

So just on the question as it relates to AWS, we do have a very good partnership with AWS. It's obviously very strategic, and we are working with them on enterprise opportunities. I won't comment sort of how the split works in terms of how we do that",257,"Yes. So just on the question as it relates to AWS, we do have a very good partnership with AWS. It's obviously very strategic, and we are working with them on enterprise opportunities. I won't comment sort of how the split works in terms of how we do that. Each deal is generally a custom deal, as you would expect, depending on the enterprise requirements.  
The other point to probably highlight is the arrangement with AWS is nonexclusive. So we do have customers that have different requirements with -- and different partnerships with other cloud providers as well. And so we'll work with them and complement that solution. We also work with multiple systems integrators and we partner on different opportunities across different verticals based on kind of the solution that those customers are looking for.
And I guess my earlier comment about the degrees of freedom we have and the platform that we have allows us to be able to integrate that in different ways depending on what the customer requirement is.  
So -- and just as an example, in some opportunities we are partnering with our sister company, EchoStar and Hughes on certain opportunities that they're in segments that are complement of what we're doing on the terrestrial side as well. So it's a good partnership with AWS. They're a very important partner, both in our network build as well as in the enterprise opportunities that we're exploring, but we are also working with many other SIs as we pursue this market opportunity as well."

When you look at it from a big picture perspective, and this is -- it's hard to model now because we're certainly in the infancy of this. But we do -- the way we look at it from a network perspective, where do we get the highest profitability per bit, right? 
And we don't -- for the enterprise customers, you don't have some of the customer service to consumers, you don't have the retail stores, you have a lot of cost you bring out of that. And because those bits are so valuable in terms of them being able to make their products better, we think that the enterprise business has more profitability, probably, that's our guess. That has a lot more profitability than kind of a very competitive retail wireless business, where everybody is selling the same thing.
We're the best 5G, we're the fastest 5G. We can differentiate a lot more on the enterprise business, where we can say we're in the cloud -- I don't think the business survives the next decade if you don't -- if you're not -- if you don't have automation, then you don't have -- you're not using the artificial intelligence and you're not cloud-based. I just don't think you should. But rare exception, some old school industries maybe do, but you're just not going to survive. 
And we're on the leading edge of that. And so we think that we move people there in a way that -- or help move them there in a way with our partners, in a way that they couldn't otherwise get there with the other carriers."

And there are a number of parties that have asked about the ability to lease capacity for -- in the short term. And obviously, I haven't seen the news on C-band, but obviously that would -- if any delay in C-band, particularly for Verizon, probably, where they really spend a lot of money on it, would not be -- would be positive for T-Mobile, probably, but not positive for the other guys."

And I know you're sort of now -- you're sort of in a blackout situation with TEGNA. The Sinclair RSNs are obviously still dark. Major League Baseball and the NBA are sort of talking about doing their own over-the-top RSN service -- or sorry, streaming local sports service. 
And every media company I've just listened to over the last week, all they talk about is their streaming services and not their linear networks that you pay a lot of money for. I'm just wondering sort of how you think about like are we getting closer to the point where rates or channels actually start coming down? Like are -- do you think anyone is learning that they can't charge more every year as viewership goes down and they don't even care about the assets versus their streaming services? And how does that affect how you negotiate retrans programming, et cetera?"

I mean it does change stuff because as something that's available through streaming, your product becomes less valuable on a linear basis because people have another way to get there. So it relates to retrans. Now that the biggest -- really retrans today is an NFL season ticket, so your local teams, right? That's the value there. And absent NFL, I don't know if they have a show in the top 100 that gets there, right? So maybe the Oscars or something, I don't know. But there's not much there based on what we see. 
So viewership, we've seen viewership decline 15 years in a row on the networks and retrans go up by 1,000%. That's not sustainable, but we look at it for math. And we know we'll lose customers, so we know we'll lose TEGNA customers. They're not up and we are losing some customers, but not as dramatic as it might have been in the past. 
And once you do football season and once people find a way to get football next year, that's going to be a permanent loss of viewers for TEGNA. And of course, people also can go get it from the networks. They can get Peacock from NBC directly. And maybe TEGNA gets revenue from that, maybe they get more revenue than they do from us, and maybe that makes sense for them. But we look at it economically.  
Sinclair is bigger than TEGNA, and we've had a long-term relationship there. And that -- there's more conversation around that than there is, and they're bigger and would probably have a little bit more clout and scale in the marketplace. But I said it last time, I think the moves in retrans are down, not up. And I don't know what that does to valuations, but I saw Gray publicly said 50% of their revenues are retrans. And I think that's going to come under pressure."

What we're doing hasn't changed a bit as a consequence of the AT&T roaming deal. And when I think about what we're building, it's really the metropolitan areas in any of the given markets. I mean we've built -- we designed the footprint sufficiently large to minimize the handovers to other networks. So we put -- the networks were built such that the handover back to T-Mobile would be on an interstate outside of town. So that would imply that all of the key suburban areas in all of the geographies will be covered. 
If I think about -- your question was, can you help dimension the 20% and the 70%? And I'd say that with respect to the 70%, that encompasses all of the major metropolitan areas across the country. And if you think about cities over 0.5 million, they're going to be -- in the Continental U.S., if it's over 0.5 million POPs, it's going to be in the footprint, right? And I'd say if I roll the clock back to the 20%, it will -- similarly, it will be metropolitan areas where they're relatively easy to build. 
So for example, California that's intrinsically more difficult, is not high on the list in the 20% nor is the Northeast, although there are some areas in the Northeast. It's primarily the middle of the country where co-location is prevalent, and we can move very quickly.

And so depending on what vertical it is, depending on what solutions they're trying to deploy, what systems they have in place, it drives different requirements. 
There are requirements and some opportunities for very low latency, depending on what they're doing in terms of the control systems and there are others that don't have that same criteria. So each one of these -- and I guess my earlier comment about degrees of freedom, you have to have the degrees of freedom within the platform and the architecture to support those different solutions based on what that enterprise need is.

And so we're just going to get there. That's just the way we're going to do it. 
On the handset, there's 2 other areas. Labor is an issue that our teams having to work extraordinarily hard because people are -- there's not enough supply of labor out there today. And the handset issue is probably the biggest because we had headwinds in this January 1 shutoff for CDMA. So we had to take handsets and give it to existing customers that would have been a new customer. 
And so absent supply chain issues on the handset side, where we're getting a fraction of what we've ordered, we would have been -- we would have had growth -- we had a lot more growth there. So -- and we don't have the scale that the incumbents have with the vendors. So I don't know that we get our fair share of handsets. And so we worked extraordinarily hard to make sure that we're on the radar -- people's radar screen. And our customers aren't -- primarily aren't buying the $1,000 phones. They're more economically challenged. But as we get into postpaid and as we get into owner economics, that changes for us in a very positive way.

So -- and obviously,",526,"Well, I don't think there shouldn't be a surprise that the capital expenditures are where they are since we -- that's what it takes to build a network, and we're doing it infinitely less expensive than anybody has ever done it before. So -- and obviously, the -- I think we're doing -- I think we should have been a little faster on rollout in Las Vegas. I mean, I think that's fair. But I think other than that, most everything else we're doing is we're doing probably better than we anticipated on. 
And we're not exactly understood by the industry that much. And part of it is because we don't spend a lot of time going through strategically what we're doing, and we spend a little bit more time on just -- it's a complicated story, and it's a little bit easy for us just to do it and then show people as opposed to try to explain it. 
And just a simple example is we're about more than just a handset business, yet the people who follow us and stuff are -- and we're basically a cloud IT network that we're building, and it's a little bit different thought process on what that looks like than traditional networks. And so we have to do a better job of explaining our story and we have to execute in our markets between now and June of 2022. So I think that's the stuff we'll focus on. 
And the marketplace, they don't always get it right in the short term and don't get it right in the long term. And we're one of the few companies that has the ability to be able to think long term. The -- if we had thought short term, we would -- we tried to get DBS up 5 years ago because that's what people wanted us to do. 
And so I think we know where it's going. We know how -- the power of this network, we know how special this network is going to be, and we know the opportunity. So it's on us to execute and then give people the road map to see why their investment in DISH is a smart investment. 
And we have certainly work to do there. But we're focused on making sure we get our network up and operating, and then we'll talk about it. And there'll be a little bit in AWS. I think there'll be a little bit in Las Vegas and AWS to reinvent stuff. I think people will start to see it there and start to understand a little bit better because those are the people that actually -- the developers and the people in the cloud, they'll have a better feel for it. 
I mean, last year, this time, people didn't -- say we weren't going to build the network. Now I think it shifted to, okay, we get it to -- I think most people believe we're building the network. Now it's, can you make it -- can you stay under your $10 billion long term and can you make it profitable. That we have to show."

I don't think there's serious negotiation going on, really. I mean, I think we remain far apart. We've got 8 weeks of football left and then we'll have lost the customers who can find football somewhere else and it remains such a huge tax that we know where that ends up. 
So having said that, we remain available to have an honest conversation about where things go. We know what the prices we pay, everybody else is. We know the prices in the marketplace. We know the ratings. So we know the economic value. We always pay more than the economic value because we have to factor in the customers that we lose. But the economic value to us is going down, not up right now because we've probably lost -- and it's not tied away by any means in terms of customer -- they find another place to watch the news, and they found another place to watch football, so.
And they can save money, we give them a credit when they don't have TEGNA. So we give them credit, so they save money. So it's a bit of a balance. But we prefer to be up. We -- TEGNA has been a good partner. We prefer to have it up. We prefer to have an honest negotiation, but we're just apart."
