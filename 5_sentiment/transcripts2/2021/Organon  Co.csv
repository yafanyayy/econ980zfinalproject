Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. As you may know, after several years in the making, Organon's  officially spun for Merck on June 2 and began trading as a public company on June 3. So today marks our fir",1461,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Jen. Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. As you may know, after several years in the making, Organon's  officially spun for Merck on June 2 and began trading as a public company on June 3. So today marks our first earnings call as a stand-alone public company, and I'm very pleased to be here. Organon's vision is to create a better and healthier every day for everyone. We have seen how our vision and purpose has connected with so many and continues to motivate thousands of our employees who have been hard at work standing up Organon and at the same time, have been focused on driving our business. 
In the second quarter, Organon generated $1.6 billion of revenue, $627 million of adjusted EBITDA and $1.72 in adjusted earnings per share. Year-to-date, all 3 of our franchises are delivering on their objectives, each playing their role and driving our vision of improving the health of women. 
Accordingly, today, we affirmed the full year 2021 guidance we provided at our May Investor Day. Looking out past 2021, we remain confident in our ability to grow revenue low to mid-single digits on an organic basis. As LOE risk will largely be behind us and the women's health and biosimilar franchises are positioned to deliver double-digit growth. 
Today, we also announced an important milestone for Organon. Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which speaks to the cash-generating power and sustainability of our business. 
Turning to Slide 5 now. Though new as a stand-alone company, the 64 products that came to Organon  for Merck trusted well-recognized medicines. Many of them household names. We operate in 3 franchises Women's Health and biosimilars are 2 growth engines and established brands, which is a portfolio of 49 products that generate sizable and stable cash flows, even though most have already lost exclusivity. 
Organon  endeavors to be a different kind of company, 1 focused on advancing the health of women. In order to do that, we are broadening our portfolio beyond our already market-leading positions in contraception and fertility. We have already begun to execute on this vision.  Already completing 2 transactions in important areas of unmet needs for women. 
In June, we completed our acquisition of [ Lidia ] Health, which is a commercial stage medical device company that received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA in 2020 for the [ JDA ] system, a product intended to control abnormal post-partum bleeding or hemorrhage. We plan to use our global commercial footprint in reproductive health and experience in creating affordable access and to further develop and bring the [ JDA ] system to more women around the world. 
We recently also announced a licensing agreement with [ ObsEva ] for the global development, manufacturing and commercial rights to investigational agents [ be evopro ] currently being studied as the first -- potential first-in-class innovation for the treatment of preterm labor. To remind everyone, every year, 15 million babies are born preterm. And although preterm birth rates are on the rise, there are currently no other known compounds in development and no approved therapies for the acute treatment of preterm labor in the United States. 
As our first development-stage asset, Organon intends to leverage its considerable expertise and work with the scientific and medical communities and regulatory authorities in major markets, including the United States, to advance the clinical development and registration of [ ebopriprant ]. Both of these opportunities fall squarely in line with our business development strategy in size, scale, market opportunities and to our focus on helping address the most serious unmet needs of women. 
Our early progress demonstrates how serious we are about our commitment to becoming the leader in women's health and expanding our portfolio beyond contraception and fertility. 
Turning to Slide 6 now. We can't talk about our women's health portfolio without talking about NEXPLANON, the #2 contraceptive worldwide by revenue and a product we believe has blockbuster potential. NEXPLANON plays in the large market or otherwise known as the long-acting reversible contraception segment. Globally, the hormonal contraception market continues to see usage shift away from the daily combined oral contraceptive segment towards [ LARCs ]. [ LARCs ] are highly efficacious and considered to be one of the most effective forms of hormonal contraception available. 
NEXPLANON, or [indiscernible] as it's known in some markets, is differentiated even within the large segment as it's the only single rod subdermal long-acting reversible contraceptive. It is a progesterone-only rod that is inserted in a woman's upper arm, average insertion time takes about a minute and it is conducted in the health care provider's office. NEXPLANON has exclusivity in the U.S. until 2027 and until 2025 in markets outside of the U.S. 
Currently, NEXPLANON is approved for 3 years of efficacy, but in November 2020, we began a registration study to evaluate the use of NEXPLANON for up to 5 years. If successful, we believe this will make NEXPLANON an attractive contraception option for many more women, including those who are family complete. 
During the quarter,  our fertility portfolio also showed particular strength. We're very encouraged by the early traction, especially in China, where fertility demand is very close to being back to pre-COVID levels. Governments around the world are becoming increasingly active in addressing the fertility issues families can face. Recently, the Chinese government introduced the 3 child policy. And next year, Japan will introduce reimbursement for IVF treatments in an attempt to address declining birth rates. 
The French government also recently passed the bill to allow egg freezing and for same-sex couple to seek IVF treatment. Outside of women's health,  we're also encouraged by the growing support for biosimilars. The U.S. biosimilar market continues to grow with  increases in physician and payer comfort with biosimilars. [indiscernible] therapeutic areas we compete in, namely immunology and oncology are seeing increased biosimilar utilization. The oncology conversion from originator to biosimilars has been faster for [indiscernible], which is where [ entrees ] on place has some of the highest adoption rates among biosimilars. We currently see nearly 70% of the [ trastuzumab ] market converted to biosimilars. We are well positioned in the biosimilar market as a commercial collaborator with [ Samsung Bioepis ]. We have a good balance in terms of geographic contribution, so we're not levered to the particular dynamics of any single market. We have balanced with the life cycle of our portfolio. We have marketed products that are growing, like RENFLEXIS and [indiscernible]. We have launched assets like [ Head Lima ] Australia and Canada, which are performing very well, and we have what we believe will be a major pipeline opportunity with our anticipated [ head Lima ] launch in the U.S. in 2023. 
We also continue to evaluate other potential pipeline opportunities with Samsung as well as other partners. And as we think about our established brand portfolio, part of the strategic timing of the spin is that 2021 is an inflection year. It is the last year during which the portfolio is subject to significant new LOE risk. Beyond 2021, the impact from the LOEs dissipates. Further, we have opportunities to soften the erosion curve with continued growth of [ ADAZED ], launches of certain products in selected markets and other life cycle management opportunities. We continue to take an entrepreneurial view with regards to the established brands portfolio. And all 3 franchises are global businesses, as you'll see on the next slide. 
Asia Pacific was the only geographic region that was down in the quarter, and that was driven by [ ZETIA's ] loss of exclusivity in Japan. Our largest region, Europe and Canada, is showing strong double-digit growth, driven not only by COVID recovery, but also by volume growth in biosimilars and in fertility. The U.S., particularly NEXPLANON benefited from lapping the significant COVID impacts in the second quarter of last year, but also from growth in fertility. The U.S. also showed solid performance in biosimilars, where we offer both RENFLEXIS and [ entrant ]. 
In China, we had several positive areas of momentum that more than offset the impact from 4 of our products being included in the volume-based procurement process in the fourth quarter of last year. We also saw the respiratory market recovering from the negative COVID impact in 2020. Our fertility portfolio outpaced the market in Q2, and the contribution from the retail channel continued to grow. 
We're actively monitoring the impact of COVID and its variance across the world, but overall, we are very encouraged by how the portfolio is performing. And now I will turn it over to Matt to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail. Matt?"
653748561,1671457538,2375404,"Organon & Co., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2021",2021-08-12,"Earnings Calls","Organon & Co.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. Before I review the details of the quarter, it's important to remind everyone that our second quarter is unique, and it's what I would call a hybrid quarter. It's hybrid in that Q2 includes approximately 2 months of preseparation operati",2394,"Thank you, Kevin. Before I review the details of the quarter, it's important to remind everyone that our second quarter is unique, and it's what I would call a hybrid quarter. It's hybrid in that Q2 includes approximately 2 months of preseparation operations for which GAAP mandates the carve-out method of accounting and approximately 1 month of post-separation business activity accounted for by conventional GAAP methodologies. 
But the key area of commonality across these 2 different methods is revenue, which is presented by and large on an apples-to-apples basis, and that's where I'll focus most of my commentary. So with this clarification on basis of presentation, and now let's turn to Slide 8. And revenue for the second quarter was up 4.5% as reported and down about 1% at constant currency exchange rates. The impact of the loss of exclusivity or LOE during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of last year is approximately $130 million [ and ] it's primarily related to the loss of exclusivity of ZETIA in the back half of 2020 in Japan as Kevin mentioned, and NuvaRing LOE in the United States.
The established brands portfolio has exposure to the volume-based procurement initiative or VBP in China,  the total impact to sales for the second quarter compared to the second quarter of last year was approximately $40 million and was associated with the third round of VBP, which is the largest so far and which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 and  that included 4 of Organon's products, [ Singular pediatrics ], [ Proscar ], [ Propecia ] and [indiscernible]. 
In the second quarter of 2021, the negative impact of COVID-19 was estimated to be approximately $120 million, which is about $100 million better than last year. Our product portfolio is comprised of physician-prescribed products, which have been affected by social distancing measures and fewer medical visits. And although we believe that global health systems and patients continue to adapt to the evolving impacts of the pandemic,  and although we have experienced recoveries during the second quarter as compared to the year ago quarter, we do expect that ongoing negative impacts will persist through the remainder of 2021. 
Foreign exchange translation had a fairly sizable impact in the second quarter with about 550 basis points of favorability -- It's not -- that's not really surprising given the impact of COVID-19 on global currency markets in the prior year period and also understanding that approximately 80% of Organon's revenues are derived outside the United States. And finally, we are seeing volume growth, mainly driven by our key growth businesses, women's health and biosimilars as well as growth geographically in China, in fertility and in our established brands products ex-VBP.  
So now let's take a look at performance by franchise. We'll start with Women's health on Slide 9. Our Women's health business grew 19% as reported and 16% ex-FX in the second quarter. We saw growth in NEXPLANON, which was up 39% ex-FX in the quarter and benefited from patients beginning to return to their health care providers as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. Now while in-person patient visits to health care professionals demonstrated recovery in the second quarter, relative to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic during the same period last year, they are not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. And as a result, we expect that ongoing negative impacts will persist through the rest of 2021, and that view is incorporated into our guidance, which we'll discuss shortly. 
Our fertility portfolio is showing strength. [indiscernible] grew 40% in the quarter. Volume growth came from increasing demand from new accounts as well as from patients returning to clinics. We have observed that patients seeking fertility treatments are more motivated to return to doctors' offices than those patients  is  seeking normal course well visits. So these growth drivers more than offset the 19% decline in NuvaRing related to increased generic penetration as a result of the NuvaRing NuvaRing LOE in 2018 in the U.S. 
Turning now to biosimilar [ report ] in the second quarter and 35% ex-FX. We have 5 assets in the portfolio, 3 in immunology and 2 in oncology. We launched our first asset, [indiscernible] in 2016, followed by RENFLEXIS in 2017, [ Entrada ] in 2018 and [indiscernible] in the back half of 2020. [ Head Lima ] launched this year in Australia and Canada. Renflexis and [Atrazine] are our 2 largest offerings and both are offered in the United States. Globally, RENFLEXIS grew 38% ex FX in the quarter, driven by strong performance in the U.S. and Atrazine, which was launched in the U.S. in July of last year, was up 13%. [indiscernible] with brands now on Slide 11. 
Because of the number of products and established brands in the multiple markets in which they're sold, we'll often discuss the performance of this franchise in terms of how it behaves as a portfolio. So revenues for established brands was down 4% as reported and 10% ex-FX in the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the impacts of LOE, revenue was down about 2% ex-FX. Volumes were up incrementally, mainly driven by COVID rebound, and price was down about 2%, which is consistent with our prior disclosures and that we expect price erosion in established brands to be in the low single-digit ex-LOE over the intermediate term. 
China is an important market for established brands, and part of our strategy in this market has been to move business out of a hospital channel and into the retail channel. And this effort continues to be successful. The retail channel in China grew double digits now represents about 45% of established plans revenue in China, up from approximately 35% a year ago. And just to reference, total revenue in China across all organized business lines for the second quarter was $236 million, up 12% versus the second quarter of last year. 
Now turning to our income statement on Slide 12. Again, because of the hybrid nature of this quarter, comparability to prior year performance across most income statement line items is not particularly meaningful. We can, however, draw comparisons at the revenue and gross margin lines, if in the case of the latter, we make a sensible adjustment to exclude purchase accounting amortization and onetime items or cost of goods sold. So making this adjustment in the second quarter of 2021, non-GAAP adjusted gross profit was $1.044 billion, representing a gross margin of 65.5% compared with 71.2% in the second quarter of last year. 
The decline reflects an increase in stand alone costs, including certain costs related to manufacturing agreements between Organon  and Merck, which had lower gross margin percentages compared to third-party product sales. While comparisons to prior year performance are challenging, probably the most important commentary we can make about Q2 performance is that it aligns very well with the full year guidance for 2021 that we provided at our Investor Day across all line items of our P&L, from revenue down to adjusted EBITDA and including our non-GAAP effective tax rate. We'll come back to guidance in a few moments. 
A few parts on debt capitalization. At June 30, our bank debt was $9.5 billion against cash and cash equivalents of $730 million. Although this cash balance includes about $400 million of prefunded cash that will shortly be remitted back to Merck related to pre-spin off inventory conveyance that will actually occur post separation. So more represented of net debt number is actually closer to $9.2 billion. And if we think about leverage ratios in the context of the guidance that we're affirming today and just to be illustrative, if we use the midpoint of our implied 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance, that would put our net leverage ratio just below 4x. To discuss our capital allocation priorities at our Investor Day in May, and I'll repeat them here today. 
With the recurring dividend now declare, of course, the dividend becomes capital allocation priority #1. We've endeavored to set the dividend at a low 20s percentage of free cash flow, excluding onetime cost of the separation, at this level, we believe, will be very manageable going forward. Our second priority will be organic growth, which would include life cycle management opportunities for existing products in the portfolio and capital deployed in our manufacturing plants. And on the latter, we expect to see annual CapEx in the range of 3% to 4% of revenue on an ongoing basis, excluding separation costs. 
Our third capital allocation priority is really a tied between: a, execution of external growth plans to develop a pipeline of product opportunities like [ JDA 2.0 ] and [ EVO piprant ], balance again be debt reduction and our commitment to maintaining our BB BA 2 rating. We are targeting a long-term leverage ratio below 3.5x net to adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to guidance now on Slide 13. Today, we are affirming the guidance that we laid out at our May 3 Investor event. Revisiting basis of presentation. Our guidance, both for the May 3 Investor event and today is non-GAAP and pro forma as if the spin-off happened on January 1. Beginning with revenue. This is the chart that we showed at Investor Day, and there's been very little change. We continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $6.1 to $6.4 billion, which is essentially all organic. We do include a de minimis partial year revenue contribution from the acquisition of [Olivia] Health that closed in June. The biggest component to the year-over-year change in revenue, of course, is the expected LOE impacts. 
Impact from LOE were approximately $210 million year-to-date and are primarily related to the loss of patent protection for ZETIA in Japan and NuvaRing in the United States. So far, we have not seen a generic entrant for Dulera, which logs exclusivity in 2020. So we're improving our full year estimate of LOE impact to $300 million to $400 million -- from the $400 million to $500 million that we projected at Investor Day. 
As we were careful to describe previously, 2021 is an inflection year for Organon. After 2021, our LOE exposure dissipates to approximately $300 million cumulative over the 4-year period, 2022 to 2025. Those who attend at Investor Day would know that we had said $250 million, but with [ Dulera ] now moving out of '21 into 2022, that pushes out some LOE exposure into future years. As far as upcoming VBP exposure, we now expect that Astral will most likely be included in the next round of VBP in 2022 instead of this year, as we previously expected. But we don't see moving the needle on the $200 million to $300 million range we previously expected. Obviously, COVID is something we're watching closely. Year-to-date impact from COVID was about $220 million. However, as we consider lagging trends in well visits and the effect that, that has had on NEXPLANON as well as potential disruptions from the COVID-19 delta variant, we now believe the 2021 impact from COVID could be more in line with 2020 as opposed to slightly better as we previously thought. On a yearly basis, we expect foreign exchange translation to be a modest tailwind based on year-to-date currency performance and where spot rates are currently. 
Taken on the whole, this quarter's revenue performance is well aligned with our previous guidance, and it continues to reflect the key themes that we've been talking about in our public communications prior to the spinoff. Looking through the LOE issues that are [ waving ], we are seeing volume growth as we expected, mainly driven by our key growth businesses, women's health and biosimilars. We're also seeing volume growth geographically in China in fertility and established brands ex-VBP. 
Turning now to other guidance items on Slide 14. We're affirming all of the guidance that we provided at Investor Day, we're updating shares outstanding so that it's now a fully diluted number. We expect weighted average fully diluted shares to be about $254 million for 2021. To reiterate what we said in May, we expect gross margin to be in the low to mid-60s range. We expect SG&A expense to be in the range of mid-20% of sales. We expect R&D expense to be in the mid-single-digit range as a percentage of revenue. And what this really represents is mostly R&D infrastructure and a relatively small amount of variable spend on the organic life cycle management opportunities that we're planning to undertake for products currently in the portfolio. 
As we fill out a pipeline, our R&D expense would rise to support these programs and we expect some of that to occur in 2021, but not by enough to revise the guidance range that we gave previously. So taking all this together, that would put us on an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 36% to 38% for 2021.  We expect back half of the year margins to be well within this range based on phasing of spending. And this is primarily related to delayed spending due to
COVID as well as timing of spending for life cycle management programs, the integration of Olivia Health and some other investments that we're planning that are intended to drive revenue growth in the future. Below the line, interest expense for 2021. Again, as if we were a stand-alone company since the beginning of the year is expected to be approximately $400 million for the year, which reflects our new debt structure as a stand-alone company. 
Depreciation is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $115 million, and we expect our ongoing non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 17.5% to 19.5%, with book and cash taxes being roughly similar.  Wrapping up the financial discussion, the franchises are progressing as we had expected. Given our outlook for 2021, we continue to believe that we're well positioned for future organic revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. This will be driven by stabilization in the established brand portfolio and continued growth in both women's health and biosimilars, each of which has the potential to grow at low double-digit CAGRs in the intermediate term. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks."

So we have seen a COVID rebound in the business. We've seen it more in fertility than in contraception as we stated in the prepared comments, fertility patients for a number of reasons are more motivated to return to the clinics versus patients seeking to roll -- to initiate a rollover contraception. And so we do think that there is more COVID recovery to be realized in the businesses, depending on the progression of the delta variant and any other variance that may come. So that's -- I think we've seen some encouraging results in terms of the COVID rebound, both for fertility as well as across solid portions of the established brands portfolio, but we are looking for more as the pandemic receives."

And year-to-date, we've got 46% growth versus year-to-date 2020, and we're significantly outpacing the fertility market growth. The market is growing at 35%, and we're growing at 46%. So very positive sign for our fertility efforts and what we're doing. And remember that overall behind what's going on here is a movement. I mean I mentioned China and the pretrial policy, Japan and suing IVF reimbursement soon to begin, France in terms of egg freezing as well as same sex couples reimbursement more reimbursement from U.S. employers to single payers like an EU recognizing the need to address declining birth rate. So we're very bullish and very focused on fertility. It's an important area of focus for us, and we'll continue to see the kind of double-digit growth we always expected to it."

And through the second quarter, we already stabilized the business, showing volume growth and revenue growth. 
We're really excited as well. Overall, the retail performance, I mentioned a number of occasions before that the retail focus we started in 2017, seeing that VBP was going to be an issue. And right now, our performance in the retail sector in Q2 has grown almost by 30% and already accounts for nearly 45% of our established brands business in China. 
I also mentioned fertility. Fertility, by the way, just take an opportunity [indiscernible], fertility grew 70% in the second quarter. And just as a reminder, the Fertility franchise is not subject to volume-based procurement and 100% cash pay business. Our portfolio in China right now, 60% of the established brands business. 60% of our portfolio has gone through the volume-based procurement process.  10%, will not because it's really fertility driven. 30% is remaining. 20% of that 30% will go through in 2022.  And the remaining 10% will come in the outer years. So we're very diversified. Remember, and volume-based procurement in terms of China, no single product represents more than 20% of our business. So we've got very well [indiscernible] just because we've got experience of it for the last 5 years. And also, we see that the future is essentially in terms of any exposure that we might have [indiscernible] potential exposure, which potentially happens in 2023, approximately hits -- can affect about 40% of our business there, but it's been in the forecast discussed during our May Investor Day, it's already folded in.

What can you speak to your ability to engage in something like that, especially early on being a public company? Are you constrained in being able to use it or not? That's first. 
Secondly, I know there's a lot of investor interest in figuring out what are the true growth drivers that's beyond biosimilars going forward? And 1 of the points I thought about is what's your ability to engage with Merck on on the possibility of using NEXPLANON device IP for substituting other women's health generic products in there to create new sort of NEXPLANON 2 and NEXPLANON 3 kind of thing, new offerings using that device given the physician comfort with that device. Can you speak to that in any programs ongoing?

So from a business development perspective, of course, we're always looking for what we feel is going to be really an important contributor to this type of business [indiscernible]. We are, though, executing currently exactly on our strategy, which is essentially, as I mentioned to you before,  there are a number of assets out there that are really looking for home because there's significant unmet need, and we believe we can start to be an aggregator in some of these women's health assets that are unique in terms of what they provide or solutions for some of the significant unmet needs that women face around the world. 
And so right now, the way that we've executed on that strategy is what I believe is spot on to what we wanted to do. It's really kind of -- look, we're 2 months into our launch, and our spend, we've already done 2 deals. Well, that really shows our seriousness.

In terms of NEXPLANON raw technology, of course, we always -- we're in very close coordination with our Merck colleagues. And right now, we don't have anything in the pipeline in terms of focusing on using that raw technology for anything else then what we're doing today, which is essentially moving from 3 years to 5 years is our focus right now in our life cycle management development for NEXPLANON. We hope that, that will give us an opportunity to extend the life of NEXPLANON to 2030, which will really make it available to many more women who really need and want something [indiscernible] along the horizon of efficacy for 5 years. 
Finally, in terms of what's happening in [indiscernible], I think we feel very solid and very good. Obviously, I can't comment on ongoing litigation, but we feel very good in our position there.

Welcome, and thank you for joining us today. As you may know, after several years in the making, Organon's officially spun from Merck on June 2 and began trading as a public company on June 3. So today marks our first earnings call as a stand-alone public company, and I'm very pleased to be here. Organon's vision is to create a better and healthier everyday for everyone. We have seen how our vision and purpose has connected with so many and continues to motivate thousands of our employees who have been hard at work standing up Organon and at the same time have been focused on driving our business. 
In the second quarter, Organon generated $1.6 billion of revenue, $627 million of adjusted EBITDA and $1.72 in adjusted earnings per share. Year-to-date, all 3 of our franchises are delivering on their objectives, each playing their role and driving our vision of improving the health of women. Accordingly, today, we affirmed the full year 2021 guidance we provided at our May Investor Day. Looking out past 2021, we remain confident in our ability to grow revenue low to mid-single digits on an organic basis, as LOE risk will largely be behind us and the women's health and biosimilar franchises are positioned to deliver double-digit growth. 
Today, we also announced an important milestone for Organon. Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which speaks to the cash-generating power and sustainability of our business. 
Turning to Slide 5 now. Though new as a stand-alone company, the 64 products that came to Organon for Merck trusted well-recognized medicines, many of them household names. We operate in 3 franchises Women's Health and biosimilars are 2 growth engines, and established brands, which is a portfolio of 49 products that generate sizable and stable cash flows, even though most have already lost exclusivity. 
Organon  endeavors to be a different kind of company, one focused on advancing the health of women. In order to do that, we are broadening our portfolio beyond our already market-leading positions in contraception and fertility. We have already begun to execute on this vision, already completing 2 transactions in important areas of unmet needs for women. 
In June, we completed our acquisition of Alydia Health, which is a commercial-stage medical device company that received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA in 2020 for the Jada System, a product intended to control abnormal post-partum bleeding or hemorrhage. We plan to use our global commercial footprint in reproductive health and experience in creating affordable access and to further develop and bring the Jada System to more women around the world. 
We recently also announced a licensing agreement with ObsEva for the global development, manufacturing and commercial rights to investigational agent ebopiprant currently being studied as the first -- potential first-in-class innovation for the treatment of preterm labor. To remind everyone, every year, 15 million babies are born preterm, and although preterm birth rates are on the rise, there are currently no other known compounds in development and no approved therapies for the acute treatment of preterm labor in the United States. As our first development-stage asset, Organon intends to leverage its considerable expertise and work with the scientific and medical communities and regulatory authorities in major markets, including the United States, to advance the clinical development and registration of ebopiprant. 
Both of these opportunities fall squarely in line with our business development strategy in size, scale, market opportunities and to our focus on helping address the most serious unmet needs of women. Our early progress demonstrates how serious we are about our commitment to becoming the leader in women's health and expanding our portfolio beyond contraception and fertility. 
Turning to Slide 6 now. We can't talk about our women's health portfolio without talking about NEXPLANON, the #2 contraceptive worldwide by revenue and a product we believe has blockbuster potential. NEXPLANON plays in the large market or otherwise known as the long-acting reversible contraception segment. Globally, the hormonal contraception market continues to see usage shift away from the daily combined oral contraceptive segment towards LARCs. LARCs are highly efficacious and considered to be one of the most effective forms of hormonal contraception available. 
NEXPLANON or Implanon NXT, as it's known in some markets, is differentiated even within a large segment as it's the only single-rod subdermal long-acting reversible contraceptive. It is a progesterone-only rod that is inserted in a woman's upper arm. Average insertion time takes about a minute, and it is conducted in the health care provider's office. NEXPLANON has exclusivity in the U.S. until 2027 and until 2025 in markets outside of the U.S. Currently, NEXPLANON is approved for 3 years of efficacy, but in November 2020, we began a registration study to evaluate the use of NEXPLANON for up to 5 years. If successful, we believe this will make NEXPLANON an attractive contraception option for many more women, including those who are family complete. 
During the quarter, our fertility portfolio also showed particular strength. We're very encouraged by the early traction, especially in China, where fertility demand is very close to being back to pre-COVID levels. Governments around the world are becoming increasingly active in addressing the fertility issues families can face. Recently, the Chinese government introduced the 3 child policy. And next year, Japan will introduce reimbursement for IVF treatments in an attempt to address declining birth rates. The French government also recently passed a bill to allow egg freezing and for same-sex couple to seek IVF treatment. 
Outside of women's health,  we're also encouraged by the growing support for biosimilars. The U.S. biosimilar market continues to grow with increases in physician and payer comfort with biosimilars. Biosimilars in therapeutic areas we compete in, namely immunology and oncology, are seeing increased biosimilar utilization, though oncology conversion from originator to biosimilars has been faster. For example, trastuzumab, which is where ONTRUZANT plays, has some of the highest adoption rates among biosimilars. We currently see nearly 70% of the trastuzumab market converted to biosimilars. 
We are well positioned in the biosimilar market as a commercial collaborator with Samsung Bioepis. We have a good balance in terms of geographic contribution, so we're not levered to the particular dynamics of any single market. We have balance with the life cycle of our portfolio. We have marketed products that are growing, like RENFLEXIS and ONTRUZANT. We have launched assets like HADLIMA in Australia and Canada, which are performing very well, and we have what we believe will be a major pipeline opportunity with our anticipated HADLIMA launch in the U.S. in 2023. We also continue to evaluate other potential pipeline opportunities with Samsung as well as other partners. 
And as we think about our established brand portfolio, part of the strategic timing of the spin is that 2021 is an inflection year. It is the last year during which the portfolio is subject to significant new LOE risk. Beyond 2021, the impact from the LOEs dissipates. Further, we have opportunities to soften the erosion curve with continued growth of Atozet, launches of certain products in selected markets, and other life cycle management opportunities. We continue to take an entrepreneurial view with regards to the established brands portfolio. And all 3 franchises are global businesses, as you'll see on the next slide. 
Asia Pacific was the only geographic region that was down in the quarter, and that was driven by ZETIA's loss of exclusivity in Japan. Our largest region, Europe and Canada, is showing strong double-digit growth, driven not only by COVID recovery, but also by volume growth in biosimilars and in fertility. The U.S., particularly NEXPLANON, benefited from lapping the significant COVID impacts in the second quarter of last year, but also from growth in fertility. The U.S. also showed solid performance in biosimilars, where we offer both RENFLEXIS and ONTRUZANT.
In China, we had several positive areas of momentum that more than offset the impact from 4 of our products being included in the volume-based procurement process in the fourth quarter of last year. We also saw the respiratory market recovering from the negative COVID impact from 2020. Our fertility portfolio outpaced the market in Q2, and the contribution from the retail channel continued to grow. We're actively monitoring the impact of COVID and its variants across the world, but overall, we are very encouraged by how the portfolio is performing. 
And now, I will turn it over to Matt to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail. Matt?"

Before I review the details of the quarter, it's important to remind everyone that our second quarter is unique, and it's what I would call a hybrid quarter. It's hybrid in that Q2 includes approximately 2 months of pre-separation operations for which GAAP mandates the carve-out method of accounting and approximately 1 month of post-separation business activity accounted for by conventional GAAP methodologies. 
But the key area of commonality across these 2 different methods is revenue, which is presented by and large on an apples-to-apples basis, and that's where I'll focus most of my commentary. So with this clarification on basis of presentation, and now, let's turn to Slide 8. 
And revenue for the second quarter was up 4.5% as reported and down about 1% at constant currency exchange rates. The impact of the loss of exclusivity, or LOE, during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of last year is approximately $130 million and it's primarily related to the loss of exclusivity of ZETIA in the back half of 2020 in Japan, as Kevin mentioned, and NuvaRing's LOE in the United States.
The established brands portfolio has exposure to the volume-based procurement initiative or VBP in China. The total impact to sales for the second quarter compared to the second quarter of last year was approximately $40 million and was associated with the third round of VBP, which is the largest so far, and which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020. And that included 4 of Organon's products: SINGULAIR pediatrics, PROSCAR, PROPECIA and Arcoxia. 
In the second quarter of 2021, the negative impact of COVID-19 was estimated to be approximately $120 million, which is about $100 million better than last year. Our product portfolio is comprised of physician-prescribed products, which have been affected by social distancing measures and fewer medical visits. And although we believe that global health systems and patients continue to adapt to the evolving impacts of the pandemic and although we have experienced recoveries during the second quarter as compared to the year-ago quarter, we do expect that ongoing negative impacts will persist through the remainder of 2021. 
Foreign exchange translation had a fairly sizable impact in the second quarter. With about 550 basis points of favorability, it's not -- that's not really surprising given the impact of COVID-19 on global currency markets in the prior year period and also understanding that approximately 80% of Organon's revenues are derived outside the United States. And finally, we are seeing volume growth, mainly driven by our key growth businesses, women's health and biosimilars as well as growth geographically in China in fertility and in our established brands products, ex VBP.  
So now, let's take a look at performance by franchise. We'll start with women's health on Slide 9. Our women's health business grew 19% as reported and 16% ex FX in the second quarter. We saw growth in NEXPLANON, which was up 39% ex FX in the quarter and benefited from patients beginning to return to their health care providers as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. Now while in-person patient visits to health care professionals demonstrated recovery in the second quarter, relative to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic during the same period last year, they are not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. And as a result, we expect that ongoing negative impacts will persist through the rest of 2021, and that view is incorporated into our guidance, which we'll discuss shortly. 
Our fertility portfolio is showing strength. Volume grew 40% in the quarter. Volume growth came from increasing demand from new accounts as well as from patients returning to clinics. We have observed that patients seeking fertility treatments are more motivated to return to doctors' offices than those patients  seeking normal course well visits. So these growth drivers more than offset the 19% decline in NuvaRing related to increased generic penetration as a result of the NuvaRing's LOE in 2018 in the U.S. 
Turning now to biosimilars on Slide 10. Biosimilars grew 43% as reported in the second quarter and 35% ex FX. We have 5 assets in the portfolio: 3 in immunology and 2 in oncology. We launched our first asset, BRENZYS, in 2016, followed by RENFLEXIS in 2017, ONTRUZANT in 2018 and AYBINTIO in the back half of 2020. HADLIMA launched this year in Australia and Canada. RENFLEXIS and ONTRUZANT are our 2 largest offerings, and both are offered in the United States. Globally, RENFLEXIS grew 38% ex FX in the quarter, driven by strong performance in the U.S. and ONTRUZANT, which was launched in the U.S. in July of last year, was up 13%. 
Let's go to established with brands now on Slide 11. Because of the number of products and established brands in the multiple markets in which they're sold, we'll often discuss the performance of this franchise in terms of how it behaves as a portfolio. So revenues for established brands was down 4% as reported and 10% ex FX in the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the impacts of LOE, revenue was down about 2% ex FX. Volumes were up incrementally, mainly driven by COVID rebound, and price was down about 2%, which is consistent with our prior disclosures and that we expect price erosion in established brands to be in the low single-digit ex LOE over the intermediate term. 
China is an important market for established brands, and part of our strategy in this market has been to move business out of a hospital channel and into the retail channel. And this effort continues to be successful. The retail channel in China grew double digits and now represents about 45% of established brands revenue in China, up from approximately 35% a year ago. And just for reference, total revenue in China across all Organon business lines for the second quarter was $236 million, up 12% versus the second quarter of last year. 
Now turning to our income statement on Slide 12. Again, because of the hybrid nature of this quarter, comparability to prior year performance across most income statement line items is not particularly meaningful. We can, however, draw comparisons at the revenue and gross margin lines, if in the case of the latter, we make a sensible adjustment to exclude purchase accounting amortization and onetime items or cost of goods sold. So making this adjustment in the second quarter of 2021, non-GAAP adjusted gross profit was $1.044 billion, representing a gross margin of 65.5% compared with 71.2% in the second quarter of last year. 
The decline reflects an increase in standalone costs, including certain costs related to manufacturing agreements between Organon and Merck, which had lower gross margin percentages compared to third-party product sales. While comparisons to prior year performance are challenging, probably the most important commentary we can make about Q2 performance is that it aligns very well with the full year guidance for 2021 that we provided at our Investor Day across all line items of our P&L, from revenue down to adjusted EBITDA and including our non-GAAP effective tax rate. We'll come back to guidance in a few moments. 
A few parts on debt capitalization. At June 30, our bank debt was $9.5 billion against cash and cash equivalents of $730 million. Although this cash balance includes about $400 million of prefunded cash that will shortly be remitted back to Merck related to pre-spinoff inventory conveyance that will actually occur post separation. So more represented of net debt number is actually closer to $9.2 billion. And if we think about leverage ratios in the context of the guidance that we're affirming today and just to be illustrative, if we use the midpoint of our implied 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance, that would put our net leverage ratio just below 4x. 
We discussed our capital allocation priorities at our Investor Day in May, and I'll repeat them here today. With the recurring dividend now declare, of course, the dividend becomes capital allocation priority #1. We've endeavored to set the dividend at a low 20s percentage of free cash flow, excluding onetime cost of the separation, and this level, we believe, will be very manageable going forward. Our second priority will be organic growth, which would include life cycle management opportunities for existing products in the portfolio and capital deployed in our manufacturing plants. And on the latter, we expect to see annual CapEx in the range of 3% to 4% of revenue on an ongoing basis, excluding separation costs. 
Our third capital allocation priority is really tie between: a, execution of external growth plans to develop a pipeline of product opportunities like Jada 2.0 and ebopiprant; balanced against b, debt reduction and our commitment to maintaining our BB BA2 rating. We are targeting a long-term leverage ratio below 3.5x net to adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to guidance now on Slide 13. Today, we are affirming the guidance that we laid out at our May 3 Investor event. Revisiting the basis of presentation. Our guidance, both for the May 3 Investor event and today is non-GAAP and pro forma as if the spin-off happened on January 1. Beginning with revenue. This is the chart that we showed at Investor Day, and there's been very little change. We continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $6.1 to $6.4 billion, which is essentially all organic. We do include a de minimis partial year revenue contribution from the acquisition of Alydia Health that closed in June. The biggest component to the year-over-year change in revenue, of course, is the expected LOE impacts. 
Impact from LOE were approximately $210 million year-to-date and are primarily related to the loss of patent protection for ZETIA in Japan and NuvaRing in the United States. So far, we have not seen a generic entrant for DULERA, which lost exclusivity in 2020. So we're improving our full-year estimate of LOE impact to $300 million to $400 million -- from the $400 million to $500 million that we projected at Investor Day. 
As we were careful to describe previously, 2021 is an inflection year for Organon. After 2021, our LOE exposure dissipates to approximately $300 million cumulative over the 4-year period 2022 to 2025. Those who attend at Investor Day would know that we had said $250 million, but with DULERA now moving out of '21 into 2022, that pushes out some LOE exposure into future years. 
As far as upcoming VBP exposure, we now expect that Estradiol will most likely be included in the next round of VBP in 2022 instead of this year, as we previously expected. But we don't see that moving the needle on the $200 million to $300 million range we previously expected. 
Obviously, COVID is something we're watching closely. Year-to-date impact from COVID was about $220 million. However, as we consider lagging trends in well visits and the effect that, that has had on NEXPLANON as well as potential disruptions from the COVID-19 Delta variant, we now believe the 2021 impact from COVID could be more in line with 2020 as opposed to slightly better as we previously thought. On a yearly basis, we expect foreign exchange translation to be a modest tailwind based on year-to-date currency performance and where spot rates are currently. 
Taken on the whole, this quarter's revenue performance is well aligned with our previous guidance, and it continues to reflect the key themes that we've been talking about in our public communications prior to the spinoff. Looking through the LOE issues that are waning, we are seeing volume growth as we expected, mainly driven by our key growth businesses, women's health and biosimilars. We're also seeing volume growth geographically in China in fertility and established brands ex VBP. 
Turning now to other guidance items on Slide 14. We're affirming all of the guidance that we provided at Investor Day. We're updating shares outstanding so that it's now a fully diluted number. We expect weighted average fully diluted shares to be about $254 million for 2021. To reiterate what we said in May, we expect gross margin to be in the low to mid-60s range. We expect SG&A expense to be in the range of mid-20% of sales. We expect R&D expense to be in the mid-single-digit range as a percentage of revenue. And what this really represents is mostly R&D infrastructure and a relatively small amount of variable spend on the organic life cycle management opportunities that we're planning to undertake for products currently in the portfolio. As we fill out a pipeline, our R&D expense would rise to support these programs, and we expect some of that to occur in 2021, but not by enough to revise the guidance range that we gave previously. 
So taking all this together, that would put us on an adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 36% to 38% for 2021. We expect back half of the year margins to be well within this range based on phasing of spending. And this is primarily related to delayed spending due to COVID as well as timing of spending for life cycle management programs, the integration of Alydia Health and some other investments that we're planning that are intended to drive revenue growth in the future. 
Below the line, interest expense for 2021. Again, as if we were a standalone company since the beginning of the year, it is expected to be approximately $400 million for the year, which reflects our new debt structure as a standalone company. Depreciation is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $115 million, and we expect our ongoing non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 17.5% to 19.5%, with book and cash taxes being roughly similar. 
Wrapping up the financial discussion, the franchises are progressing, as we had expected. Given our outlook for 2021, we continue to believe that we're well positioned for future organic revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. This will be driven by stabilization in the established brand portfolio and continued growth in both women's health and biosimilars, each of which has the potential to grow at low double-digit CAGRs in the intermediate term. 
At this point, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks."

And we identified probably about 140 assets in various stages of development around the world, where we could actually use, some -- obviously, some of our balance sheet capital to be able to go out and make some meaningful acquisitions. 
So we're working because of the fact that, as I mentioned a number of times, the unmet needs are significant out there in a number of different areas for women, in areas, significantly in terms of -- or the areas specifically towards those that are predominantly affecting women.

So we feel very good about our full year revenue guidance of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion, the biggest source of variability in terms of where we land in there, I think the question -- you pointed it out was going to be where the pandemic takes us. We do believe we have a good handle on most other key drivers, whether it's [indiscernible] impact, VBP. So whether we end up at the high end or the low end, I think we'll be -- it will really be driven by the progression of the pandemic and I think where FX rates may go. 
Let's not forget, 80% of our revenues are outside the United States. We report in U.S. dollars, so there can be cases where foreign exchange translation. And this is just a -- it's a reporting impact, not an economic impact per se that can just drive our reported numbers, even though we may post our expectations in local currency.

Q2, we've got essentially 12% reported growth, and year-to-date, a 3% reported growth. Remember, 4 products, key products, the largest batch that we've had, were included into the volume-based procurement process in Q4 of 2020. And through the second quarter, we already stabilized the business, showing volume growth and revenue growth. 
We're really excited as well. Overall, the retail performance -- I mentioned a number of occasions before that the retail focus we started in 2017, seeing that VBP was going to be an issue, and right now, our performance in the retail sector in Q2 has grown almost by 30% and already accounts for nearly 45% of our established brands business in China. 
I also mentioned fertility. Fertility, by the way -- just let me take an opportunity to say this, fertility grew 70% in the second quarter. And just as a reminder, the Fertility franchise is not subject to volume-based procurement and is 100% cash-pay business. Our portfolio in China right now, 60% of the established brands business. 60% of our portfolio has gone through the volume-based procurement process. 10%, will not because it's really fertility driven. 30% is remaining. 20% of that 30% will go through in 2022. And the remaining 10% will come in the outer years, so we're very diversified. Remember, and volume-based procurement, in terms of China, no single product represents more than 20% of our business. 
So we've got very well [ represented business ]. [ We have a business that's moving forward through these challenges ] because we've got experience of it for the last 5 years. And also, we see that the future is essentially -- in terms of any exposure that we might have -- the URPS, potential exposure, which potentially happens in 2023, approximately hits -- can affect about 40% of our business there, but it's been in the forecast, discussed during our May Investor Day. It's already folded in. So we feel very good that we're on the way back to really managing the volume-based procurement process in China."

Are you constrained in being able to use it or not? That's first. 
Secondly, I know there's a lot of investor interest in figuring out what are the true growth drivers that's beyond biosimilars going forward. And one of the points I thought about is what's your ability to engage with Merck on the possibility of using the NEXPLANON device IP for substituting other women's health generic products in there to create new sort of NEXPLANON 2 and NEXPLANON 3 kind of thing, new offerings using that device, given the physician comfort with that device. Can you speak to that in any programs ongoing? 
And then finally, where are you guys on the MICROSPHERIX versus NEXPLANON IP side? I know you've lost a couple of cases, but it's also been my sense that there's starting to be an alignment. And at least on part of those patents you guys have been able to settle, should we expect MICROSPHERIX to be a nonissue to NEXPLANON from a damages perspective going forward?"

So from a business development perspective, of course, we're always looking for what we feel is going to be really an important contributor to this type of business [ of fertility ]. We are, though, executing currently exactly on our strategy, which is essentially, as I mentioned to you before, there are a number of assets out there that are really looking for a home because there's significant unmet need. And we believe we can start to be an aggregator in some of these women's health assets that are unique in terms of what they provide or solutions for some of the significant unmet needs that women face around the world. 
And so right now, the way that we've executed on that strategy is what I believe is spot on to what we wanted to do. It's really kind of -- look, we're 2 months into our launch, and our spend, we've already done 2 deals. Well, that really shows our seriousness. But of course, to your point, it's one thing really attractive with the right valuation and the right focus and the right [ price ], of course, we're going to look at it seriously. But nothing of that nature is something that we're considering right now. We're considering more of the same with what you've seen from us over the first 2 months. 
In terms of NEXPLANON raw technology, of course, we always -- we're in very close coordination with our Merck colleagues. And right now, we don't have anything in the pipeline in terms of focusing on using that raw technology for anything else than what we're doing today, which is essentially moving from 3 years to 5 years is our focus right now in our life cycle management development for NEXPLANON. We hope that, that will give us an opportunity to extend the life of NEXPLANON to 2030, which will really make it available to many more women who really need and want something for that long in the horizon of efficacy for 5 years. 
Finally, in terms of what's happening in MICROSPHERIX, I think we feel very solid and very good. Obviously, I can't comment on ongoing litigation, but we feel very good with our position there, and we have a very strong case. As I said, we'd like to wind that down in the not-too-distant future, but we feel very good and very confident about where we stand right now with that potential issue."

Welcome to today's call where we will talk about our first full quarter as a stand-alone company. Also, as today is Veterans Day in the U.S. and Remembrance Day in other parts of the world, we would like to thank all of those who have served, especially our own employee veterans. 
Let me start by saying I continue to be inspired by the commitment of our employees across the world. They are unified in the dedication to our vision, creating a better and healthier every day for every woman. Already, less than 6 months after spinning into an independent company, we are delivering on our corporate and financial goals. 
Our year-to-date results have shaped up very much in line with our expectations with third quarter revenues of $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $636 million. And with about 7 weeks left in 2021, we have good visibility into the performance of each of our key 3 franchises for the remainder of the year. Accordingly, we affirmed our guidance and narrowed the ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin for full year 2021, which Matt will discuss with all of you shortly. 
Importantly, we have been active on the business development front, as we told you we would be. We have executed 3 transactions in the last 6 months. This underscores our stated commitment to deliver health care interventions that address unmet and undermet needs in women's health. We're partnering with or acquiring companies to advance true innovation, something that has been woefully lacking in the area of women's health. 
Today, we announced our proposed acquisition of Forendo, a clinical stage drug development company focused on novel treatments in women's health. This acquisition brings a pipeline of candidates, including a lead candidate for endometriosis and a secondary candidate in polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS. 
Endometriosis is a high priority unmet need for us. It affects up to 170 million patients or up to 10% of all women of reproductive age. The current therapies and development candidates target the pain associated with endometriosis but do not address disease progression. Existing treatments also often lead to systemic estrogen depletion, which impacts bone metal density and triggers menopausal symptoms. Such treatments are, therefore, unsuitable beyond short-term use in premenopausal women. 
Completing the acquisition of Forendo will be another step in building our end-to-end women's health portfolio. It joins our other recent additions, including Alydia Health and its Jada System, which Organon acquired in June of this year. The Jada System is aimed at controlling abnormal post-partum bleeding or hemorrhage, one of the most common complications of birth impacting up to 10% of mothers and potentially resulting in emergency interventions such as hysterectomy and blood transfusions. 
In July, we also announced the licensing of the global development manufacturing and commercial rights to an investigational agent, ebopiprant from ObsEva. Ebopiprant is currently being studied as a first-in-class innovation for the treatment of preterm labor, which impacts an estimated 15 million babies or about 11% of all babies born globally. These acquisitions are tightly aligned with our goal to be the leader in women's health by addressing the significant unmet needs of women. We have quickly expanded beyond contraception and fertility, where we are well established and already hold leading market share positions. 
I want to turn my attention to fertility, where we saw revenue growth of approximately 30% year-to-date x FX. We don't believe the opportunity for the products in our fertility portfolio, FOLLISTIM, ORGALUTRAN and ELONVA are always well understood. These products are used in the patient-friendly GnRH antagonist protocol, which requires few injections and is favored in conjunction with egg and embryo freezing globally and fertility rates are increasing. We have seen the average age for giving birth to a first child increase from 20 years -- 21 years old in 1970 to 29 years old today. About 15% of couples worldwide experience infertility, impacting almost 190 million people. These figures are impacted by women proactively choosing to delay parenthood until an optimal time due to advances in modern fertility protocols and egg and embryo freezing technology. 
Governments are recognizing fertility rates are not just a personal family planning issue but also have an impact on GDP. And in 100 countries, birth rates are now below 2.1, the level needed to maintain the population. Low birth rates are a growing threat to some very large economies such as China, the U.S. and Japan, triggering public sector responses that serve as structural tailwinds for fertility treatment. Recently, China introduced the 3-child policy. Next year, Japan will introduce reimbursement for IVF treatments, and the French, Swiss and Spanish governments recently passed bills allowing egg freezing and IVF treatments for same-sex couples. 
These recent changes are just the beginning of providing equal access to reproductive assistance. Government interest in increasing fertility rates and changing laws on access to reproductive assistance makes us optimistic for the growing prospects of our fertility portfolio. 
Let's talk now about contraception and NEXPLANON, the #2 contraceptive worldwide by revenue. We believe NEXPLANON and or LARC, or long-acting reversible contraceptive, has blockbuster potential. Historically, there has been a sustained shift in the hormonal contraception market away from the daily combined oral contraceptive segment towards LARCs. LARCs are highly efficacious and considered to be one of the most effective forms of hormonal contraception. 
Implanon or Implanon NXT, as it's known in some markets, is differentiated even within the large segment. It is the only single rod subdermal long-acting reversible contraceptive comprised of a progesterone-only rod inserted in a woman's upper arm. Average insertion time takes about a minute. 
Historically, NEXPLANON sales have been highly correlated with well visits, and logically, the pandemic dampened our ability to reach health care providers and patients, especially in the U.S. However, as the pandemic is slowly receding, we are seeing improvements in recent weeks. Additionally, since NEXPLANON has been in our hands, we have been aggressively working to modernizing the brand's marketing and our operating model. This has included a direct-to-consumer education campaign in television and social media with digital campaigns to drive traffic to our revamped websites, where patients can find health care professionals by zip code trained in NEXPLANON insertion. This was complemented by targeted bespoke campaigns aimed at specific patient segments. 
Additionally, our clinical training programs ramped up quickly once providers' offices reopened. We trained over 7,500 health care professionals in the third quarter alone, which is above our pre-pandemic baseline levels, and we trade over 6,000 health care professionals in Q2. This is a steep ramp -- a ramp-up from the 2,000 that were trained in Q1. And  we believe it's contributing to increasing demand, and we are very encouraged by the results of these programs, especially given we're less than 6 months into this journey. We continue to feel very positive about NEXPLANON path, particularly now midway through the fourth quarter. 
Now let's talk about biosimilars, which has grown 30% year-to-date and where we are well positioned with our commercial strategy. In the U.S., our 2 offerings are: RENFLEXIS, or infliximab biosimilar; and ONTRUZANT, our trastuzumab biosimilar. The infliximab market continues to grow every year, and RENFLEXIS has benefited from that tailwind with sales still growing even 4 years after launch. The trastuzumab market has some of the highest adoption rates, about 70% among biosimilars, and the uptake of ONTRUZANT in the U.S. continues to show unit growth since its launch last year. 
Outside the U.S., our recent launches of HADLIMA in Australia and Canada have been performing exceptionally well. We also continue to evaluate other potential pipeline opportunities with Samsung as well as other developers as we pursue the potential opportunity to present it by the estimated $100 billion plus of blockbuster biologics going off-patent over the next decade. 
As we now turn our attention to Established Brands, I'll repeat what I said last quarter. Part of the strategic timing of our spend is that 2021 is an inflection year. It is the last year during which the portfolio is subject to significant new LOE risk. Beyond 2021, the impact from the LOE decreases significantly. This portfolio of 49 products is comprised of brands with significant customer loyalty that tend to respond well to promotion. For example, in China, our retail business now representing almost 50% of our China Established Brands revenue continues to grow strong double digits because of brand loyalty, offsetting the impact of the volume-based procurement program, or VBP and positioning Organon for sustainable growth in China post VBP. 
Importantly, we are taking a very entrepreneurial view of this portfolio and have uncovered a number of accretive opportunities within our existing portfolio. For example, we anticipate taking NASONEX, OTC and Russia, with that launch planned for early next year. 
All 3 franchises are global businesses, as you will see on Slide 7. There are several areas I want to highlight about our business geographically. The decline in Asia Pacific is primarily related to ZETIA's loss of exclusivity in Japan. In the U.S., the LOE from NUVARING as well as NEXPLANON performance through the pandemic were factors. However, importantly, we continue to grow in China despite 4 of our products being included in the volume-based procurement process in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Revenue from China is up 4% x FX this quarter driven by the respiratory market recovering from the COVID impact in 2020, the favorable positioning of our fertility portfolio and continued contribution from the retail channel. I'd like to turn it over to Matt to discuss our third quarter performance in more detail."

On the plus side, our third quarter results marked the first time that Organon is reported [Audio Gap] discussed in last quarter's call, our results prior to the June 2 spin off date are presented on the carve-out basis of accounting. Carve-out accounting is a GAAP convention which has a lot of positives. However, it's not intended to present results as if Organon were a stand-alone company. So I want to be clear as we discuss results for this quarter and for the next 3 quarters that any comparisons to prior year periods will be somewhat apples to oranges and that we'll be comparing Organon's stand-alone performance to pre-spin carve-out basis of the county. With that said, where we'll have the best comparability is at the revenue line. So I'll be focusing attention at the top line as we discuss our performance. 
So turning to Slide 8. Revenue for the third quarter was $1.6 billion down 1% as reported and down about 3% at constant currency exchange rates when compared to the third quarter of last year. In this graphic, we break out the change in revenue according to key drivers, and I'll highlight some of the more significant impacts. The impact of loss of exclusivity, or LOE, during the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year is approximately $70 million, and it's primarily related to the LOE of ZETIA in Japan and NUVARING LOE in the United States. 
Continuing to read across the waterfall chart, the Established Brands portfolio has exposure to VBP in China. The total impact to sales for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year was approximately $60 million and was associated with the third round of VBP, the largest round so far, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 and that included 4 of Organon's products: SINGULAIR pediatrics, PROSCAR, PROPECIA and Arcoxia. 
In the third quarter of 2021, the negative impact of COVID-19 was estimated to be approximately $100 million, which is about $20 million above Q3 of last year. Our product portfolio is comprised of physician prescribed products, which have been affected by the shortage of qualified personnel, social distancing measures and delayed medical visits. 
In the third quarter, we continued to see lingering effects from COVID as compared to the year ago quarter, including, as Kevin just mentioned, a slower return of well visits, which particularly impacts NEXPLANON. We continue to observe restrictive measures, which vary by country and region. So we expect to see some further lingering negative impacts from COVID persisting into the fourth quarter, although we believe we're starting to see encouraging trend development in U.S. NEXPLANON early in the fourth quarter, which could be pointing to stronger sequential performance in Q4 versus Q3. 
Foreign exchange translation had about 200 basis points of favorability for the quarter. Year-to-date, that impact is more pronounced at about 350 basis points, which is not really surprising given the impact of COVID-19 on global currency markets in the prior year period and also understanding that about 75% of our revenue is derived outside the United States. And finally, on the plus side, we saw a volume growth in Q3 mainly driven by growth in China, in U.S. biosimilars and in Europe with Established Brands. 
So now let's take a look at performance by franchise, and we'll start with women's health on Slide 9. Our women's health business was down 10% as reported and 11% in constant currency in the third quarter versus the prior year. NEXPLANON declined 8% x FX in the quarter. As Kevin mentioned, well visits are not yet back to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S., and NEXPLANON sales are largely tied to that metric. 
So we know the question on investors' minds is can NEXPLANON have a $200 million revenue quarter in Q4. And while we don't provide specific guidance by product, this question is important enough to address and provide you at least a directional answer. And based on current visibility into the data that we're looking at, we do see fourth quarter as being favorable for U.S. NEXPLANON. 
There's 3 reasons why. Reason number one goes back to the quarter just completed. Third quarter negative growth should be considered in the context of Q3 2020 being a tough comp from the standpoint that, in September of last year, even though we were in the pandemic, we saw a short-lived resurgence in patient well visits that positively impacted third quarter 2020 NEXPLANON sales. There has been volatility in the trend of patient OB/GYN well visits over the last year. But for the third quarter of last year, those visits were almost back to a pre-COVID baseline and Q3 2020 NEXPLANON sales were the highest since the start of the pandemic. So the message here is that the third quarter of 2020 was a tough comp for NEXPLANON. 
Second reason goes to phasing of revenues within this year. There was a tender that we were expecting in the third quarter in Mexico that was delayed and has now become signed business for us in the fourth quarter. 
Third and final reason goes back to what Kevin said about our next NEXPLANON DTC campaign in the United States, which began running this summer. It's starting to show results now as well as other new digital campaigns that are raising brand awareness for NEXPLANON and driving sizable increases in our website traffic by potential new users. 
Beyond NEXPLANON, also pressuring women's health this quarter was the continuing and expected decline in NUVARING down 17% x FX in the quarter, relates to increased generic penetration as a result of the product's LOE in 2018 in the U.S. On a positive note, our fertility portfolio continues to show strength.  FOLLISTIM grew 18% x FX in the quarter. Volume growth came from an increase in demand from new accounts as well as from patients returning to clinics. And our observation has been that patients seeking fertility treatments are more motivated to return to doctors' offices than those patients seeking normal course OB/GYN well visits. 
Turning to biosimilars on Slide 10. Biosimilars grew 41% as reported in the third quarter and 39% x FX. We have 5 assets in the portfolio, 3 in immunology and 2 in oncology. RENFLEXIS and ONTRUZANT are our 2 largest offerings, and both are offered in the U.S. Globally, RENFLEXIS grew 43% x FX in the quarter driven by strong performance in the U.S. And ONTRUZANT, which was launched in the U.S. in July of last year, was up 47%. The biosimilars business outside the U.S., which represents about half of our total biosimilars revenue, is tender-driven and, therefore, it's more price sensitive. And timing of tenders can also make this business somewhat lumpy, and we benefited from that in the third quarter. So while we are coming off 2 quarters of about 40% year-on-year revenue growth in biosimilars, we see some moderation of that growth rate for the remainder of 2021, resulting in solid double-digit revenue growth year-on-year. 
I now turn to Established Brands on Slide 11. Revenue for Established Brands was down 6% as reported and 8% ex FX in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the impacts of LOE, revenue was down 4% x FX. Volumes were up incrementally mainly driven by COVID rebound, although not as strong as it was in Q2, as well as growth in China retail. Price was down about 5% across the Established Brands portfolio. And given that this is a portfolio of medicines that, for the most part, are well beyond their LOEs, it may be counterintuitive to investors to hear that, in the third quarter, more than 50% Of Established Brands' revenue came from products for which volumes grew. These brands are well known. They respond to promotion, and we're actively managing life cycle opportunities across the portfolio. These factors support our May Investor Day discussion that we expect erosion in this portfolio to be in the low single-digit area x LOE over the intermediate term. 
China. China is an important market for established brands. And part of our strategy in this market has been to drive volumes into the retail channel versus our historical presence in the hospital channel, and this effort continues to be successful. The retail channel in China grew 20% in the third quarter versus prior year and now represents almost 50% of Established Brands revenue in China, up from approximately 35% a year ago. 
Now turning to our income statement on Slide 12. Our GAAP income statement for Q3 and year-to-date are available in our earnings release, and I encourage investors to look at that important information. 
Here on Slide 12, we'll be looking at our non-GAAP income statement for these same time periods. For gross margins, we're excluding purchase accounting amortization and onetime items related to the spin-off from cost of goods sold. So making these straightforward adjustments in the third quarter of 2021, non-GAAP adjusted gross profit was $1 billion, representing gross margin of 64.9% compared with 68.6% in the third quarter of 2020. The decline reflects costs associated with standing up Organon as an independent company, including certain costs related to manufacturing agreements between Organon and Merck, which have lower gross margin percentages compared to product sales. Those manufacturing agreements had an approximate 180 basis point negative impact to gross margins in the third quarter. 
Also included in cost of goods sold this quarter was a $24 million onetime cost related to estimated losses associated with the vendor supply contract conveyed as part of the spin, which had a 160 basis point negative impact to gross margins. There were some spin-related accounting items that partially offset this unfavorability but this quarter's gross margin is a good example actually of where we had apples-and-oranges comparability issues with prior year comparisons and why our 2021 guidance becomes a much more useful yardstick for investors. That said, our gross margin for the third quarter was squarely aligned with the guidance that we've communicated in the low to mid-60% range. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.8% in the third quarter, which brings year-to-date margins to 38.9%. We had told you last quarter that we expected second half EBITDA margins to be lower than the first half. The reason why our EBITDA margins are running stronger than we forecasted is driven by lower operating expenses, and this is mainly timing related. We're onboarding our stand-alone operating expenses a bit more slowly than we thought in headcount costs, as well as promotional spending in certain markets. 
And if you're doing back-of-the-envelope math, you'd likely draw the conclusion that Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin would have to be markedly lower than year-to-date for us to finish within the EBITDA margin guidance range that we'll be discussing shortly. So we do expect operating expenses to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter as the pace of onboarding some of these expenses speeds up going into year-end. Given the strong EBITDA performance in Q3, we did consider raising the adjusted EBITDA margin guidance range for the full year but it would have been by a relatively small amount. So instead, we elected to just narrow the range and communicate to you a high and improved level of confidence in the guidance that we are affirming. 
A few words on debt capitalization on Slide 13. At September 30, our bank debt was $9.3 billion against cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion. Now embedded in that cash balance is approximately $320 million that is earmarked for finished goods inventory purchases from our former parent that's really related to the spin-off transaction. So a more representative net debt number as of September 30 and is closer to $8.6 billion. If we use the implied midpoint of our 2021 EBITDA guidance just for illustrative purposes, that would put our pro forma net leverage at about 3.7x, which is a modest improvement in leverage ratio compared sequentially to last quarter. 
And one more item here, our imputed cash flow for the third quarter is a good indicator that we are meeting our pre-spin forecasting and is representative of the cash-generating power of this business. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what we laid out in our pre-spin-off communications, and we are reiterating them today. 
Now that our Board has established a dividend, the dividend becomes our first priority. We're targeting the dividend at a low 20s percentage of free cash flow excluding onetime costs of the separation, a level of which we believe is very manageable. Our second priority will be organic growth. and that would include life cycle management opportunities for existing products within our portfolio, supported by capital deployed in our manufacturing plants. And on the latter, we expect to see annual CapEx in the range of 3% to 4% of revenue on an ongoing basis, once again, excluding separation costs. 
Our third priority for capital allocation is really a tie. It's a tie between, a, execution of external growth plans to develop a pipeline of new product opportunities like you've seen us announce already, Alydia Health and the Jada System, investigation of ebopiprant for preterm labor and now Forendo targeting endometriosis. We'll balance that against, b, debt reduction and our commitment to maintaining our BB, Ba2 parent rating. We are targeting a long-term leverage ratio below 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to guidance on Slide 14. Consistent with previous communications, this guidance is all non-GAAP and pro forma is that the spinoff happened on January 1 of this year. Beginning with revenue, this is a chart we showed at Investor Day, and changes since then have really been at the margin. Based on where we are in the year, we're narrowing our full year 2021 revenue range from $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion to $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion. This revenue is essentially all organic. We do include a de minimis partial year revenue contribution from the acquisition of Alydia Health. 
The biggest component to the year-over-year change in revenue is the expected LOE impacts. Impacts from LOE were approximately $280 million year-to-date and primarily related to the loss of patent protection for ZETIA in Japan and NUVARING in the U.S. We continue to expect a full year LOE impact of approximately $300 million to $400 million. As we've been careful to describe previously, 2021 is an inflection year for Organon as regards LOE impacts. After 2021, our LOE exposure dissipates to approximately $300 million cumulatively over the next 4 years combined, 2022 through year-end 2025. 
We now think our VBP exposure in China for the year will be on the low end of the $200 million to $300 million range we previously communicated. Year-to-date exposure has been about $150 million and we have a fairly good understanding of what will be included in the next round of VBP, which is likely to include EZETROL, HYZAAR and NASONEX. 
Now COVID is something that we're obviously watching very closely. We updated our view on COVID impact last quarter to expect that our total year impact from COVID in 2021 would be about even with what we experienced in 2020, which was about $400 million. Year-to-date 2021 impact from COVID was $320 million. And given the recent trends that we've seen in NEXPLANON prescriptions, which is the product where we see the most lingering COVID impact, we are comfortable with that implied estimate of about $80 million of COVID impact in the fourth quarter. 
On a yearly basis, we expect foreign exchange translation to be a modest tailwind based on year-to-date currency performance and where spot rates are currently. And finally, for performance, we've tweaked this bucket down in here, and this is mostly tied to my earlier commentary on biosimilars and the lumpiness of tenders quarter-to-quarter. 
Taken as a whole, year-to-date revenue performance is largely to be expected despite the uncertainties introduced by COVID. The key themes that we've been talking about in our public communications prior to spin-off and since the spin-off remains very much intact, and those are: lOE issues that are waiting; women's health, especially fertility; and biosimilars that are delivering growth; and China that's performing very well despite VBP headwinds. 
Turning to other guidance metrics on Slide 15. The message here is that for all the items shown, we're affirming prior guidance for most metrics. And for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, we're simply narrowing the ranges in light of where we are in the fiscal year. Reiterating the point I made earlier, during 2021, we've onboarded operating expenses more deliberately than we had forecasted. We're not yet at our run rate for SG&A expense as an independent company. We know R&D expense will be increasing in 2022 and beyond as we add pipeline assets. And I say this more as we start to look forward to next fiscal year, and we will provide quantitative guidance for 2022 when we report our full year 2021 results in February. 
Wrapping up the financial discussion, the franchises are progressing as we had expected. And given our outlook for 2021, we continue to believe that we're well positioned for future organic revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. This will be driven by stabilization in the Established Brands portfolio and continued growth in both women's health and biosimilars, each of which has the potential to grow at low double-digit CAGRs in the intermediate term. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks."

Further, as the pandemic starts to recede, we have doubled down on our operational investments behind NEXPLANON in the U.S. to ensure that we meet her where she is. And we have started to see very positive impact of those investments in the first weeks of the fourth quarter. We've been very disciplined in our business development plans and have action on 3 attractive assets. 2 of them are earlier stage products with significant downstream opportunities as well as the recently commercialized device in Jada, which is helping to address a significant unmet need.

I guess, given some of the comments you're making about the timing of onboarding and the R&D step-up, can you just directionally help us -- I know [ '22 ], you're not giving formal guidance yet. I guess at a high level, I guess, I'm assuming we shouldn't use 4Q as a run rate for margins. But when we think about full year margins for next year, is it fair to think about us coming down a bit from '21 as, again, it sounds like SG&A comes up, R&D comes up. So just any directional color there, I think, would be very much appreciated. 
And then my second question was just on the pipeline build-out. You've done 3 deals this year. Should we think about these type of transactions, which it seemed like there's some R&D elements to them. They seem a bit smaller in size is kind of the sweet spot in terms of acquisitions, both near and long term. Or do we think about deals starting to skew towards larger transactions as you delever? So I'm trying to sense of like if there wasn't capital constraints right now, would you be also mixing in some larger deals? Or again, is this -- these type of transactions more than go forward to think about?"

I want to be clear on that. directionally though, providing maybe some bumpers. I think the comment that you made -- well, let's back up and just repeat some of the prepared comments, which were geared to start to address this question, which is we know that R&D expense will be increasing in 2022 to support pipeline assets. This is, we believe, very important for the future, sustainable revenue growth of the company. So you'll see R&D expenses increasing. 
We've been very careful about how we are adding costs at the SG&A line to reach out what we believe our run rate -- every dollar that we're adding, we're analyzing it very carefully. So that said, you had said, Chris, it looks like 2022 EBITDA margin was likely to be below what you're guiding for in 2021. I think directionally, that's a fair statement. You also said how should we think about the fourth quarter EBITDA margin in the context of 2022. It might not be as low as that, I think that's directionally accurate. Now I think it probably makes sense to just stop there at this point, and we'll be providing quantitative very, very transparent guidance in February."

So we've been very disciplined, exceptionally disciplined in the way that we've looked at our business development portfolio. We did signal early on in the Investment Day that we were going to kind of using baseball parts kind of go after singles and doubles because we do -- we saw opportunities like, for example, with Jada to solve a significant unmet need in postpartum hemorrhage. We saw an opportunity with ObsEva's product with preterm labor, a significant unmet need today in that world. And now we are very excited about the Forendo acquisition because they bring a new mechanism of action to treat a significant issue around the world, which is endometriosis affecting really 170 people -- 70 million women across the world. 
So we see great opportunities there. I've mentioned before there's about 140 assets out there in various stages of development. But having said that, let me be clear, we're not saying no to larger deals. We're not saying no to essentially anything that we believe could be accretive ultimately down the road for Organon. We are open to whatever is actually going to be working best for us as a company. And so -- but right now, what we see is opportunities that are really what we consider low-hanging fruit to go after in order to be able to really round out our portfolio and be a leader in women's health."

It's a very important question in regards to the performance of NEXPLANON. Look, I mean the thing to keep in mind is the fact that we truly believe that NEXPLANON will be a blockbuster for all of us. We have patent prot",626,"So let me take that first question. It's a very important question in regards to the performance of NEXPLANON. Look, I mean the thing to keep in mind is the fact that we truly believe that NEXPLANON will be a blockbuster for all of us. We have patent protection until 2027 with an opportunity to extend it to 2030 as we start to round out and look at our 5-year extension data that will possibly come through and report out in the 2025 time frame. 
Having said that, we have invested really truly invested in the operational opportunities in the U.S. And I'd like to point out 3 key investments. And then, ultimately, I'm going to lead to answering your question by -- after going through that. Clinical training programs, these are essentially -- just to keep you in mind that physicians or health care providers need to be certified and trained on how to insert and remove a NEXPLANON in order to be able to prescribe the product. 
Prior to the pandemic, Merck averaged about 18,000 certifications per year. Since spin, that would essentially be June through September, we've done 10,000 certifications. We're essentially averaging in the second and third quarters nearly 13,500 certifications. That is a significant proxy for NEXPLANON uptake and performance going forward. direct-to-consumer marketing. We've invested in the direct-to-consumer, initiated a TV and social media campaign with a well-known celebrity and more importantly real-world users of NEXPLANON. 
2 observations. Unaided awareness of NEXPLANON has increased when compared to the prior 3 months, and our organic searches for NEXPLANON information have increased as we have made significant -- really significant improvements and enhancements to our nexplanon.com site where we expect to see about 7 million visitors uniquely every year. 
Finally, representative activities as the COVID pandemic recedes. Over the last 3 quarters of 2021 versus the 3 quarters of 2020, our representative calls face to face have increased by 60%. All of that is leading to the fact that right now, in the first 5 weeks of performance of the first -- of Q4, we see sales distributors have increased strong double digits strong double digits. We expect the fourth quarter to be a very strong quarter for us in NEXPLANON. And ultimately, as I've always been saying, as we start to invest in senior management attention, as we start to invest in some of these programs, we will see NEXPLANON just from the sheer fact of the matter, what it can represent in dealing with unintended pregnancies in the U.S. and beyond start to really ramp up and start to go back to that double-digit performance that we expect of it. 
And on the second part of your question regarding free cash flow. The reason why we included Slide 13 of the earnings deck and the format that we did was so that investors would be able to triangulate back to what third quarter operating cash flow was in free cash flow. And so now the question is, is that figure for operating cash flow, is it representative. And I would tell you that there are one-timers that are running through that, but they're going in both directions. Some good guys and some bad guys use colloquial terms that we use within the company, but they're netting out so that the Q3 operating cash flow figure that we're looking at is really pretty representative of what the company should do. And I put that in my prepared comments to say that the cash flow generating performance in Q3 is well aligned with what we had forecasted. So that much I can say for this fiscal year, and I'll refrain from making any free cash flow commentary for 2022 at this point."

And secondly, can you also speak to any ECG changes and/or hypertension with this molecule so far? Third, perhaps just the selectivity for 17B HSV-1 versus sort of 11 beta or other ones? And finally, would you potentially intend to develop it in oncology indications as well?"

And I will say that, first of all, we are truly excited about the Forendo announcement and potential acquisition going forward. I mean it does -- I mean when you think about endometriosis, it's really underresearched, underfunded and misunderstood with essentially an average of 8 to 10 years before a woman is actually diagnosed with the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
In regards to your questions on endometrial thickness, we're still -- we're just starting our Phase II proof-of-concept studies. We expect to report out in the 2024-2025 range with commercialization of this product, if all goes well, knock on wood, by the 2027-2028 time frame. It is something that we need to get back to you as we start to kind of go down deep in terms of understanding exactly the data in that respect. We can return back to you on that. But just to say this, currently, as you know, the treatment of endometriosis is really relied on pain medication and managing the symptoms in regards to  endometriosis not necessarily the underlying issues that are essentially causing the problem. 
GnRHs, for example, acts systemically at the pituitary level, cutting off all signals to female -- to the female reproductive system, which basically is plunging limit into menopause and really causing all kinds of bone metal density issues. So that's why it's really short-term usage. For 6219, it's really targeting the  estradiol pathway, essentially targeting only impacting -- estradiol conversion process, and that process is exclusively responsible for endometriosis. And ultimately, all of the sequelae when you see in terms of inflammation and all the things regarding the pain and bleeding all the issues go on. 
So we feel very excited about this mechanism. It is a potential, and I underscore potential for disease modification as well as managing the symptoms of endometriosis are really at the sight of where it really needs to be addressed. In terms of endometrial thickness and in terms of any ECG or any cardiovascular issues, we'll get back to you in terms of as we start to be able to get a better insight in terms of the data."

First, under the drug price reform proposal, reimbursement for Part B drugs would go from ASP plus 6 to ASP plus $1,000. This would seem to potentially encourage prescribing biosimilars over more expensive brand drugs. Can you put some numbers on it -- on that? To what extent could biosimilar usage increase by simply reimbursement changes? Or do you think that that's not correct, that biosimilar use will not be encouraged by any reimbursement change? 
Second question is on the acquisition of Forendo. The total consideration of $954 million seems strikingly high. How would -- how much is that attributable to the lead asset versus the follow-ons? And what happens with the existing collaboration with Novartis for chronic liver disease? 
And then lastly, the observation. For a company that has a core strategy of business development, I'm surprised that business development is third or even last on the capital allocation priority list. So that's it."
653748561,1686394193,2435207,"Organon & Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2021",2021-11-11,"Earnings Calls","Organon & Co.","Executives","So let's take the capital allocation question first.

So the business generates strong cash flow today. The collective view of our former parent, Merck, our Board of Directors, is that investors should be able to share in that cash flow in real time and that the valuation of the company at a very sensitive time around the spin was that the dividend would be an important consideration in achieving the right value on the company. So that was the reason for the institution of the dividend. And of course, once it's in, it does become the #1 priority. 
The reason why organic growth projects come in #2, Steve, is because these are products that are already in the portfolio. They've got a demonstrated track record of safety and performance. And so simply introducing these products in new markets or potentially for adjacent indications are generally de-risked investment opportunities and have very, very attractive risk-adjusted returns. And I would also add it's not a big consumer of capital in the overall scheme of things. 
So with the dividend being a relatively modest and manageable number, with the organic growth plans being derisked and also modest and manageable, that still leaves really a substantial amount of our available operating cash flow, free cash flow available to pursue the business development agenda. So I hope that explanation makes sense. 
In terms of the economics around the Forendo deal, of the number that you cited in terms of total consideration, $600 million of that are commercial milestones. So the product has to be successful commercially for most of the value of the deal to be realized. And the consideration is about $84 million upfront and then approximately $270 million of clinical milestones. So we did wait the deal to be back-ended and dependent as much as we could justify commercial success of the product. And yes, most of the value has been ascribed to the lead candidate. 
And I think your last question was on biosimilars. And we do view the current dialogue in Washington as very positive for biosimilars, Steve. And it's difficult to quantify the impact for Organon at this point. It'll certainly be articulated when we provide guidance for 2022, but we do see the dialogue in Washington as being favorable for our portfolio of biosimilar products."

Prior to",387,"Yes. So Charlie, I think that those are good questions. Let me take the NEXPLANON first. As we've said in our last May in our Investor Day, we believe that NEXPLANON is poised for strong double-digit growth. It was a double-digit growing product. Prior to the pandemic, we believe that, that will continue to be the case. As soon as clinics start to open up as they are reopening now and staffs are coming back online, that's what kind of why we made the investments we did in things like clinical training programs, direct-to-consumer marketing, all the rep activities that are ongoing right now and many other things that we're doing right now in the space. 
Keep in mind, that NEXPLANON really only has about 5% market share. So there's tremendous room for growth going forward. And we do have patent protection for some time in order to build this product out. It will be a $1 billion product for us. We feel very sure about that. And as I mentioned, first half of the fourth quarter looks very strong for NEXPLANON, which is -- again, it's tied to the fact that as women go back into the clinics right now, there's opportunities to really be able to utilize NEXPLANON in a manner by which kind of comes along with our vision of double-digit growth for this product and blockbuster potential. 
In regards to the second point, I think you were mentioning in terms of price volume activity around HUMIRA biosimilars. Look, we expect unlike, say, for example, hospital products like infliximab is and REMICADE, where the price tends to move kind of a lumpy fashion hospital-by-hospital, account by account. We do expect that it's going to move very quickly, not like small molecule erosion, but nevertheless, it's going to move fairly quickly in terms of price erosion with the loss of exclusivity of HUMIRA and moving forward in 2023 as you start to see all the launches of biosimilars. And you're going to probably see anywhere between 7 to 8 biosimilar launches in the first, say, year opportunities for biosimilars to come in. So we'll see, I think, significant erosion. Again, nothing like the small molecule type of erosion, but nothing like that you see, for example, in a hospital dispense biosimilars that you see today."

And then the second question I have is on x U.S. Established Brands. Is there a good way to think about what may be steady state pricing erosion, if there is any at all? Could be over the long term?

Look, the way that we've really looked at this market, and let's just take Had limo or rather the HUMIRA biosimilars, you're right, Boehri",365,"Okay, David. Let me take the first question in regards to interchangeability because I know it's coming up recently. Look, the way that we've really looked at this market, and let's just take Had limo or rather the HUMIRA biosimilars, you're right, Boehringer does have a low-dose interchangeability study that they've done. That represents a very small segment of the market. The majority of the market is in high dose, the high-dose segment. 
So really, the following variables, we believe, are very important. Order of entry, again, is very important, and we're still planning to be the second to the market in June 2023. The high-dose citrate-free formulation is exceptionally important because that is essentially what the dominant form is today with AbbVie's product. Real-world experience, and we have that from successful launches in Europe, Canada and Australia for our HUMIRA biosimilar, HADLIMA, which -- where we've launched that product in those places. Quality. Quality product from a manufacturing partner, you can rest assured, it's got top line quality manufacturing, like, for example, Samsung Bioepis. 
But having said that, our thinking around interchangeability, especially interchangeability in a high-dose citrate preform is evolving. And we're in very active discussions with our partner in Samsung right now. And we will take a decision shortly in terms of what needs to be done in that space. But we are going to be very competitive. We're not going to be essentially a company that's going to have all the right variables to launch and succeed in this segment because it's an important area for us and not be competitive in regards to competitive pressures from other companies. 
But keep in mind, there are no -- no company is perfectly positioned. As we look today in terms of being kind of early launching with high concentration citrate-free dose, also having interchangeability designation for high concentration at launch, nobody's got that. So essentially, it's going to be that we launch with what we have. And then ultimately, you'll see later post launch as many of the other competitors are stating the interchangeability indication coming through. And in regards to Established Brands, what we do see -- let's have Matt address that."

Women's health driven by NEXPLANON and fertility remains positioned to deliver double-digit growth over the intermediate period, plus we're making the changes necessary to build the foundation for continued growth going forward. 
Year-to-date, biosimilars are already delivering double-digit growth, and we expect that to happen over the planning period. We are stabilizing the Established Brands business with volume increases in more than 50% of our products, and we believe we have a pathway to sustain performance over the coming years. This portfolio serves as a cash generator, contributing to the free cash flow that Matt referenced, enabling us to build out our pipeline with targeted and disciplined business development and life cycle management activities focused on our company's purpose to address significant unmet medical needs in women's health. 
With our 3 deals in the past 6 months, we have lost no time in tackling areas where new innovation is sorely needed. We have commercialized the Jada device to address postpartum hemorrhage, launched in the U.S. with plans to bring it to the rest of the world as quickly as possible. We've licensed ObsEva's investigational preterm labor agent, a new mechanism of action in a space with few options. And our existing deal announced today -- our exciting deal announced today, the proposed acquisition of Forendo brings an early-stage asset with new mechanism of action being studied for endometriosis plus an earlier-stage asset for PCOS. 
In addition, we have a number of life cycle management opportunities underway, including the potential for a NEXPLANON 5-year label extension and many, many more. overall, our company is shaping up just as we planned, sustainable, predictable and on strategy.

Also, as today is Veterans Day in the U.S. and Remembrance Day in other parts of the world, we would like to thank all of those who have served, especially our own employee veterans.  
Let me start by saying I continue to be inspired by the commitment of our employees across the world. They are unified in the dedication to our vision, creating a better and healthier every day for every woman. Already, less than 6 months after spinning into an independent company, we are delivering on our corporate and financial goals. Our year-to-date results have shaped up very much in line with our expectations with third quarter revenues of $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $636 million. And with about 7 weeks left in 2021, we have good visibility into the performance of each of our key 3 franchises for the remainder of the year. Accordingly, we affirmed our guidance and narrowed the ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin for full year 2021, which Matt will discuss with all of you shortly.  
Importantly, we have been active on the business development front, as we told you we would be. We have executed 3 transactions in the last 6 months. This underscores our stated commitment to deliver health care interventions that address unmet and undermet needs in women's health. We're partnering with or acquiring companies to advance true innovation, something that has been woefully lacking in the area of women's health.  
Today, we announced our proposed acquisition of Forendo, a clinical stage drug development company focused on novel treatments in women's health. This acquisition brings a pipeline of candidates, including a lead candidate for endometriosis and a secondary candidate in polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS.  
Endometriosis is a high priority unmet need for us. It affects up to 170 million patients or up to 10% of all women of reproductive age. The current therapies and development candidates target the pain associated with endometriosis but do not address disease progression. Existing treatments also often lead to systemic estrogen depletion, which impacts bone mineral density and triggers menopausal symptoms. Such treatments are, therefore, unsuitable beyond short-term use in premenopausal women.  
Completing the acquisition of Forendo will be another step in building our end-to-end women's health portfolio. It joins our other recent additions, including Alydia Health and its JADA System, which Organon acquired in June of this year. The JADA System is aimed at controlling abnormal postpartum bleeding or hemorrhage, one of the most common complications of birth impacting up to 10% of mothers and potentially resulting in emergency interventions such as hysterectomy and blood transfusions.  
In July, we also announced the licensing of the global development manufacturing and commercial rights to an investigational agent, ebopiprant from ObsEva. Ebopiprant is currently being studied as a first-in-class innovation for the treatment of preterm labor, which impacts an estimated 15 million babies or about 11% of all babies born globally. These acquisitions are tightly aligned with our goal to be the leader in women's health by addressing the significant unmet needs of women. We have quickly expanded beyond contraception and fertility, where we are well established and already hold leading market share positions.  
I want to turn my attention to fertility, where we saw revenue growth of approximately 30% year-to-date x FX. We don't believe the opportunity for the products in our fertility portfolio, Follistim, Orgalutran and Elonva are always well understood. These products are used in the patient-friendly GnRH antagonist protocol, which requires few injections and is favored in conjunction with egg and embryo freezing. Globally infertility rates are increasing. We have seen the average age for giving birth to a first child increase from 20 years -- 21 years old in 1970 to 29 years old today. About 15% of couples worldwide experience infertility, impacting almost 190 million people. These figures are impacted by 
 women proactively choosing to delay parenthood until an optimal time due to advances in modern fertility protocols and egg and embryo freezing technology. 
Governments are recognizing fertility rates are not just a personal family planning issue but also have an impact on GDP.  In 100 countries, birth rates are now below 2.1, the level needed to maintain the population. Low birth rates are a growing threat to some very large economies such as China, the U.S. and Japan, triggering public sector responses that serve as structural tailwinds for fertility treatment. Recently, China introduced the 3-child policy. Next year, Japan will introduce reimbursement for IVF treatments, and the French, Swiss and Spanish governments recently passed bills allowing egg freezing and IVF treatments for same-sex couples. 
These recent changes are just the beginning of providing equal access to reproductive assistance. Government interest in increasing fertility rates and changing laws on access to reproductive assistance makes us optimistic for the growing prospects of our fertility portfolio. 
Let's talk now about contraception and NEXPLANON, the #2 contraceptive worldwide by revenue. We believe NEXPLANON, a LARC, or long-acting reversible contraceptive, has blockbuster potential. Historically, there has been a sustained shift in the hormonal contraception market away from the daily combined oral contraceptive segment towards LARCs. LARCs are highly efficacious and considered to be one of the most effective forms of hormonal contraception. 
Implanon or Implanon NXT, as it's known in some markets, is differentiated even within the large segment. It is the only single rod subdermal long-acting reversible contraceptive comprised of a progesterone-only rod inserted in a woman's upper arm. Average insertion time takes about a minute. 
Historically, NEXPLANON sales have been highly correlated with well visits, and logically, the pandemic dampened our ability to reach health care providers and patients, especially in the U.S. However, as the pandemic is slowly receding, we are seeing improvements in recent weeks. Additionally, since NEXPLANON has been in our hands, we have been aggressively working to modernizing the brand's marketing and our operating model. This has included a direct-to-consumer education campaign in television and social media with digital campaigns to drive traffic to our revamped websites, where patients can find healthcare professionals by zip code trained in NEXPLANON insertion. This was complemented by targeted bespoke campaigns aimed at specific patient segments. 
Additionally, our clinical training programs ramped up quickly once providers' offices reopened. We trained over 7,500 healthcare professionals in the third quarter alone, which is above our pre-pandemic baseline levels, and we trade over 6,000 healthcare professionals in Q2. This is a steep ramp -- a ramp-up from the 2,000 that were trained in Q1. And  we believe it's contributing to increasing demand, and we are very encouraged by the results of these programs, especially given we're less than 6 months into this journey. We continue to feel very positive about NEXPLANON path, particularly now midway through the fourth quarter. 
Now let's talk about biosimilars, which has grown 30% year-to-date and where we are well positioned with our commercial strategy. In the U.S., our 2 offerings are: RENFLEXIS, or infliximab biosimilar; and ONTRUZANT, our trastuzumab biosimilar. The infliximab market continues to grow every year, and RENFLEXIS has benefited from that tailwind with sales still growing even 4 years after launch. The trastuzumab market has some of the highest adoption rates, about 70% among biosimilars, and the uptake of ONTRUZANT in the U.S. continues to show unit growth since its launch last year. 
Outside the U.S., our recent launches of HADLIMA in Australia and Canada have been performing exceptionally well. We also continue to evaluate other potential pipeline opportunities with Samsung as well as other developers as we pursue the potential opportunity to present it by the estimated $100 billion plus of blockbuster biologics going off-patent over the next decade. 
As we now turn our attention to Established Brands, I'll repeat what I said last quarter. Part of the strategic timing of our spend is that 2021 is an inflection year. It is the last year during which the portfolio is subject to significant new LOE risk. Beyond 2021, the impact from the LOE decreases significantly. 
This portfolio of 49 products is comprised of brands with significant customer loyalty that tend to respond well to promotion. For example, in China, our retail business now representing almost 50% of our China Established Brands revenue continues to grow strong double digits because of brand loyalty, offsetting the impact of the volume-based procurement program, or VBP and positioning Organon for sustainable growth in China post VBP. 
Importantly, we are taking a very entrepreneurial view of this portfolio and have uncovered a number of accretive opportunities within our existing portfolio. For example, we anticipate taking Nasonex OTC in Russia, with that launch planned for early next year. 
All 3 franchises are global businesses, as you will see on Slide 7. There are several areas I want to highlight about our business geographically. The decline in Asia Pacific is primarily related to Zetia's loss of exclusivity in Japan. In the U.S., the LOE from NuvaRing as well as NEXPLANON performance through the pandemic were factors. However, importantly, we continue to grow in China despite 4 of our products being included in the volume-based procurement process in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Revenue from China is up 4% Ex FX this quarter driven by the respiratory market recovering from the COVID impact in 2020, the favorable positioning of our fertility portfolio and continued contribution from the retail channel. Overall we are very encouraged by our performance in this very important market. Now I'd like to turn it over to Matt to discuss our third quarter performance in more detail."
653748561,1686394193,2435850,"Organon & Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2021",2021-11-11,"Earnings Calls","Organon & Co.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. Before we dive into the specifics of our financial performance, let's start briefly with data on presentation and make sure we align on exactly what numbers we're looking at, where we have apples-to-apples comparability and where we may",2979,"Thank you, Kevin. Before we dive into the specifics of our financial performance, let's start briefly with data on presentation and make sure we align on exactly what numbers we're looking at, where we have apples-to-apples comparability and where we may have something less than that. On the plus side, our third quarter results marked the first time that Organon is reporting an entire quarter of standalone result. As I discussed in last quarter's call, our results prior to the June 2 spin-off date are presented on the carve-out basis of accounting. Carve-out accounting is a GAAP convention which has a lot of positives. However, it's not intended to present results as if Organon were a stand-alone company. So I want to be clear as we discuss results for this quarter and for the next 3 quarters that any comparisons to prior year periods will be somewhat apples-to-oranges  and that we'll be comparing Organon's stand-alone performance to pre-spin carve-out basis of the county. With that said, where we'll have the best comparability is at the revenue line. So I'll be focusing attention at the top line as we discuss our performance. 
So turning to Slide 8. Revenue for the third quarter was $1.6 billion down 1% as reported and down about 3% at constant currency exchange rates when compared to the third quarter of last year. In this graphic, we break out the change in revenue according to key drivers, and I'll highlight some of the more significant impacts. The impact of loss of exclusivity, or LOE, during the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year is approximately $70 million, and it's primarily related to the LOE of Zetia in Japan and NuvaRing LOE in the United States. 
Continuing to read across the waterfall chart, the Established Brands portfolio has exposure to VBP in China. The total impact to sales for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year was approximately $60 million and was associated with the third round of VBP, the largest round so far, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 and that included 4 of Organon's products: SINGULAIR pediatrics, PROSCAR, PROPECIA and Arcoxia. 
In the third quarter of 2021, the negative impact of COVID-19 was estimated to be approximately $100 million, which is about $20 million above Q3 of last year. Our product portfolio is comprised of physician prescribed products, which have been impacted by the shortage of qualified personnel, social distancing measures and delayed medical visits. 
In the third quarter, we continued to see lingering effects from COVID as compared to the year ago quarter, including, as Kevin just mentioned, a slower return of well visits, which particularly impacts NEXPLANON. We continue to observe restrictive measures, which vary by country and region. So we expect to see some further lingering negative impacts from COVID persisting into the fourth quarter, although we believe we're starting to see encouraging trend development in U.S. NEXPLANON early in the fourth quarter, which could be pointing to stronger sequential performance in Q4 versus Q3. 
Foreign exchange translation had about 200 basis points of favorability for the quarter. Year-to-date, that impact is more pronounced at about 350 basis points, which is not really surprising given the impact of COVID-19 on global currency markets in the prior year period and also understanding that about 75% of our revenue is derived outside the United States. And finally, on the plus side, we saw a volume growth in Q3 mainly driven by growth in China, in U.S. biosimilars and in Europe with Established Brands. 
So now let's take a look at performance by franchise, and we'll start with women's health on Slide 9. Our women's health business was down 10% as reported and 11% in constant currency in the third quarter versus the prior year. NEXPLANON declined 8% Ex FX in the quarter. As Kevin mentioned, well visits are not yet back to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S., and NEXPLANON sales are largely tied to that metric. 
So we know the question on investors' minds is, can NEXPLANON have a $200 million revenue quarter in Q4. And while we don't provide specific guidance by product, this question is important enough to address and provide you at least a directional answer. And based on current visibility into the data that we're looking at, we do see fourth quarter as being favorable for U.S. and NEXPLANON. 
There's 3 reasons why. Reason number one goes back to the quarter just completed. Third quarter negative growth should be considered in the context of Q3 2020 being a tough comp from the standpoint that, in September of last year, even though we were in the pandemic, we saw a short-lived resurgence in patient well visits that positively impacted third quarter 2020 NEXPLANON sales. There has been volatility in the trend of patient OB/GYN well visits over the last year. But for the third quarter of last year, those visits were almost back to a pre-COVID baseline and Q3 2020 NEXPLANON sales were the highest since the start of the pandemic. So the message here is that the third quarter of 2020 was a tough comp for NEXPLANON. 
Second reason goes to phasing of revenues within this year. There was a tender that we were expecting in the third quarter in Mexico that was delayed and has now become signed business for us in the fourth quarter. 
Third and final reason goes back to what Kevin said about our next NEXPLANON DTC campaign in the United States, which began running this summer. It's starting to show results now as well as other new digital campaigns that are raising brand awareness for NEXPLANON and driving sizable increases in our website traffic by potential new users. 
Beyond NEXPLANON, also pressuring women's health this quarter was the continuing and expected decline in NuvaRing down 17% Ex FX in the quarter, relates to increased generic penetration as a result of the product's LOE in 2018 in the U.S. On a positive note, our fertility portfolio continues to show strength.  FOLLISTIM grew 18% Ex FX in the quarter. Volume growth came from an increase in demand from new accounts as well as from patients returning to clinics. And our observation has been that patients seeking fertility treatments are more motivated to return to doctors' offices than those patients seeking normal course OB/GYN well visits. 
Turning to biosimilars on Slide 10. Biosimilars grew 41% as reported in the third quarter and 39% Ex FX. We have 5 assets in the portfolio, 3 in Immunology and 2 in Oncology. RENFLEXIS and ONTRUZANT are our 2 largest offerings, and both are offered in the U.S. Globally, RENFLEXIS grew 43% Ex FX in the quarter, driven by strong performance in the U.S. And ONTRUZANT, which was launched in the U.S. in July of last year, was up 47%. The biosimilars business outside the U.S., which represents about half of our total biosimilars revenue, is tender-driven and, therefore, it's more price sensitive. And timing of tenders can also make this business somewhat lumpy, and we benefited from that in the third quarter. So while we are coming off 2 quarters of about 40% year-on-year revenue growth in biosimilars, we see some moderation of that growth rate for the remainder of 2021, resulting in solid double-digit revenue growth year-on-year. 
I now turn to Established Brands on Slide 11. Revenue for Established Brands was down 6% as reported and 8% Ex FX in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the impacts of LOE, revenue was down 4% Ex FX. Volumes were up incrementally mainly driven by COVID rebound, although not as strong as it was in Q2, as well as growth in China retail. Price was down about 5% across the Established Brands portfolio. And given that this is a portfolio of medicines that, for the most part, are well beyond their LOEs, it may be counterintuitive to investors to hear that, in the third quarter, more than 50% Of Established Brands' revenue came from products for which volumes grew. These brands are well known. They respond to promotion, and we're actively managing life cycle opportunities across the portfolio. These factors support our May Investor Day discussion that we expect erosion in this portfolio to be in the low single-digit area Ex LOE over the intermediate term. 
China. China is an important market for Established Brands. And part of our strategy in this market has been to drive volumes into the retail channel versus our historical presence in the hospital channel, and this effort continues to be successful. The retail channel in China grew 20% in the third quarter versus prior year and now represents almost 50% of Established Brands revenue in China, up from approximately 35% a year ago. 
Now turning to our income statement on Slide 12. Our GAAP income statement for Q3 and year-to-date are available in our earnings release, and I encourage investors to look at that important information. 
Here on Slide 12, we'll be looking at our non-GAAP income statement for these same time periods. For gross margins, we're excluding purchase accounting amortization and onetime items related to the spin-off from cost of goods sold. So making these straightforward adjustments in the third quarter of 2021, non-GAAP adjusted gross profit was $1 billion, representing gross margin of 64.9% compared with 68.6% in the third quarter of 2020. The decline reflects costs associated with standing up Organon as an independent company, including certain costs related to manufacturing agreements between Organon and Merck, which have lower gross margin percentages compared to product sales. Those manufacturing agreements had an approximate 180 basis point negative impact to gross margins in the third quarter. 
Also included in cost of goods sold this quarter was a $24 million onetime cost related to estimated losses associated with the vendor supply contract conveyed as part of the spin, which had a 160 basis point negative impact to gross margins. There were some spin-related accounting items that partially offset this unfavorability but this quarter's gross margin is a good example actually of where we had apples-and-oranges comparability issues with prior year comparisons and why our 2021 guidance becomes a much more useful yardstick for investors. That said, our gross margin for the third quarter was squarely aligned with the guidance that we've communicated in the low- to mid-60% range. 
Adjusted EBITDA margins were 39.8% in the third quarter, which brings year-to-date margins to 38.9%. We had told you last quarter that we expected second half EBITDA margins to be lower than the first half. The reason why our EBITDA margins are running stronger than we forecasted is driven by lower operating expenses, and this is mainly timing related. We're onboarding our stand-alone operating expenses a bit more slowly than we thought in headcount costs, as well as promotional spending in certain markets. 
And if you're doing back-of-the-envelope math, you'd likely draw the conclusion that Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin would have to be markedly lower than year-to-date for us to finish within the EBITDA margin guidance range that we'll be discussing shortly. So we do expect operating expenses to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter as the pace of onboarding some of these expenses speeds up going into year-end. 
Given the strong EBITDA performance in Q3, we did consider raising the adjusted EBITDA margin guidance range for the full year but it would have been by a relatively small amount. So instead, we elected to just narrow the range and communicate to you a high and improved level of confidence in the guidance that we are affirming. 
A few words on debt capitalization on Slide 13. At September 30, our bank debt was $9.3 billion against cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion. Now embedded in that cash balance is approximately $320 million that is earmarked for finished goods inventory purchases from our former parent that's really related to the spin-off transaction. So a more representative net debt number as of September 30 is closer to $8.6 billion. If we use the implied midpoint of our 2021 EBITDA guidance just for illustrative purposes, that would put our pro forma net leverage at about 3.7x, which is a modest improvement in leverage ratio compared sequentially to last quarter. 
And one more item here, our imputed cash flow for the third quarter is a good indicator that we are meeting our pre-spin forecasting and is representative of the cash-generating power of this business. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what we laid out in our pre-spin-off communications, and we are reiterating them today. 
Now that our Board has established a dividend, the dividend becomes our first priority. We're targeting the dividend at a low 20s percentage of free cash flow excluding onetime costs of the separation, a level of which we believe is very manageable. Our second priority will be organic growth. and that would include life cycle management opportunities for existing products within our portfolio, supported by capital deployed in our manufacturing plants. And on the latter, we expect to see annual CapEx in the range of 3% to 4% of revenue on an ongoing basis, once again, excluding separation costs. 
Our third priority for capital allocation is really a tie. It's a tie between, a, execution of external growth plans to develop a pipeline of new product opportunities like you've seen us announce already, Alydia Health and the JADA System, investigation of ebopiprant for preterm labor and now Forendo targeting endometriosis. We'll balance that against, b, debt reduction and our commitment to maintaining our BB/Ba2 parent rating. We are targeting a long-term leverage ratio below 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
Turning to guidance on Slide 14. Consistent with previous communications, this guidance is all non-GAAP and pro forma and just the spinoff happened on January 1 of this year. Beginning with revenue, this is a chart we showed at Investor Day, and changes since then have really been at the margin. Based on where we are in the year, we're narrowing our full year 2021 revenue range from $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion to $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion. This revenue is essentially all organic. We do include a de minimis partial year revenue contribution from the acquisition of Alydia Health. 
The biggest component to the year-over-year change in revenue is the expected LOE impacts. Impacts from LOE were approximately $280 million year-to-date and primarily related to the loss of patent protection for Zetia in Japan and NuvaRing in the U.S. We continue to expect a full year LOE impact of approximately $300 million to $400 million. As we've been careful to describe previously, 2021 is an inflection year for Organon as regards LOE impacts. After 2021, our LOE exposure dissipates to approximately $300 million cumulatively over the next 4 years combined, 2022 through year-end 2025. 
We now think our VBP exposure in China for the year will be on the low end of the $200 million to $300 million range we previously communicated. Year-to-date exposure has been about $150 million and we have a fairly good understanding of what will be included in the next rounds of VBP, which is likely to include Ezetrol, Hyzaar and Nasonex. 
Now COVID is something that we're obviously watching very closely. We updated our view on COVID impact last quarter to expect that our total year impact from COVID in 2021 would be about even with what we experienced in 2020, which was about $400 million. Year-to-date 2021 impact from COVID was $320 million. And given the recent trends that we've seen in NEXPLANON prescriptions, which is the product where we see the most lingering COVID impact, we are comfortable with that implied estimate of about $80 million of COVID impact in the fourth quarter. 
On a yearly basis, we expect foreign exchange translation to be a modest tailwind based on year-to-date currency performance and where spot rates are currently. And finally, for performance, we've tweaked this bucket down in here, and this is mostly tied to my earlier commentary on biosimilars and the lumpiness of tenders quarter-to-quarter. 
Taken as a whole, year-to-date revenue performance is largely to be expected despite the uncertainties introduced by COVID. The key themes that we've been talking about in our public communications prior to spin-off and since the spin-off remains very much intact, and those are: LOE issues that are waiting; women's health, especially fertility; and biosimilars that are delivering growth; and China, that's performing very well despite VBP headwinds. 
Turning to other guidance metrics on Slide 15. The message here is that for all the items shown, we're affirming prior guidance for most metrics. And for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, we're simply narrowing the ranges in light of where we are in the fiscal year. 
Reiterating the point I made earlier, during 2021, we've onboarded operating expenses more deliberately than we had forecasted. We're not yet at our run rate for SG&A expense as an independent company. We know R&D expense will be increasing in 2022 and beyond as we add pipeline assets. And I say this more as we start to look forward to next fiscal year, and we will provide quantitative guidance for 2022 when we report our full year 2021 results in February. 
Wrapping up the financial discussion, the franchises are progressing as we had expected. And given our outlook for 2021, we continue to believe that we're well positioned for future organic revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. This will be driven by stabilization in the Established Brands portfolio and continued growth in both women's health and biosimilars, each of which has the potential to grow at low double-digit CAGRs in the intermediate term. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks."

Further, as the pandemic starts to recede, we have doubled down on our operational investments behind NEXPLANON in the U.S. to ensure that we meet her where she is. 
And we have started to see very positive impact of those investments in the first weeks of the fourth quarter. We've been very disciplined in our business development plans and have action on 3 attractive assets; 2 of them are earlier stage products with significant downstream opportunities as well as the recently commercialized device in JADA, which is helping to address a significant unmet need. All in all, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance, and all the evidence points to a solid fourth quarter to finish off the year. So now we're happy to take your questions.

So just any directional color there, I think, would be very much appreciated. 
And then my second question was just on the pipeline build-out. You've done 3 deals this year. Should we think about these type of transactions, which it seemed like there's some R&D elements to them. They seem a bit smaller in size is kind of the sweet spot in terms of acquisitions, both near and long term. Or do we think about deals starting to skew towards larger transactions as you delever? So I'm trying to sense of like if there wasn't capital constraints right now, would you be also mixing in some larger deals?

This is, we believe, very important for the future, sustainable revenue growth of the company. So you'll see R&D expenses increasing. 
We've been very careful about how we are adding costs at the SG&A line to reach out what we believe our run rate -- every dollar that we're adding, we're analyzing it very carefully. So that said, you had said, Chris, it looks like 2022 EBITDA margin was likely to be below what you're guiding for in 2021. I think directionally, that's a fair statement. You also said how should we think about the fourth quarter EBITDA margin in the context of 2022. It might not be as low as that, I think that's directionally accurate. Now I think it probably makes sense to just stop there at this point, and we'll be providing quantitative very, very transparent guidance in February."

So we've been very disciplined, exceptionally disciplined in the way that we've looked at our business development portfolio. We did signal early on in the Investment Day that we were going to kind of using baseball parlance, its kind of go after singles and doubles because we do -- we saw opportunities like, for example, with JADA to solve a significant unmet need in postpartum hemorrhage. 
We saw an opportunity with ObsEva's product with preterm labor, a significant unmet need today in that world. And now we are very excited about the Forendo acquisition because they bring a new mechanism of action to treat a significant issue around the world, which is endometriosis affecting really 170 people -- 70 million women across the world. 
So we see great opportunities there. I've mentioned before there's about 140 assets out there in various stages of development. But having said that, let me be clear, we're not saying no to larger deals. We're not saying no to essentially anything that we believe could be accretive ultimately down the road for Organon. We are open to whatever is actually going to be working best for us as a company. And so -- but right now, what we see is opportunities that are really what we consider low-hanging fruit to go after in order to be able to really round out our portfolio and be a leader in women's health."

It's a very important question in regards to the performance of NEXPLANON. Look, I mean the thing to keep in mind is the fact that we truly believe that NEXPLANON will be a blockbuster for all of us. We have patent prot",624,"So let me take that first question. It's a very important question in regards to the performance of NEXPLANON. Look, I mean the thing to keep in mind is the fact that we truly believe that NEXPLANON will be a blockbuster for all of us. We have patent protection until 2027 with an opportunity to extend it to 2030 as we start to round out and look at our 5-year extension data that will possibly come through and report out in the 2025 time frame. 
Having said that, we have invested, really truly invested, in the operational opportunities in the U.S. And I'd like to point out 3 key investments. And then, ultimately, I'm going to lead to answering your question by -- after going through that. Clinical training programs, these are essentially -- just to keep you in mind that physicians or healthcare providers need to be certified and trained on how to insert and remove a NEXPLANON in order to be able to prescribe the product. 
Prior to the pandemic, Merck had averaged about 18,000 certifications per year. Since spin, that would essentially be June through September, we've done 10,000 certifications. We're essentially averaging in the second and third quarters nearly 13,500 certifications. That is a significant proxy for NEXPLANON uptake and performance going forward. direct-to-consumer marketing. We've invested in the direct-to-consumer, initiated a TV and social media campaign with a well-known celebrity and more importantly real-world users of NEXPLANON. 
Two observations. Unaided awareness of NEXPLANON has increased when compared to the prior 3 months, and our organic searches for NEXPLANON information have increased as we have made significant -- really significant improvements and enhancements to our nexplanon.com site where we expect to see about 7 million visitors uniquely every year. 
Finally, representative activities as the COVID pandemic recedes. Over the last 3 quarters of 2021 versus the 3 quarters of 2020, our representative calls face-to-face have increased by 60%. All of that is leading to the fact that right now, in the first 5 weeks of performance of the first -- of Q4, we see sales distributors have increased strong double digits strong double digits. We expect the fourth quarter to be a very strong quarter for us in NEXPLANON.
And ultimately, as I've always been saying, as we start to invest in senior management attention, as we start to invest in some of these programs, we will see NEXPLANON just from the sheer fact of the matter, what it can represent in dealing with unintended pregnancies in the U.S. and beyond start to really ramp up and start to go back to that double-digit performance that we expect of it. 
And on the second part of your question regarding free cash flow. The reason why we included Slide 13 of the earnings deck in the format that we did, was so that investors would be able to triangulate back to what third quarter operating cash flow was and free cash flow. And so now the question is, is that figure for operating cash flow, is it representative? 
And I would tell you that there are one-timers that are running through that, but they're going in both directions. Some good guys and some bad guys use colloquial terms that we use within the company, but they're netting out so that the Q3 operating cash flow figure that we're looking at is really pretty representative of what the company should do. And I put that in my prepared comments to say that the cash flow generating performance in Q3 is well aligned with what we had forecasted. So that much I can say for this fiscal year, and I'll refrain from making any free cash flow commentary for 2022 at this point."

And I will say that, first of all, we are truly excited about the Forendo announcement and potential acquisition going forward. I mean it does -- I mean when you think about endometriosis, it's really under-researched, underfunded and misunderstood with essentially an average of 8 to 10 years before a woman is actually diagnosed with the diagnosis of endometriosis. 
In regards to your questions on endometrial thickness, we're still -- we're just starting our Phase II proof-of-concept studies. We expect to report out in the 2024-2025 range with commercialization of this product, if all goes well, knock on wood, by the 2027-2028 time frame. It is something that we need to get back to you as we start to kind of go down deep in terms of understanding exactly the data in that respect. We can return back to you on that. 
But just to say this, currently, as you know, the treatment of endometriosis is really relied on pain medication and managing the symptoms in regards to  endometriosis not necessarily the underlying issues that are essentially causing the problem. 
GnRHs, for example, acts systemically at the pituitary level, cutting off all signals to female -- to the female reproductive system, which basically is plunging woman at the menopause and really causing all kinds of bone mineral density issues. So that's why it's really short-term usage. FOR-6219, it's really targeting the estradiol pathway, essentially targeting only impacting esterone to estradiol conversion process,-and that process is exclusively responsible for endometriosis. And ultimately, all of the sequelae when you see in terms of inflammation and all the things regarding the pain and bleeding all the issues go on. 
So we feel very excited about this mechanism. It is a potential, and I underscore potential for disease modification as well as managing the symptoms of endometriosis are really at the sight of where it really needs to be addressed. In terms of endometrial thickness and in terms of any ECG or any cardiovascular issues, we'll get back to you in terms of as we start to be able to get a better insight in terms of the data."

To what extent could biosimilar usage increase by simply reimbursement changes? Or do you think that that's not correct, that biosimilar use will not be encouraged by any reimbursement change? 
Second question is on the acquisition of Forendo. The total consideration of $954 million seems strikingly high. How would -- how much is that attributable to the lead asset versus the follow-ons? And what happens with the existing collaboration with Novartis for chronic liver disease? 
And then lastly, the observation. For a company that has a core strategy of business development, I'm surprised that business development is third or even last on the capital allocation priority list. So that's it."

So the business generates strong cash flow today. The collective view of our former parent, Merck, our Board of Directors, is that investors should be able to share in that cash flow in real time and that the valuation of the company at a very sensitive time around the spin was that the dividend would be an important consideration in achieving the right value on the company. So that was the reason for the institution of the dividend. And of course, once it's in, it does become the #1 priority. 
The reason why organic growth projects come in #2, Steve, is because these are products that are already in the portfolio. They've got a demonstrated track record of safety and performance. And so simply introducing these products in new markets or potentially for adjacent indications are generally de-risked investment opportunities and have very, very attractive risk-adjusted returns. And I would also add it's not a big consumer of capital in the overall scheme of things. 
So with the dividend being a relatively modest and manageable number, with the organic growth plans being derisked and also modest and manageable, that still leaves really a substantial amount of our available operating cash flow, free cash flow available to pursue the business development agenda. So I hope that explanation makes sense. 
In terms of the economics around the Forendo deal, of the number that you cited in terms of total consideration, $600 million of that are commercial milestones. So the product has to be successful commercially for most of the value of the deal to be realized. And the consideration is about $84 million upfront and then approximately $270 million of clinical milestones. So we did wait the deal to be back-ended and dependent as much as we could justify commercial success of the product. And yes, most of the value has been ascribed to the lead candidate. 
And I think your last question was on biosimilars. And we do view the current dialogue in Washington as very positive for biosimilars, Steve. And it's difficult to quantify the impact for Organon at this point. It'll certainly be articulated when we provide guidance for 2022, but we do see the dialogue in Washington as being favorable for our portfolio of biosimilar products."

As we've said in our last May in our Investor Day, we believe that NEXPLANON is poised for strong double-digit growth. It was a double-digit growing product prior to the pandemic; we believe that, that will continue to be the case as soon as clinics start to open up as they are reopening now and staffs are coming back online, that's kind of why we made the investments we did in things like clinical training programs, direct-to-consumer marketing, all the rep activities that are ongoing right now and many other things that we're doing right now in the space. 
Keep in mind, that NEXPLANON really only has about 5% market share. So there's tremendous room for growth going forward. And we do have patent protection for some time in order to build this product out. It will be a billion dollar product for us. We feel very sure about that. And as I mentioned, first half of the fourth quarter looks very strong for NEXPLANON, which is -- again, it's tied to the fact that as women go back into the clinics right now, there's opportunities to really be able to utilize NEXPLANON in a manner by which kind of comes along with our vision of double-digit growth for this product and blockbuster potential. 
In regards to the second point, I think you were mentioning in terms of price volume activity around HUMIRA biosimilars. Look, we expect unlike, say, for example, hospital products like infliximab is and Remicade, where the price tends to move in kind of a lumpy fashion hospital-by-hospital, account by account. We do expect that it's going to move very quickly, not like small molecule erosion, but nevertheless, it's going to move fairly quickly in terms of price erosion with the loss of exclusivity of HUMIRA and moving forward in 2023 as you start to see all the launches of biosimilars. 
And you're going to probably see anywhere between 7 to 8 biosimilar launches in the first, say, year of opportunities for biosimilars to come in. So we'll see, I think, significant erosion. Again, nothing like the small molecule type of erosion, but nothing like that you see, for example, in a hospital dispense biosimilars that you see today."

Let me take the first question in regards to interchangeability because I know it's coming up recently. Look, the way that we've really looked at this market, and let's just take HADLIMA rather the HUMIRA biosimilars, you're right, Boehringer does have a low-dose interchangeability study that they've done. That represents a very small segment of the market. The majority of the market is in high dose, the high-dose segment. 
So really, the following variables, we believe, are very important. Order of entry, again, is very important, and we're still planning to be the second to the market in June 2023. The high-dose citrate-free formulation is exceptionally important because that is essentially what the dominant form is today with AbbVie's product. 
Real-world experience, and we have that from successful launches in Europe, Canada and Australia for our HUMIRA biosimilar, HADLIMA, which -- where we've launched that product in those places. Quality. Quality product from a manufacturing partner, you can rest assured, it's got top line quality manufacturing, like, for example, Samsung Bioepis. 
But having said that, our thinking around interchangeability, especially interchangeability in a high-dose citrate freeform is evolving. And we're in very active discussions with our partner in Samsung right now. And we will take a decision shortly in terms of what needs to be done in that space. But we are going to be very competitive. We're not going to be essentially a company that's going to have all the right variables to launch and succeed in this segment because it's an important area for us and not be competitive in regards to competitive pressures from other companies. 
But keep in mind, there are no -- no company is perfectly positioned. As we look today in terms of being kind of early launching with high concentration citrate-free dose, also having interchangeability designation for high concentration at launch, nobody's got that. So essentially, it's going to be that we launch with what we have. And then ultimately, you'll see later post launch as many of the other competitors are stating the interchangeability indication coming through. And in regards to Established Brands, what we do see -- let's have Matt address that."

Thanks, everyone, to -- for your very thoughtful questions. But I just want to just say, as we wrap up today's call, I want to conclude by saying we are exactly where we want to be.

But I just want to just say, as we wrap up today's call, I want to conclude by saying we are exactly where we want to be. At our first Investor Day in May, one month before spin, we laid out our plan for delivering low to mid-single-digit organic growth. We are delivering on what we committed to. Women's health driven by NEXPLANON and fertility remains positioned to deliver double-digit growth over the intermediate period, plus we're making the changes necessary to build the foundation for continued growth going forward. 
Year-to-date, biosimilars are already delivering double-digit growth, and we expect that to happen over the planning period. We are stabilizing the Established Brands business with volume increases in more than 50% of our products, and we believe we have a pathway to sustain performance over the coming years. 
This portfolio serves as a cash generator, contributing to the free cash flow that Matt referenced, enabling us to build out our pipeline with targeted and disciplined business development and life cycle management activities focused on our company's purpose to address significant unmet medical needs in women's health. 
With our 3 deals in the past 6 months, we have lost no time in tackling areas where new innovation is sorely needed. We have commercialized the JADA device to address postpartum hemorrhage, launched in the U.S. with plans to bring it to the rest of the world as quickly as possible. We've licensed ObsEva's investigational preterm labor agent, a new mechanism of action in a space with few options. 
And our existing deal announced today -- our exciting deal announced today, the proposed acquisition of Forendo brings an early-stage asset with new mechanism of action being studied for endometriosis plus an earlier-stage asset for PCOS. 
In addition, we have a number of life cycle management opportunities underway, including the potential for a NEXPLANON 5-year label extension and many, many more. overall, our company is shaping up just as we planned; sustainable, predictable and on strategy. So I want to thank you, and we'll talk again early next year. All the best."
