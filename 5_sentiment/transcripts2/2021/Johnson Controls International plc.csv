I will start with a brief strategic update and summary of our Q1 results. Olivier will provide a more detailed review of those results and update you on our forward outlook. And we'll have plenty of time to take your questions. 
Let's get started on Slide 3. 
We are off to a strong start in the first quarter with solid financial performance and accelerating momentum on all of our strategic initiatives. As we will cover in a few minutes, top line performance was at the high end of the expectations we communicated to you last quarter, which, together with impressive operational execution across all segments, enabled us to grow EBIT by 5% year-on-year despite continued volume pressure related to the ongoing pandemic. 
A little bit of promise of a vaccine is sparking modest optimism in several of our end markets. Many of which continue to show improving sequential demand. There are still many regions of the world-facing second and third waves, with varying degrees of lockdowns in restrictions. With that being the case, we have remained focused on the commitments we made to our employees, customers and suppliers. 
Our teams have come together to achieve truly extraordinary things, improving the fundamentals of our businesses and executing our overall strategy. During the quarter, we were honored to receive recognition from several organizations. Additionally, as you may have seen in a separate press release issued earlier this morning, we announced an ambitious set of new ESG commitments, reinforcing sustainability as a top priority in our leadership role in climate change. 
Lastly, we continued to gain traction on several of our core growth initiatives, which we have been discussing with you over the last couple of quarters, scaling Open Blue, driving higher service attachment rates and sales growth, and accelerating new product introductions. 
Please turn to Slide 4. 
There has been a tremendous amount of engagement at Johnson Controls over the last several months, both with our teams internally as well as with our customers and partners. In early December, we announced an exciting partnership agreement with Microsoft as part of our global collaboration to build a comprehensive Digital Twin platform that supports the entire ecosystem of a building. Open Blue Digital Twin technology is transforming how buildings are conceived, built and operated, enabling the creation of digital replicas of physical spaces, systems, processes and people. 
The next floor on the page reflects the incredible efforts in leadership by countless individuals across various businesses and functions throughout the organization. I want to congratulate our colleagues across the company as it underscores the commitment to excellence we have been driving towards over the last few years. 
Additionally, I am honored to have been selected to serve as the Chair of the Energy and Environment Committee on the Business Roundtable. I look forward to working with my colleagues into having an opportunity to influence the nation's policies toward addressing climate change, the most significant challenge facing the planet today. 
On Slide 5, I would like to highlight the ambitious set of new ESG commitments we announced this morning. 
Sustainability is at the center of our vision for a healthy world and is integrated into our culture and values. Now with our Open Blue platform, the value creation we provide to our customers is directly linked to ESG. 
In terms of our new environmental commitments, we are setting a goal through our science-based targets, which enable us to achieve net 0 carbon emissions before 2040, which is 10 years earlier than required by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's goal to cap global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. Additionally, we will direct 75% of our R&D investment on new product development to products and solutions that address climate needs. 
On the social and governance side, we intend to double the representation of women and minorities in management roles by 2025. And finally, in terms of new commitments, beginning in fiscal 2021, we are including sustainability and diversity goals in senior leaders' performance assessments and linking those directly to executive compensation to ensure accountability. 
Turning to Slide 6 for an update on OpenBlue. 
The rollout of OpenBlue is going very well, and we remain encouraged by the high level of engagement we are seeing with customers and partners. We launched 7 new offerings this quarter, the most significant of which is OpenBlue Healthy Buildings, the industry's most comprehensive suite of connected solutions. This particular launch leverages the strength of our core capabilities, which, together with data-driven AI technologies, enables our customers to transform how people interact with their buildings, create intelligent, safe, dynamic environments, achieve their own green building goals and maximize return on investment with shorter paybacks. By combining these solutions, we create a holistic menu of offerings that prevent customers from having to choose between efficiency and sustainability. 
We now have 27 offerings available that solve for unique customer problems and serve a new market opportunity, which we sized at $10 billion to $15 billion and is growing at a double-digit CAGR over at least the next 5 years. We are ideally positioned with technologies and solutions that accelerate the transformation and reinvention of healthy buildings, which is directly aligned with the priorities of the incoming U.S. administration. Our pipeline continues to build, and momentum with key partners like Microsoft, Accenture and Salesforce is gaining steam. 
Turning to Service on Slide 7. 
Service is an incredibly attractive business that is showing momentum, with profitability that is 2x the company average. We are fully deploying resources to enhance our Service offerings and leveraging the power of OpenBlue to drive mid-single-digit-plus organic growth on an annual basis, improve attachment rates and revenue per user as well as reduce attrition. 
Turning to new products on Slide 8. 
As most of you know, we have been engaged in a significant amount of reinvestment in new product development over the last several years. Our engineering and R&D efforts have been aimed at reinvigorating our core product portfolio, ensuring new technologies are connected and future-ready, while designing cost out of equipment and helping our customers reach their sustainability goals. 
We think about product investment as having 4 primary themes or drivers: regulatory and environmental; electrification; digital connectivity; and more recently, healthy occupants. We launched several new products in the quarter that address all of these themes. We continue to expand our chiller portfolio, with equipment that uses low or ultra-low GWP refrigerants. And in Q1, we did that with one of our water cooled screw chiller platforms. We also launched our Mercury 2 smaller tonnage package split system that is already compliant with the 2023 Emission Standards Change 2 years ahead of time. York is the first in the industry with resi and light commercial product that is ready for the 2023 changeover. In Asia, we launched an exciting new Siflo BRF system, which is the first of its kind, and opens a new market opportunity by enabling installation and building configurations that previously wouldn't accommodate top flow systems, in the modular design meets the needs of our customers who want to expand or retrofit existing spaces more easily and in a cost-effective way. 
Electrification is another big theme, particularly in Europe and Asia, which is driving significant demand for more energy-efficient heat pump technology across both HVAC and industrial refrigeration markets. This trend towards electrification is geared to lowering energy use, carbon emissions and the reliance on fossil fuels. 
In addition to making sure that every piece of equipment that leaves our factory is enabled for connectivity, we are also investing significantly in cybersecurity technology, which has become increasingly important in a more digital world. 
Lastly, new demand for clean air technologies has resulted in some of the most rapid innovation sessions we have had. For example, our new premium Hitachi ductless system applies proprietary Frost Wash technology as well as more hygienic coils to increase the level of air quality in residential and small commercial applications. 
Over the last 12 months, we've been increasing the cadence of new product introductions, generating a higher level of product vitality than we have had in years past, with over 150 new products planned in fiscal '21. We are also investing in our channel to expand our points of distribution and leverage strategic partnerships with large dealers and other channel players. 
We are seeing tremendous validation of our investment in the marketplace and would expect that to continue over the next several years. 
Before Olivier review Slide 9 in detail, I just wanted to reiterate our solid start to the year, with improved performance in revenue, orders, profitability and overall earnings per share. Additionally, free cash flow was exceptionally strong. 
Now let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details."
282590,701064625,2185632,"Johnson Controls International plc, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Johnson Controls International plc","Executives","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone.

Continuing on Slide 9. 
Q1 sales declined 5% organically, improving sequentially compared to the 6% decline last quarter. Relative to our expectations, global products outperformed, primarily the result of continued high levels of demand for residential HVAC equipment, both here in North America as well as our Hitachi business in Asia Pacific including China. 
Cement EBITDA expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 12%, the highest margin rate in any first half since the merger, despite volume headwinds related to the pandemic. EPS of $0.43 increased 8%, benefiting from the higher profitability I just discussed as well as lower share count, as we have maintained a disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Our free cash flow performance in the quarter was strong, up about 10% on a reported basis to over $400 million. I will provide the details on our cash performance later in the call, but the strong start in Q1 puts us on a path to achieve 100% conversion for the full year. 
Please turn to Slide 10. 
Orders of our Field businesses continued to improve, with the year-over-year decline moderating to just 3% despite our installed business still experiencing pressure from slower non-resi newbuild activity, with retrofit activity showing signs of recovery. 
Service orders increased 2% overall, driven by Mila and supported by the recovery of our core commercial Fire & Security businesses in Europe. 
Our global products book-to-bill was up slightly year-over-year, with extremely strong growth in our North American resi HVAC business, up over 170% year-on-year. 
Backlog accelerated up 3% over the prior year to $9.5 billion, with service backlog up 8% to $2.5 billion and installed backlog up 2% to just over $7 billion. We are beginning to see conversion rates in our Service backlog accelerate, which gives us more confidence in our mid-single-digit growth outlook for that business. Our installed backlog flow rate is improving, but still below historical levels. Where site access has been allowed, we have continued to execute larger projects that were funded prior to the pandemic. As those projects reach completion, incoming backlog is remixing towards shorter cycle projects, which is positive for near-term margin outlook. 
Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 11. 
Operations net of mitigating actions netted to a $0.02 tailwind versus the prior year. Similar to the past several quarters, we experienced broad-based volume pressure and unfavorable mix. We remained in a positive price/cost position, and we continued to keep tight control on SG&A costs, including ongoing efforts to mitigate COVID-related volume declines. Net financing cost and controlling interest were each $0.01 headwind, with lower share count benefited us by $0.03. 
Let us turn to Slide 12 to discuss our segment results in more detail. My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 13. 
North America revenues declined 6% organically, with installed down 9%. Sales in the new construction channel remained depressed, as customers continued to delay large projects. And although retrofit activity was still down year-over-year in Q1 due to the drop in orders we experienced last year, we would expect this part of our installed business to inflect over the next 2 quarters. 
Services declined 2%, with our recurring contractual Service business up low single-digits across all domain, offset by weakness in transactional service, linked to customers' lower discretionary spend in the current environment. 
Segment margin increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 12.5%, primarily reflecting strong gross margin performance, up 90 basis points. Continued cost mitigation efforts and favorable mix also benefited us in Q1. 
Orders in North America declined 7%, improving slightly on a sequential basis, but impacted by significant declines in our federal government business. Persistent softness related to managing the pandemic was exacerbated by the disruption due to change in the administration. Backlog of $5.9 billion increased 1% year-over-year. 
EMEALA revenues declined 5%, with Installed down 11% and Services flat. By geography, we saw continued challenges across our major regions, with most geographies back under significant restrictions or full lockdown due to the spark -- the spike in COVID cases in the second half of the quarter. Europe declined low single-digits, while the Middle East saw significant pressure, down high teens against this quarter, with continued weakness in HVAC business. Latin America was down low double-digits. EBITDA margins rebounded, expanding 80 basis points from the prior year, as favorable mix, cost mitigation efforts and better fixed costs absorption more than offset the volume deleverage. Orders in EMEALA grew 2% in the quarter, and backlog of $1.8 billion was up 5% year-over-year. 
APAC revenue were down 6%, with Installed down 11% and Service up 1%. Sales in China turned positive, growing 2%, while other geographies throughout the APAC region have deteriorated modestly since last quarter due to renewed lockdowns and restrictions related to COVID-19 in areas like India, Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. That said, continued strength in China, a healthy backlog, stronger service activity and easy comps should allow us to post solid revenue growth over the next couple of quarters, with more modest growth in orders. EBITDA margins improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 12.8%, as favorable mix and the benefit of mitigation actions more than offset the volume decline. Orders declined 1% in Q1 despite China orders growing 60%, as renewed lockdowns and restrictions in several other key geographies offset. Backlog of $1.8 billion grew 12% year-over-year. 
Moving to Global Products. Revenue declined 2% on an organic basis in the quarter, better sequentially, with continued outperformance from our residential HVAC and security businesses. North America resi HVAC grew 46% in the quarter, as the market continues its sharp recovery and we continue to gain share as a result of expanding our points of distribution and new product launches. We would expect these trends to begin decelerating over the next several months, but sales growth should still be relatively strong. In Asia Pacific, our resi HVAC business grew 2%, with growth in Taiwan and India more than offsetting a low single-digit decline in Japan. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, our Nsense JV in China grew 30% year-over-year in Q1. On the commercial HVAC side, sales declined at a high single-digits rate as the commercial market remains under pressure, particularly in light commercial military. Fire & Security products declined low single-digits overall, with strong growth in our Security business, more than offset by continued weakness in commercial fire detection and suppression markets. EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 11.9%, as positive price/cost and the benefit of mitigating cost actions more than offset the volume decline and related absorptions as well as negative mix. 
Turning to Slide 14. 
Corporate expense was down significantly year-over-year to $67 million, benefiting from cost mitigation actions and continuous structural cost reductions. We do expect corporate expense to step up next quarter and throughout the course of the second half as temporary cost reductions begin to reinstate. Given the favorable performance in Q1, we now expect corporate expense to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million for the year. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 15. 
Starting with the balance sheet at the top of the page. No significant changes versus the prior period. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares for roughly $350 million. As we have said, the balance sheet remains in very good shape. On cash, we generated $424 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is truly remarkable performance for a quarter which typically experiences a cash outflow. As a reminder, beginning this year, we moved away from the adjusted free cash flow construct, so this represents true available free cash. Our cash from operations and reported free cash flow last year included a $600 million tax refund as well as $100 million cash outflow related to integration costs. While there were clearly some timing benefits driving some -- the substantial year-over-year increase, with CapEx still in process and ramping back up, underlying operational performance was the primary driver. 
Now let's turn to Slide 16 for our outlook. 
Although the market remains uncertain, given the solid start to the year and slightly more visibility, our confidence in the outlook for fiscal '21 has increased. In addition to initiating fiscal Q2 guidance, we are also providing formal guidance for the full year. 
Starting with our full year guidance, we still expect organic revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits range, turning slightly positive in Q2 and then ramping significantly in the second half. As I mentioned last quarter, we will continue to manage costs over the course of the year, including the return of cost that were subject to temporary mitigation actions last year. And we'll look for additional opportunities to streamline some of these costs out on a permanent basis. We have many levers to continue to improve overall profitability through actions focused on gross margin as well as SG&A. This, along with our continued strong execution, is expected to result in solid EBITDA margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points for fiscal '21. Q2 margins are expected to expand by 80 to 100 basis points, with continued benefits from cost actions. EPS for the full year would be in the range of $2.45 to $2.55, up 9% to 14% over 2020, which, as you will recall, was up 14%. Q2 EPS would be in the range of $0.47 to $0.49. Given our strong cash performance in Q1, we are raising our outlook for free cash flow conversion on a reported basis to approximately 100% for the full year, overall, continued strong performance in what remains a challenging environment. 
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

And so we've been going back after that, and we believe that, that's a real material opportunity and a competitive advantage for us. We have been increasing our market coverage with people as well as enhancing the technology that we're deploying within our solutions with OpenBlue. When you look at the margin profile, it's 2x the overall company EBITDA margin. And as we now look at our new capabilities, differentiating our services with connectivity and utilization of data, that really gives us an opportunity to be able to get longer-term contracts, being able to solve bigger problems, be able to attach contracts and ultimately drive that attachment rate. We've seen great progress here in Q1. We're up about 90 basis points sequentially in Q1. We expect for the whole year that our attach rate will move up 300 [ or ] 400 basis points and will actually accelerate as we enter 2022.

So as we look at our priorities for the year, we are not only supporting strong dividend, but also optimistically doing the buybacks. And we committed the $1 billion that's still remaining from the Power Solutions sale. But on a go-forward basis, see M&A as being an area that we can contribute 1% or 2% growth on a go-forward basis on an annual basis because of the pipeline that we see, the ability to be able to enhance our technologies, our go-to market, our services, and then accelerate the work we're doing with OpenBlue."

And that was a lot of blocking and tackling. Now strategically, we've been investing in new services. We've been enhancing those services with OpenBlue. We've been targeting our installed base in a much more aggressive manner because we have an opportunity to be able to bring that forward with new technologies and be able to be able to address some of the new challenges that our customers are facing. So when you put all of that together -- and you look at our performance here, in Q1, we've been sequentially improving. We're only down -- when you look at our -- Service was down 1%. It was down 3% in Q4. We're projecting here on a go-forward basis -- now our orders were actually up 2% in the quarter. On a go-forward basis, we see our orders continuing to improve. We're getting a higher mix of longer-term contracts within those orders. And that we believe that from a revenue standpoint, will turn positive here in Q2, and it will continue to ramp Q3 and Q4. So it's really a combination of not only mining the installed base, adding additional capabilities within the field and being able to do that, be able to enhance the offerings, be able to get it connected, utilizing data, creating new outcomes, and then ultimately being positioned here to attach. Our attach rate in the first quarter was up 90 basis points sequentially, and we see that improving 400 or 500 basis points over the year and then accelerating beyond that. So that gives us confidence here, Scott, that through the year, we'll get to mid-single-digit growth in '21 and that we believe that we can accelerate from there with very attractive margins going forward."

So Applied HVAC orders were down low single digits, this is globally, now about 3%. We did see continued sequential improvement in the market through the quarter. We did see some pressure in North America, where it's purely due to timing of orders as well as some federal business that got pressured, and again, timing. And then Asia Pac continues to accelerate. China was up over 20%. When you look at the sales now, following the orders, the sales were down low to mid-single digits globally, about 4%. We did see sequential improvement in North America as well as APAC. APAC actually came back to being flat. And a lot of that's being driven by our Service growth and the traction we're getting there. The North America install is better, and we're seeing the -- as Olivier said, we're seeing more retrofit quarter-on-quarter. 
And then when you look at unitary markets, they generally remain under pressure. They were down low single digits in Q1. The mix of that is -- like commercial, smaller tonnage units was down slightly in the quarter. Larger tonnage units are actually weaker because of the larger projects being delayed or deferred. We continue to gain share as a result of the investment that we've made in both new products as well as channel. 
So when you look at the whole space, we're still pretty bullish that these are very attractive end markets with long-term secular trends that align very well with our core, and a lot of focus now on energy and sustainability, which is going to drive, I think, is going to drive the industry. And we've been leading with the investments we've made in our YZ chillers and the increased tonnage that we're launching there, our rooftops, our premier choice in select rooftops. And ultimately, now we're investing more heavily in next-gen air cool technologies, electrification with heat pumps and heat transfer units and advanced VRF technology. 
So when you think of the space, there is some changes happening in the space, but we're invested to really capitalize on that going forward. And now with our larger installed base and now with the connectivity with our digital offering does give us an opportunity to really leverage that and build the Service business that we've been building. And so I think the trends are sequentially positive, some pressure on the larger nonresidential construction that we see being pushed to the right a bit, but we are seeing sequential improvement, Steve."

So what we're doing is, as we've really brought our strategy around Service to a whole new level here, we brought on new leadership.

We have significant opportunity to go back into that installed base and bring that forward. And that includes bringing holistic solutions, being able to get longer-term contracts with how we deploy those solutions, and then ultimately getting a recurring revenue that comes out of that work. And so it's been both. We're not only getting a higher attach with the new projects that were we're engineering and deploying and getting a higher attach rate because of the value proposition that we can bring with our OpenBlue capabilities combined with our Service capabilities in the field. But at the same time, being able to get additional volume by leveraging the installed base and bringing that forward with some of the new technologies and capabilities. And that all is supported with what we're doing in the field and being able to expand our technicians and the capabilities and capacity that we have in the field to be able to actually deliver the new solutions that we're providing.

It really is built on the depth and breadth of our product portfolio, which, as we have been reinvesting, is industry leading. We've been gaining share. We've had various new product introductions related to both the core HVAC and Fire & Security products as well as now products that are enabling the COVID response and healthy building opportunities. 
Just quickly, HVAC. We've had the continued tonnage expansion of the YZ chiller platform. We've had the Premier Choice Select rooftops. We've had the York Affinity series in residential and as well as additional heat pumps. In controls, we continue to advance our Amedisys 11, with continuous upgrades to enhance the capabilities and the better user interfaces. Security, with our Qualys business, we're now in a leadership position and we're a leader now in providing smart home solutions. Electronic Fire, and that's been very strong. Electronic Fire has been more around connectivity, notification, enhanced interfaces. And in fire suppression, although we're pressured over the last year or so in the high hazard business, we have continued to advance our sprinkler heads, and we're getting good traction there. 
So overall, the business recovers nicely. There was some pressure in the nonresi space remaining. But when you look at Q1, we definitely saw better than expected performance in. It would really be broken down into Rest of World Residential, which is our JCH business with better performance and a better recovery there and gaining share.

It's core to building systems. Very attractive margin profile due to the Service mix. We've got an incredible installed base, which creates significant recurring revenue in Service. And then when you look at these attributes, they're critical to what we're doing with OpenBlue and being able to really drive a comprehensive solution within the building, deploying technology in our go-to-market. 
And Security now is coming to the forefront because it takes all of what is done in a building, and it brings it together interactively and then being able to then manage the data that gets collected throughout the building. So that's been very important. 
When you look at the performance, we did moderate. The Service moderated in Q1. We're only down roughly about 1%, 1% or 2%. We saw North America recurring Service revenue turned positive, and a lot of that was our ability to be able to drive long-term contracts in the fire business. EMEALA, the overall Service turned positive, and Asia Pac is slightly down. 
When you look at where the pressure is right now, it's an install. And it's mainly due to project delays and general prioritization of HVAC around indoor air quality that's driving some of the resource allocation of our customers. But I believe that that's only a timing issue. These projects will be released, and we'll be able to be positioned and capitalize on those going forward. 
And the only other one to note, Andy, is the retail. Retail continues to be under pressure. It's down about the same that it was down in Q4. So we are -- it's a great business. It's a high-value proposition within the business. But given what's been happening in retail, we've been working to reposition ourselves to be critical to the essential retailers at the same time, while we're helping the less essential of the apparel retailers to expand their omnichannels in addition to their brick and mortar infrastructure. So that's where we are in Fire & Security, but still a very attractive business for us."

And then when you look at the verticals, certainly mixed. There's some verticals that still have strong growth and there's others that are being more challenged. 
So when you look at new construction starts, it's still under pressure. We are seeing retrofit activity related to Healthy Buildings and Service beginning to pick up -- pick back up. Our -- we do see our installed business growing low single digits this year in spite of those metrics because we've been reallocating our resources to the higher growth verticals and then being able to now capitalize on the retrofit opportunity that we see, both short and long term. 
When you look at the verticals, there are certain verticals that are under more pressure than others. When you think about the growth areas, better than 25% of our sales go into institutional markets. And both health care and education are -- they're definitely receiving a lot of attention right now with respect to building health. 
And then when you look at commercial office, it is more mixed with lower utilization rates near term. But we do believe that there's going to be a demand because there is a lot of interest in solutions now for what the new normal will be within these buildings. 
And so when you look at the overall impact of COVID, we believe that it has delayed the investment decisions, which is creating some uncertainty and limited visibility beyond the 6 months. But we believe that what we see with our pipeline, our pipeline has actually been growing. And we see now in North America, for instance, with the access restrictions continuing to be eased. We'll see some headwinds here in Europe and LatAm with some of the shutdowns and the like. 
But as we get into the second half of the year, we believe we start to recover. On orders, I mean orders are actually going to be recovering here in the second quarter. That will continue to improve through the course of the year and set us up well for 2022. We do have a $9 billion backlog, and that is up year-on-year. We believe the mix within that backlog is shorter cycle. So that is helping us book and turn through the course of the year, which is helping us be able to outperform the market within the nonresi market. And then with Service recovered now with PSAs, that is beginning to offset the pressure that we've had with some of these site restrictions.

So the investments that we're making is really -- what's enabling our ability to be able to get a higher attach rate is not only making sure we have the right capacity deployed across the regions and being able to go after. So historically, going after the installed base that's out there today that we've underserved, and then being able to bring those forward by upgrading and getting new technology deployed and getting a recurring revenue contract. But then on new, new solutions in how we now bring our technology investments and embed those into the overall solution, and then being able to then tie that to a long-term contract that enables us to be able to get that attached. That is the underlying strategy. 
So the investments that are being made are built into our products within -- at the product stage. They're built into our digital capabilities we're building with OpenBlue. And then it's ultimately making sure that we've got the infrastructure deployed within our regions to be able to successfully deliver that to our customers. And we have all of those elements that have been built into the plan and our reinvestment. And this has been ongoing here for the last 18, 24 months. And so we're starting to see the fruits of our labor with the work that we're doing. We're beginning to get the attachment rate on the new projects. We're beginning to get a pickup in service on the installed base. And all of that is leading to not only the higher attach rate, but higher revenue per customer, and ultimately, accelerating the overall Service growth rate."

I will start with a brief strategic update and summary of our Q1 results. Olivier will provide a more detailed review of those results and update you on our forward outlook. And we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.  
Let's get started on Slide 3. We are off to a strong start in the first quarter with solid financial performance and accelerating momentum on all of our strategic initiatives. As we will cover in a few minutes, top line performance was at the high end of the expectations we communicated to you last quarter, which, together with impressive operational execution across all segments, enabled us to grow EBIT by 5% year-on-year despite continued volume pressure related to the ongoing pandemic.  
A little bit of promise of a vaccine is sparking modest optimism in several of our end markets, many of which continue to show improving sequential demand. There are still many regions of the world facing second and third waves with varying degrees of lockdowns and restrictions. With that being the case, we have remained focused on the commitments we made to our employees, customers and suppliers. Our teams have come together to achieve truly extraordinary things, improving the fundamentals of our businesses and executing our overall strategy.
During the quarter, we were honored to receive recognition from several organizations. Additionally, as you may have seen in a separate press release issued earlier this morning, we announced an ambitious set of new ESG commitments, reinforcing sustainability as a top priority in our leadership role in climate change.  
Lastly, we continued to gain traction on several of our core growth initiatives, which we have been discussing with you over the last couple of quarters: scaling OpenBlue, driving higher service attachment rates and sales growth, and accelerating new product introductions.  
Please turn to Slide 4. There has been a tremendous amount of engagement at Johnson Controls over the last several months, both with our teams internally as well as with our customers and partners. In early December, we announced an exciting partnership agreement with Microsoft as part of our global collaboration to build a comprehensive digital twin platform that supports the entire ecosystem of a building. OpenBlue Digital Twin technology is transforming how buildings are conceived, built and operated, enabling the creation of digital replicas of physical spaces, systems, processes and people.  
The next floor on the page reflects the incredible efforts and leadership by countless individuals across various businesses and functions throughout the organization. I want to congratulate our colleagues across the company as it underscores the commitment to excellence we have been driving towards over the last few years.  
Additionally, I am honored to have been selected to serve as the Chair of the Energy & Environment Committee on the Business Roundtable. I look forward to working with my colleagues into having an opportunity to influence the nation's policies toward addressing climate change, the most significant challenge facing the planet today.  
On Slide 5, I would like to highlight the ambitious set of new ESG commitments we announced this morning. Sustainability is at the center of our vision for a healthy world and is integrated into our culture and values. Now with our OpenBlue platform, the value creation we provide to our customers is directly linked to ESG.  
In terms of our new environmental commitments, we are setting a goal through our science-based targets, which enable us to achieve net 0 carbon emissions before 2040, which is 10 years earlier than required by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's goal to cap global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050. Additionally, we will direct 75% of our R&D investment on new product development to products and solutions that address climate needs.  
On the social and governance side, we intend to double the representation of women and minorities in management roles by 2025. And finally, in terms of new commitments, beginning in fiscal 2021, we are including sustainability and diversity goals in senior leaders' performance assessments and linking those directly to executive compensation to ensure accountability.  
Turning to Slide 6 for an update on OpenBlue. The rollout of OpenBlue is going very well, and we remain encouraged by the high level of engagement we are seeing with customers and partners. We launched 7 new offerings this quarter, the most significant of which is OpenBlue Healthy Buildings, the industry's most comprehensive suite of connected solutions. This particular launch leverages the strength of our core capabilities, which, together with data-driven AI technologies, enables our customers to transform how people interact with their buildings, create intelligent, safe, dynamic environments, achieve their own green building goals and maximize return on investment with shorter paybacks. By combining these solutions, we create a holistic menu of offerings that prevent customers from having to choose between efficiency and sustainability.  
We now have 27 offerings available that solve for unique customer problems and serve a new market opportunity, which we sized at $10 billion to $15 billion and is growing at a double-digit CAGR over at least the next 5 years. We are ideally positioned with technologies and solutions that accelerate the transformation and reinvention of healthy buildings, which is directly aligned with the priorities of the incoming U.S. administration. Our pipeline continues to build, and momentum with key partners like Microsoft, Accenture and Salesforce is gaining steam.  
Turning to service on Slide 7. Service is an incredibly attractive business that is showing momentum with profitability that is 2x the company average. We are fully deploying resources to enhance our service offerings and leveraging the power of OpenBlue to drive mid-single-digit-plus organic growth on an annual basis, improve attachment rates in revenue per user as well as reduce attrition.  
Turning to new products on Slide 8. As most of you know, we have been engaged in a significant amount of reinvestment in new product development over the last several years. Our engineering and R&D efforts have been aimed at reinvigorating our core product portfolio, ensuring new technologies are connected and future-ready, while designing cost out of equipment and helping our customers reach their sustainability goals. 
We think about product investment as having 4 primary themes or drivers: regulatory and environmental, electrification, digital connectivity and, more recently, healthy occupants. We launched several new products in the quarter that address all of these themes. We continue to expand our chiller portfolio with equipment that uses low- or ultra-low GWP refrigerants. And in Q1, we did that with one of our water-cooled screw chiller platforms. We also launched our Mercury 2 smaller tonnage package split system that is already compliant with the 2023 emission standards change, 2 years ahead of time. YORK is the first in the industry with resi and light commercial product that is ready for the 2023 changeover.
In Asia, we launched an exciting new Side Flow VRF system, which is the first of its kind and opens a new market opportunity by enabling installation and building configurations that previously wouldn't accommodate top flow systems. And the modular design meets the needs of our customers who want to expand or retrofit existing spaces more easily and in a cost-effective way.  
Electrification is another big theme, particularly in Europe and Asia, which is driving significant demand for more energy-efficient heat pump technology across both HVAC and industrial refrigeration markets. This trend towards electrification is geared to lowering energy use, carbon emissions and the reliance on fossil fuels.
In addition to making sure that every piece of equipment that leaves our factory is enabled for connectivity, we are also investing significantly in cybersecurity technology, which has become increasingly important in a more digital world.  
Lastly, new demand for clean air technologies has resulted in some of the most rapid innovation sessions we have had. For example, our new premium Hitachi ductless system applies proprietary Frost Wash technology as well as more hygienic coils to increase the level of air quality in residential and small commercial applications.  
Over the last 12 months, we've been increasing the cadence of new product introductions, generating a higher level of product vitality than we have had in years past with over 150 new products planned in fiscal '21. We are also investing in our channel to expand our points of distribution and leverage strategic partnerships with large dealers and other channel players. We are seeing tremendous validation of our investment in the marketplace and would expect that to continue over the next several years.  
Before Olivier reviews Slide 9 in detail, I just wanted to reiterate our solid start to the year with improved performance in revenue, orders, profitability and overall earnings per share. Additionally, free cash flow was exceptionally strong.  
Now let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details."
282590,701064625,2185973,"Johnson Controls International plc, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Johnson Controls International plc","Executives","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone.  Continuing on Slide 9. Q1 sales declined 5% organically, improving sequentially compared to the 6% decline last quarter.

Continuing on Slide 9. Q1 sales declined 5% organically, improving sequentially compared to the 6% decline last quarter. Relative to our expectations, global products outperformed, primarily the result of continued high levels of demand for residential HVAC equipment, both here in North America as well as our Hitachi business in Asia Pacific, including China.  
Segment EBITA expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 12%, the highest margin rate in any first half since the merger, despite volume headwinds related to the pandemic. EPS of $0.43 increased 8%, benefiting from the higher profitability I just discussed as well as lower share count, as we have maintained a disciplined approach to capital allocation.  
Our free cash flow performance in the quarter was strong, up about 10% on a reported basis to over $400 million. I will provide the details on our cash performance later in the call, but the strong start in Q1 puts us on a path to achieve 100% conversion for the full year.  
Please turn to Slide 10. Orders of our Field businesses continue to improve with the year-over-year decline moderating to just 3% despite our installed business still experiencing pressure from slower non-resi newbuild activity, with retrofit activity showing signs of recovery. Service orders increased 2% overall, driven by Miller and supported by the recovery of our core commercial Fire & Security businesses in Europe.  
Our Global Products' book-to-bill was up slightly year-over-year with extremely strong growth in our North American resi HVAC business, up over 170% year-on-year. Backlog accelerated up 3% over the prior year to $9.5 billion, with service backlog up 8% to $2.5 billion and install backlog up 2% to just over $7 billion. We are beginning to see conversion rates in our service backlog accelerate, which gives us more confidence in our mid-single-digit growth outlook for that business.  
Our install backlog flow rate is improving, but still below historical levels. Where site access has been allowed, we have continued to execute larger projects that were funded prior to the pandemic. As those projects reach completion, incoming backlog is remixing towards shorter-cycle projects, which is positive for near-term margin outlook.  
Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 11. Operations, net of mitigating actions, netted to a $0.02 tailwind versus the prior year. Similar to the past several quarters, we experienced broad-based volume pressure and unfavorable mix. We remained in a positive price/cost position, and we continued to keep tight control on SG&A cost, including ongoing efforts to mitigate COVID-related volume declines. Net financing cost and controlling interest were each $0.01 headwind, with lower share count benefited us by $0.03.  
Let us turn to Slide 12 to discuss our segment results in more detail. My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 13. North America revenues declined 6% organically, with install down 9%. Sales in the new construction channel remained depressed as customers continued to delay large projects. And although retrofit activity was still down year-over-year in Q1 due to the drop in orders we experienced last year, we would expect this part of our install business to inflect over the next 2 quarters.  
Services declined 2%, with our recurring contractual service business up low single digits across all domain, offset by weakness in transactional service linked to customers' lower discretionary spend in the current environment. Segment margin increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 12.5%, primarily reflecting strong gross margin performance, up 90 basis points. Continued cost mitigation efforts and favorable mix also benefited us in Q1.  
Orders in North America declined 7%, improving slightly on a sequential basis, but impacted by significant declines in our federal government business. Persistent softness relating -- related to managing the pandemic was exacerbated by the disruption due to change in the administration. Backlog of $5.9 billion increased 1% year-over-year.
EMEA/LA revenues declined 5%, with install down 11% and service is flat. By geography, we saw continued challenges across our major regions, with most geographies back under significant restrictions or full lockdown due to the spark -- the spike in COVID cases in the second half of the quarter. Europe declined low single digits, while the Middle East saw significant pressure, down high teens against this quarter with continued weakness in HVAC business.
Latin America was down low double digits. EBITA margins rebounded, expanding 80 basis points from the prior year, as favorable mix, cost mitigation efforts and better fixed cost absorption more than offset the volume deleverage. Orders in EMEA/LA  grew 2% in the quarter, and backlog of $1.8 billion was up 5% year-over-year.  
APAC revenue were down 6%, with install down 11% and service up 1%. Sales in China turned positive, growing 2%, while other geographies throughout the APAC region have deteriorated modestly since last quarter due to renewed lockdowns and restrictions related to COVID-19 in areas like India, Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. That said, continued strength in China, a healthy backlog, stronger service activity and easy comps should allow us to post solid revenue growth over the next couple of quarters, with more modest growth in orders.
EBITA margins improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 12.8% as favorable mix and the benefit of mitigation actions more than offset the volume decline. Orders declined 1% in Q1 despite China orders growing 60% as renewed lockdowns and restrictions in several other key geographies offset. Backlog of $1.8 billion grew 12% year-over-year.  
Moving to Global Products. Revenue declined 2% on an organic basis in the quarter, better sequentially with continued outperformance from our residential HVAC and security businesses. North America resi HVAC grew 46% in the quarter as the market continues its sharp recovery and we continue to gain share as a result of expanding our points of distribution and new product launches. We would expect these trends to begin decelerating over the next several months, but sales growth should still be relatively strong.
In Asia Pacific, our resi HVAC business grew 2%, with growth in Taiwan and India more than offsetting a low single-digit decline in Japan. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, our Hisense JV in China grew 30% year-over-year in Q1. On the commercial HVAC side, sales declined at a high single-digits rate as the commercial market remains under pressure, particularly in light commercial unitary. 
Fire & Security products declined low single digits overall, with strong growth in our Security business more than offset by continued weakness in commercial fire detection and suppression markets. EBITA margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 11.9% as positive price/cost and the benefit of mitigating cost actions more than offset the volume decline and related absorptions as well as negative mix.  
Turning to Slide 14. Corporate expense was down significantly year-over-year to $67 million, benefiting from cost mitigation actions and continuous structural cost reductions. We do expect Corporate expense to step up next quarter and throughout the course of the second half as temporary cost reductions begins to reinstate. Given the favorable performance in Q1, we now expect Corporate expense to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million for the year.  
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 15, starting with the balance sheet at the top of the page, no significant changes versus the prior period. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares for roughly $350 million. As we have said, the balance sheet remains in very good shape.
On cash, we generated $424 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is truly remarkable performance for a quarter which typically experiences a cash outflow. As a reminder, beginning this year, we moved away from the adjusted free cash flow construct, so this represents true available free cash.
Our cash from operations and reported free cash flow last year included a $600 million tax refund as well as $100 million cash outflow related to integration costs. While there were clearly some timing benefits driving some -- the substantial year-over-year increase, with CapEx still in process and ramping back up, underlying operational performance was the primary driver.  
Now let's turn to Slide 16 for our outlook. Although the market remains uncertain, given the solid start to the year and slightly more visibility, our confidence in the outlook for fiscal '21 has increased. In addition to initiating fiscal Q2 guidance, we are also providing formal guidance for the full year.  
Starting with our full year guidance, we still expect organic revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits range, turning slightly positive in Q2 and then ramping significantly in the second half. As I mentioned last quarter, we will continue to manage cost over the course of the year, including the return of cost that were subject to temporary mitigation actions last year. And we'll look for additional opportunities to streamline some of these costs out on a permanent basis.
We have many levers to continue to improve overall profitability through actions focused on gross margin as well as SG&A. This, along with our continued strong execution, is expected to result in solid EBITA margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points for fiscal '21. Q2 margins are expected to expand by 80 to 100 basis points with continued benefits from cost actions.
EPS for the full year would be in the range of $2.45 to $2.55, up 9% to 14% over 2020, which, as you will recall, was up 14%. Q2 EPS would be in the range of $0.47 to $0.49. Given our strong cash performance in Q1, we are raising our outlook for free cash flow conversion on a reported basis to approximately 100% for the full year, overall, continued strong performance in what remains a challenging environment.  
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

So Nigel, when you look at our $6 billion service business, of course, as we've laid out, it's a very attractive vector for growth, and that has been accelerated with the healthy buildings trends. So when you look at historically, we've been under-serving our installed base. And so we've been going back after that, and we believe that that's a real material opportunity and a competitive advantage for us. We have been increasing our market coverage with people as well as enhancing the technology that we're deploying within our solutions with OpenBlue. When you look at the margin profile, it's 2x the overall company EBITA margin.
And as we now look at our new capabilities, differentiating our services with connectivity and utilization of data, that really gives us an opportunity to be able to get longer-term contracts, being able to solve bigger problems, be able to attach contracts and ultimately drive that attachment rate. We've seen great progress here in Q1. We're up about 90 basis points sequentially in Q1. We expect for the whole year that our attach rate will move up 300 or 400 basis points and will actually accelerate as we enter 2022. And so it's a combination of all of that, that truly positions us to be able to take what we've done historically and truly now move the needle with how we can attach a lot more to what we do to serve that installed base."

Now strategically, we've been investing in new services. We've been enhancing those services with OpenBlue. We've been targeting our installed base in a much more aggressive manner because we have an opportunity to be able to bring that forward with new technologies and be able to -- to be able to address some of the new challenges that our customers are facing.
So when you put all of that together and you look at our performance here, in Q1, we've been sequentially improving. We're only down -- when you look at our -- service was down 1%. It was down 3% in Q4. We're projecting here on a go-forward basis -- our orders were actually up 2% in the quarter. On a go-forward basis, we see our orders continuing to improve. We're getting a higher mix of longer-term contracts within those orders and that we believe that from a revenue standpoint, we turn positive here in Q2, and it will continue to ramp Q3 and Q4.
So it's really a combination of not only mining the installed base, adding additional capabilities within the field and being able to do that, be able to enhance the offerings, be able to get it connected, utilizing data, creating new outcomes and then ultimately being positioned here to attach. Our attach rate in the first quarter was up 90 basis points sequentially, and we see that improving 400 or 500 basis points over the year and then accelerating beyond that.

So applied HVAC orders were down low single digits, this is globally, now about 3%. We did see continued sequential improvement in the market through the quarter. We did see some pressure in North America, where it's purely due to timing of orders as well as some federal business that got pressured and, again, timing. And then Asia Pac continues to accelerate. China was up over 20%. 
When you look at the sales now, following the orders, the sales were down low to mid-single digits globally, about 4%. We did see sequential improvement in North America as well as APAC. APAC actually came back to being flat. And a lot of that is being driven by our service growth and the traction we're getting there. The North America install is better, and we're seeing the -- as Olivier said, we're seeing more retrofit quarter-on-quarter. 
And then when you look at unitary markets, they generally remain under pressure. They were down low single digits in Q1. The mix of that is -- like commercial, smaller tonnage units was down slightly in the quarter. Larger tonnage units are actually weaker because of the larger projects being delayed or deferred. We continue to gain share as a result of the investment that we've made in both new products as well as channel. 
So when you look at the whole space, we're still pretty bullish that these are very attractive end markets with long-term secular trends that align very well with our core. And a lot of focus now on energy and sustainability, which is going to drive, I think, is going to drive the industry. And we've been leading with the investments we've made in our YZ chillers and the increased tonnage that we're launching there, our rooftops, our premier choice in select rooftops. And ultimately, now we're investing more heavily in next-gen air cool technologies, electrification with heat pumps and heat transfer units and advanced VRF technology. 
So when you think of the space, there is some changes happening in the space, but we're invested to really capitalize on that going forward. And now with our larger installed base and now with the connectivity with our digital offering, it does give us an opportunity to really leverage that and build the service business that we've been building. And so I think the trends are sequentially positive, some pressure on the larger nonresidential construction that we see being pushed to the right a bit but we are seeing sequential improvement, Steve."

We have significant opportunity to go back into that installed base and bring that forward. And that includes bringing holistic solutions, being able to get longer-term contracts with how we deploy those solutions and then ultimately getting a recurring revenue that comes out of that work.
And so it's been both. We're not only getting a higher attach with the new projects that we're engineering and deploying and getting a higher attach rate because of the value proposition that we can bring with our OpenBlue capabilities combined with our service capabilities in the field, but at the same time, being able to get additional volume by leveraging the installed base and bringing that forward with some of the new technologies and capabilities.

Just quickly, HVAC, we've had the continued tonnage expansion of the YZ chiller platform. We've had the Premier, Choice, Select rooftops. We've had the YORK Affinity series in residential and as well as additional heat pumps.

It's core to building systems, very attractive margin profile due to the service mix. We've got an incredible installed base, which creates significant recurring revenue in service. And then when you look at these attributes, they're critical to what we're doing with OpenBlue in being able to really drive a comprehensive solution within the building, deploying technology in our go-to-market. And security now is coming to the forefront because it takes all of what is done in a building, and it brings it together interactively and then being able to then manage the data that gets collected throughout the building. So that's been very important. 
When you look at the performance, we did moderate -- the service moderated in Q1. We're only down roughly about 1% -- 1% or 2%. We saw North America recurring service revenue turned positive, and a lot of that was our ability to be able to drive long-term contracts in the fire business. EMEA/LA, the overall service turned positive, and Asia Pac is slightly down. 
When you look at where the pressure is right now, it's in install, and it's mainly due to project delays and general prioritization of HVAC around indoor air quality that's driving some of the resource allocation of our customers. But I believe that that's only a timing issue. These projects will be released, and we'll be able to be positioned and capitalize on those going forward. 
And the only other one to note, Andy, is the retail. Retail continues to be under pressure. It's down about the same that it was down in Q4. So we are -- it's a great business. It's a high-value proposition within the business. But given what's been happening in retail, we've been working to reposition ourselves to be critical to the essential retailers at the same time, while we're helping the less essential or the apparel retailers to expand their omni-channels in addition to their brick-and-mortar infrastructure. So that's where we are in Fire & Security, but still a very attractive business for us."

When you look at the market indicators coming out of 2020, they were pointing to a weaker new construction, that was ABI and construction starts and the like. And then when you look at the verticals, certainly mixed. There's some verticals that still have strong growth and there's others that are being more challenged.
So when you look at new construction starts, it's still under pressure. We are seeing retrofit activity related to healthy buildings and service beginning to pick up -- pick back up. Our -- we do see our install business growing low single digits this year in spite of those metrics because we've been reallocating our resources to the higher-growth verticals and then being able to now capitalize on the retrofit opportunity that we see, both short and long term. 
When you look at the verticals, there are certain verticals that are under more pressure than others. When you think about the growth areas, better than 25% of our sales go into institutional markets. And both health care and education are -- they're definitely receiving a lot of attention right now with respect to building health. And then when you look at commercial office, it is more mixed with lower utilization rates near term. But we do believe that there's going to be a demand because there is a lot of interest in solutions now for what the new normal will be within these buildings. 
And so when you look at the overall impact of COVID, we believe that it has delayed the investment decisions, which is creating some uncertainty and limited visibility beyond the 6 months. But we believe that what we see with our pipeline, our pipeline has actually been growing. And we see now in North America, for instance, with the access restrictions continuing to be eased, we'll see some headwinds here in Europe and LatAm with some of the shutdowns and the like. 
But as we get into the second half of the year, we believe we start to recover on orders. I mean orders are actually going to be recovering here in the second quarter. That will continue to improve through the course of the year and set us up well for 2022. We do have a $9 billion backlog, and that is up year-on-year. We believe the mix within that backlog is shorter cycle. So that is helping us book and turn through the course of the year, which is helping us be able to outperform the market within the non-resi market. And then with service recovered now with PSAs, that is beginning to offset the pressure that we've had with some of these site restrictions. 
So I believe you'll see that we're going to outperform through the course of the year. The market will continue to recover, and you'll start to see positive expansion within the industry metrics in 2022."

But on -- then on new solutions in how we now bring our technology investments and embed those into the overall solution and then being able to then tie that to a long-term contract that enables us to be able to get that attached, that is the underlying strategy. 
So the investments that are being made are built into our products within -- at the product stage. They're built into our digital capabilities we're building with OpenBlue. And then it's ultimately making sure that we've got the infrastructure deployed within our regions to be able to successfully deliver that to our customers. And we have all of those elements that have been built into the plan in our reinvestment. And this has been ongoing here for the last 18, 24 months.
And so we're starting to see the fruits of our labor with the work that we're doing. We're beginning to get the attachment rate on the new projects. We're beginning to get a pickup in service on the installed base.

Let's get started on Slide 3. We delivered another quarter of solid financial performance. Organic sales and order growth inflected positive as anticipated, which when combined with our ongoing commitment to operational excellence enabled us to grow EBIT by more than 20% year-over-year. Despite some challenges in the macro environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and the lingering impacts of COVID-19 trends across most of our end markets continue to improve, and we continue to gain share. We have maintained an incredible level of engagement with our teams globally as well as with our customers and partners. And we continue to execute on all of our strategic initiatives, expanding our service attachment rate and driving higher recurring revenue, enhancing and connecting our installed base with our digital OpenBlue platform and advancing our role in addressing the environmental needs of our customers. 
Lastly, as promised, we are announcing our constant goods reduction program on today's call, which targets $250 million in run rate savings by fiscal 2023. In combination with the SG&A actions we announced earlier this quarter, we expect to deliver $550 million in net savings, which provides significant margin expansion over the next several years. These actions are a testament to our commitment of continuous improvement that will enable us to close our margin gap versus peers. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. As was the case last quarter, we have had a number of strategic announcements. A few of the more notable examples are listed on the slide. Each of these is significant in its own right. But I do want to take a minute to touch on 2 in particular. And that's the announced acquisition of Silent-Aire and the partnership with Pelion. We are extremely excited to welcome the Silent-Aire team into the Johnson Controls family. Their best-in-class portfolio of innovative cooling equipment and modular data center technologies is tailored to hyperscalers. These specialized data center providers are building and operating the critical infrastructure that the world needs in the rapid global transition to consuming cloud-based software-as-a-service through well-established entrepreneurial spirit throughout Silent-Aire combined with a customer-centric culture, deep subject matter expertise and a long history of seamless execution. Expanding our exposure to the data center vertical and specifically, a high-growth hyperscale market, has been a high priority over the last several years. Silent-Aire accelerates these efforts considerably And together, we have an opportunity to leverage a best-of-both approach to fuel growth in this end market globally with a high return profile and immediate earnings accretion. 
We also announced a transformational partnership with the leading technology player in connected IoT device management, Pelion, a division of ARM Technologies. Put simply, this partnership allows us to bring connected intelligence to all of the operational technology, be it heat pumps, security sensors or air handling systems and buildings. This partnership will help remove the complexities associated with pushing that intelligence to the edge by leveraging Pelion's connected device platform with secure simple integrations across a diverse installed base of hardware. Pelion's open flexible device management capabilities will allow OpenBlue to run on any device in any hardware configuration at cloud scale and address the challenges with monitoring and maintaining performance at the edge. 
Moving to Slide 5. Turning to the theme of sustainability. We wanted to spend a few minutes highlighting 1 of the more important secular trends that we expect will benefit our industry for the next decade plus, and that is decarbonization. With buildings representing approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, large-scale investment in decarbonization is at an inflection point. We have seen corporate commitments to meeting science-based targets from over 1,000 companies and countless commitment to net 0 operations from the private sector. Federal policies and stimulus to incentivize investment in the renovation of existing infrastructure is growing and regulations designed to reduce emissions are increasing. We see the investment required for commercial buildings to achieve net zero, extending into the hundreds of billions of dollars. We believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this once-in-a-generation opportunity with a combination of efficient building systems and smart technologies that are connected via our digital infrastructure, OpenBlue, as well as our global presence, enabling us to convert on a local scale. 
Turning quickly to Slide 6. We are enabling net zero buildings today with a value proposition that is centered around transferring the risk of delivering building decarbonization from the building owner to JCI, leveraging flexible, customizable turnkey solutions and our improving capability of delivering energy savings and emission reductions. One such solution is OpenBlue Enterprise Manager, a comprehensive suite of applications to monitor and improve energy efficiency, tenant satisfaction, asset performance, maintenance operations, space performance and ultimately, the comfort of all occupants. Using a single pane of glass approach, Enterprise Manager delivers the next generation of smart building capabilities or portfolios ranging from commercial offices, health care, mixed-use high-end, transportation, retail and K-12 school systems. 
Turning to Slide 7. Another increasing area of focus when it comes to addressing decarbonization is the electrification of heat. This is a market that is growing at a high single-digit CAGR overall with a lot of that growth being driven by demand in Europe and Asia as a result of the increased level of environmental regulations in these regions that minimize the use of fossil fuels and mandate low GWP refrigerants. Many of you have asked recently about our offerings in this space. And from my perspective, I would tell you we have one of the broadest portfolios of heat pump technologies in the industry. As you can see, our portfolio spans all major building segments, residential, commercial and industrial covering a wide range of capacities and equipment configurations. We are the leader in the complex segment, which serves applications like district heating and industrial process manufacturing, with the most complete offering stretching between our applied and industrial refrigeration portfolios and utilizing natural and HFO refrigerants. District Heating is an exciting subsegment of growth in this category, particularly across Europe and China. In fact, we have had several major district heating project wins in these 2 regions recently, supplying customers with customizable solutions to help achieve their environmental goals and lower energy costs substantially. We also have a strong market position across commercial and residential markets in China with leading technologies in Applied [indiscernible]. 
Turning to Slide 8 and staying on the theme of sustainability. Our customers are challenged with balancing costs and achieving their sustainability goals. Our solutions are positioned to address those challenges and be more agile in providing outcome-based solutions and services centered around integrated data and reduce energy and cost while providing an attractive return on investment. As you can see on Slide 9, the enhanced capabilities enabled by OpenBlue, combined with our performance infrastructure business are proving to be a powerful combination in the current environment. Our energy savings performance contracts offer customers a budget-neutral way to fund the improvements necessary to reduce energy intensity and the environmental footprint of a building through guaranteed operational savings. This is a business we have been in for 2 decades, having implemented well over 3,000 performance contracts in North America alone with a portfolio of over $6 billion in guaranteed savings. Utilizing OpenBlue-as-a-service, we help our customers make and implement the decisions that improve a building's total cost of occupancy, energy and carbon profile as well as the well-being of their occupants without customers having to manage the process. We ensure our consistent availability to buildings and a predictable cost of operations. As a result, building owners are able to focus on their mission and their business. 
We are proud to be partnering with our customers on several new projects. We have listed 5 recent wins that showcase our ability to power sustainability for our customers. Before I turn things over to Olivier to review the financial performance for the quarter, let me wrap up my opening remarks by saying, we had a very strong first half of the year and I am extremely encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across Johnson Controls. Our teams remain focused on execution and are committed to achieving top-tier performance. We have a number of initiatives in-flight designed to accelerate top line growth and improve profitability and ensure we expand our competitive advantages. We continue to reinvest in our portfolio both organically and inorganically, and we believe we are extremely well positioned to outperform as we look to the second half of fiscal '21 and beyond. With that, let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details of the quarter."

Organic sales inflected positive as anticipated in Q2 up 1% overall, with strong growth in Global Products and underlying trends improving across our field businesses. The strength in Global Products was driven by continued high levels of the vend in residential end markets, not only in our HVAC equipment business but also in security products. The field businesses continue to improve on a sequential basis with service revenues having inflected positive and installed down low single digits. We have been encouraged by the more recent development of our order pipeline with clear signs of notable improvements in long cycle project activity. Segment EBITDA increased 15% versus the prior year, and segment EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 12.7%. Despite the modest recovery in overall volume growth, we have maintained our disciplined approach to managing the cost structure, resulting in additional year-over-year cost savings. We also benefited from strong execution across the board as well as positive price costs, helping to expand our gross margins by 80 basis points. EPS of $0.52 increased 24%, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. We had another strong quarter of free cash flow performance, up significantly versus the prior year to over $500 billion in Q2. 
I will review further details of our performance later in the call. Please turn to Slide 11. Orders for our field businesses increased 4% year-over-year, inflecting positive and stronger than originally planned, led by a strong rebound in retrofit project activity, which we include in-store. Backlog grew 4% to $9.6 billion. We service backlog up 5% to $2.4 billion and installed backlog up 4% to $7.2 billion. Conversion rates in our service backlog continue to accelerate, which gives us more confidence in our mid-single-digit service growth outlook for the year. Our installed backlog flow rate is improving, particularly given the rebound in shorter-term retrofit activity. 
Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 12. Operations were $0.10 tailwind versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, positive price cost and the incremental benefits from previous cost actions, which offset regional and business mix headwinds. Net financing charges added an additional $0.02, mainly the result of favorable FX gains and noncontrolling interest was a $0.05 headwind on as a result of stronger year-over-year performance in our Hitachi joint venture, lower share count and net favorability from other items were a combined $0.03 tailwind. 
Let us turn to Slide 13 to discuss our segment results in more details. My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 14. North America revenues declined 4% organically, driven by a 7% decline in install. As demand for shorter-term retrofit and upgrade projects continues to improve and comps become easier in the second half of the year, we expect the installed side of our business to grow as we move forward. Service revenues were flat in the quarter with our recurring contractual service business up low single digits, offset by continued pressure in transactional service linked to customers' lower discretionary spend. But domain applied HVAC revenues declined mid-single digits, while fire and security declined mid- to high single digits in the quarter. We had a very strong quarter in performance infrastructure, which was up mid-teens. Segment margin increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 12.7%, primarily reflecting strong gross margin performance, up 150 basis points and continued cost mitigation efforts. Orders in North America rebounded sharply on a sequential basis and grew 5% versus the prior year. Applied HVAC orders were up low double digits overall, driven by strong retrofit activity, backlog of $6 billion increased 3% year-over-year. 
EMEALA revenues were essentially flat organically with the prior year with install up 1% and service down 1%. The Market conditions remain mixed with varying degree of lingering COVID restrictions and lockdown across many parts of Europe and Latin America. We saw low single-digit growth in our applied HVAC and control business, which was more than offset by low single-digit decline in Fire & Security, which improved on a sequential basis. Industrial refrigeration grew mid-single digits. By geography, revenue in Europe grew low single digits, while the Middle East improved sequentially due to an acceleration in HVAC demand. Latin America was down high single digits. 
EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points, including a 40 basis point headwind from FX. Excluding FX, EBITDA margin was flat as favorable price/mix and continued cost mitigation efforts were more than offset by lower volumes and lower equity income. Orders in EMEALA accelerated to up 5% in the quarter, led by mid-single-digit growth in finance security and over 20% growth in industrial refrigeration. APAC revenues increased 9% organically with install up 15% and services up 3%, both led by a recovery in applied HVAC and Control, which grew a little over 20%. Strength in HVAC was driven by the rapid recovery we are seeing in China, where revenue growth accelerated more than expected, up more than 60% year-over-year. Conditions outside of China remain mixed with sporadic lockdown restrictions across part of South East Asia and spike in COVID cases in India. EBITDA margins declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 12.3%, including a 20 basis point headwind from FX and the divestiture. Core margins improved by 10 basis points as the benefit of volume leverage was partially offset by unfavorable country mix. APAC orders declined 1% despite a 40% increase in China orders as the economic recovery in many of our other key geographies remain subdued due to the ongoing impacts of COVID and delayed rollouts of vaccines. 
Moving to Global Products. Revenue grew 6% on an organic basis in the quarter. Our global residential HVAC business was up about 20% in the quarter with strong growth in all regions. In North America, resi HVAC grew 35% in the quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations. as the market seems to remain in a V-shaped recovery, and we continue to gain share as a result of expanding our points of distribution and new product launches. Orders in the quarter were nearly up 90%, and we exited the quarter with a record level of backlog. 
In Asia Pacific, our CH residential HVAC business was up in the mid-teens percent range with growth across all of our major regions, Japan, Taiwan and India. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, Our iStent JV in China grew revenues 90% year-over-year in Q2, which explains the majority of the growth in our equity income this quarter. On the commercial HVAC side, the sales decline significantly moderated to low single digits as high single-digit growth in our indirect applied business was more than offset by a decline in light commercial. Fire & Security products grew low single digits overall, led by continued strength in our security business with flattish performance in commercial fire detection and suppression markets. 
EBITDA margins expanded 280 basis points year-over-year to 14.2% as volume leverage positive price cost, higher equity income and the benefit of mitigating cost actions was partially offset by negative product mix. 
Turning to Page 15. Corporate expense was down 15% year-over-year to $70 million, benefiting from cost mitigation actions and continuous structural cost reductions. We do expect corporate expense to step up in the second half as some temporary cost reductions begin to reinstate. Given the favorable performance year-to-date, we now expect corporate expense to be in the range of $285 million to $295 million for the year. For modeling purposes, we have included an updated outlook for some of our below-the-line items. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 16. Starting with the balance sheet at the top of the page, similar to last quarter, no significant changes versus the prior period. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares for roughly $315 million, which brings us to around 14 million shares year-to-date for just under $700 million. We remain committed to completing $1 billion in share repurchases in fiscal '21. As a reminder, you may recall that in mid-March, we announced an increase to our annual cash dividend of 4% to $1.08 per share, remaining within our target payout ratio of 40% to 45%. This is the first dividend raise since the divestiture of Power Solutions back in 2019, and we believe we are positioned to resume a pattern of solid dividend growth going forward. We also announced an increase to our existing share repurchase authorization, which gives us the capacity for a little less than $6 billion in buyback. Our balance sheet remains healthy with leverage of roughly 1.8x, still below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. 
On cash, we generated $539 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly $1 billion for the first half. This is a significant improvement compared to our normal seasonality and has been driven by solid trade capital management, lower CapEx and timing of payments. As we enter our back half, we would expect lower conversion levels Then what we have seen in the first half and compared to our historical seasonality, given the expected acceleration in our top line and CapEx spend. 
Before we turn to our guidance update, as George referenced at the start of the call, we're launching Phase 2 of our 3 years cost program, presenting the detail of our cost of goods saving plan on Slide 17. Similar to our SG&A savings plan announced intra-quarter, we completed a bottoms-up analysis of the entire $15 billion based on cost of goods sold and have thoroughly evaluated plans to optimize our spend in selected areas. We have included a breakdown of the addressable spend category on Slide 18. Based on our review, we have built a firm roadmap to $250 million in net run rate savings to be realized over the course of fiscal '22 and '23. Nearly 3/4 of these savings are tied to plans that improve labor productivity, standardized project execution practices and streamlined by office activities across our branch-based businesses. The remaining 25% primarily address costs in our manufactured facility and supply chains, including leveraging best practices of our Level 3 GCOS facilities and deploying them across our manufacturing base. We have combined our SG&A and COGS saving programs into a single consolidated view on Slide 19. As you can see from the chart, we are targeting $550 million in combined net savings over the course of the next 2.5 years, which in addition to normal base margin improvement related to revenue growth, improved mix and annual productivity provides significant margin run rate potential. Delivering on this plan will ensure we close the margin gap versus peers and, in turn, create significant shareholder value. 
Please turn to Slide 20. When we are initiating fiscal Q3 guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $0.82, which is predicated on mid-teens organic revenue growth and more modest segment EBITDA margin performance compared to what we have experienced in the first half, given the significant temporary cost actions taken last year during the third quarter. For the full year, we're raising our guidance once again and now our target adjusted EPS in the range of $2.58 to $2.65. This compares to our most recent EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.60 and our initial guide in January of $2.45 to $2.55. You may recall that we provided updated EPS guidance intra-quarter in conjunction with our SG&A cost reduction plan in late February. Based on our strong performance in the first half, and continued underlying momentum we are seeing in most of our end markets, we are raising our organic sales growth outlook to the high end of our previous range. Segment EBITDA margins are tracking towards the high end of our most recent range, and we now expect 70 to 90 basis points of expansion for the full year. 
Free cash flow conversion is well on track for 100% for the full year. Before we get into our questions, I would like to point to our Slide 21 and ask you to save the date for our 2021 Investor Day, which will be held on September 8. More details to follow in the coming months. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

When you look at the quarter, service orders were down slightly and is mainly just timing of conversion. We had an extremely strong March, which is continuing in April. Our service pipeline is up double digit. And then with the site access improving, that's also helping us to accelerate our L&M and our L&M contracts, which is labor and material. So our attach rate, when you look at our attach rate for service with our installed projects is up significantly, up 300 basis points year-to-date. And so when you look at our backlog up 5% and the strong pipeline and then the work that we've done executing on our strategy, we're very well positioned for a strong double-digit second half in both orders and revenue."

So when you look at healthy buildings, our OpenBlue healthy buildings launched in mid-January with a solution portfolio of over 25 unique products and services, which is targeted at healthy people, places, planet. The market opportunity continues to grow. We originally sized it at $10 billion to $15 billion, and that continues to increase. Our pipeline is nearing $1 billion. Year-to-date, we've secured over $150 million. We expect this to continue to play through with a few hundred million in 2021. We partnered with schools. We've got an incredible base of business with K-12 schools. We're working closely where we have presence with over 6,000 districts. We're working with sports venues and the like to bring back people to sports events. And so when you look at what we're doing, it's really a robust approach that ultimately starts with a detailed assessment and then through monitoring, remote maintenance and optimization that we can do ultimately driving the best solution. And so we're extremely excited. And then lastly, with OpenBlue, in general, across the board, it's really translating to multiple elements. It's improving our service attach rates. It's improving profitability in our businesses with the book margins that we're booking. It's making us more competitive now in the overall smart buildings with our leadership in sustainability and decarbonization, which I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks. And then the overall acceleration of digitization within our existing service base through connectivity, going back and getting our installed base connected has given us an incredible platform now to become much more intimate with our customers and bring our new capabilities to really change the game and how we serve them."

That has served us extremely well as we get into the cycle with accelerating inflation. So with that, we have improved discipline in the field. We're executing projects better at better margin rates. And then within our product businesses where you see the impact sooner because of the material cost, we've been able to have a very dynamic pricing model that has been deployed across each one of our platforms to ultimately not only see what's happening in the near term, but longer term, being able to be very dynamic in how we pass that along into the channels. And so to date, we've -- in the second quarter, we had about a 30 basis point benefit. And we believe that the work we're doing, not only in productivity, VAVE, direct material productivity, designing material costs out of our products and then ultimately driving just improved productivity across the entire supply chain that we're still in a position to be net positive here in the second half.

If you look at our installed business, which is about 35% of the revenue of the organization, we see this business now growing, and that is done at the back of the retrofit market. Usually 50% of install is associated with new buildings. The new buildings today are depressed.

It is about 40% of our total revenues. It's core to Building Systems. It's got a very attractive margin profile due to the product and service mix. We've got a large installed base, which ultimately drives the recurring revenue. And this combined now with OpenBlue, we can truly differentiate what we do longer term to get a higher percentage of that recurring revenue. And security now in the new world, in the digital world, that now is becoming a critical asset as we think about our smart buildings to be able to collect data and apply analytics. And when you look at the sequential trends, Our short-cycle business in fire and security is up nicely. When you look at products up, total products is going to be up -- it's up about low to mid-single digits. And then our service actually inflected positive in the field businesses, which, as you know, because of all of the shutdowns, we had a lot of difficulty over the last few quarters to be able to get in and perform the service. 
So I think as we go forward, those trends on the shorter cycle is coming through very nicely. And then on the installed side, as these new projects that come into market, both in retrofit and in install, which are longer cycle, we're getting more than our fair share on that. So as they're coming to market and these projects start to be deployed, we're very well positioned to be able to start to pick up the install revenues. But I would tell you the shorter-cycle piece is actually performing very well. And so even though the installed revenues were down, it's mainly just a function of timing, of conversion, and we see the orders now picking up very nicely in the second half."

The 3 large COVID relief packages, they totaled about $5 trillion in aid over the last 12 months, much needed relief for our customers. We were very active in participating in making sure as those builds were put together, that certainly was focused on healthy buildings and making sure that as we -- whether it's bringing students back to the school room or the like or buildings, we're very actively involved in making sure that the details of what was going to be needed to be able to address some of the new challenges were actually incorporated in the bills. And when you look at the funding directed to upgrading facilities in the vertical markets that we have the highest exposure in deep relationships, it is K-12, higher ed and then state and local government, which play to our strengths. 
And so when you look at your question on education, K-12, we have relationships across North America or the U.S. with about 6,000 school districts, and then at the higher ed level, about 1,900. They all -- this all plays right into our strengths. And so in K-12 alone, there's been about $195 billion allocated. And so what we've done is making sure that not only right from the front end of building the build to now executing state-by-state with what we have as a program management office We're making sure we're detailing all of the flow of that stimulus and that we're positioned to be able to address the challenges that they're going to deploy that stimulus to be able to address. And so we think the TAM for the U.S., you're in billions of dollars relative to the opportunity that we see as we're going after this. And the healthy -- and healthy buildings market itself, we said it was originally 10 to 15. That continues to be expanded with the stimulus is coming into the market. So we believe that we're in the early stages with the pipeline that we see that it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars that we can be well positioned to execute on."

But as you dig into the specific products in every category, we're gaining share. So if you look into, for instance, in the unitary business in the commercial side, new orders in North America for equipment for the rooftops is up mid-teens and with March up over 30%. Our backlog is up 100%. Now those orders are in our product-based business. So you wouldn't see those orders. It's in the -- obviously, inherent in the book and bill. And then when you look at our unitary share, we're up about 40 basis points year-over-year. And so as we look at the backlog being up 100% and the projected growth here in the third quarter, In North America unitary, we're projecting we're going to be up 30-plus percent in the quarter and third quarter. So that would be the commercial side. 
On the residential side, our orders were up again about 88%, record level of backlog there. Our sales were up about 35% with our units were up over 40%. We're seeing strong sell- through that channel. We're going to see continued strength in Q4 -- on Q3 and Q4. And so that's continuing. When you look at -- and the same holds true in our Hitachi business in Asia Pac, we got strong double-digit revenue there, mainly driven by Japan, and that's been because of a gain share with our new product introductions. And then when you look at even in North America, when you look at even though our installs showed our orders were up about 5%. And underlying in those orders, in North America, we saw mid-teens growth in applied equipment orders. So that is going to play out very nicely for us in the second half and ultimately set us up for increased service attach and service revenue going forward. So you got to look at the details to understand that in every category, whether it be through our distribution or as we now set up our install business that we're setting it up for the longer term that's going to be very attractive. 
And just building off one thing that Olivier said, when you look at our install business, we have significantly outperformed through this cycle. With the non-resi construction down as much as it is, we were able to actually fill most of that void with short-term retrofit upgrade orders, which in North America alone were up 20% in the quarter. 
Now we're seeing a fundamental that with the short-term demand, that's going to continue. It's going to continue around healthy buildings and sustainability projects. That's going to now combine with what we see happening in nonresidential new demand coming through. This is the first that I've seen the 2 coming together, and it's going to play out very well in the second half for strong orders as well as beginning to convert to strong revenue in the second half."

Thank you for joining us on today's call. I will start with a brief strategic update, highlighting a few specific areas related to our growth initiatives. Olivier will provide a detailed review of Q2 results",1497,"Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I will start with a brief strategic update, highlighting a few specific areas related to our growth initiatives. Olivier will provide a detailed review of Q2 results and update you on our forward outlook. And we will leave as much time as possible to take your questions. 
Let's get started on Slide 3. We delivered another quarter of solid financial performance. Organic sales and order growth inflected positive, as anticipated, which, when combined with our ongoing commitment to operational excellence, enabled us to grow EBIT by more than 20% year-over-year. Despite some challenges in the macro environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and the lingering impacts of COVID-19, trends across most of our end markets continue to improve, and we continue to gain share. 
We have maintained an incredible level of engagement with our teams globally as well as with our customers and partners. And we continue to execute on all of our strategic initiatives, expanding our service attachment rate and driving higher recurring revenue, enhancing and connecting our installed base with our digital OpenBlue platform and advancing our role in addressing the environmental needs of our customers. 
Lastly, as promised, we are announcing our Cost of Goods Reduction Program on today's call, which targets $250 million in run rate savings by fiscal 2023. In combination with the SG&A actions we announced earlier this quarter, we expect to deliver $550 million in net savings, which provides significant margin expansion over the next several years. These actions are a testament to our commitment of continuous improvement that will enable us to close our margin gap versus peers. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. As was the case last quarter, we have had a number of strategic announcements. A few of the more notable examples are listed on this slide. Each of these is significant in its own right, but I do want to take a minute to touch on 2 in particular, and that's the announced acquisition of Silent-Aire and the partnership with Pelion. 
We are extremely excited to welcome the Silent-Aire team into the Johnson Controls family. Their best-in-class portfolio of innovative cooling equipment and modular data center technologies is tailored to hyperscalers. These specialized data center providers are building and operating the critical infrastructure that the world needs in the rapid global transition to consuming cloud-based Software as a Service through the well-established entrepreneurial spirit throughout Silent-Aire, combined with a customer-centric culture, deep subject matter expertise and a long history of seamless execution. 
Expanding our exposure to the data center vertical and, specifically, a high-growth hyperscale market, has been a high priority over the last several years. Silent-Aire accelerates these efforts considerably, and together, we have an opportunity to leverage a best-of-both approach to fuel growth in this end market globally, with a high-return profile and immediate earnings accretion. 
We also announced a transformational partnership with the leading technology player in connected IoT device management, Pelion, a division of Arm technologies. Put simply, this partnership allows us to bring connected intelligence to all of the operational technology, be it heat pumps, security sensors or air handling systems in buildings. 
This partnership will help remove the complexities associated with pushing that intelligence to the edge by leveraging Pelion's connected device platform with secure, simple integrations across a diverse installed base of hardware. Pelion's open, flexible device management capabilities will allow OpenBlue to run on any device in any hardware configuration at cloud scale and address the challenges with monitoring and maintaining performance at the edge. 
Moving to Slide 5. Turning to the theme of sustainability, we wanted to spend a few minutes highlighting one of the more important secular trends that we expect will benefit our industry for the next decade-plus, and that is decarbonization. With buildings representing approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, large-scale investment in decarbonization is at an inflection point. 
We have seen corporate commitments to meeting science-based targets from over 1,000 companies and countless commitments to net-zero operations from the private sector. Federal policies and stimulus to incentivize investment in the renovation of existing infrastructure is growing, and regulations designed to reduce emissions are increasing. 
We see the investment required for commercial buildings to achieve net zero extending into the hundreds of billions of dollars. We believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this once-in-a-generation opportunity with a combination of efficient building systems and smart technologies that are connected via our digital infrastructure, OpenBlue, as well as our global presence, enabling us to convert on a local scale. 
Turning quickly to Slide 6. We are enabling net-zero buildings today with a value proposition that is centered around transferring the risk of delivering building decarbonization from the building owner to JCI, leveraging flexible, customizable turnkey solutions and our improving capability of delivering energy savings and emission reductions. 
One such solution is OpenBlue Enterprise Manager, a comprehensive suite of applications to monitor and improve energy efficiency, tenant satisfaction, asset performance, maintenance operations, space performance and, ultimately, the comfort of all occupants. Using a single pane of glass approach, Enterprise Manager delivers the next generation of smart building capabilities or portfolios ranging from commercial offices, health care, mixed-use high-end, transportation, retail and K-12 school systems. 
Turning to Slide 7. Another increasing area of focus when it comes to addressing decarbonization is the electrification of heat. This is a market that is growing at a high single-digit CAGR overall, with a lot of that growth being driven by demand in Europe and Asia as a result of the increased level of environmental regulations in these regions that minimize the use of fossil fuels and mandate low-GWP refrigerants. 
Many of you have asked recently about our offerings in this space. And from my perspective, I would tell you, we have one of the broadest portfolios of heat pump technologies in the industry. As you can see, our portfolio spans all major building segments: residential, commercial and industrial, covering a wide range of capacities and equipment configurations. 
We are the leader in a complex segment, which serves applications like district heating and industrial process manufacturing, with the most complete offering stretching between our applied and industrial refrigeration portfolios and utilizing natural and HFO refrigerants. District heating is an exciting subsegment of growth in this category, particularly across Europe and China. 
In fact, we have had several major district heating project wins in these 2 regions recently, supplying customers with customizable solutions to help achieve their environmental goals and lower energy costs substantially. We also have a strong market position across commercial and residential markets in China, with leading technologies in Applied and Ductless. 
Turning to Slide 8 and staying on the theme of sustainability, our customers are challenged with balancing costs and achieving their sustainability goals. Our solutions are positioned to address those challenges and be more agile in providing outcome-based solutions and services centered around integrated data and reduce energy and cost, while providing an attractive return on investment. 
As you can see on Slide 9, the enhanced capabilities enabled by OpenBlue, combined with our performance infrastructure business, are proving to be a powerful combination in the current environment. Our energy savings performance contracts offer customers a budget-neutral way to fund the improvements necessary to reduce energy intensity and the environmental footprint of a building through guaranteed operational savings. 
This is a business we have been in for 2 decades, having implemented well over 3,000 performance contracts in North America alone, with a portfolio of over $6 billion in guaranteed savings. Utilizing OpenBlue as a Service will help our customers make and implement the decisions that improve a building's total cost of occupancy, energy and carbon profile as well as the well-being of their occupants without customers having to manage the process. 
We ensure our consistent availability to buildings and a predictable cost of operations. As a result, building owners are able to focus on their mission and their business. We are proud to be partnering with our customers on several new projects. We have listed 5 recent wins that showcase our ability to power sustainability for our customers. 
Before I turn things over to Olivier to review the financial performance for the quarter, let me wrap up my opening remarks by saying, we had a very strong first half of the year, and I am extremely encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across Johnson Controls. Our teams remain focused on execution and are committed to achieving top-tier performance. 
We have a number of initiatives in-flight designed to accelerate top line growth and improve profitability and ensure we expand our competitive advantages. We continue to reinvest in our portfolio, both organically and inorganically, and we believe we are extremely well positioned to outperform as we look to the second half of fiscal '21 and beyond. 
With that, let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details of the quarter."
282590,711405495,2264966,"Johnson Controls International plc, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Johnson Controls International plc","Executives","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on Slide 10. Organic sales inflected positive, as anticipated, in Q2, up 1% overall, with strong growth in Global Products and underlying trends improving across our field businesses. The strength",2044,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on Slide 10. Organic sales inflected positive, as anticipated, in Q2, up 1% overall, with strong growth in Global Products and underlying trends improving across our field businesses. The strength in Global Products was driven by continued high levels of demand in residential end markets, not only in our HVAC equipment business, but also in security products. 
The field businesses continue to improve on a sequential basis, with service revenues having inflected positive, and install down low single digits. We have been encouraged by the more recent development of our order pipeline, with clear signs of notable improvements in long-cycle project activity. 
Segment EBITDA increased 15% versus the prior year, and segment EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 12.7%. Despite the modest recovery in overall volume growth, we have maintained our disciplined approach to managing the cost structure, resulting in additional year-over-year cost savings. 
We also benefited from strong execution across the board as well as positive price costs, helping to expand our gross margins by 80 basis points. EPS of $0.52 increased 24%, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. We had another strong quarter of free cash flow performance, up significantly versus the prior year to over $500 million in Q2. I will review further details of our performance later in the call. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Orders for our field businesses increased 4% year-over-year, inflecting positive and stronger than originally planned, led by a strong rebound in retrofit project activity, which we include in install. Backlog grew 4% to $9.6 billion, with service backlog up 5% to $2.4 billion and install backlog up 4% to $7.2 billion. 
Conversion rates in our service backlog continue to accelerate, which gives us more confidence in our mid-single-digit service growth outlook for the year. Our install backlog flow rate is improving, particularly given the rebound in shorter-term retrofit activity. 
Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 12. Operations were a $0.10 tailwind versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, positive price cost and the incremental benefits from previous cost actions, which offset regional and business mix headwinds. Net financing charges added an additional $0.02, mainly the result of favorable FX gains. And noncontrolling interest was a $0.05 headwind as a result of stronger year-over-year performance in our Hitachi joint venture. Lower share count and net favorability from other items were a combined $0.03 tailwind. 
Let us turn to Slide 13 to discuss our segment results in more details. My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 14. 
North America revenues declined 4% organically, driven by a 7% decline in install. As demand for shorter-term retrofit and upgrade projects continues to improve and comps become easier in the second half of the year, we expect the install side of our business to grow as we move forward. 
Service revenues were flat in the quarter, with our recurring contractual service business up low single digits, offset by continued pressure in transactional service linked to customers' lower discretionary spend. Both domain Applied HVAC revenues declined mid-single digits, while Fire & Security declined mid- to high single digits in the quarter. We had a very strong quarter in performance infrastructure, which was up mid-teens. 
Segment margin increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 12.7%, primarily reflecting strong gross margin performance, up 150 basis points, and continued cost mitigation efforts. Orders in North America rebounded sharply on a sequential basis and grew 5% versus the prior year. Applied HVAC orders were up low double digits overall, driven by strong retrofit activity, backlog of $6 billion increased 3% year-over-year. 
EMEALA revenues were essentially flat organically with the prior year, with install up 1% and service down 1%. Market conditions remain mixed, with varying degree of lingering COVID restrictions and lockdown across many parts of Europe and Latin America. 
We saw low single-digit growth in our Applied HVAC & Control business, which was more than offset by low single-digit decline in Fire & Security, which improved on a sequential basis. Industrial Refrigeration grew mid-single digits. By geography, revenue in Europe grew low single digits, while the Middle East improved sequentially due to an acceleration in HVAC demand. Latin America was down high single digits. 
EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points, including a 40 basis point headwind from FX. Excluding FX, EBITDA margin was flat as favorable price/mix and continued cost mitigation efforts were more than offset by lower volumes and lower equity income. Orders in EMEALA accelerated to up 5% in the quarter, led by mid-single-digit growth in Fire & Security and over 20% growth in Industrial Refrigeration. 
APAC revenues increased 9% organically, with install up 15% and services up 3%, both led by a recovery in Applied HVAC & Control, which grew a little over 20%. Strength in HVAC was driven by the rapid recovery we are seeing in China, where revenue growth accelerated more than expected, up more than 60% year-over-year. Conditions outside of China remain mixed, with sporadic lockdown restrictions across part of South East Asia and a spike in COVID cases in India. 
EBITDA margins declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 12.3%, including a 20 basis point headwind from FX and the divestiture. Core margins improved by 10 basis points as the benefit of volume leverage was partially offset by unfavorable country mix. APAC orders declined 1% despite a 40% increase in China orders as the economic recovery in many of our other key geographies remain subdued due to the ongoing impacts of COVID and delayed rollouts of vaccines. 
Moving to Global Products. Revenue grew 6% on an organic basis in the quarter. Our global Residential HVAC business was up about 20% in the quarter, with strong growth in all regions. In North America, resi HVAC grew 35% in the quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations as the market seems to remain in a V-shaped recovery, and we continue to gain share as a result of expanding our points of distribution and new product launches. Orders in the quarter were nearly up 90%, and we exited the quarter with a record level of backlog. 
In Asia Pacific, our JCH Residential HVAC business was up in the mid-teens percent range, with growth across all of our major regions: Japan, Taiwan and India. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, our Hisense JV in China grew revenues 90% year-over-year in Q2, which explains the majority of the growth in our equity income this quarter. 
On the Commercial HVAC side, the sales decline significantly moderated to low single digits as high single-digit growth in our indirect applied business was more than offset by a decline in light commercial. Fire & Security products grew low single digits overall, led by continued strength in our security business, with flattish performance in commercial fire detection and suppression markets. EBITDA margins expanded 280 basis points year-over-year to 14.2% as volume leverage, positive price cost, higher equity income and the benefit of mitigating cost actions was partially offset by negative product mix. 
Turning to Page 15. Corporate expense was down 15% year-over-year to $70 million, benefiting from cost mitigation actions and continuous structural cost reductions. We do expect corporate expense to step up in the second half as some temporary cost reductions begin to reinstate. Given the favorable performance year-to-date, we now expect corporate expense to be in the range of $285 million to $295 million for the year. For modeling purposes, we have included an updated outlook for some of our below-the-line items. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 16. Starting with the balance sheet at the top of the page, similar to last quarter, no significant changes versus the prior period. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares for roughly $315 million, which brings us to around 14 million shares year-to-date for just under $700 million. We remain committed to completing $1 billion in share repurchases in fiscal '21. 
As a reminder, you may recall that in mid-March, we announced an increase to our annual cash dividend of 4% to $1.08 per share, remaining within our target payout ratio of 40% to 45%. This is the first dividend raise since the divestiture of Power Solutions back in 2019, and we believe we are positioned to resume a pattern of solid dividend growth going forward. We also announced an increase to our existing share repurchase authorization, which gives us the capacity for a little less than $6 billion in buyback. Our balance sheet remains healthy, with leverage of roughly 1.8x, still below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. 
On cash, we generated $539 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly $1 billion for the first half. This is a significant improvement compared to our normal seasonality and has been driven by solid trade capital management, lower CapEx and timing of payments. As we enter our back half, we would expect lower conversion levels than what we have seen in the first half and compared to our historical seasonality, given the expected acceleration in our top line and CapEx spend. 
Before we turn to our guidance update, as George referenced at the start of the call, we're launching Phase 2 of our 3 years cost program, presenting the detail of our cost of goods saving plan on Slide 17. Similar to our SG&A savings plan announced intra-quarter, we completed a bottoms-up analysis of the entire $15 billion based on cost of goods sold and have thoroughly evaluated plans to optimize our spend in selected areas. 
We have included a breakdown of the addressable spend category on Slide 18. Based on our review, we have built a firm road map to $250 million in net run rate savings to be realized over the course of fiscal '22 and '23. Nearly 3/4 of these savings are tied to plans that improve labor productivity, standardized project execution practices and streamlined by office activities across our branch-based businesses. The remaining 25% primarily address costs in our manufacturing facility and supply chains, including leveraging best practices of our Level 3 GCOS facilities and deploying them across our manufacturing base. 
We have combined our SG&A and COGS saving programs into a single consolidated view on Slide 19. As you can see from the chart, we are targeting $550 million in combined net savings over the course of the next 2.5 years, which, in addition to normal base margin improvement related to revenue growth, improved mix and annual productivity, provides significant margin run rate potential. Delivering on this plan will ensure we close the margin gap versus peers and, in turn, create significant shareholder value. 
Please turn to Slide 20. When we are initiating fiscal Q3 guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $0.82, which is predicated on mid-teens organic revenue growth, and more modest segment EBITDA margin performance compared to what we have experienced in the first half, given the significant temporary cost actions taken last year during the third quarter. For the full year, we're raising our guidance once again, and now our target adjusted EPS in the range of $2.58 to $2.65. This compares to our most recent EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.60, and our initial guide in January of $2.45 to $2.55. 
You may recall that we provided updated EPS guidance intra-quarter in conjunction with our SG&A cost reduction plan in late February. Based on our strong performance in the first half, and continued underlying momentum we are seeing in most of our end markets, we are raising our organic sales growth outlook to the high end of our previous range. Segment EBITDA margins are tracking towards the high end of our most recent range, and we now expect 70 to 90 basis points of expansion for the full year. Free cash flow conversion is well on track for 100% for the full year. 
Before we get into our questions, I would like to point to our Slide 21 and ask you to save the date for our 2021 Investor Day, which will be held on September 8. More details to follow in the coming months. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

When you look at the progress we're making with OpenBlue across the board, not only digitizing our core business, but now being able to, with the data that's being extracted and the solutions that now we're bringing to the market, truly now positioning us to capitalize on these significant accelerating trends. So when you look at healthy buildings, our OpenBlue Healthy Buildings launched in mid-January with a solution portfolio of over 25 unique products and services, which is targeted at healthy people, places, planet. 
The market opportunity continues to grow. We originally sized it at $10 billion to $15 billion, and that continues to increase. Our pipeline is nearing $1 billion. Year-to-date, we've secured over $150 million. We expect this to continue to play through with a few hundred million in 2021. 
We partnered with schools. We've got an incredible base of business with K-12 schools. We're working closely where we have presence with over 6,000 districts. We're working with sports venues and the like to bring back people to sports events. 
And so when you look at what we're doing, it's really a robust approach that ultimately starts with a detailed assessment. And then through monitoring, remote maintenance and optimization that we can do, ultimately driving the best solution. And so we're extremely excited. 
And then lastly, with OpenBlue, in general, across the board, it's really translating to multiple elements. It's improving our service attach rates. It's improving profitability in our businesses, with the book margins that we're booking. 
It's making us more competitive now in the overall smart buildings, with our leadership in sustainability and decarbonization, which I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks. And then the overall acceleration of digitization within our existing service base through connectivity, going back and getting our installed base connected, has given us an incredible platform now to become much more intimate with our customers and bring our new capabilities to really change the game in how we serve them."

The 100% free cash flow will include both the restructuring cash impact of our SG&A and COGS pronounced -- COGS programs announced today. You're right, more profit would be part of how we get there and also enhanced working capital. 
If you look at today, for the second quarter, we have improved cash conversion cycle by about 24 days, 8 in DSO, about 11 days in DIO, inventory, and about 5 days in DPO. And we have built, over the quarters, even before I took the position, a great machine to have a high focus on working capital. And you see that keep delivering. 
And we are actually very confident in our ability to deliver a 100% free cash flow this year, but also the following years, right? If you do some math, Jeff, just in the first half, we are converting at 140%. So we have quite a fair headroom to now achieve 100% for the year."

We identify opportunities to be able to reduce energy, improve operations and the like. And when we do that, there's significant improvement to be made. 
I mean buildings, historically, have been very inefficient. They've been very energy-intensive. And so our opportunity here is to be able to create an outcome, energy savings, higher operations, and then do that. We -- in some cases, we bring in financing for the project, and ultimately then get a recurring revenue that goes over -- it can be over 10, 15, 20-plus years, depending on the type of projects. 
These are great returns, great recurring revenue that's tied to that initial install project, and ultimately delivering on the outcome. And our track record in being able to deliver on the commitments that we make with these type of contracts is extremely high.

So with that, we have improved discipline in the field. We're executing projects better at better margin rates. And then within our product businesses, where you see the impact sooner because of the material cost, we've been able to have a very dynamic pricing model that has been deployed across each one of our platforms to ultimately not only see what's happening in the near term, but longer term, being able to be very dynamic in how we pass that along into the channels. 
And so to date, we've -- in the second quarter, we had about a 30 basis point benefit. And we believe that the work we're doing, not only in productivity, VAVE, direct material productivity, designing material costs out of our products and then ultimately driving just improved productivity across the entire supply chain, that we're still in a position to be net positive here in the second half.

And something important, if you look at our install business, which is about 35% of the revenue of the organization, we see this business now growing.

It is about 40% of our total revenues. It's core to building systems. It's got a very attractive margin profile due to the product and service mix. We've got a large installed base, which ultimately drives the recurring revenue. 
And this, combined now with OpenBlue, we can truly differentiate what we do longer term to get a higher percentage of that recurring revenue. And security now, in the new world, in the digital world, that now is becoming a critical asset as we think about our smart buildings, to be able to collect data and apply analytics. 
And when you look at the sequential trends, our short-cycle business in Fire & Security is up nicely. When you look at products, up -- total products is going to be up -- it's up about low to mid-single digits. And then our service actually inflected positive in the field businesses, which, as you know, because of all of the shutdowns, we had a lot of difficulty over the last few quarters to be able to get in and perform the service. So I think, as we go forward, those trends on the shorter cycle is coming through very nicely. 
And then on the install side, as these new projects that come into market, both in retrofit and in install, which are longer cycle, we're getting more than our fair share on that. So as they're coming to market, and these projects start to be deployed, we're very well positioned to be able to start to pick up the install revenues. 
But I would tell you, the shorter-cycle piece is actually performing very well. And so even though the install revenues were down, it's mainly just a function of timing of conversion, and we see the orders now picking up very nicely in the second half."

The 3 large COVID relief packages, they totaled about $5 trillion in aid over the last 12 months, much-needed relief for our customers. We were very active in participating in making sure, as those builds were put together, that certainly was focused on healthy buildings and making sure that, as we, whether it's bringing students back to the school room or the like or buildings, we're very actively involved in making sure that the details of what was going to be needed to be able to address some of the new challenges were actually incorporated in the bills. 
And when you look at the funding directed to upgrading facilities in the vertical markets that we have the highest exposure and deep relationships, it is K-12, higher ed and then state and local government, which play to our strengths. And so when you look at -- your question on education, K-12, we have relationships across North America or the U.S., with about 6,000 school districts, and then at the higher ed level, about 1,900. They all -- this all plays right into our strengths. 
And so in K-12 alone, there's been about $195 billion allocated. And so what we've done is making sure that not only right from the front end of building the build to now executing state-by-state with what we have as a program management office, we're making sure we're detailing all of the flow of that stimulus and that we're positioned to be able to address the challenges that they're going to deploy that stimulus to be able to address. 
And so we think the TAM for the U.S., you're in billions of dollars relative to the opportunity that we see as we're going after this. And the healthy -- and healthy buildings market itself, we said it was originally $10 billion to $15 billion. That continues to be expanded with the stimulus that's coming into the market. So we believe that we're in the early stages with the pipeline that we see, that it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars, that we can be well positioned to execute on."

So if you look into, for instance, in the unitary business in the commercial side, new orders in North America for RTU equipment for the rooftops is up mid-teens. And with March up over 30%, our backlog is up 100%. 
Now those orders are in our product-based business. So you wouldn't see those orders. It's in the -- obviously, inherent in the book and bill. And then when you look at our unitary share, we're up about 40 basis points year-over-year. 
And so as we look at the backlog being up 100% and the projected growth here in the third quarter, in North America unitary, we're projecting we're going to be up 30-plus percent in the quarter and third quarter. So that would be the commercial side. 
On the residential side, our orders were up again about 88%, record level of backlog there. Our sales were up about 35%, with our -- our units were up over 40%. We're seeing strong sell-through through that channel. We're going to see continued strength in Q4 -- on Q3 and Q4. And so that's continuing. 
When you look at -- and the same holds true in our Hitachi business in Asia Pac. We got strong double-digit revenue there, mainly driven by Japan, and that's been because of a gain share with our new product introductions. And then when you look at -- even in North America, when you look at -- even though our install shows -- showed our orders were up about 5%. And underlying in those orders, in North America, we saw mid-teens growth in applied equipment orders. 
So that is going to play out very nicely for us in the second half and ultimately set us up for increased service attach and service revenue going forward. So you got to look at the details to understand that, in every category, whether it be through our distribution or as we now set up our install business, that we're setting it up for the longer term that's going to be very attractive. 
And just building off one thing that Olivier said, when you look at our install business, we have significantly outperformed through this cycle. With the nonresi construction down as much as it is, we were able to actually fill most of that void with short-term retrofit upgrade orders, which, in North America alone, were up 20% in the quarter. 
Now we're seeing a fundamental that, with the short-term demand, that's going to continue. It's going to continue around healthy buildings and sustainability projects. That's going to now combine with what we see happening in nonresidential new demand coming through. This is the first that I've seen the 2 coming together, and it's going to play out very well in the second half for strong orders as well as beginning to convert to strong revenue in the second half."

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let me kick things off with a brief update, a few specific areas related to our strategic initiatives and Olivier will provide a detailed review of Q3 results and update you on our forward outlook. We will leave as much time as possible to take your questions. 
Let's get started on Slide 3. Another quarter of solid results with demand accelerating across most of our end markets as a robust recovery continues to expand. Q3 represents our easiest comparison of the year, but I am encouraged to see the underlying sequential improvement experienced in the first half continue to accelerate in the third quarter with many of our businesses back to operating at prepandemic volume levels. Nonresidential construction markets continue to recover, led by the ongoing strength in retrofit activity tied to demand for healthy building solutions. 
New construction is also beginning to show signs of stabilization and the inflection in order trends for our longer cycle project businesses sets us up well as we look to next year and beyond. Our service business has recovered, and we continue to transform this business through our digital service strategy to drive higher levels of recurring revenue and an improved growth profile. 
This recovery has not been without its challenges. We have managed through significant headwinds related to persistent supply chain disruptions, component shortages, labor constraints and continued inflation. While these dynamics have created some revenue pressure, which will continue near term, the pace and composition of order growth in the quarter provides confidence that we will remain on track over the medium and long term. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating these challenges, and I'd like to acknowledge and thank them for the tremendous amount of time and effort dedicated to meeting our customer needs, particularly over these last several quarters. 
As you may recall, in an effort to mitigate the severe impact of the volume declines during the height of the pandemic, we implemented significant cost actions last year. These actions provided a material boost to profitability in the prior year period and led to best-in-class decrementals. Lapping that difficult comparison in managing the return of some of those variable costs coupled with navigating current capacity constraints and supply disruptions has resulted in significant margin pressure. That said, we were able to deliver better-than-expected margin expansion in the quarter and remain on track to meet our targets for the full year, which is a remarkable accomplishment in the current environment. At the same time, we remain laser-focused on executing our strategy, which is driving continued share gains. 
As we will discuss over the next few slides, we continue to advance our efforts to deliver innovative solutions to help customers enhance building performance and reduce costs while achieving their net zero carbon and renewable energy goals. This will be accomplished through our ongoing digital transformation enabled by OpenBlue and accelerating our offerings to deliver the outcomes our customers need. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Continuing our trend to highlight a few notable achievements over the past quarter, recently, we launched the latest offering under our OpenBlue platform Net Zero Buildings as a Service. I will spend more time on this announcement in a few minutes as this represents an important step forward in enabling our customers' achievement of decarbonization and sustainability commitments. 
We have now filed our 200th U.S. patent application and received 90 U.S. patents for OpenBlue energy optimization innovations. We announced another strategic partnership with DigiCert, which will allow us to leverage their IoT device manager an industry-leading automated digital certificate platform to encrypt data and authenticate the identity of users, devices or services within a building. This will further expand Johnson Controls already robust capabilities around cybersecurity risk management providing our customers peace of mind and resilient solutions that ensure hardware, software and communications remain trusted throughout the building life cycle. 
Together with the announcement of our partnership with Pelion last quarter, OpenBlue solutions users will have confidence that their devices are safely and securely connected to the network. About 2 weeks ago, we launched the Community College partnership program aimed at expanding and advancing associate degree and certificate programs in HVAC, fire and security and digital building automation systems across the U.S. 
Over the next 5 years, Johnson Controls will grant $15 million to nonprofit community colleges in support of academic programs that train and develop the next generation of skilled trades technicians. In addition to the funding, Johnson Controls employees will be increasing their support through volunteer and mentorship programs and also provide a pathway for our student internships and entry-level employment opportunities. Lastly, we are proud to have received additional recognition for our efforts to ensure we create a diverse and inclusive work environment, recently being named as one of the best companies for multicultural women by [indiscernible] . We are also proud to be a part of the full of 2021 list of best employees for diversity as well as the Financial Times European Climate Leaders list further demonstrating our commitment to sustainability. Before I move to the next slide, I wanted to welcome  [indiscernible] our Chief Technology Officer to the team. VJ is transforming our software organization, strengthening our engineering development processes and expanding the solution set of our OpenBlue platform. We are excited to have Vijay on board. He is already having an incredible impact internally, and you will hear more from him at our upcoming Investor Day. 
Let's move to Slide 5 for a brief update on trends in our service business. As we have shared with you over the past couple of quarters, accelerating growth in service has been a strategic initiative underway since well before the pandemic. Ultimately, the actions we are taking are designed to drive 200 or 300 basis points of above-market growth, which would place us firmly in the mid-single-digit annual growth range for the entire $6-plus billion in revenues. Our approach is multifaceted, simultaneously focusing on increasing our contractual service attach rate, reducing attrition and driving higher revenue per user while transforming our offerings through digital. Enabling higher digital content and connecting our installed base compounds our ability to create higher levels of recurring revenue over time. 
In the quarter, service revenue increased 11%, in line with the rebound we expected with double-digit growth across all 3 regions. Order growth also accelerated, as expected, up 13%. And our attachment rate year-to-date has now improved close to 400 basis points, already achieving our guidance range for the full year. We expect to continue this pace going forward, again, aided by our digital services and solutions, which were up mid-teens in the quarter. 
Please go to Slide 6. I referenced our new OpenBlue offering, Net Zero Buildings as a service back on Slide 4, and I thought I would spend a few minutes highlighting the importance of this launch. Not only does this offering fulfill an immediate need as expressed by our customers, it also represents the next phase in the evolution of our digital smart buildings offerings, which will drive our shift towards increased deployment of higher recurring as-a-service revenue models. Our broad Building Systems portfolio and market-leading capabilities and expertise in ESCO projects combined with the OpenBlue software platform uniquely positions Johnson Controls to provide customers with guaranteed outcomes and risk management models to achieve their emission reduction commitments. 
Based on our high level of customer engagement and the extensive market-backed research conducted leading up to the development of this solution, the need for a trusted partner to deliver a one-source seamless road map to net zero and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions is clear. What is also clear is that digitally enabled solutions that tie together the IT and OT in the built environment are the only ways to provide these road maps. And nearly $250 billion, sustainability and decarbonization is a once-in-a-generation opportunity and we are excited about our role in leading these critical trends. 
Net Zero Buildings as a service includes a full portfolio of sustainability offerings tailored to schools, campuses, data centers, health care facilities as well as commercial and industrial verticals. It leverages a game-changing new solution, Net Zero Adviser, which delivers turnkey, AI-driven tracking and reporting of sustainability metrics and helps building operators ensure improved carbon reduction and renewable energy impacts of their buildings. We also leveraged the full OpenBlue suite of connected solutions and services offered through flexible risk-sharing models that enable tailored deal structures where end users pay for outcomes rather than assets. 
Turning quickly to Slide 7. Just a few examples of customer wins tied to the theme of decarbonization and net zero. I won't go through each of these. But in every example, Johnson Controls is providing unique solutions to solve the outcomes our customers are looking for. Some of these new relationships are borne out of our digital partner ecosystem while some are long-standing relationships where we are converting existing building automation systems to OpenBlue or advancing customers' ongoing sustainability initiatives. In all of these, we are driving energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption, driving cost savings and emission reductions. 
Before I turn things over to Olivier to review our financial performance in more detail, let me conclude my opening remarks by saying, I remain extremely encouraged by the demand patterns playing out across our portfolio. Our teams remain dedicated to achieving top-tier performance despite some of the short-term challenges we are facing. We are watching closely the resurgence of COVID cases and the potential impacts renewed lockdowns in supply chain constraints may or may not have on project activity. And from a supply chain perspective, we are confident in our ability to manage access to critical materials and components. 
Although lead times and conversion cycles are stretching, we believe conditions will begin to improve over the next couple of quarters. We are successfully leveraging our pricing capabilities to offset inflation, and we still expect to remain price cost positive for the year. At the same time, we are making tremendous progress on our strategic initiatives to accelerate top line growth and improve profitability, including indoor air quality, decarbonization, smart buildings, digital services and our productivity program, and we continue to reinvest in our portfolio, both organically and inorganically. 
We believe we are extremely well positioned to outperform throughout the next cycle. With that, let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details of the quarter."

The strength in Global",1672,"Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on Slide 8. Organic sales accelerated in Q3, up 15% of all in line with the guidance we provided last quarter as growth in Global Products and our field businesses accelerated. The strength in Global Products was across the board from continued high level of demand in residential end markets, including both our global HVAC equipment and security products to the anticipated rebound in commercial HVAC and Fire & Security. 
Segment EBITA increased 21% versus the prior year and segment EBITA margin expanded 30 basis points to 16.2%. Better leverage on higher volumes, the benefit of our SG&A actions and strong execution more than offset the significant headwind from the reversal of temporary cost reductions and a modest headwind from negative price cost. EPS of $0.83 increased 24%, benefiting from higher profitability as well as a lower share count. 
On cash, we had another strong quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was $735 million, flat versus the prior year despite the planned uptick in CapEx. I will review further details of our performance later in the call. 
Please turn to Slide 9. I Orders for our field businesses increased 18% year-over-year, accelerating at a faster pace than expected, led by continued strength in retrofit project activity, which we include in install but also stabilization in new construction activity. Service orders recovered above prepandemic level, up 13%, led primarily by improving conditions for our transactional service business. Backlog grew 7% to $10 billion with service backlog up 5% and installed backlog up 7%. Conversion rates in our service backlog continued to accelerate. Our installed backlog flow is improving, particularly given the rebound in retrofit activity, which turns more quickly. 
Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 10. Let me touch on a few key items. Operations were a $0.16 tailwind versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes and favorable mix, partially offset by price cost and the reversal of prior year mitigating cost actions. Just to further emphasize the magnitude of the headwinds from the temporary actions. Excluding this impact, underlying incrementals in Q3 were just over 30%. We're on track with our SG&A productivity program, which equated to a benefit of around $0.03. Since we spoke last time, we have already begun taking some of the necessary actions to achieve the savings related to our COGS program, which will begin impacting the P&L in fiscal 2022. We are well on track to achieve our savings targets for fiscal '21 and beyond. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss our segment results in more detail. My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 12. North America revenues grew 8% organically with solid growth in both service and install. Service revenues were higher in all domain driven by a sharp rebound in our transactional service business, which increased nearly 30%. Installed demand which is the area of our business that was most impacted by supply chain disruptions, continues to be driven by shorter cycle retrofit and upgrade projects in addition to easier prior year comparisons. 
By domain, commercial applied HVAC revenue grew mid-single digits, while Fire & Security increased low double digits in the quarter. We had another strong quarter in performance infrastructure, which also grew revenues low double digits. This business as has leading position in the ESCO market, which is well positioned to address customers' decarbonization needs. Segment margin decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% as North America experienced the most headwinds from the reversal of temporary cost given the majority of the action in the prior year related to furloughs and other employee compensation-related expense. 
Orders in North America accelerated on a sequential basis and grew 18% versus the prior year with mid-teens growth in Fire & Security and performance infrastructure. Commercial HVAC orders were up over 20% overall, driven by strong retrofit activity with equipment orders up over 50%. backlog to $6.2 billion increased 6% year-over-year. Revenue in Miller increased 17% organically, led by strong recovery in installed activity. Non-resi construction grew more than 25% in the quarter, with most verticals returning to 2019 levels led by increased demand for energy-related infrastructure projects. Fire & Security, which accounts for nearly 60% of segment revenues inflected sharply growing at a mid-20s rate in Q3 and surfacing 2019 levels. Industrial refrigeration grew 20% and commercial HVAC and controls grew high single digits. 
By geography, revenue growth in Europe accelerated to nearly 25%, while the Middle East declined low double digits and Latin America increased 10%. Segment EBITA margins increased 250 basis points driven by volume leverage and the benefit of SG&A actions. Orders in EMEALA accelerated further, increasing 22% in the quarter with strong growth in Fire & Security and Commercial HVAC. APAC revenues increased 14% organically with install and service increasing by the same amount. Commercial HVAC and controls revenue grew mid-teens, primarily driven by the enduring recovery we are seeing in China. EBITA margins declined 380 basis points year-over-year to 11.8% as the benefit of volume leverage was more than offset by the significant temporary cost mitigation actions taken in the prior year and geographic mix. 
APAC orders grew 14%, driven by continued strength in Commercial HVAC in China and recovery in controls business in Japan. Economic conditions outside of China remain mixed with uncertainty increasing as ongoing and renewed lockdown restrictions across parts of Southeast Asia, Australia and part of Japan follow a rise in core cases and continued delays in the whole art of exceeds. Global Products revenue grew 21% on an organic basis in the quarter, in line with what we initially expected despite incremental headwinds related to COVID lockdown in Asia and the short-term supply chain restrictions.  In aggregate, we continue to gain share across most of our portfolio. 
Our global Residential HVAC business was up 16% in the quarter, with strong growth in all regions. North America resi HVAC grew mid-teens in the quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations, benefiting from a stronger sell-through demand, particularly in April and May. Our JCH Residential HVAC business was up high teens, led by strong share gains in Japan and Taiwan as part of a successful effort to attain the #1 residential share position in those markets. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, our iSense joint venture grew revenue 44% year-over-year  in Q3, expanding our leading shares in China. 
Commercial HVAC sales improved significantly up more than 20% with our indirect apply business up more 25%. Light commercial industry up over 20%, led by the recovery in North America and VRF up high single digits. Fire & Security products growth was above 30%, led by continued strength in our security business, which grew over 40% in the quarter. Commercial fire detection and supersion products were up low to mid-20s on easier year comparisons and the stabilization in key vertical markets. Margin expanded 140 basis points year-over-year to 20.9% as volume leverage, positive mix increased equity income and the benefit of SG&A actions more than offset the significant temporary cost actions taken in the prior year as well as current price cost pressure. 
Turning to Slide 13. As expected, corporate expense increased significantly year-over-year of an abnormally low level to $70 million. For the full year, we now expect corporate expense to be in the range of $280 million to $285 million, slightly below the low end of the prior guide. 
For modeling purposes, we have included an updated outlook for some of our below-the-line items. I would point out that our amortization expense now reflects the impact of Silent Air. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 14, starting with the balance sheet at the top of the page. Similar to last quarter, no significant changes versus the prior period other than the net reduction in cash due to the closing of the Silent Air transaction. Our balance sheet remains healthy with leverage of roughly 1.8x and still below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. On cash, we generated $735 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly $1.7 billion year-to-date. This is a significant improvement compared to our normal year-to-date seasonality and has been driven by solid trade working capital management and the timing of CapEx and order payments. We expect a much lower conversion level in the fourth quarter given the reversal of some timing benefits. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105%. During the third quarter, we repurchased a little more than 5 million shares for roughly $340 million, which brings us to around 19 million shares year-to-date completing our $1 billion program. We expect to repurchase an incremental $350 million of shares in Q4. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for a look at our updated guidance. For the full year, we're raising our guidance once again and now target adjusted EPS in the range of  $2.64 to $2.66. This puts the midpoint at the high end of our previous EPS guidance of $2.58 to $2.65. Based on our strong performance year-to-date and the continued underlying momentum we are seeing in most of our end markets, we continue to expect organic sales growth in the mid-single digits. Segment EBITA margins are tracking towards the high end of our most recent range, and we now expect 80 to 90 basis points of expansion for the full year, which includes a 10 basis point headwind related to the acquisition of Silent Air. 
Based on the full year guide, Q4 adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88, which assumes mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and 30 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion. 
Before we get into your questions, just a quick update on our Investor Day plan for September 8. We made the decision to host the event virtually. Registration details will be available over the next couple of weeks. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

When you look at the year, the way that we set up the year and made sure that we were anticipating the inflationary pressures and ultimately making sure that we're driving the proper level of price as well as continuing to drive productivity. We've built that into our model. And so every step through the year, we've been staying ahead on pricing. And we've been ultimately driving additional productivity to offset some of these headwinds. And I would say from a pricing standpoint, over the last couple of years, we've built a lot of strong strategic capability across our businesses. And that has played out extremely well during this period of time. And so with the inflationary environment, we knew that, that was going to be a challenge in second half, and we anticipated that. And as we probably have about 2 points of price flowing through the top line, which given the timing of that, that has created some headwind here in the third quarter. But with the work that we've done here, we're going to be set up still to be able to continue to deliver on the 80 to 90 basis points of margin expansion for the year. And so I think the team has done an incredible job from where -- when we first set the year up and then ultimately, how we've executed, we've executed extremely well. Olivier?"

If you look at price cost, the impact in Q3 is around 40 basis points. We believe we will be in price cost positive for the second half. So of course, Q4 will be positive. And last piece of your question, the headwind from temporary actions in OpEx, net of our ongoing productivity actions, in Q4, the impact would be about 50 basis points negative. So we are posting improvement in margin rates despite 2 major headwinds, which are temporary in nature, and we feel good about our ability to keep improving the profitability of Johnson Controls."

And if you look at why that's true with our business, the general macro conditions continue to improve.  Although they're not linear across all the regions, as Olivier laid out, we're seeing continued momentum in construction-related indicators and that's beginning to accelerate. So we're actually seeing that come through, and that's supported by ABI continuing to be very strong. Dodge construction starts are improving sequentially. And well, what we're seeing is we're very active in the earlier shorter-cycle projects, which is really outperforming right now. And for us, a lot of that is focused on healthy buildings, and that's been really critical to how we filled in our backlog through the course of the year. 
Retrofit right now in these smaller turn projects continue to ramp. In North America, they were up year-on-year, we're up over 30%. And so that has been a big driver of our install business. And when Olivier talked about our backlog, we're up -- we've got a record backlog. We're up 7%. 
And so as you play out fourth quarter, we don't see any slowdown. And so as we begin to set up '22, that is where we've had a lot of the pressure here in '21, and that's come back nicely.  You can go through different verticals that are driving that, health care, education, some of the data centers, we're seeing good activity there. Real estate is coming back. And so I think, overall, -- When you ask about the cycle, this -- not only the short cycle demand as well as a longer cycle. And then with services, with now these new demands and new outcomes that our customers are looking for. We have an incredible opportunity now as we're digitizing our existing service business to now take the new technologies and to be able to create new outcomes, which ultimately has given us a recurring revenue stream. And that is another dimension that we didn't have before as we get into more of a change in the market and being positioned to be able to now capitalize on those changes."

We gave some of those in our prepared remarks. So what is the proof point about the decarb market, right?

If you look at the best proxy for this at Johnson Controls, it's our performance infrastructure contract. This business is year-to-date growing at about 15%, 1-5. Last year, this business was growing, too. So it's really a business which is taking altitude. On the indoor air quality, if you pass in install order growth between retrofit and new. In Retrofit, which is a byproduct of indoor air quality, the order growth was in the quarter 29%, close to 30% on the 2-year stack, plus 10%. And we said that last quarter, we see this retrofit really accelerating it is, and we said we are starting to see an inflection point in new build. We said that last quarter.

OpenBlue now is being incorporated. We're leveraging OpenBlue with all of our services. We're getting all of our installations connected being able to now extract all of the critical data and then apply AI and analytics to that data to create new outcomes. And then if you advance forward that not only doing it with the core business, but now as we're building out new capabilities across all of our digital platforms and bringing them all together into 1 architecture. I talked about Vijay [indiscernible] coming on board. We've been able to bring Vijay in and he's got an incredible reputation and the ability now to be able to take all of what we've done and really put that together. So not only it enhances our core, but it accelerates the pipeline of digital content that is ultimately now being deployed in everything we do. 
And so a good metric is when you look at our digital revenues, our digital revenues, today, we don't segment that. But if you were to look at all of our digital revenues, we're up strong double digits across all of our -- whether it be our platforms and/or through our digital services. And so another way to look at it is when you look at our pipeline. 
So as we are building pipeline across all 3 regions, there's a much more significant digital content that's being now built in the solutions that we're deploying because we're now differentiating the value that we're bringing to our customers with new offerings. And so that pipeline is well over -- I think we've talked about this in previous quarters, is now well over $1 billion going forward. So those are the ways you kind of look at how it's being deployed and the amount of impact that it's having not only in the core, but now as we look to really lead what I would call autonomous buildings of the future, which is a little bit more forward-looking. We'll have all of the pieces that come together to be able to now support these big outcomes. 
And Olivier said it, decarbonization is going to be a $240 billion market. Healthy buildings is $10 billion to $15 billion and the digital content is what enables us to bring leadership solutions to that. And so as we -- and then smart buildings will be a little bit longer term, but we showed some examples today we're deploying OpenBlue not only takes all of our core, enhances our core, but then positions us to be able to get incremental revenue above that."

And so when you look at this, it's bolt-on technology. It's filling out white space that we didn't have capability in. It also enables us to be able to build out an increased installed base where we haven't had a significant level of service there, but there's tremendous opportunity to build service on top of those offerings. And then the whole digital content, being able to take what they do so well working with all of the data center operators that really is innovative. It takes the technology, it configures the technology in a way that truly differentiates how they work with each of these data center operators. And now you throw digital into that, it really becomes a game changer. 
And so I believe that as we look at data centers and how we're going to be able to leverage this not only with the Silent Air capability, but also with the core, our core capabilities, I couldn't be more excited.

The performance on trade working capital is pretty impressive in a quarter when many of your peers are needing to add lots of buffer inventory and you kind of see the trading working capital moving against you.

We were at about 13.5% same quarter a year ago. All the levers are actually playing in our favor. Let me speak now in terms of days. So DSO up down 9 days year-on-year is structural. We have now in place a strong mechanic to really do a good job on DSO. That's a structural improvement, and we have not reached our best game here. If you look DPO improvement year-on-year by about 4 days. Again, structural. We have various programs in place to make our DPO even better for Johnson Controls. 
And last one, in terms of inventory also good job. That's a byproduct also of strong demand. So some of the inventory improvement. So it's 15 days in total is structural. Some of it is temporary.  But we feel good about the free cash flow generation of the company. We said before, Deane, that we were a 100% free cash flow organization. We'd at 105%, including restructuring. So really, the run rate is in 115, and we feel strong about our cash flow generation in our company, Deane."

And it's such a difference between where the company was a couple of years ago on working capital management, free cash flow and being comfortably above 100% is -- congrats to the team there. 
And then just second question for George. Just put this net zero building as a service that you're highlighting today, put it in context, it's encouraging to see a SaaS business being added to this. But where does it stand in the priority stack in terms of, let's say, indoor air quality? And are there any regulatory oversight that's going to come into the industry on how these calculations are being made because obviously, this feeds into each of your customers, ESG rankings and so forth. There's a lot of focus on it. Just how does this all develop from here?"

And as I said, we've sized that market up to be $10 billion to $15 billion, double-digit CAGR. We have secured well over $300 million to date. And we have a pipeline that's well over $1 billion that we're working on, and that has been continuing to accelerate because of the reopening and return to work plans and the like. And a key space for us within healthy buildings is K-12. We've got an incredible position within schools across 6,000 school districts across the U.S. and as well as 1,900 higher ed. 
So overall, it's been our ability to be able to not only from a pure equipment -- doing a pure equipment upgrade. It's really taking the combined capabilities that we have within a building that ultimately then creates the best outcome as you think about healthy buildings or indoor quality. So that is front and center today. 
When you think about decarbonization sustainability, we've been in that space for years with our performance contracting business. And really, that business has been focused on reducing energy consumption, reducing the carbon footprint. Now with the commitments that have been made pretty broadly now to get to zero net carbon emissions, the capabilities that we can bring now without just 1 narrow solution, we can bring a full solution to a building that enables us not only to optimize the equipment but how the equipment operates within that building with the occupants that ultimately then creates the best outcome, which is ultimately reducing energy and achieving the decarbonization goals. We believe over the next decade, this will build into a $240 billion market, and that's above the $300-plus billion market that we serve today. And I think when you look at our now not only the products and the building systems that now we have brought together and now when you layer on OpenBlue, and in the digital capabilities, it is what is required to get to the best outcome as you're looking to make a building most efficient. And then with the remaining demand, how do you drive towards renewables as far as supply. So that is going to play out a little bit longer term, Deane, but a very attractive space for us."

And so everything we deploy, we attach and then we get a contract and then the ability to differentiate the type of services that we ultimately perform with the data that is extracted from the systems that we deploy to optimize the overall operation. So that with the increased installed base to attach the additional services, and then now as we think about some of these new opportunities with healthy buildings and decarbonization, all of those converge into our ability to be able to deliver as we've committed 200 or 300 basis points above the market. And I think as some of these trends continue to accelerate, I think there's opportunity beyond that.

So let's look at Fire & Security in the quarter. although it was a little bit lagging the recovery, it's come back really strong, not only in our products being up over 30%, but now converting with new installs in the field and building backlog and then recognize that with that backlog or with that installed base that we create, it does spin off very attractive service. 
And so when you look at your question how do we compare to the others and ultimately, strategically, how this contributes to our growth. When you look at our Fire & Security field business, it's about $7 billion in revenue and it's one of our highest margin BUs in our portfolio. And then when you look at Power and security products, that's another roughly $2 billion. And then with this installed base is what ultimately spins out a very attractive what I would say more traditional service business and now as we think as we go forward, it's going to ultimately then be much more digital and be contributing to not only the fire and security aspect, but also to the overall smart building aspect of the building. 
So it is going to be an important part of the overall ability to be able to now capitalize on these big trends. We talked about decarbonization. We talked about healthy buildings. And so when you look at ours compared to others, there are some similarities. There are major differences. I think you need to look at the geographic mix, the product and solution mix, the customer mix I would say that we have a significant advantage when it comes to scale and overall portfolio maturity. And then as I said, really, as you look at the future and the ability to be able to now take all of the multiple systems within a building and bring those together into 1 architecture with 1 data platform that enables -- it ultimately, longer term, enables an autonomous building. But as we step our way from where we are today to where we go, we should see incremental growth as that begins to transform. 
And so I truly believe the work that we've done and how it's been integrated and how it's enabling not only services -- our service, being able to deliver service growth above market as well as being able to really capitalize on what we see to be accelerating trends in our space, it does become a competitive advantage. 
All right, operator, then we'll close out the call. I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning.

Thank you for joining us on the call today.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let me kick things off with a brief update, spotlighting a few specific areas related to our strategic initiatives and Olivier will provide a detailed review of Q3 results and update you on our forward outlook. We will leave as much time as possible to take your questions.
Let's get started on Slide 3. Another quarter of solid results with demand accelerating across most of our end markets as a robust recovery continues to expand. Q3 represents our easiest comparison of the year, but I am encouraged to see the underlying sequential improvement experienced in the first half continue to accelerate in the third quarter, with many of our businesses back to operating at pre-pandemic volume levels. Nonresidential construction markets continue to recover, led by the ongoing strength in retrofit activity tied to demand for healthy building solutions.  
New construction is also beginning to show signs of stabilization, and the inflection in order trends for our longer-cycle project businesses sets us up well as we look to next year and beyond. Our service business has recovered, and we continue to transform this business through our digital service strategy to drive higher levels of recurring revenue and an improved growth profile. 
This recovery has not been without its challenges. We have managed through significant headwinds related to persistent supply chain disruptions, component shortages, labor constraints and continued inflation. While these dynamics have created some revenue pressure, which will continue near term, the pace and composition of order growth in the quarter provides confidence that we will remain on track over the medium and long term. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating these challenges, and I'd like to acknowledge and thank them for the tremendous amount of time and effort dedicated to meeting our customer needs, particularly over these last several quarters.  
As you may recall, in an effort to mitigate the severe impact of the volume declines during the height of the pandemic, we implemented significant cost actions last year. These actions provided a material boost to profitability in the prior year period and led to best-in-class decrementals. Lapping that difficult comparison in managing the return of some of those variable costs, coupled with navigating current capacity constraints and supply disruptions, has resulted in significant margin pressure. That said, we were able to deliver better-than-expected margin expansion in the quarter and remain on track to meet our targets for the full year, which is a remarkable accomplishment in the current environment. At the same time, we remain laser-focused on executing our strategy, which is driving continued share gains.  
As we will discuss over the next few slides, we continue to advance our efforts to deliver innovative solutions to help customers enhance building performance and reduce costs while achieving their net-zero carbon and renewable energy goals. This will be accomplished through our ongoing digital transformation enabled by OpenBlue and accelerating our offerings to deliver the outcomes our customers need.  
Please turn to Slide 4. Continuing our trend to highlight a few notable achievements over the past quarter. Recently, we launched the latest offering under our OpenBlue platform, Net Zero Buildings as a Service. I will spend more time on this announcement in a few minutes as this represents an important step forward in enabling our customers' achievement of decarbonization and sustainability commitments.  
We have now filed our 200th U.S. patent application and received 90 U.S. patents for OpenBlue energy optimization innovations. We announced another strategic partnership with DigiCert, which will allow us to leverage their IoT Device Manager, an industry-leading automated digital certificate platform, to encrypt data and authenticate the identity of users, devices or services within a building. This will further expand Johnson Controls already robust capabilities around cybersecurity risk management, providing our customers peace of mind and resilient solutions that ensure hardware, software and communications remain trusted throughout the building life cycle.  
Together with the announcement of our partnership with Pelion last quarter, OpenBlue solutions users will have confidence that their devices are safely and securely connected to the network. About 2 weeks ago, we launched the Community College Partnership Program aimed at expanding and advancing associate degree and certificate programs in HVAC, Fire & Security and digital building automation systems across the U.S.  
Over the next 5 years, Johnson Controls will grant $15 million to nonprofit community colleges in support of academic programs that train and develop the next generation of skilled trades technicians. In addition to the funding, Johnson Controls employees will be increasing their support through volunteer and mentorship programs, and also provide a pathway for our student internships and entry-level employment opportunities. Lastly, we are proud to have received additional recognition for our efforts to ensure we create a diverse and inclusive work environment, recently being named as one of the Best Companies for Multicultural Women by Seramount. We are also proud to be a part of the Forbes 2021 list of best employers for diversity as well as the Financial Times European Climate Leaders List, further demonstrating our commitment to sustainability. 
Before I move to the next slide, I wanted to welcome Vijay Sankaran, our Chief Technology Officer, to the team. Vijay is transforming our software organization, strengthening our engineering development processes and expanding the solution set of our OpenBlue platform. We are excited to have Vijay on board. He is already having an incredible impact internally, and you will hear more from him at our upcoming Investor Day.  
Let's move to Slide 5 for a brief update on trends in our service business. As we have shared with you over the past couple of quarters, accelerating growth in service has been a strategic initiative underway since well before the pandemic. Ultimately, the actions we are taking are designed to drive 200 or 300 basis points of above-market growth, which would place us firmly in the mid-single-digit annual growth range for the entire $6-plus billion in revenues. Our approach is multifaceted, simultaneously focusing on increasing our contractual service attach rate, reducing attrition and driving higher revenue per user while transforming our offerings through digital. Enabling higher digital content and connecting our installed base compounds our ability to create higher levels of recurring revenue over time.  
In the quarter, service revenue increased 11%, in line with the rebound we expected, with double-digit growth across all 3 regions. Order growth also accelerated, as expected, up 13%. And our attachment rate year-to-date has now improved close to 400 basis points, already achieving our guidance range for the full year. We expect to continue this pace going forward, again, aided by our digital services and solutions, which were up mid-teens in the quarter.  
Please go to Slide 6. I referenced our new OpenBlue offering, Net Zero Buildings as a Service back on Slide 4, and I thought I would spend a few minutes highlighting the importance of this launch. Not only does this offering fulfill an immediate need as expressed by our customers, it also represents the next phase in the evolution of our digital smart buildings offerings, which will drive our shift towards increased deployment of higher recurring as-a-service revenue models. Our broad building systems portfolio and market-leading capabilities and expertise in ESCO projects, combined with the OpenBlue software platform, uniquely positions Johnson Controls to provide customers with guaranteed outcomes and risk management models to achieve their emission reduction commitments.  
Based on our high level of customer engagement and the extensive market-backed research conducted leading up to the development of this solution, the need for a trusted partner to deliver a one-source seamless road map to net zero and the urgency to reduce carbon emissions is clear. What is also clear is that digitally enabled solutions that tie together the IT and OT in the built environment are the only ways to provide these road maps. At nearly $250 billion, sustainability and decarbonization is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and we are excited about our role in leading these critical trends.  
Net Zero Buildings as a Service includes a full portfolio of sustainability offerings tailored to schools, campuses, data centers, health care facilities as well as commercial and industrial verticals. It leverages a game-changing new solution, Net Zero Advisor, which delivers turnkey, AI-driven tracking and reporting of sustainability metrics and helps building operators ensure improved carbon reduction and renewable energy impacts of their buildings. We also leveraged the full OpenBlue suite of connected solutions and services offered through flexible risk-sharing models that enable tailored deal structures where end users pay for outcomes rather than assets.  
Turning quickly to Slide 7. Just a few examples of customer wins tied to the theme of decarbonization and net zero. I won't go through each of these. But in every example, Johnson Controls is providing unique solutions to solve the outcomes our customers are looking for. Some of these new relationships are borne out of our digital partner ecosystem while some are long-standing relationships where we are converting existing building automation systems to OpenBlue or advancing customers' ongoing sustainability initiatives. In all of these, we are driving energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption, driving cost savings and emission reductions.  
Before I turn things over to Olivier to review our financial performance in more detail, let me conclude my opening remarks by saying, I remain extremely encouraged by the demand patterns playing out across our portfolio. Our teams remain dedicated to achieving top-tier performance despite some of the short-term challenges we are facing. We are watching closely the resurgence of COVID cases and the potential impacts renewed lockdowns and supply chain constraints may or may not have on project activity. And from a supply chain perspective, we are confident in our ability to manage access to critical materials and components.  
Although lead times and conversion cycles are stretching, we believe conditions will begin to improve over the next couple of quarters. We are successfully leveraging our pricing capabilities to offset inflation, and we still expect to remain price/cost positive for the year. At the same time, we are making tremendous progress on our strategic initiatives to accelerate top line growth and improve profitability, including indoor air quality, decarbonization, smart buildings, digital services and our productivity program, and we continue to reinvest in our portfolio, both organically and inorganically.  
We believe we are extremely well positioned to outperform throughout the next cycle. With that, let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details of the quarter."

Continuing on Slide 8. Organic sales accelerated in Q3, up 15% of all, in line with the guidance we provided last quarter as growth in Global Products and our field businesses accelerated. The strength in Global",1662,"Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on Slide 8. Organic sales accelerated in Q3, up 15% of all, in line with the guidance we provided last quarter as growth in Global Products and our field businesses accelerated. The strength in Global Products was across the board from continued high level of demand in residential end markets, including both our global HVAC equipment and security products to the anticipated rebound in Commercial HVAC and Fire & Security.  
Segment EBITA increased 21% versus the prior year and segment EBITA margin expanded 30 basis points to 16.2%. Better leverage on higher volumes, the benefit of our SG&A actions and strong execution more than offset the significant headwind from the reversal of temporary cost reductions and a modest headwind from negative price/cost. EPS of $0.83 increased 24%, benefiting from higher profitability as well as a lower share count.  
On cash, we had another strong quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was $735 million, flat versus the prior year despite the planned uptick in CapEx. I will review further details of our performance later in the call.  
Please turn to Slide 9. Orders for our field businesses increased 18% year-over-year, accelerating at a faster pace than expected, led by continued strength in retrofit project activity, which we include in install but also stabilization in new construction activity. Service orders recovered above pre-pandemic level, up 13%, led primarily by improving conditions for our transactional service business. Backlog grew 7% to $10 billion with service backlog up 5% and installed backlog up 7%. Conversion rates in our service backlog continued to accelerate. Our installed backlog flow is improving, particularly given the rebound in retrofit activity, which turns more quickly.  
Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 10. Let me touch on a few key items. Operations were a $0.16 tailwind versus the prior year, driven by higher volumes and favorable mix, partially offset by price/cost and the reversal of prior year mitigating cost actions. Just to further emphasize the magnitude of the headwinds from the temporary actions. Excluding this impact, underlying incrementals in Q3 were just over 30%. We're on track with our SG&A productivity program, which equated to a benefit of around $0.03. Since we spoke last time, we have already begun taking some of the necessary actions to achieve the savings related to our COGS program, which will begin impacting the P&L in fiscal 2022. We are well on track to achieve our savings targets for fiscal '21 and beyond.  
Let's turn to Slide 11 to discuss our segment results in more detail. My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 12. North America revenues grew 8% organically with solid growth in both service and install. Service revenues were higher in all domain, driven by a sharp rebound in our transactional service business, which increased nearly 30%. Installed demand, which is the area of our business that was most impacted by supply chain disruptions, continues to be driven by shorter-cycle retrofit and upgrade projects in addition to easier prior year comparisons.  
By domain, commercial applied HVAC revenue grew mid-single digits, while Fire & Security increased low double digits in the quarter. We had another strong quarter in performance infrastructure, which also grew revenues low double digits. This business has a leading position in the ESCO market, which is well positioned to address customers' decarbonization needs. Segment margin decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% as North America experienced the most headwinds from the reversal of temporary costs given the majority of the action in the prior year related to furloughs and other employee compensation-related expense.  
Orders in North America accelerated on a sequential basis and grew 18% versus the prior year with mid-teens growth in Fire & Security and performance infrastructure. Commercial HVAC orders were up over 20% overall, driven by strong retrofit activity, with equipment orders up over 50%. Backlog to $6.2 billion increased 6% year-over-year. Revenue in EMEALA increased 17% organically, led by strong recovery in install activity. Non-resi construction grew more than 25% in the quarter, with most verticals returning to 2019 levels led by increased demand for energy-related infrastructure projects. Fire & Security, which accounts for nearly 60% of segment revenues inflected sharply, growing at a mid-20s rate in Q3 and surpassing 2019 levels. Industrial Refrigeration grew 20% and Commercial HVAC and controls grew high single digits.  
By geography, revenue growth in Europe accelerated to nearly 25%, while the Middle East declined low double digits and Latin America increased 10%. Segment EBITA margins increased 250 basis points driven by volume leverage and the benefit of SG&A actions. Orders in EMEALA accelerated further, increasing 22% in the quarter with strong growth in Fire & Security and Commercial HVAC. APAC revenues increased 14% organically, with install and service increasing by the same amount. Commercial HVAC and controls revenue grew mid-teens, primarily driven by the ongoing recovery we are seeing in China. EBITA margins declined 380 basis points year-over-year to 11.8% as the benefit of volume leverage was more than offset by the significant temporary cost mitigation actions taken in the prior year and geographic mix.  
APAC orders grew 14%, driven by continued strength in Commercial HVAC in China and recovery in controls business in Japan. Economic conditions outside of China remain mixed with uncertainty increasing as ongoing and renewed lockdown restrictions across parts of Southeast Asia, Australia and part of Japan follow a rise in COVID cases and continued delays in the rollout of vaccines. Global Products revenue grew 21% on an organic basis in the quarter, in line with what we initially expected despite incremental headwinds related to COVID lockdown in Asia and the short-term supply chain restrictions.  In aggregate, we continue to gain share across most of our portfolio.  
Our global Residential HVAC business was up 16% in the quarter, with strong growth in all regions. North America resi HVAC grew mid-teens in the quarter, slightly ahead of our expectations, benefiting from a stronger sell-through demand, particularly in April and May. Our JCH Residential HVAC business was up high teens, led by strong share gains in Japan and Taiwan as part of a successful effort to attain the #1 residential share position in those markets. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, our Hisense joint venture grew revenue 44% year-over-year  in Q3, expanding our leading shares in China.  
Commercial HVAC sales improved significantly, up more than 20% with our indirect applied business up more 25%. Light commercial industry up over 20%, led by the recovery in North America and VRF up high single digits. Fire & Security products growth was above 30%, led by continued strength in our security business, which grew over 40% in the quarter. Commercial fire detection and suppression products were up low to mid-20s on easier year comparisons and the stabilization in key vertical markets. EBITA margin expanded 140 basis points year-over-year to 20.9% as volume leverage, positive mix increased equity income and the benefit of SG&A actions more than offset the significant temporary cost actions taken in the prior year as well as current price/cost pressure.  
Turning to Slide 13. As expected, corporate expense increased significantly year-over-year of an abnormally low level to $70 million. For the full year, we now expect corporate expense to be in the range of $280 million to $285 million, slightly below the low end of the prior guide.  
For modeling purposes, we have included an updated outlook for some of our below-the-line items. I would point out that amortization expense now reflects the impact of Silent-Aire.  
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 14, starting with the balance sheet at the top of the page. Similar to last quarter, no significant changes versus the prior period other than the net reduction in cash due to the closing of the Silent-Aire transaction. Our balance sheet remains healthy with leverage of roughly 1.8x, still below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. On cash, we generated $735 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly $1.7 billion year-to-date. This is a significant improvement compared to our normal year-to-date seasonality and has been driven by solid trade working capital management and the timing of CapEx and order payments. We expect a much lower conversion level in the fourth quarter given the reversal of some timing benefits. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105%. During the third quarter, we repurchased a little more than 5 million shares for roughly $340 million, which brings us to around 19 million shares year-to-date completing our $1 billion program. We expect to repurchase an incremental $350 million of shares in Q4.  
Please turn to Slide 15 for a look at our updated guidance. For the full year, we're raising our guidance once again and now target adjusted EPS in the range of  $2.64 to $2.66. This puts the midpoint at the high end of our previous EPS guidance of $2.58 to $2.65. Based on our strong performance year-to-date and the continued underlying momentum we are seeing in most of our end markets, we continue to expect organic sales growth in the mid-single digits. Segment EBITA margins are tracking towards the high end of our most recent range, and we now expect 80 to 90 basis points of expansion for the full year, which includes a 10 basis point headwind related to the acquisition of Silent-Aire.  
Based on the full year guide, Q4 adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88, which assumes mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and 30 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion.  
Before we get into your questions, just a quick update on our Investor Day plan for September 8. We made the decision to host the event virtually. Registration details will be available over the next couple of weeks. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions."

When you look at the year, the way that we set up the year and made sure that we were anticipating the inflationary pressures and ultimately making sure that we're driving the proper level of price as well as continuing to drive productivity. We've built that into our model. And so every step through the year, we've been staying ahead on pricing. And we've been ultimately driving additional productivity to offset some of these headwinds. 
And I would say from a pricing standpoint, over the last couple of years, we've built a lot of strong strategic capability across our businesses. And that has played out extremely well during this period of time. And so with the inflationary environment, we knew that, that was going to be a challenge in second half, and we anticipated that. And we probably have about 2 points of price flowing through the top line, which given the timing of that, that has created some headwind here in the third quarter. But with the work that we've done here, we're going to be set up still to be able to continue to deliver on the 80 to 90 basis points of margin expansion for the year. And so I think the team has done an incredible job from where -- when we first set the year up and then ultimately, how we've executed, we've executed extremely well. Olivier?"

The impact of our temporary actions from last year, net of our ongoing productivity program, is about 160 basis points in the quarter. 
If you look at price/cost, the impact in Q3 is around 40 basis points. We believe we will be in price/cost positive for the second half. So of course, Q4 will be positive. And last piece of your question, the headwind from temporary actions in OpEx, net of our ongoing productivity actions, in Q4, the impact would be about 50 basis points negative. So we are posting improvement in margin rates despite 2 major headwinds, which are temporary in nature, and we feel good about our ability to keep improving the profitability of Johnson Controls."

Because at the end of the day, we have a unique position here with the combined portfolio to truly lead the future buildings, as we're thinking about healthy buildings, not only healthy people, healthy places, healthy planet.

And if you look at why that's true with our business, the general macro conditions continue to improve.  Although they're not linear across all the regions, as Olivier laid out, we're seeing continued momentum in construction-related indicators and that's beginning to accelerate. So we're actually seeing that come through, and that's supported by ABI continuing to be very strong. Dodge construction starts are improving sequentially. And well, what we're seeing is we're very active in the earlier shorter-cycle projects, which is really outperforming right now. And for us, a lot of that is focused on healthy buildings, and that's been really critical to how we filled in our backlog through the course of the year. 
Retrofit right now in these smaller turn projects continue to ramp. In North America, they were up, year-on-year, were up over 30%. And so that has been a big driver of our install business. And when Olivier talked about our backlog, we're up. We've got a record backlog. We're up 7%. 
And so as you play out fourth quarter, we don't see any slowdown. And so as we begin to set up '22, that is where we've had a lot of the pressure here in '21, and that's come back nicely.  You can go through different verticals that are driving that, health care, education, some of the data centers, we're seeing good activity there. Real estate is coming back. And so I think, overall, when you ask about the cycle, this -- not only the short-cycle demand as well as a longer cycle. And then with services, with now these new demands and new outcomes that our customers are looking for, we have an incredible opportunity now as we're digitizing our existing service business to now take the new technologies and to be able to create new outcomes, which ultimately has given us a recurring revenue stream.

Last year, this business was growing, too. So it's really a business which is taking altitude. On the indoor air quality, if you pass in install order growth between retrofit and new. 
In retrofit, which is a byproduct of indoor air quality, the order growth was in the quarter 29%, close to 30% on the 2-year stack, plus 10%. And we said that last quarter, we see this retrofit really accelerating. It is, and we said we are starting to see an inflection point in new build. We said that last quarter.

OpenBlue now is being incorporated. We're leveraging OpenBlue with all of our services. We're getting all of our installations connected, being able to now extract all of the critical data and then apply AI and analytics to that data to create new outcomes. And then if you advance forward, we're  not only doing it with the core business, but now as we're building out new capabilities across all of our digital platforms and bringing them all together into one architecture. I talked about Vijay Sankaran coming on board. We've been able to bring Vijay in and he's got an incredible reputation. And the ability now to be able to take all of what we've done and really put that together, so not only it enhances our core, but it accelerates the pipeline of digital content that is ultimately now being deployed in everything we do. 
And so a good metric is when you look at our digital revenues, our digital revenues, today, we don't segment that. But if you were to look at all of our digital revenues, we're up strong double digits across all of our -- whether it be our platforms and/or through our digital services. And so another way to look at it is when you look at our pipeline. 
So as we are building pipeline across all 3 regions, there's a much more significant digital content that's being now built in the solutions that we're deploying because we're now differentiating the value that we're bringing to our customers with new offerings. And so that pipeline is well over -- I think we've talked about this in previous quarters, is now well over $1 billion going forward. So those are the ways you kind of look at how it's being deployed and the amount of impact that it's having not only in the core, but now as we look to really lead what I would call autonomous buildings of the future, which is a little bit more forward-looking. We'll have all of the pieces that come together to be able to now support these big outcomes. 
And Olivier said it, decarbonization is going to be a $240 billion market. Healthy buildings is $10 billion to $15 billion and the digital content is what enables us to bring leadership solutions to that. And so as we -- and then smart buildings will be a little bit longer term, but we showed some examples today we're deploying OpenBlue not only takes all of our core, enhances our core, but then positions us to be able to get incremental revenue above that."

And so when you look at this, it's bolt-on technology. It's filling out white space that we didn't have capability in. It also enables us to be able to build out an increased installed base where we haven't had a significant level of service there, but there's tremendous opportunity to build service on top of those offerings. And then the whole digital content, being able to take what they do so well, working with all of the data center operators that really is innovative. It takes the technology, it configures the technology in a way that truly differentiates how they work with each of these data center operators. And now you throw digital into that, it really becomes a game changer. 
And so I believe that as we look at data centers and how we're going to be able to leverage this not only with the Silent-Aire capability, but also with the core, our core capabilities, I couldn't be more excited.

If you look at DPO, improvement year-on-year by about 4 days. Again, structural. We have various programs in place to make our DPO even better for Johnson Controls. 
And last one, in terms of inventory, also good job. That's a byproduct also of strong demand. So some of the inventory improvement. So it's 15 days in total is structural. Some of it is temporary.

And as I said, we've sized that market up to be $10 billion to $15 billion, double-digit CAGR. We have secured well over $300 million to date. And we have a pipeline that's well over $1 billion that we're working on, and that has been continuing to accelerate because of the reopening and return-to-work plans and the like. And a key space for us within healthy buildings is K-12. We've got an incredible position within schools across 6,000 school districts across the U.S. and as well as 1,900 higher ed. 
So overall, it's been our ability to be able to not only from a pure equipment -- doing a pure equipment upgrade, it's really taking the combined capabilities that we have within a building that ultimately then creates the best outcome as you think about healthy buildings or indoor air quality. So that is front and center today. 
When you think about decarbonization sustainability, we've been in that space for years with our performance contracting business. And really, that business has been focused on reducing energy consumption, reducing the carbon footprint. Now with the commitments that have been made pretty broadly now to get to zero-net carbon emissions, the capabilities that we can bring now without just one narrow solution, we can bring a full solution to a building that enables us not only to optimize the equipment but how the equipment operates within that building with the occupants that ultimately then creates the best outcome, which is ultimately reducing energy and achieving the decarbonization goals. 
We believe over the next decade, this will build into a $240 billion market, and that's above the $300-plus billion market that we serve today. And I think when you look at our now not only the products and the building systems that now we have brought together, and now when you layer on OpenBlue, and in the digital capabilities, it is what is required to get to the best outcome as you're looking to make a building most efficient. And then with the remaining demand, how do you drive towards renewables as far as supply? So that is going to play out a little bit longer term, Deane, but a very attractive space for us."

And so everything we deploy, we attach and then we get a contract and then the ability to differentiate the type of services that we ultimately perform with the data that is extracted from the systems that we deploy to optimize the overall operation. So that with the increased installed base, the attach, the additional services, and then now as we think about some of these new opportunities with healthy buildings and decarbonization, all of those converge into our ability to be able to deliver as we've committed 200 or 300 basis points above the market.

So let's look at Fire & Security in the quarter. Although it was a little bit lagging the recovery, it's come back really strong, not only in our products being up over 30%, but now converting with new installs in the field and building backlog and",515,"Sure. So let's look at Fire & Security in the quarter. Although it was a little bit lagging the recovery, it's come back really strong, not only in our products being up over 30%, but now converting with new installs in the field and building backlog and then recognize that with that backlog or with that installed base that we create, it does spin off very attractive service. 
And so when you look at your question how do we compare to the others and ultimately, strategically, how this contributes to our growth? When you look at our Fire & Security field business, it's about $7 billion in revenue and it's one of our highest-margin BUs in our portfolio. And then when you look at Fire & Security products, that's another roughly $2 billion. And then with this installed base is what ultimately spins out a very attractive what I would say more traditional service business and now as we think as we go forward, it's going to ultimately then be much more digital and be contributing to not only the fire and security aspect, but also to the overall smart building aspect of the building. 
So it is going to be an important part of the overall ability to be able to now capitalize on these big trends. We talked about decarbonization. We talked about healthy buildings. And so when you look at ours compared to others, there are some similarities. There are major differences. I think you need to look at the geographic mix, the product and solution mix, the customer mix. I would say that we have a significant advantage when it comes to scale and overall portfolio maturity. And then as I said, really, as you look at the future and the ability to be able to now take all of the multiple systems within a building and bring those together into one architecture with one data platform that enables -- it ultimately, longer term, enables an autonomous building. But as we step our way from where we are today to where we go, we should see incremental growth as that begins to transform. 
And so I truly believe the work that we've done and how it's been integrated and how it's enabling not only services -- our service, being able to deliver service growth above market as well as being able to really capitalize on what we see to be accelerating trends in our space, it does become a competitive advantage. 
All right, operator, then we'll close out the call. I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. And as I mentioned earlier, we've had a very strong third quarter, and the momentum that we are seeing across our portfolio and key verticals, coupled with our strategic focus and improved execution gives me high confidence in our ability to keep outperforming as we move forward. 
We look forward to speaking to many of you and hope to see you virtually at our Investor Day that's coming up on September 8. So on that, operator, that concludes our call."

I'm going to start off with a quick look back at 2021 and update you on a few of our long-term strategic priorities. Olivier will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and provide you with our fiscal 2022 guidance. And as always, we will leave as much time as possible to take your questions. 
Let's get started on Slide 3. We rounded out fiscal '21 with another quarter of solid financial results having met or exceeded all of our original commitments for the year and what turned out to be a much more difficult environment than originally planned. 
The ability to deliver these results while navigating through unprecedented levels of inflation and supply chain disruptions is a testament to the operational discipline and agility demonstrated throughout the organization. And for that, I am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire Johnson Controls team. Despite the challenging external environment, our end market demand remains strong. Robust retrofit activity, coupled with a pickup in new nonresidential construction we are starting to see, creates a strong future demand trend. This is evidenced by the continued momentum we are seeing in our order books in the record backlog we have built. 
We also remain focused on the big picture, moving ahead with bold new commitments, doubling down with ambitious new ESG goals set earlier this year, embarking on a substantial new productivity program designed to drive a step function change in profitability. And just recently at our Investor Day in September, we committed to a new set of 3-year financial commitments. 
We made significant progress in advancing our growth strategy, scaling our OpenBlue digital platform, launching 8 new major offerings and greatly expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in the refresh of our product portfolio, focusing on accelerating our service growth and improving our attachment rate and we are capitalizing on strong secular trends for healthy buildings, decarbonization and smart connected equipment and buildings. 
As end markets continue to recover and the adoption of these trends continue to expand globally, I am confident we are uniquely positioned from a competitive standpoint to continue to outperform. 
Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to the strong financial results and advancement on our strategic initiatives,  we have also continued to lead in ESG, including continued progress toward both our 2025 sustainability goals in our new ESG commitments. This is not, by any means, an exhaustive list, but I am extremely pleased with what our teams have accomplished in the last year. We are committed to net zero, committed to reducing emissions within our own operations and that of our customers, our science-based targets have been approved, our leadership team is aligned from a governance perspective and we are extending our leadership in sustainable financing as well. 
Tomorrow, I travel to COP 26 in Glasgow. We made great progress in driving home the understanding that buildings represent approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and there is no tackling climate change without substantial investment in buildings. Governments are now acting on this and mobilizing billions to upgrade buildings, and Johnson Controls is perfectly positioned to deliver their solutions. At COP26, I will meet with government and business leaders to build momentum and ensure action. 
Turning to Slide 5. I wanted to take a few minutes to highlight several new strategic developments in the quarter. Most recently, we signed an MOU with 2 significant technology leaders, Accenture and Alibaba, to address sustainable infrastructure needs. This collaboration will focus on an estimated multibillion-dollar market for digital solutions serving data centers in China. We also signed a foundational technology agreement with tempered networks, building upon our recent cybersecurity partnerships with Pelion and DigiCert. Each of these partnerships embeds a critical layer of trust, security and operational capability into our OpenBlue platform and connected devices. These elements differentiate our products and services to help protect the integrity of our customers' operations and data. Tempered brings an industry-leading zero-trust secure network capability that helps us drive customer confidence and, in turn, accelerate the adoption of OpenBlue services. Our partnerships with UL, Safe Traces and with Biogen are powerful examples of how we are innovating to extend our healthy buildings leadership, providing new indoor environmental quality solutions to address our customers' most pressing challenges. 
Our near-term focus is on the education vertical as there is a clear and compelling need to help those customers optimize their investments. With an estimated $195 billion in government stimulus earmarked for K-12 spending, this provides a significant opportunity. Additionally, we entered into an exclusive joint development agreement and investment with Biogen, a leading biotech company working on the identification of indoor bacteria and viruses that are all around us in buildings. Our work with Biogen is a commitment to developing the cutting edge of capabilities to deliver and maintain healthy buildings. 
Please turn to Slide 6. At our Investor Day, we shared with you our 3 pillars for delivering above-market growth over the next 3 years and beyond. One of those pillars related to gaining share through innovative product development, centered around digital and sustainability. As planned, we launched over 150 new products in fiscal 2021, spanning nearly all business units, resulting in continued share gains in both Q4 and in the full year. 
In 2022, we are well positioned to gain share with another 175 new products across 4 main categories: sustainability, smart buildings, digital and residential, with heat pumps central to our product development strategy. These are just a sample of what is expected to launch over the next 90 days with a steady pipeline behind this. 
Turning to Slide 7. Service plays a central role in everything we do. Over the last 18 months, we have strengthened our market-leading capabilities to best position ourselves for the shifting industry demographics and evolving digital technologies that are enabling outcome-based solution models. 
At the start of last year, we began articulating our intentions to accelerate service growth to a couple of points above market levels, part of which would be the result of increasing our attachment rate by leveraging our large installed base and the digital transformation of our business. In fiscal 2021, we saw the early benefits of our efforts shine through. We exited the year with service revenues up 8% in the fourth quarter with high single-digit growth in all 3 regions in nearly all business domains. 
For the full year, service revenue grew 4%, which is up 2 to 3 points over 2019 levels despite a slow start to the year as we manage through lingering site access restrictions and abnormal customer budget pressures. 
Looking ahead, we see service accelerating through fiscal 2022, in line with our goal to outpace the market. The order strength we've seen in the second half of the year bolsters that view. Service orders were up 7% in Q4 and importantly, up low single digits organically versus 2019 levels. Additionally, we improved our attach rate to approximately 40%.  
Turning to Slide 8. The third pillar is our vectors of growth, which we believe on a combined basis represents an incremental market opportunity of $250 billion over the next decade. Our unique portfolio is a competitive advantage across all 3 areas. And from a financial performance perspective, we have significantly increased both revenue and orders in fiscal 2021. This positions us very well for continued strong performance as we move forward. 
Next, on Slide 9. I wanted to highlight a key customer win related to one of our key vectors of growth. In Q4, we were awarded a building-as-a-service project by one of our long-standing customers, the University of North Dakota. This is the second long-term performance infrastructure contract we have been awarded with this university in the last 2 years. It leverages not only our expertise in performance contracting, but also the OpenBlue Enterprise Manager software. The total contract value was nearly $220 million over the life of the project with a smaller portion of that book during the quarter. On a related note, our OpenBlue Healthy Buildings platform enabled nearly 900 colleges and universities to safely and efficiently welcome students, staff and faculty back to their campuses this fall. 
Before I turn things over to Olivier, let me conclude with a few thoughts. I remain extremely encouraged by the demand patterns we are seeing across most of our end markets and the ability of our teams to capitalize on more than our fair share of that demand. We see this decade as being one of the most exciting for the smart building industry, which Johnson Controls is positioned to lead. Underlying momentum in our short-cycle businesses continues to improve despite pressure from ongoing supply chain and component availability constraints. 
Our longer cycle install business, driven by the new buildings market, also continues to recover, although extended lead times and inflation are delaying some investment decisions, particularly on larger projects. Retrofit activity remains an important driver of our business. and we see plenty of opportunity to capitalize on this activity going forward. All of that said, we are very mindful of the macro backdrop and our outlook does not assume any significant near-term improvement in supply chain conditions or inflation over the next couple of quarters. 
On price/cost, given the progressive rise in inflation, for almost all input costs throughout the year, we took decisive steps on pricing and cost to stay ahead of the curve, And I am confident we will continue to manage through these challenges. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, our focus turns to accelerating and demonstrating our growth capabilities. Our proven product technology leadership, combined now with OpenBlue, truly differentiates the solutions we can bring to our customers. In fact, we believe we are best positioned to lead the revolution of smart buildings, and we are fully committed to creating healthier, safer and more sustainable buildings. 
With that, let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details of the quarter."
282590,1685284308,2427311,"Johnson Controls International plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Johnson Controls International plc","Executives","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief financial summary on Slide 10. Sales in the quarter were up 5% organically, led by Global Products, which is truly a reflection of the team's strong execution.  Underlying momentum in t",1664,"Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a brief financial summary on Slide 10. Sales in the quarter were up 5% organically, led by Global Products, which is truly a reflection of the team's strong execution.  Underlying momentum in this business continued to improve as evidenced by mid-single digits growth on a 2-year stack basis. Our longer cycle field business continued to recover, led by strong growth in services, up 8% in the quarter. 
Segment EBITA increased 10% versus the prior year, margin expanding 30 basis points to 15.9%, better leverage on higher volumes favorable mix and the incremental benefit of our SG&A actions more than offset the headwind from the reversal of temporary cost reductions and price cost, including significant supply chain disruptions.  EPS of $0.88 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 16% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $200 million, reflecting the reversal of timing benefits experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year as expected. On a full year basis, we achieved 105% free cash flow conversion. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Orders for our field businesses increased 9%, led by low double-digit growth in install on strong double-digit growth in retrofit activity. We are also seeing continued strength in our service business with orders up 7%, driven by strong growth in North America and EMEALA. 
Backlog grew 10% to more than $10 billion, with service backlog up 5% and installed backlog up 11%. The sequential improvement was led by strong retrofit activity as new construction continues to recover from depressed level in fiscal '20, particularly in North America. 
Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 12. Let me touch on a few key items. Overall, operations contributed $0.09 versus the prior year, including a $0.04 benefit from our SG&A productivity program, achieving our targeted savings in fiscal '21. We are well on track to achieve our SG&A and COGS savings in fiscal '22 and beyond. Similar to last quarter, excluding the headwind from the prior year temporary actions, underlying incrementals in Q4 were approximately 30%. Corporate was a $0.03 headwind year-over-year and other items netted to a $0.06 tailwind, primarily related to lower share count, lower net financing charges and FX. 
Let's discuss our segment results in more details on Slide 13. My commentary will also refer to the segment end market performance included on Slide 14. North America revenue grew 4% organically, led by strength in services, which was higher in all domain. Installed revenue was up low single digits, primarily due to strong demand from shorter cycle retrofit and upgrade projects and positive growth in new construction. Both our internal and customer supply chain restrictions negatively impacted our North America installed business. By domain, commercial applied HVAC revenue grew mid-single digits, while Fine security increased low single digits in the quarter. We had another strong quarter in performance infrastructure, which grew revenue low double digits, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, a good reflection on our customers' demand for decarbonization solutions. 
Segment margin decreased 20 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, primarily due to the reversal of temporary cost from the mitigation actions in the prior year. Orders in North America were up 11% versus the prior year with high single-digit growth in both commercial HVAC and Fire & Security. Performance infrastructure orders were up nearly 40%. Applied HVAC orders increased 10% overall, driven by strong retrofit activity with another strong quarter of equipment orders, up over 20% in Q4. Backlog of $6.5 billion increased 10% year-over-year. 
Revenue in EMEALA increased 3% organically, led by continued strength in our service business, particularly in our applied HVAC and industrial refrigeration businesses. Client security, which account for nearly 60% of segment revenues, grew at mid-single-digit rate in Q4 with strength across our enterprise accounts and residential security businesses, including a rebound in our retail platform. Industrial refrigeration also grew mid-single digits, while commercial HVAC and controls declined low single digits. By geography, revenue growth was broad-based with strength in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by low double-digit decline in the Middle East. 
Segment EBITA margins declined 30 basis points, driven by a prior year gain on sales. Underlying margin performance improved as favorable mix, positive price/cost and the benefit of SG&A savings this year more than offset the temporary mitigation actions taken in the prior year. Order in EMEALA continued to accelerate, increasing 7% in the quarter with strong mid-teens growth in commercial HVAC and high single-digit growth in Fire & Security. 
APAC revenue increased 7% organically led by low double-digit growth in commercial HVAC and controls. EBITA margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 15.5%, driven by a favorable reserve adjustment. APAC underlying margin declined year-over-year as volume leverage and net productivity was offset by unfavorable mix and negative price cost. APAC orders grew 4%, driven by continued strength in commercial HVAC. Global Products revenue grew 7% on an organic basis in the quarter with broad-based strength across the portfolio. Our global residential HVAC business was up 5% in the quarter. North America resi HVAC grew 4% in the quarter, benefiting from both higher volume and pricing. 
Outside of North America, our residential HVAC business grew mid-single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe and driven in part by the launch of our new Hitachi air to water residential heat pump, which was well received by the market. In APAC, residential HVAC declined low single digits as a result of softer industry demand in Japan, given the COVID-related state of emergency in place for much of the quarter. We continue to gain shares in Japan, up more than 100 basis points in the quarter as we continue to launch new premium products with indoor air quality technologies. Although not reflected in our revenue growth, our iSense JV revenue grew over 40% year-over-year in Q4, expanding our leading position in China. Commercial HVAC product sales were up low double digits overall, led by mid-teens growth in our indirect applied business, including strong Chile demand within the data center end market. 
Light commercial grew high single digits overall, with North America unitary equipment down 2% and VRF up high single digits. Our light commercial business in Asia was up low double digits, including a significant win in Taiwan to supply high-efficiency dockless unit with indoor air quality technology to all schools across the country. Client security products grew high single digits in aggregate, led by our access and control and video solutions business and return to pre-pandemic levels for parts of our fire suppression business. 
EBITA margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 18.7% and as volume leverage, higher equity income and the benefit of SG&A actions more than offset the temporary cost action in the prior year and price cost, including the significant supply chain disruptions. 
Turning to Slide 15. Corporate expense increased significantly year-over-year of an abnormal low level to $83 million. For modeling purposes, we have included an outlook for some of our below-the-line items in financial year '22. I will point out that amortization expense reflects the full year run rate impact of Silent-Aire as well as additional software R&D. Net financing charges returned to a more normal level as fiscal '21 benefited from significant FX gain. Noncontrolling interest reflects continued growth in our Hitachi JV. 
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 16. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the year with $1.3 billion in available cash and net debt at 1.8x, still below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. On cash, we generated a little over $200 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly  $2 billion year-to-date, and achieving our target of 105% conversion for the year. 
As you will recall from our guidance last quarter, we expected a reversal in some of the timing benefits we experienced earlier in the year. I am extremely pleased with our cash performance and remain confident that we will sustain 100% conversion over the next several years. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a little over 4 million shares for approximately $200 million, which for the full year, brings us to around 23 million shares or $1.3 billion. 
Let's turn to Slide 17 for a look at our historical Q1 seasonality. As you can see, Q1 typically represents less than 15% of our full year EPS given our normal seasonality. For Q1 of fiscal '22, we expect to be above that level with Q1 guidance representing about 16% of our full year at the midpoint. Additionally, we expect an improving first half, second half versus historical seasonality. As we look at fiscal '22 overall on Slide 18, we are entering the year with record backlog and underlying markets are continuing to improve. With that said, we do expect supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment to continue, at least over the next couple of quarters. 
On a full year basis, we expect high single-digit organic revenue growth with 70 to 80 basis points of segment EBITDA margin expansion. Although we expect to remain price cost positive on an EPS basis,  the inflated level of pricing will result in margin headwinds of approximately 40 basis points for the year. Underlying margins are expanding to 110 to 120 basis points. Additionally, we expect another year of strong earnings growth with adjusted EPS in the range of $3.22 to $3.32, which represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%. Turning to Slide 19. We can see that our expectations for fiscal '22 are very much in line with the growth expectations we provided at our recent Investor Day, and we are accelerating growth in each area. Last,  on Slide 20, I want to reiterate that we are well on our way to our '24 targets. With that, operator, we can open up the lines for questions."

Certainly, this is a very attractive end market. has long secular drivers that align very well with our core. And as you know, Nigel, we've been investing nicely reinvesting into our product, and we're I think overall, we're taking share for the year, we're going to be up about almost 200 basis points. 
Big focus on energy efficiency and sustainability, and that's supported with not only our industry-leading chillers, but also now with the new rooftops that we're bringing into the market with low GWP refrigeration that's driving increased efficiency and driving service. And then we're investing more heavily now in the next-gen air cool technologies, electrification with heat pumps and heat transfer units as well as advanced VRF technology. As you said, we have had strong performance not only in North America, but across the globe -- across the board. That's also enabling us to be able to create a very nice installed base and get that connected, which drives to longer-term services. And all of this is being enhanced with our digital capabilities with OpenBlue. So specifically in Applied, when you look at the demand for retrofit opportunities driven by healthy buildings and return to work and school particularly in North America, that was very strong with our controls airside and filtration. A lot of that has been driven by K-12. 
We also see a strong demand globally for air cooled chillers and data centers and rental markets as well as industrial heat pumps in both chiller in our portfolios. And so when you look at our orders globally and Applied, it's up 11% globally. North America, when you look at purely equipment, it's up kind of mid-20s, which was very strong, and that's sequentially to a very strong quarter that we had in the third quarter. So overall, we're gaining nice share, as I said, for the year, up almost 200 basis points. 
Now as it relates to -- on the residential, when we talk about the residential space, we continue to perform very well. When you look at our residential business inducted, we have a nice, nice backlog. We're up significantly in backlog, and we're continuing to perform well. We've been investing in new products here and ultimately gaining share, and we feel good about that. Now globally, when you look at the overall position that we have globally in residential, we had decent performance in our JCH business, which was up about 4%. And I think as we look at that business, we've been gaining share and continuing to perform with the new products that we've been able to bring to market. Although Japan was down 11%, we outperformed in that market. You know that that's a big end market for us. We had strong growth in Europe, which was up about 35%. And as Olivier said, that the China, the Hisense business, the HAPQ is up over 40%. So overall, we feel good about our overall performance in residential."

We're going to continue to work it. With that all being said, we do believe that in the quarter, that there was probably an impact of about 1% to 2% on top line as a result of the shortages that hindered our ability to be able to convert all that we could have -- But the team overall has done a great job working with our suppliers to be able to mitigate the impact and ultimately secure the critical materials.

And so we have been able to stay ahead of the curve in being able to bring on, whether it be the skilled technicians, the technical capability that we need to support OpenBlue, all of the different capabilities to be able to produce.

And certainly, we get the return to our service margin rates. And so when you look the traditional service business, obviously, that's come back nicely post pandemic. 
Well, the accelerator now is what we're doing with digital, the new OpenBlue offerings. That all is helping us increase attach rates and then not only attach rates, but now additional services, taking the intelligence, applying AI and ultimately now delivering these new service offerings. As I said, through 2021, we delivered 15 new service offerings. A lot of those were tied to healthy buildings, sustainability, all of our key growth vectors and we've been able to build a tremendous pipeline of opportunity that we're now beginning to convert. 
When you look at service orders, we're up 7% above the 2019 levels, and we see that continuing with that momentum because not only is it we're getting the core business is coming back and we're going to continue to maintain that with the traditional service business that we perform.

So as we look at this business, we have a lot of conversion coming from what would have been a conventional business to now incorporating that business into solutions, differentiated solutions. 
And so as we look at, for instance, the partnership we have with Apollo and this is a focus on decarbonization and sustainability. We've got a pipeline that we're working that that's over $1 billion in how we're going to convert. 
And now some of this depends on the timing of conversion of orders, but we're making tremendous progress right now working a number of these and working to convert a number of these. So  it's hard to say exactly what's going to ultimately come through performance contracting and then what we would still gain if it were not to be the full solution, what we would gain in our traditional HVAC businesses. 
But Dean, this is going to be -- when you look at our vectors of growth, decarbonization and sustainability, healthy buildings and then ultimately, smart buildings, a lot of our go-to-market would be -- we actually deliver an outcome solution. A lot of that will be done long term with underperformance contracting. So we've got a leadership position today with our performance contracting business that ultimately has been focused on energy savings. We've expanded that. And now with our go-to-market, we have, I believe, tremendous potential here over the next few years to make this much more significant within the portfolio.

I'm going to start off with a quick look back at 2021 and update you on a few of our long-term strategic priorities. Olivier will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and provide you with our fiscal 2022 guidance. And as always, we will leave as much time as possible to take your questions.  
Let's get started on Slide 3. We rounded out fiscal '21 with another quarter of solid financial results, having met or exceeded all of our original commitments for the year, in what turned out to be a much more difficult environment than originally planned. The ability to deliver these results, while navigating through unprecedented levels of inflation and supply chain disruptions, is a testament to the operational discipline and agility demonstrated throughout the organization. And for that, I am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire Johnson Controls team. 
Despite the challenging external environment, our end market demand remains strong. Robust retrofit activity, coupled with a pickup in new nonresidential construction we are starting to see, creates a strong future demand trend. This is evidenced by the continued momentum we are seeing in our order books and the record backlog we have built.  
We also remain focused on the big picture, moving ahead with bold new commitments, doubling down with ambitious new ESG goals set earlier this year, embarking on a substantial new productivity program designed to drive a step-function change in profitability. And just recently, at our Investor Day in September, we committed to a new set of 3-year financial commitments.  
We made significant progress in advancing our growth strategy, scaling our OpenBlue digital platform, launching 8 new major offerings and greatly expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in the refresh of our product portfolio, focusing on accelerating our service growth and improving our attachment rate. And we are capitalizing on strong secular trends for healthy buildings, decarbonization and smart connected equipment and buildings. As end markets continue to recover and the adoption of these trends continue to expand globally, I am confident we are uniquely positioned from a competitive standpoint to continue to outperform.  
Please turn to Slide 4. In addition to the strong financial results and advancement on our strategic initiatives, we have also continued to lead in ESG, including continued progress toward both our 2025 sustainability goals and our new ESG commitments. This is not, by any means, an exhaustive list, but I am extremely pleased with what our teams have accomplished in the last year. We are committed to net zero, committed to reducing emissions within our own operations and that of our customers. Our science-based targets have been approved. Our leadership team is aligned from a governance perspective, and we are extending our leadership in sustainable financing as well.  
Tomorrow, I travel to COP26 in Glasgow. We made great progress in driving home the understanding that buildings represent approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and there is no tackling climate change without substantial investment in buildings. Governments are now acting on this and mobilizing billions to upgrade buildings. And Johnson Controls is perfectly positioned to deliver those solutions. At COP26, I will meet with government and business leaders to build momentum and ensure action.  
Turning to Slide 5. I wanted to take a few minutes to highlight several new strategic developments in the quarter. Most recently, we signed an MOU with 2 significant technology leaders, Accenture and Alibaba, to address sustainable infrastructure needs. This collaboration will focus on an estimated multibillion-dollar market for digital solutions serving data centers in China. 
We also signed a foundational technology agreement with Tempered Networks, building upon our recent cybersecurity partnerships with Pelion and DigiCert. Each of these partnerships embeds a critical layer of trust, security and operational capability into our OpenBlue platform and connected devices. These elements differentiate our products and services to help protect the integrity of our customers' operations and data. 
Tempered brings an industry-leading zero-trust secure network capability that helps us drive customer confidence and, in turn, accelerate the adoption of OpenBlue services. Our partnerships with UL, Safe Traces and with Phylagen are powerful examples of how we are innovating to extend our Healthy Buildings leadership, providing new indoor environmental quality solutions to address our customers' most pressing challenges.  
Our near-term focus is on the education vertical as there is a clear and compelling need to help those customers optimize their investments. With an estimated $195 billion in government stimulus earmarked for K-12 spending, this provides a significant opportunity. Additionally, we entered into an exclusive joint development agreement and investment with Phylagen, a leading biotech company working on the identification of indoor bacteria and viruses that are all around us in buildings. Our work with Phylagen is a commitment to developing the cutting-edge capabilities to deliver and maintain healthy buildings.  
Please turn to Slide 6. At our Investor Day, we shared with you our 3 pillars for delivering above-market growth over the next 3 years and beyond. One of those pillars related to gaining share through innovative product development centered around digital and sustainability. As planned, we launched over 150 new products in fiscal 2021, spanning nearly all business units, resulting in continued share gains in both Q4 and the full year.  
In 2022, we are well positioned to gain share with another 175 new products across 4 main categories: sustainability, smart buildings, digital and residential, with heat pumps central to our product development strategy. These are just a sample of what is expected to launch over the next 90 days, with a steady pipeline behind us.  
Turning to Slide 7. Service plays a central role in everything we do. Over the last 18 months, we have strengthened our market-leading capabilities to best position ourselves for the shifting industry demographics and evolving digital technologies that are enabling outcome-based solution models. At the start of last year, we began articulating our intentions to accelerate service growth to a couple of points above market levels, part of which would be the result of increasing our attachment rate by leveraging our large installed base and the digital transformation of our business. 
In fiscal 2021, we saw the early benefits of our efforts shine through. We exited the year with service revenues up 8% in the fourth quarter with high single-digit growth in all 3 regions in nearly all business domains. For the full year, service revenue grew 4%, which is up 2 to 3 points over 2019 levels, despite a slow start to the year as we manage through lingering site access restrictions and abnormal customer budget pressures.  
Looking ahead, we see service accelerating through fiscal 2022, in line with our goal to outpace the market. The order strength we've seen in the second half of the year bolsters that view. Service orders were up 7% in Q4 and, importantly, up low single digits organically versus 2019 levels. Additionally, we improved our attach rate to approximately 40%.   
Turning to Slide 8. The third pillar is our vectors of growth, which we believe, on a combined basis, represents an incremental market opportunity of $250 billion over the next decade. Our unique portfolio is a competitive advantage across all 3 areas. And from a financial performance perspective, we have significantly increased both revenue and orders in fiscal 2021. This positions us very well for continued strong performance as we move forward.  
Next, on Slide 9, I wanted to highlight a key customer win related to one of our key vectors of growth. In Q4, we were awarded a Buildings as a Service project by one of our long-standing customers, the University of North Dakota. This is the second long-term Performance Infrastructure contract we have been awarded with this university in the last 2 years. It leverages not only our expertise in Performance Contracting, but also the OpenBlue Enterprise Manager software. 
The total contract value was nearly $220 million over the life of the project, with a smaller portion of that booked during the quarter. On a related note, our OpenBlue Healthy Buildings platform enabled nearly 900 colleges and universities to safely and efficiently welcome students, staff and faculty back to their campuses this fall.  
Before I turn things over to Olivier, let me conclude with a few thoughts. I remain extremely encouraged by the demand patterns we are seeing across most of our end markets and the ability of our teams to capitalize on more than our fair share of that demand. We see this decade as being one of the most exciting for the smart building industry, which Johnson Controls is positioned to lead. 
Underlying momentum in our short-cycle businesses continues to improve despite pressure from ongoing supply chain and component availability constraints. Our longer-cycle install business, driven by the new buildings market, also continues to recover, although extended lead times and inflation are delaying some investment decisions, particularly on larger projects. Retrofit activity remains an important driver of our business, and we see plenty of opportunity to capitalize on this activity going forward. 
All of that said, we are very mindful of the macro backdrop and our outlook does not assume any significant near-term improvement in supply chain conditions or inflation over the next couple of quarters. On price/cost, given the progressive rise in inflation for almost all input costs throughout the year, we took decisive steps on pricing and cost to stay ahead of the curve. And I am confident we will continue to manage through these challenges. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, our focus turns to accelerating and demonstrating our growth capabilities. Our proven product technology leadership, combined now with OpenBlue, truly differentiates the solutions we can bring to our customers. In fact, we believe we are best positioned to lead the revolution of smart buildings, and we are fully committed to creating healthier, safer and more sustainable buildings. 
With that, let me turn it over to Olivier to go through the details of the quarter."

Sales in the quarter were up 5% organically, led by Global Products, which is truly a reflection of the team's strong execution. Underlying momentum in this business continue to improve, as evidenced by mid-single digits growth on a 2-year stack basis. Our longer-cycle field business continue to recover, led by strong growth in services, up 8% in the quarter.  
Segment EBITA increased 10% versus the prior year, margin expanding 30 basis points to 15.9%. Better leverage on higher volumes, favorable mix and the incremental benefit of our SG&A actions more than offset the headwind from the reversal of temporary cost reductions and price/cost, including significant supply chain disruptions. 
EPS of $0.88 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 16% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $300 million, reflecting the reversal of timing benefits experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year, as expected. On a full year basis, we achieved 105% free cash flow conversion.  
Please turn to Slide 11. Orders for our field businesses increased 9%, led by low double-digit growth in install on strong double-digit growth in retrofit activity. We are also seeing continued strength in our service business, with orders up 7%, driven by strong growth in North America and EMEALA. Backlog grew 10% to more than $10 billion, with service backlog up 5% and install backlog up 11%. The sequential improvement was led by strong retrofit activity as new construction continues to recover from depressed level in fiscal '20, particularly in North America.  
Turning to our EPS bridge on Slide 12. Let me touch on a few key items. Overall, operations contributed $0.09 versus the prior year, including a $0.04 benefit from our SG&A productivity program, achieving our targeted savings in fiscal '21. We are well on track to achieve our SG&A and COGS savings in fiscal '22 and beyond. 
Similar to last quarter, excluding the headwind from the prior year temporary actions, underlying incrementals in Q4 were approximately 30%. Corporate was a $0.03 headwind year-over-year and other items netted to a $0.06 tailwind, primarily related to lower share count, lower net financing charges and FX.  
Let's discuss our segment results in more details on Slide 13. My commentary will also refer to the segment end-market performance included on Slide 14. North America revenue grew 4% organically, led by strength in services, which was higher in all domain. Install revenue was up low single digits, primarily due to strong demand from shorter-cycle retrofit and upgrade projects, and positive growth in new construction. Both our internal and customer supply chain restrictions negatively impacted our North America install business. 
By domain, Commercial Applied HVAC revenue grew mid-single digits, while Fire & Security increased low single digits in the quarter. We had another strong quarter in Performance Infrastructure, which grew revenue low double digits, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, a good reflection on our customers' demand for decarbonization solution. Segment margin decreased 20 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, primarily due to the reversal of temporary cost from the mitigation actions in the prior year. 
Orders in North America were up 11% versus the prior year, with high single-digit growth in both Commercial HVAC and Fire & Security. Performance Infrastructure orders were up nearly 40%. Applied HVAC orders increased 10% overall, driven by strong retrofit activity, with another strong quarter of equipment orders up over 20% in Q4. Backlog of $6.5 billion increased 10% year-over-year.  
Revenue in EMEALA increased 3% organically, led by continued strength in our service business, particularly in our Applied HVAC and Industrial Refrigeration businesses. Fire & Security, which account for nearly 60% of segment revenues, grew at mid-single digits rate in Q4, with strength across our enterprise accounts and residential security businesses, including a rebound in our retail platform. Industrial Refrigeration also grew mid-single digits, while Commercial HVAC & Controls declined low single digits. 
By geography, revenue growth was broad-based, with strength in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by low double-digit decline in the Middle East. Segment EBITA margins declined 30 basis points, driven by a prior year gain on sales. Underlying margin performance improved as favorable mix, positive price/cost and the benefit of SG&A savings this year more than offset the temporary mitigation actions taken in the prior year. Order in EMEALA continued to accelerate, increasing 7% in the quarter, with strong mid-teens growth in Commercial HVAC and high single-digit growth in Fire & Security. 
APAC revenue increased 7% organically, led by low double digits growth in Commercial HVAC & Controls. EBITA margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 15.5%, driven by a favorable reserve adjustment. APAC underlying margin declined year-over-year as volume leverage and net productivity was offset by unfavorable mix and negative price/cost. APAC orders grew 4%, driven by continued strength in Commercial HVAC. 
Global Products revenue grew 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, with broad-based strength across the portfolio. Our Global Residential HVAC business was up 5% in the quarter. North America Resi HVAC grew 4% in the quarter, benefiting from both higher volume and pricing. Outside of North America, our Residential HVAC business grew mid-single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe and driven in part by the launch of our new Hitachi air-to-water residential heat pump, which was well received by the market. 
In APAC, Residential HVAC declined low single digits as a result of softer industry demand in Japan, given the COVID-related state of emergency in place for much of the quarter. We continue to gain shares in Japan, up more than 100 basis points in the quarter, as we continue to launch new premium products with indoor air quality technologies. 
Although not reflected in our revenue growth, our Hisense JV revenue grew over 40% year-over-year in Q4, expanding our leading position in China. Commercial HVAC product sales were up low double digits overall, led by mid-teens growth in our indirect Applied business, including strong chiller demand within the data center end market. 
Light Commercial grew high single digits overall, with North America unitary equipment down 2% and VRF up high single digits. Our Light Commercial business in Asia was up low double digits, including a significant win in Taiwan to supply high-efficiency ductless unit with indoor air quality technology to all schools across the country. 
Fire & Security products grew high single digits in aggregate, led by our access and control and video solutions business and return to pre-pandemic levels for parts of our fire suppression business. EBITA margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 18.7% as volume leverage, higher equity income and the benefit of SG&A actions more than offset the temporary cost action in the prior year and price/cost, including the significant supply chain disruptions.  
Turning to Slide 15. Corporate expense increased significantly year-over-year off an abnormal low level to $83 million. For modeling purposes, we have included an outlook for some of our below-the-line items in financial year '22. I will point out that amortization expense reflects the full year run rate impact of Silent-Aire as well as additional software R&D. Net financing charges returned to a more normal level as fiscal '21 benefited from significant FX gain. Noncontrolling interest reflects continued growth in our Hitachi JV.  
Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 16. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. We ended the year with $1.3 billion in available cash and net debt at 1.8x, still below our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. On cash, we generated a little over $300 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly $2 billion year-to-date and achieving our target of 105% conversion for the year.  
As you will recall from our guidance last quarter, we expected a reversal in some of the timing benefits we experienced earlier in the year. I am extremely pleased with our cash performance and remain confident that we will sustain 100% conversion over the next several years. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased a little over 4 million shares for approximately $300 million, which for the full year, brings us to around 23 million shares or $1.3 billion.  
Let's turn to Slide 17 for a look at our historical Q1 seasonality. As you can see, Q1 typically represents less than 15% of our full year EPS given our normal seasonality. For Q1 of fiscal '22, we expect to be above that level, with Q1 guidance representing about 16% of our full year at the midpoint. Additionally, we expect an improving first half, second half versus historical seasonality. 
As we look at fiscal '22 overall, on Slide 18, we are entering the year with record backlog, and underlying markets are continuing to improve. With that said, we do expect supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment to continue, at least over the next couple of quarters. On a full year basis, we expect high single-digit organic revenue growth, with 70 to 80 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion. 
Although we expect to remain price/cost positive on an EPS basis,  the inflated level of pricing will result in margin headwinds of approximately 40 basis points for the year. Underlying margins are expanding to 110 to 120 basis points. Additionally, we expect another year of strong earnings growth, with adjusted EPS in the range of $3.22 to $3.32, which represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%. 
Turning to Slide 19. We can see that our expectations for fiscal '22 are very much in line with the growth expectations we provided at our recent Investor Day, and we are accelerating growth in each area. Last, on Slide 20, I want to reiterate that we are well on our way to our '24 targets. 
With that, operator, we can open up the lines for questions."

So if you look at North America, and let's focus on the commercial HVAC market, certainly, this is a very attractive end market. It has long secular drivers that align very well with our core. And as you know, Nigel, we've been investing nicely, rei",519,"Sure. So if you look at North America, and let's focus on the commercial HVAC market, certainly, this is a very attractive end market. It has long secular drivers that align very well with our core. And as you know, Nigel, we've been investing nicely, reinvesting into our product, and we're -- I think, overall, we're taking share. For the year, we're going to be up about almost 200 basis points. 
Big focus on energy efficiency and sustainability. And that's supported with not only our industry-leading chillers, but also now with the new rooftops that we're bringing into the market, with low-GWP refrigeration that's driving increased efficiency and driving service. And then we're investing more heavily now in the next-gen air cool technologies, electrification with heat pumps and heat transfer units as well as advanced VRF technology. 
So as you said, we have had strong performance not only in North America, but across the globe -- across the board. That's also enabling us to be able to create a very nice installed base and get that connected, which drives to longer-term services. And all of this is being enhanced with our digital capabilities with OpenBlue. 
So specifically in Applied, when you look at the demand for retrofit opportunities driven by healthy buildings and return to work and school, particularly in North America, that was very strong with our controls airside and filtration. A lot of that has been driven by K-12. We also see a strong demand globally for air-cooled chillers in data centers and rental markets as well as industrial heat pumps -- and both chiller -- in our IR portfolios. 
And so when you look at our orders globally in Applied, it's up 11% globally. North America, when you look at purely equipment, it's up kind of mid-20s, which was very strong, and that's sequentially to a very strong quarter that we had in the third quarter. So overall, we're gaining nice share, as I said, for the year, up almost 200 basis points. 
Now as it relates to -- on the residential, when we talk about the residential space, we continue to perform very well. When you look at our residential business in ducted, we have a nice, nice backlog. We're up significantly in backlog, and we're continuing to perform well. We've been investing in new products here and ultimately gaining share, and we feel good about that. 
Now globally, when you look at the overall position that we have globally in residential, we had decent performance in our JCH business, which was up about 4%. And I think, and as we look at that business, we've been gaining share and continuing to perform with the new products that we've been able to bring to market. 
We -- although Japan was down 11%, we outperformed in that market. You know that, that's a big end market for us. We had strong growth in Europe, which was up about 35%. And as Olivier said, that the China, the Hisense business, the HAPQ is up over 40%. So overall, we feel good about our overall performance in residential."

Certainly, not only expanding our market coverage, we've been enhancing our technology and now deploying a lot more digital content within the solutions that we provide to our customers. And we've been going after the underserved installed base. 
With an incredible installed base, we have a material opportunity and, we believe, a competitive advantage now with the technology that we're bringing to really create a lot of value. And it's got a very attractive margin profile, as you know, 2x the company EBITDA margin. And so that all being said, with the investments we've been making, we've been certainly -- not only as we bring new projects to the field, we're getting a lot more connectivity and getting attached PSAs while we've been going after the installed base, which, historically, we had not served. 
And so this year, with the work that we did, we got that attach rate up to now 40%. We're continuing to make a lot of progress with that installed base. We're committing another 300 to 400 basis point improvement in '22. And that's all tied to -- when you look at the new services that we're bringing to the market, we're bringing 20 new service products and offerings in '22 across our domains, leveraging technology and data insights. 
And that will enable our customers to not only reach their clean air, fire and security as well as sustainability goals. And that's going to be a big focus for us.

Let me start with the first question there. When you look at what we've done here in the last year, given all of the volatility, I would say that our team is operating at top quartile, that we have been able to navigate and be able to stay ahead of the disruption. We've been working closely with our suppliers. We're working closely with our customers. And ultimately, we've been able to deliver on our commitments. 
And so we're going to stay proactive. We're going to continue to work it. With that all being said, we do believe that, in the quarter, that there was probably an impact of about 1% to 2% on top line as a result of the shortages that hindered our ability to be able to convert all that we could have. But the team, overall, has done a great job working with our suppliers to be able to mitigate the impact and ultimately secure the critical materials. 
Now as it relates to labor, because of our growth rates and the like, we have had a program management team globally to make sure that we're positioning ourselves to get all of the critical talent that's going to be required to support the growth strategies that we laid out during the Investor Day, which we feel very good about. And so we have been able to stay ahead of the curve in being able to bring on, whether it be the skilled technicians, the technical capability that we need to support OpenBlue, all of the different capabilities to be able to produce. 
Now with some of the demand, we have been -- we talked a little bit about the accelerated demand in unitary residential and as well as rooftops, we've had -- we've been stretched with capacity. That being said, we have been bringing on new capacity. We just brought on some additional capacity here in the last month, which will help improve our abilities there.

So when you look at -- like I said, this has become a central focus for the entire organization, recognizing that all of the investments we make in products as well as now with OpenBlue, the translation of that, Jeff, is into a solution, into a recurring revenue that ultimately creates more value for our customers and, certainly, we get the return to our service margin rates. 
And so when you look -- the traditional service business, obviously, that's come back nicely post pandemic. Well, the accelerator now is what we're doing with digital, the new OpenBlue offerings. That all is helping us increase attach rates, and then not only attach rates, but now additional services, taking the intelligence, applying AI and ultimately now delivering these new service offerings. As I said, through 2021, we delivered 15 new service offerings. A lot of those were tied to healthy buildings, sustainability, all of our key growth vectors, and we've been able to build a tremendous pipeline of opportunity that we're now beginning to convert. 
When you look at service orders, we're up 7% above the 2019 levels, and we see that continuing with that momentum. Because not only is it -- we're getting the core business is coming back, and we're going to continue to maintain that with the traditional service business that we perform. More important now is the conversion of all of the new services on top of that, that has become the accelerator. And so we believe that we're positioned here well to continue to build backlog, to get more of it recurring and, ultimately, with the value that we create, continued very strong margins on that service going forward."

Let me mention a few levers we are using today. One, we have priced projects through last year, anticipating some level of inflations. That's point number one. Point number two, we had modified about 2 years ago our contract agreement to allow us to adjust pricing. For number three, we have identified now, because of our business intelligence, part of the market which are less sensitive to price. Point number four, and George mentioned that today, our offering now provide great value to our customers: decarb, sustainability, indoor air quality. And we offer great ROI for our customers and then price to value. 
Our backlog is now also shorter, so we can adjust pricing faster. On materials, for a large part of our whole materials today, we have ESG program covering costs for about 6 months. And last but not least, across the enterprise at Johnson Controls, our workforce is incentivized to drive pricing, pricing rate.
