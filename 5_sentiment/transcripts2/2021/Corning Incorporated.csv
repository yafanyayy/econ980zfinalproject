With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. 
I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The these statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. 
Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the fourth quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stem from restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash as well as noncash mark-to-market losses associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. 
For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q4 by $63 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. 
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. 
Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast, and we encourage you to follow along, and you can download them from our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell."

Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3 bi",1840,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. 
Our operating margin expanded 500 basis points year-over-year to 19.4%. Operating income grew 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, $948 million for the full year, and we finished the year with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet. 
It goes without saying, 2020 was an incredibly difficult year. We joined the rest of the world to confront the pandemic, economic uncertainty and social unrest. Throughout the year, we focused on our customers and executed on strategic priorities while protecting our people. For more perspective on our performance, I'll share 3 observations. 
First, we demonstrated our ability to adapt rapidly and remain resilient in the face of uncertainty; second, our More Corning content strategy clearly contributed to our growth and outperformed against our end markets; and finally, throughout this difficult period, we're embracing the opportunity to make a difference wherever we are, with what we have to contribute. 
Now I'll expand on my first observation. Our decisive actions and strong operational execution have resulted in continued leadership in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. Like many companies, we focused on bolstering our financial strength, reducing production levels and operating cost, carefully managing inventory, reducing capital expenditures and pausing share buybacks. 
However, it's not about what we cut, but what we kept. While we adjusted production, we didn't reduce capacity, keeping us positioned to meet increasing demand when the economy improved. We continue to make strategic investments and advance major innovations with our customers to capture the growth playing out across our market access platforms. 
And we develop multifaceted programs to protect our talent and preserve our capabilities. Our first half actions generated significant cost savings in the second half of the year. And as the economy started showing signs of green shoots, we effectively adjusted our operations keeping pace as demand started to recover in many of the markets we serve. 
Our results tell the story. Our sales were down 12% in the first half as most economies were impacted by pandemic related lockdowns. But in the second half, we improved sales 24% over the first, while growing operating income 122%, returning the year-over-year growth and generating very strong free cash flow. For the year, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow, and our balance sheet remains very strong. We expect this strong momentum to continue heading into 2021. 
We will continue to adapt and focus on execution as we have proven that our approach is working. Turning to my second observation. In all the industries we serve, important market trends continue to offer new challenges that Corning is just uniquely qualified to address, and new opportunities to integrate More Corning content into our customers' products. 
In this difficult year, we have proven that this is an especially powerful value creation letter. We aren't relying exclusively on people buying more stuff. We're putting more corning into the products that people are already buying. In the fourth quarter, this strategy paid off as we grew sales year-over-year in every one of our businesses. 
At the top were Specialty Materials, with sales up 20% year-over-year, and Environmental Technologies up 19% year-over-year, both significantly outperforming their end markets. Last quarter, I described our innovations in Mobile Consumer Electronics, looking at how we're investing to create additional revenue streams and capture content opportunities. 
Today, I'll focus on our Automotive market-access platform. The auto industry is undergoing major disruptions. Automakers are designing cleaner and safer vehicles while featuring technology that provides immersive experiences. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. And for us, the opportunity is large in the range of $100 per car in Corning content. 
We're collaborating with more OEMS, and we're offering more solutions to help move the industry forward. Let's look at 2 of our biggest successes right now. Starting with our Automotive Glass Solutions business. We're building strong momentum. Our advantaged solutions are enabling the very rapid shift towards in-vehicle displays that are interactive, that are integrated and shaped. 
We're collaborating with industry leaders across the auto ecosystem, including Visteon, LGE, BOE, and Via Optronics to accelerate the adoption of our patented 3D ColdForm technology, which enables lower cost, shaped auto interiors. Our large-scale facility in Hefei, China, is now fully operational and servicing our growing demand. And we continue to see strong adoption of our technology by auto OEMS. 
Our recent proof point is the new Mercedes-Benz hyper screen dashboard display, which features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. Similarly, in Environmental Technologies, in a year when a global pandemic temporarily shut down OEM production, our proprietary gasoline particulate filter business still grew sales year-over-year. 
When we introduced EPS, we said our technology increased our content opportunity per car by 3 to 4x. Like most of our innovations, it started with the customer challenge. Europe and China are addressing fine particular pollution with new emissions regulations. We applied our expertise in ceramic science with our advanced manufacturing capabilities and extrusion to rapidly develop filters that efficiently trap ion particulates. 
And today, we're effectively helping automakers reduce these harmful emissions, meet new regulations and produce some of the cleanest gasoline vehicles you can buy. Demand for our GPF has grown quickly. And with our market-leading product, we continue to win the majority of platforms awarded to date. We're well on our way to building a $500 million business. 
We're actually ahead of schedule, and the content opportunity continues to grow. We expect our GPF technology to migrate beyond Europe and China as other regions focus on improving air quality. And many new car models will soon be required to get even closer to near 0 particulate emissions. 
In response, we recently introduced our next-generation GPF featuring enhanced filtration capabilities. They're launching in upcoming models as automakers prepare for the next wave of regulations. Across our markets, we see a similar content story playing out as we respond to key industry challenges with More Corning solutions. 
Let me share some other accomplishments across our market access platforms. In Life Sciences, pandemic related demand has highlighted our strength in the industry. And we achieved major milestones towards building a significant Valor Glass franchise in 2020. At the start of the year, we entered a long-term supply agreement to provide Valor Glass vials for a portion of the currently marketed Pfizer drug products. 
Soon after, we were awarded $204 million in funding from the U.S. government to substantially expand domestic manufacturing capacity for Valor vials. Today, we're supplying Valor Glass to several leading COVID vaccine manufacturers. We've produced millions of Valor vials and shipped enough for more than 100 million doses, supporting multiple vaccine developers. 
In our Life Sciences segment, the global health fight is driving strong demand for our consumable products. We're supporting the development of treatments in vaccines as well as mass testing efforts. We received $15 million from the U.S. government to expand domestic capacity for robotic pipette tips, which are used for Cove diagnostic testing. BioNTech recently recognized our contribution to their successful COVID vaccine development. 
Turning to Mobile Consumer Electronics. We launched the toughest Gorilla Glass yet, Victus. And it's already featured on 6 Samsung devices. Corning also invented the world's first transparent color-free glass ceramic, which is featured on the front cover of the latest iPhone. Apple and Corning partnered to develop and scale manufacturing of Ceramic Shield. It offers unparallel durability and toughness. 
I noted that Specialty Materials sales were up 20% year-over-year in quarter 4. They were up 18% for the full year in a smartphone market, that declined 7%. In optical communications, we returned to growth and we expect this growth to continue as customers increase spending to support growing bandwidth requirements. In 2020, we introduced new and innovative solutions that help speed the deployment of 5G. 
We launched our outdoor 5G-ready connectivity solutions, featuring compact easy-to-install terminals that can be deployed in any conceivable architecture. Operators can actually save up to $500 per terminal location, dramatically lowering installation cost and speeding up deployment. We're also collaborating with Verizon to enable 5G millimeter wave indoor deployments for their enterprise customers. 
We're also working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G ready, easy to install and affordable. And we're collaborating with Enersys to simplify the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small cell wireless sites. 
Turning to Display. Retail demand for TV and IT products remain strong. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% for the full year. Large TVs are most efficiently made on Gen 10.5 plants. Corning is well positioned to capture that growth with its Gen 10.5 plants in China, including the 2 newest Gen 10.5 facilities in Wuhan and Guangzhou, which are now expanding production to meet customer demand. Ramping these sites has been no small feat in the midst of a pandemic. 
We are very proud of our innovative and dedicated expert engineering teams that rose to a host of unprecedented challenges to start up tanks in both facilities. Looking ahead, Corning's long-term growth drivers and content opportunities are strong in each of our markets. And we believe some secular trends could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to change in the aftermath of the health crisis. 
And that leads to my third observation. We're living through the kind of moment that tends to bring true carrier to light at Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We've unleased our capabilities to help combat the virus. And we're proud to be creating life-changing technologies that contribute to keeping people safe and help society address the challenges of the pandemic. 
We also recognize in these unprecedented times that we have the opportunity to share resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We've launched racial and social quality programs, and our unity campaign support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities. Around the world. In conclusion, on all fronts, Corning is executing well. We're delivering outstanding results and making important progress across our strategic priorities. I am confident that we are entering the year with solid momentum and we expect to grow in 2021. 
Our More Corning strategy will continue to drive outperformance across the diverse industries that we serve. We're not just counting on consumers buying more cars, TVs or smartphones to grow. And I'm excited about how we're bringing our capabilities to bear in Optical and Life Sciences as operators expand their networks and we continue to support vital drug and vaccine development. Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so that he can provide additional insight on our results and expectations."
173840,699741068,2182053,"Corning Incorporated, 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone.

We expect to grow again in the first quarter, and we expect to grow for the full year driven by improving",1507,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. We feel good about our fourth quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, we grew sales and earnings. We expect to grow again in the first quarter, and we expect to grow for the full year driven by improving markets and our More Corning strategy. We are building a bigger, stronger company that delivers sustainable results while remaining agile in our ability to respond to changing market factors. 
Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter, we grew sales 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, exceeding expectations. Excluding the consolidation of Hemlock Semiconductor, sales grew 11% year-over-year, with every segment growing sales and net income. 
Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies delivered particularly strong year-over-year sales growth, up 20% and 19%, respectively, both outperforming their underlying markets. Optical Communications returned to year-over-year growth, and we expect that growth to continue. Our operating margin was 19.4%. That is an improvement of 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis. 
We grew operating income 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Cumulative free cash flow for the full year was $948 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. We entered 2021 in an excellent financial position. 
Now let's review the business segments. In Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $841 million, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. And net income was $217 million, up 11% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Retail demand for TV and IT products remained strong during the promotional season in Q4. 
Display's full year sales were $3.2 billion, and net income was $717 million. Our full year price declines in 2020 were mid-single digits. The glass market and our glass volume were up mid-single digits for the year. The retail market was more robust than the industry expected, resulting in panel supply being tight for the second half of 2020. 
Panel makers ran at high utilizations and the industry drew down inventory to satisfy demand. These dynamics also resulted in glass supply being tight, and more recently in shortage due to a power outage at a competitor's glass plant. Now let's look at 2021. We expect the TV and IT retail markets to remain strong. We remain confident that large size TVs will continue to grow, and we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5 and which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. 
We expect the glass market to grow a mid- single-digit percentage in 2021. We expect glass supply to remain tight in the upcoming quarters. As a result of these supply-demand dynamics, we are experiencing a very favorable pricing environment. We expect Q1 2021 glass prices to be flat with Q4 2020. This is significantly better than the sequential declines we've seen in any other first quarter over the last decade. 
Glass prices for some customers in some gen sizes may actually see a sequential increase. We believe the following 3 factors will continue to drive the favorable pricing environment for the upcoming quarters: First, we expect glass supply to continue to be tight; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels; and third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. 
Glass prices must support acceptable returns on these investments. In optical communications, fourth quarter sales were $976 million, up 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Our year-over-year growth can be attributed to broad improvements in demand for both carrier and enterprise customers. 
Fourth quarter core net income of $141 million was up 127% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. The improvement was driven by the incremental volume, and favorable cost performance. We have returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we expect that growth to continue. Bandwidth demand is increasing and users are demanding higher performance connections. We're seeing positive statements from customers on increasing investments in their optical networks. Our sales and order rates are picking up, and we're ready to capture demand as it materializes. We are confident we will grow sales in Optical Communications for the year. We continue to monitor and evaluate market demand signals to determine the magnitude of growth, and we'll keep -- we'll continue to keep you updated as we go through the year. 
In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $445 million, up 19% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, ahead of expectations as markets continue to improve and GPF adoptions continued in China. Net income was $93 million, up 45% year-over-year and 35% sequentially, driven by strong operational performance globally and successful ramping of additional GPF capacity in China. 
For the full year, sales were $1.4 billion, and our performance was better than the underlying market. Net income was $197 million. While our full year 2020 sales were certainly impacted by COVID-19, we are recovering faster than the market by increasing our content for both the automotive and diesel end markets. Despite severely challenged markets i.e. over growth in GPF sales, strong GPF adoption continues in Europe and in China, where the China 6A regulation is being implemented nationwide this month. We are ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million GPF business. 
Specialty Materials had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year. Q4 sales of $545 million were up 20% year-over-year, full year sales were $1.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year despite a 7% decline in the smartphone market, driven by strong demand for our premium cover materials and our other innovations. 
Net income was $423 million, up 40% from 2019 on higher sales volume and strong cost performance. The importance of computing and connectivity were amplified during the pandemic. Our new product innovations, including Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, as well as our EUV products in the semiconductor market were important contributors to our strong performance. 
Now before I get to our Life Sciences results, I'd like to note something of great importance to us. Throughout the pandemic, our Life Sciences market access platform has applied its broad capabilities and full product portfolio to help the world combat the pandemic. From our traditionally research-focused consumables to our bioproduction products to our transport media and, of course, our Valor glass, we're playing a vital role in the development and supply of test kits and vaccines. 
Now let's look at our segment results. Life Sciences fourth quarter sales were $274 million, up 7% year-over-year and 23% sequentially, driven by strong demand for COVID related products, including bioproduction products used in clinical trials. Net income was $42 million, up 11% year-over-year and 50% sequentially. 
In summary, we successfully navigated a very challenging year. We strengthened our balance sheet, established growth in the second half and generated free cash flow of $948 million for the year. As we look ahead, we have strong momentum coming into 2021 and expect year-over-year growth to accelerate in the first quarter. 
Specifically, we expect core sales of $3 billion to $3.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first quarter last year and EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, which is double last year's first quarter EPS at the low end of the range. 
For the full year, we expect growth in sales and earnings, and we anticipate generating more free cash flow in 2021 than in 2020. And we will share more with you as the year progresses. Let's turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and prudent capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. 
We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
In 2021, we expect CapEx similar to 2020 as we have capacity in place to meet higher sales. Now we'll invest more if we require capacity to support additional growth, any additional capital investment would be supported by a customer commitment. We'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year. Given our expected strong free cash flow generation in 2021, we expect to increase our distributions to shareholders. That includes reinstating opportunistic share repurchases sometime this year. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our strong close to 2020, highlighted by growing sales and profitability. We continue to focus on a rich set of opportunities. Our businesses are fundamental to the long-term growth drivers in the industries they serve, and our More Corning strategy continues to deliver sales outperformance relative to our end markets. And I look forward to sharing our progress as the year goes on. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

The market overall was more robust than what we had expected. And what the industry expected, which meant that panel makers ran tight in the second half of 2020. Not only did those higher utilizations, but the industry also brought down inventory to meet that demand and that meant that glass was tight throughout the year. And as you -- we remain confident that things will remain tight on -- over the next several quarters because of where we think demand is and as that demand continues to be met, there's also a need to replenish what's happened from a supply chain standpoint and some of the tightness that's happened from a supply chain standpoint. 
So that's obviously led to very favorable pricing in the first quarter. And as we look out over the next several quarters, we think that, that environment continues, that tight environment continues. Yes. Just building on tones because I think you're -- obviously a close watcher of the industry. We were tight. Glass was tight, and glass is going to stay tight for -- as far as we can see right now. 
Then with a competitor having a power outage and the planned shutdown of the Korean operations, that took everything being delayed because the market was so strong, that tipped everything in the shortage. So we went from being very tight to go into shortage. And that's what led to the very, very strong quarter 1 pricing environment. 
But we're going to stay tight even as we address those. I think the Koreans will still, ultimately, continue their shift to those big Gen 10.5 plants just because it's more economical. But right now, they continue to press us to be able to help them supply their Korean operations, and they're not providing a firm end date for when they'll transfer those over, primarily because they continue to see this end market is being very strong. Does that make sense? Does that answer your question?"

I personally have now switched to leading a key engineering program to help address this upcoming bottleneck. That's a long answer. Really, I could have simply just said, how has it changed our view, we need to make a lot more vials, is the short answer to your question, Shannon."

I think the last several calls, we really have focused in on our fundamental belief that as bandwidth demand is increasing and users demand higher performance connections that this was going to be positive from a business standpoint. And we've even talked about, I think, in the last quarter about how our customers were beginning to talk more about that in their conference calls, and there are plenty of examples of that. 
I think what's really happened over the last 3 or 4 months is that our sales and order rates have started to pick up. And it's really that pickup in the sales and order rates, which is what drove our growth on a year-over-year basis and why we're confident that, that growth is going to happen. So I think the question before was was when was it going to happen? And I think the answer is that it's happening now. And so I think that's how we think about it there. And then I think from an overall economic standpoint, clearly, as we enter into the year, we had a very strong fourth quarter, and we expect to have a strong first quarter. 
But there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world and we're not in the greatest position to sort through how that uncertainty is actually going to play out. We think there's 2 places where we can provide unique insights. When was optical that we just talked about.

Normally, you have a big step down in Q1 and then you have very moderate in through the rest of the year, this year, you're not really seeing a step down. In fact, with some customers, you're seeing a step up. So should we expect that pace of pricing to remain as it has in past years, just very, very moderate?

And I would like to make a little more macro comment on how we see the year. Yes. I think from an OpEx standpoint, I see -- clearly, we got into the early parts of 2020 and things were changing, we did a number of things to adjust our operating cost. Some of them were set up so that we would be able to as the economy has recovered, be able to respond to that. Some of them were compensation related, for example, furloughs and things like that. 
And certainly, to the degree that business has returned, of course, those costs will also return. But from an overall standpoint, we've remained very focused from an OpEx standpoint to make sure that we're getting leverage as we grow and that we don't grow our OpEx over a longer period of time as fast as we grow our sales. And that's really our underlying philosophy from an OpEx standpoint. 
I think what structurally makes it possible for us to do is when you us lay out our 3, 4, 5 framework, what that allows us to do as we build on our market access platforms, is that ability to sort of reuse and share those platforms, both in our -- we've seen that both on our technology side as well now in our customer-facing organizations. 
And so that should allow us to more efficiently address the growth that we see. And over time, we do expect that at operating margin leverage to be sort of a more powerful generated for us than just at the manufacturing gross margin levels. So you're going to see us really addressing that more because that's where we're seeing the synergy really start to drive across our portfolio. 
Let's touch briefly on Specialty for you. We would expect that our outperformance versus the smartphone market to continue. And sort of the -- I'm not calling what happens with the smartphone market. So that kind of takes me to a sort of a broader point. And I'd be really interested in [indiscernible] from investors, both sell-side and buy, which is -- we saw the strong momentum. We knew it was coming, but we saw the strong momentum and really strong order book in Q4. And that continues into this quarter. So that increasing clarity enabled us to provide the sales in EPS guidance that we just did for quarter 1. 
Now we listened to our investors and made it simple and clear by providing sales and EPS for the entire company rather than the more complicated and detailed market-by-market guidance that we previously provided. Now as we turn to the total year, simply put, we expect our momentum and our outperformance versus our markets to continue. 
So then the question really becomes what happens in the macro environment. Now you all have your own experts and opinions on what's going to happen in the macro. At Corning, we approach our ability to predict macroeconomic and geopolitical events and tensions with great humility. Hence, we don't think it's helpful for us at this time to predict these forces, and therefore, what exactly our revenue for the year will be. 
What we are confident of is that we're going to outperform these markets. So as you pick your geopolitical or macroeconomic scenario, for our various markets, what you can count on is we're going to do better than that. So that may be more than you wanted to know, Asiya, but that's how we think about it."

And so that's what we're seeing. And that's why we're saying it."

Tony, we're looking at the cash flow conversion of EBITDA in the fourth quarter, and it's lower than we anticipated. We see the working capital release a little lower than last year. So that's one of the drivers that normally, we see pretty good conversion in Q4. I assume maybe there's cove related impacts, et cetera. But I wonder if you could dig into the color on that a little bit more for us and help us understand the dynamics of the cash flow conversion, whether it's one-off in nature and kind of some of those things go away as we move into the year here?"

But overall, we were very excited about our cash flow conversion. And frankly, that's a question that a lot of our investors have asked us over the last couple of years, and it's something that we've been focused on. And this is what happens when we're not in a build cycle. We generate a lot of operating cash flow. We generate a lot of free cash flow, and we saw that in the back half of this year. We expect to see more of that in '21."

With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.  
I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data.  
Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the fourth quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stem from restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash as well as noncash mark-to-market losses associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.  
For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q4 by $63 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.  
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center.  
Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast, and we encourage you to follow along, and you can download them from our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell."

Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3",1837,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. 
For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Our operating margin expanded 500 basis points year-over-year to 19.4%. Operating income grew 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, $948 million for the full year, and we finished the year with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet.  
It goes without saying, 2020 was an incredibly difficult year. We joined the rest of the world to confront the pandemic, economic uncertainty and social unrest. Throughout the year, we focused on our customers and executed on strategic priorities while protecting our people. For more perspective on our performance, I'll share 3 observations. First, we demonstrated our ability to adapt rapidly and remain resilient in the face of uncertainty. Second, our More Corning content strategy clearly contributed to our growth and outperformed against our end markets. And finally, throughout this difficult period, we're embracing the opportunity to make a difference, wherever we are, with what we have to contribute.  
Now I'll expand on my first observation. Our decisive actions and strong operational execution have resulted in continued leadership in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. Like many companies, we focused on bolstering our financial strength, reducing production levels and operating cost, carefully managing inventory, reducing capital expenditures and pausing share buybacks. However, it's not about what we cut, but what we kept. While we adjusted production, we didn't reduce capacity, keeping us positioned to meet increasing demand when the economy improved. We continue to make strategic investments and advance major innovations with our customers to capture the growth playing out across our market access platforms. And we developed multifaceted programs to protect our talent and preserve our capabilities. 
Our first half actions generated significant cost savings in second half of the year. And as the economy started showing signs of green shoots, we effectively adjusted our operations keeping pace as demand started to recover in many of the markets we serve. Our results tell the story. Our sales were down 12% in the first half as most economies were impacted by pandemic related lockdowns. But in the second half, we improved sales 24% over the first, while growing operating income 122%, returning the year-over-year growth and generating very strong free cash flow. For the year, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow, and our balance sheet remains very strong. We expect this strong momentum to continue heading into 2021. We will continue to adapt and focus on execution as we have proven that our approach is working. 
Turning to my second observation. In all the industries we serve, important market trends continue to offer new challenges that Corning is just uniquely qualified to address, and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into our customers' products. In this difficult year, we have proven that this is an especially powerful value creation ladder. We aren't relying exclusively on people buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. In the fourth quarter, this strategy paid off as we grew sales year-over-year in every one of our businesses.  
At the top were Specialty Materials, with sales up 20% year-over-year, and Environmental Technologies up 19% year-over-year, both significantly outperforming their end markets. Last quarter, I described our innovations in Mobile Consumer Electronics, looking at how we're investing to create additional revenue streams and capture content opportunities.  
Today, I'll focus on our Automotive Market-Access platform. The auto industry is undergoing major disruptions. Automakers are designing cleaner and safer vehicles while featuring technology that provides immersive experiences. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. And for us, the opportunity is large in the range of $100 per car in Corning content. We're collaborating with more OEMS, and we're offering more solutions to help move the industry forward. Let's look at 2 of our biggest successes right now. Starting with our Automotive Glass Solutions business. We're building strong momentum. Our advantaged solutions are enabling the very rapid shift towards in-vehicle displays that are interactive, that are integrated and shaped.  
We're collaborating with industry leaders across the auto ecosystem, including Visteon, LGE, BOE, and VIA Optronics to accelerate the adoption of our patented 3D ColdForm technology, which enables lower cost, shaped auto interiors. Our large-scale facility in Hefei, China, is now fully operational and servicing our growing demand. And we continue to see strong adoption of our technology by auto OEMs. Our recent proof point is the new Mercedes-Benz Hyperscreen dashboard display, which features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. 
Similarly, in Environmental Technologies, in a year when a global pandemic temporarily shut down OEM production, our proprietary gasoline particulate filter business still grew sales year-over-year. When we introduced EPS, we said our technology increased our content opportunity per car by 3 to 4x. Like most of our innovations, it started with the customer challenge. Europe and China are addressing fine particular pollution with new emissions regulations. We applied our expertise in ceramic science with our advanced manufacturing capabilities in extrusion to rapidly develop filters that efficiently trap ion particulates. And today, we're effectively helping automakers reduce these harmful emissions, meet new regulations and produce some of the cleanest gasoline vehicles you can buy. 
Demand for our GPF has grown quickly. And with our market-leading product, we continue to win the majority of platforms awarded to date. We're well on our way to building a $500 million business. We're actually ahead of schedule, and the content opportunity continues to grow. We expect our GPF technology to migrate beyond Europe and China as other regions focus on improving air quality. And many new car models will soon be required to get even closer to near 0 particulate emissions.  
In response, we recently introduced our next-generation GPF featuring enhanced filtration capabilities. They're launching in upcoming models as automakers prepare for the next wave of regulations. Across our markets, we see a similar content story playing out as we respond to key industry challenges with more Corning solutions.  
Let me share some other accomplishments across our market access platforms. In Life Sciences, pandemic related demand has highlighted our strength in the industry. And we achieved major milestones towards building a significant Valor Glass franchise in 2020. At the start of the year, we entered a long-term supply agreement to provide Valor Glass vials for a portion of the currently marketed Pfizer drug products. Soon after, we were awarded $204 million in funding from the U.S. government to substantially expand domestic manufacturing capacity for Valor vials. Today, we're supplying Valor Glass to several leading COVID vaccine manufacturers. We produce millions of Valor vials and shipped enough for more than 100 million doses, supporting multiple vaccine developers.  
In our Life Sciences segment, the global health fight is driving strong demand for our consumable products. We're supporting the development of treatments in vaccines as well as mass testing efforts. We received $15 million from the U.S. government to expand domestic capacity for robotic pipette tips, which are used for COVID diagnostic testing. BioNTech recently recognized our contribution to their successful COVID vaccine development.  
Turning to Mobile Consumer Electronics. We launched the toughest Gorilla Glass yet, Victus. And it's already featured on 6 Samsung devices. Corning also invented the world's first transparent color-free glass ceramic, which is featured on the front cover of the latest iPhone. Apple and Corning partnered to develop and scale manufacturing of Ceramic Shield. It offers unparallel durability and toughness.  
I noted that Specialty Materials sales were up 20% year-over-year in quarter 4. They were up 18% for the full year in a smartphone market, that declined 7%. In Optical Communications, we returned to growth and we expect this growth to continue as customers increase spending to support growing bandwidth requirements. In 2020, we introduced new and innovative solutions that help speed the deployment of 5G. We launched our outdoor 5G-ready connectivity solutions, featuring compact easy-to-install terminals that can be deployed in any conceivable architecture. Operators can actually save up to $500 per terminal location, dramatically lowering installation cost and speeding up deployment. We're also collaborating with Verizon to enable 5G millimeter wave indoor deployments for their enterprise customers.  
We're also working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G ready, easy to install and affordable. And we're collaborating with EnerSys to simplify the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small cell wireless sites.  
Turning to Display. Retail demand for TV and IT products remain strong. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% for the full year. Large TVs are most efficiently made on Gen 10.5 plants. Corning is well positioned to capture that growth with its Gen 10.5 plants in China, including the 2 newest Gen 10.5 facilities in Wuhan and Guangzhou, which are now expanding production to meet customer demand. Ramping these sites has been no small feat in the midst of a pandemic. We are very proud of our innovative and dedicated expert engineering teams that rose to a host of unprecedented challenges to start-up tanks in both facilities. 
Looking ahead, Corning's long-term growth drivers and content opportunities are strong in each of our markets. And we believe some secular trends could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to change in the aftermath of the health crisis. And that leads to my third observation. We're living through the kind of moment that tends to bring true character to light. At Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We've unleashed our capabilities to help combat the virus. And we're proud to be creating life-changing technologies that contribute to keeping people safe and help society address the challenges of the pandemic.  
We also recognize in these unprecedented times that we have the opportunity to share resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We've launched racial and social quality programs, and our unity campaign support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. 
In conclusion, on all fronts, Corning is executing well. We're delivering outstanding results and making important progress across our strategic priorities. I am confident that we are entering the year with solid momentum and we expect to grow in 2021. Our more Corning strategy will continue to drive outperformance across the diverse industries that we serve. We're not just counting on consumers buying more cars, TVs or smartphones to grow. And I'm excited about how we're bringing our capabilities to bear in optical and life sciences as operators expand their networks and we continue to support vital drug and vaccine development. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so that he can provide additional insight on our results and expectations."

We feel good about our fourth quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, we grew sales and earnings. We expect to grow again in the first quarter, and we expect to grow for the full year driven by improving markets and our more Corning strategy. We are building a bigger, stronger company that delivers sustainable results while remaining agile in our ability to respond to changing market factors.  
Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter, we grew sales 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, exceeding expectations. Excluding the consolidation of Hemlock Semiconductor, sales grew 11% year-over-year, with every segment growing sales and net income. Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies delivered particularly strong year-over-year sales growth, up 20% and 19%, respectively, both outperforming their underlying markets. Optical Communications returned to year-over-year growth, and we expect that growth to continue. Our operating margin was 19.4%. That is an improvement of 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis.  
We grew operating income 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Cumulative free cash flow for the full year was $948 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. We entered 2021 in an excellent financial position.  
Now let's review the business segments. In Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $841 million, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. And net income was $217 million, up 11% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Retail demand for TV and IT products remained strong during the promotional season in Q4.  
Display's full year sales were $3.2 billion, and net income was $717 million. Our full year price declines in 2020 were mid-single digits. The glass market and our glass volume were up mid-single digits for the year. The retail market was more robust than the industry expected, resulting in panel supply being tight for the second half of 2020. Panel makers ran at high utilizations and the industry drew down inventory to satisfy demand. These dynamics also resulted in glass supply being tight, and more recently in shortage due to a power outage at a competitor's glass plant. 
Now let's look at 2021. We expect the TV and IT retail markets to remain strong. We remain confident that large size TVs will continue to grow, and we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5 and which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing.  
We expect the glass market to grow a mid- single-digit percentage in 2021. We expect glass supply to remain tight in the upcoming quarters. As a result of these supply-demand dynamics, we are experiencing a very favorable pricing environment. We expect Q1 2021 glass prices to be flat with Q4 2020. This is significantly better than the sequential declines we've seen in any other first quarter over the last decade.  
Glass prices for some customers in some gen sizes may actually see a sequential increase. We believe the following 3 factors will continue to drive the favorable pricing environment for the upcoming quarters: First, we expect glass supply to continue to be tight; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels; and third, Display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.  
Glass prices must support acceptable returns on these investments. In Optical Communications, fourth quarter sales were $976 million, up 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Our year-over-year growth can be attributed to broad improvements in demand for both carrier and enterprise customers.  
Fourth quarter core net income of $141 million was up 127% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. The improvement was driven by the incremental volume, and favorable cost performance. We have returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we expect that growth to continue. Bandwidth demand is increasing and users are demanding higher performance connections. We're seeing positive statements from customers on increasing investments in their optical networks. Our sales and order rates are picking up, and we're ready to capture demand as it materializes. We are confident we will grow sales in Optical Communications for the year. We continue to monitor and evaluate market demand signals to determine the magnitude of growth, and we'll keep -- we'll continue to keep you updated as we go through the year.  
In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $445 million, up 19% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, ahead of expectations as markets continue to improve and GPF adoptions continued in China. Net income was $93 million, up 45% year-over-year and 35% sequentially, driven by strong operational performance globally and successful ramping of additional GPF capacity in China.  
For the full year, sales were $1.4 billion, and our performance was better than the underlying market. Net income was $197 million. While our full year 2020 sales were certainly impacted by COVID-19, we are recovering faster than the market by increasing our content for both the automotive and diesel end markets. Despite severely challenged markets i.e. overgrowth in GPF sales. Strong GPF adoption continues in Europe and in China, where the China 6A regulation is being implemented nationwide this month. We are ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million GPF business.  
Specialty Materials had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year. Q4 sales of $545 million were up 20% year-over-year, full year sales were $1.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year despite a 7% decline in the smartphone market, driven by strong demand for our premium cover materials and our other innovations.  
Net income was $423 million, up 40% from 2019 on higher sales volume and strong cost performance. The importance of computing and connectivity were amplified during the pandemic. Our new product innovations, including Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, as well as our EUV products in the semiconductor market were important contributors to our strong performance.  
Now before I get to our Life Sciences results, I'd like to note something of great importance to us. Throughout the pandemic, our Life Sciences market access platform has applied its broad capabilities and full product portfolio to help the world combat the pandemic. From our traditionally research-focused consumables to our bioproduction products to our transport media and, of course, our Valor glass, we're playing a vital role in the development and supply of test kits and vaccines.  
Now let's look at our segment results. Life Sciences fourth quarter sales were $274 million, up 7% year-over-year and 23% sequentially, driven by strong demand for COVID related products, including bioproduction products used in clinical trials. Net income was $42 million, up 11% year-over-year and 50% sequentially.  
In summary, we successfully navigated a very challenging year. We strengthened our balance sheet, established growth in the second half and generated free cash flow of $948 million for the year. As we look ahead, we have strong momentum coming into 2021 and expect year-over-year growth to accelerate in the first quarter. Specifically, we expect core sales of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first quarter last year and EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, which is double last year's first quarter EPS at the low end of the range. For the full year, we expect growth in sales and earnings, and we anticipate generating more free cash flow in 2021 than in 2020. And we will share more with you as the year progresses. 
Let's turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and prudent capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward.  
We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.  
In 2021, we expect CapEx similar to 2020 as we have capacity in place to meet higher sales. Now we'll invest more if we require capacity to support additional growth, any additional capital investment would be supported by a customer commitment. We'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year. 
Given our expected strong free cash flow generation in 2021, we expect to increase our distributions to shareholders. That includes reinstating opportunistic share repurchases sometime this year. In closing, we're very pleased with our strong close to 2020, highlighted by growing sales and profitability. We continue to focus on a rich set of opportunities. Our businesses are fundamental to the long-term growth drivers in the industries they serve, and our more Corning strategy continues to deliver sales outperformance relative to our end markets. And I look forward to sharing our progress as the year goes on. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

Not only did those higher utilizations, but the industry also brought down inventory to meet that demand and that meant that glass was tight throughout the year. And as you -- we remain confident that things will remain tight on -- over the next several quarters because of where we think demand is and as that demand continues to be met, there's also a need to replenish what's happened from a supply chain standpoint and some of the tightness that's happened from a supply chain standpoint. 
So that's obviously led to very favorable pricing in the first quarter. And as we look out over the next several quarters, we think that, that environment continues, that tight environment continues."

Glass was tight, and glass is going to stay tight for as far as we can see right now. Then with a competitor having a power outage and the planned shutdown of the Korean operations, that took everything being delayed because the market was so strong, that tipped everything in the shortage. So we went from being very tight to go into shortage. And that's what led to the very, very strong quarter 1 pricing environment. But we're going to stay tight even as we address those. I think the Koreans will still, ultimately, continue their shift to those big Gen 10.5 plants just because it's more economical. But right now, they continue to press us to be able to help them supply their Korean operations, and they're not providing a firm end date for when they'll transfer those over, primarily because they continue to see this end market is being very strong. Does that make sense? Does that answer your question?"

I think the last several calls, we really have focused in on our fundamental belief that as bandwidth demand is increasing and users demand higher performance connections that this was going to be positive from a business standpoint. And we've even talked about, I think, in the last quarter about how our customers were beginning to talk more about that in their conference calls, and there are plenty of examples of that. 
I think what's really happened over the last 3 or 4 months is that our sales and order rates have started to pick up. And it's really that pickup in the sales and order rates, which is what drove our growth on a year-over-year basis and why we're confident that, that growth is going to happen. So I think the question before was that when was it going to happen? And I think the answer is that it's happening now. And so I think that's how we think about it there. And then I think from an overall economic standpoint, clearly, as we enter into the year, we had a very strong fourth quarter, and we expect to have a strong first quarter. 
But there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world and we're not in the greatest position to sort through how that uncertainty is actually going to play out.

Normally, you have a big step down in Q1 and then you have very moderate in through the rest of the year, this year, you're not really seeing a step down. In fact, with some customers, you're seeing a step up. So should we expect that pace of pricing to remain as it has in past years, just very, very moderate?

I think from an OpEx standpoint, Asiya, clearly, we got into the early parts of 2020 and things were changing, we did a number of things to adjust our operating cost. Some of them were set up so that we would be able to as the economy has recovered, be able to respond to that. Some of them were compensation related, for example, furloughs and things like that. And certainly, to the degree that business has returned, of course, those costs will also return. But from an overall standpoint, we've remained very focused from an OpEx standpoint to make sure that we're getting leverage as we grow and that we don't grow our OpEx over a longer period of time as fast as we grow our sales. And that's really our underlying philosophy from an OpEx standpoint. 
I think what structurally makes it possible for us to do is when you us lay out our 3, 4, 5 framework, what that allows us to do as we build on our market access platforms, is that ability to sort of reuse and share those platforms, both in our -- we've seen that both on our technology side as well now in our customer-facing organizations. And so that should allow us to more efficiently address the growth that we see. And over time, we do expect that at operating margin leverage to be sort of a more powerful generator for us than just at the manufacturing gross margin levels. So you're going to see us really addressing that more because that's where we're seeing the synergy really start to drive across our portfolio. 
Let's touch briefly on Specialty for you. We would expect that our outperformance versus the smartphone market to continue. And sort of the -- I'm not calling what happens with the smartphone market. So that kind of takes me to a sort of a broader point. And I'd be really interested in [indiscernible] from investors, both sell-side and buy, which is -- we saw the strong momentum. We knew it was coming, but we saw the strong momentum and really strong order book in Q4. And that continues into this quarter. So that increasing clarity enabled us to provide the sales in EPS guidance that we just did for quarter 1. 
Now we listened to our investors and made it simple and clear by providing sales and EPS for the entire company rather than the more complicated and detailed market-by-market guidance that we previously provided. Now as we turn to the total year, simply put, we expect our momentum and our outperformance versus our markets to continue. 
So then the question really becomes what happens in the macro environment. Now you all have your own experts and opinions on what's going to happen in the macro. At Corning, we approach our ability to predict macroeconomic and geopolitical events and tensions with great humility. Hence, we don't think it's helpful for us at this time to predict these forces, and therefore, what exactly our revenue for the year will be. What we are confident of is that we're going to outperform these markets. So as you pick your geopolitical or macroeconomic scenario, for our various markets, what you can count on is we're going to do better than that. So that may be more than you wanted to know, Asiya, but that's how we think about it."

Can we, with our capabilities, make it accelerate or vice versa? We really are interested in can we address some of the significant issues there are with lack of domestic production of solar here in the U.S. So there's a number of, I think -- there's a number of significant opportunities. It's too early to say, will they work out or not. And sometimes, and I'd love to have a conversation with you about any ideas that you have on it as well, given how long you've advocated for this."

And that gets a lot harder to predict because you not only have to call the total market, but then which OEMs sort of win in that market as well as which of our technologies play. But I think, overall, you could think about it as we will outperform, it's just a little too early in the year to give you some insight as to like how much to outperform, Steven. I'm sorry on that. And then on Opto, you're right to identify it, it is definitely a positive, but it is just one of the sort of number of positive impacts and announcements that you're seeing from our key customers. 
It's never been -- as Tony said, it's never been that we did it -- we believe strongly that our customers would have to build and invest to meet the very strong demand. What we wanted to do, though, is before we predicted when it would come. We wanted to see it in our sales. We wanted to see it in our order book. We wanted to see the projects actually start.

I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data.  
Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the fourth quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stem from restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash as well as noncash mark-to-market losses associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.  
For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q4 by $63 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.  
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center.

173840,699741068,2252548,"Corning Incorporated, 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3",1837,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. 
For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Our operating margin expanded 500 basis points year-over-year to 19.4%. Operating income grew 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, $948 million for the full year, and we finished the year with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet.  
It goes without saying, 2020 was an incredibly difficult year. We joined the rest of the world to confront the pandemic, economic uncertainty and social unrest. Throughout the year, we focused on our customers and executed on strategic priorities while protecting our people. For more perspective on our performance, I'll share 3 observations. First, we demonstrated our ability to adapt rapidly and remain resilient in the face of uncertainty. Second, our More Corning content strategy clearly contributed to our growth and outperformed against our end markets. And finally, throughout this difficult period, we're embracing the opportunity to make a difference, wherever we are, with what we have to contribute.  
Now I'll expand on my first observation. Our decisive actions and strong operational execution have resulted in continued leadership in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. Like many companies, we focused on bolstering our financial strength, reducing production levels and operating cost, carefully managing inventory, reducing capital expenditures and pausing share buybacks. However, it's not about what we cut, but what we kept. While we adjusted production, we didn't reduce capacity, keeping us positioned to meet increasing demand when the economy improved. We continue to make strategic investments and advance major innovations with our customers to capture the growth playing out across our market access platforms. And we developed multifaceted programs to protect our talent and preserve our capabilities. 
Our first half actions generated significant cost savings in second half of the year. And as the economy started showing signs of green shoots, we effectively adjusted our operations keeping pace as demand started to recover in many of the markets we serve. Our results tell the story. Our sales were down 12% in the first half as most economies were impacted by pandemic related lockdowns. But in the second half, we improved sales 24% over the first, while growing operating income 122%, returning the year-over-year growth and generating very strong free cash flow. For the year, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow, and our balance sheet remains very strong. We expect this strong momentum to continue heading into 2021. We will continue to adapt and focus on execution as we have proven that our approach is working. 
Turning to my second observation. In all the industries we serve, important market trends continue to offer new challenges that Corning is just uniquely qualified to address, and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into our customers' products. In this difficult year, we have proven that this is an especially powerful value creation ladder. We aren't relying exclusively on people buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. In the fourth quarter, this strategy paid off as we grew sales year-over-year in every one of our businesses.  
At the top were Specialty Materials, with sales up 20% year-over-year, and Environmental Technologies up 19% year-over-year, both significantly outperforming their end markets. Last quarter, I described our innovations in Mobile Consumer Electronics, looking at how we're investing to create additional revenue streams and capture content opportunities.  
Today, I'll focus on our Automotive Market-Access platform. The auto industry is undergoing major disruptions. Automakers are designing cleaner and safer vehicles while featuring technology that provides immersive experiences. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. And for us, the opportunity is large in the range of $100 per car in Corning content. We're collaborating with more OEMS, and we're offering more solutions to help move the industry forward. Let's look at 2 of our biggest successes right now. Starting with our Automotive Glass Solutions business. We're building strong momentum. Our advantaged solutions are enabling the very rapid shift towards in-vehicle displays that are interactive, that are integrated and shaped.  
We're collaborating with industry leaders across the auto ecosystem, including Visteon, LGE, BOE, and VIA Optronics to accelerate the adoption of our patented 3D ColdForm technology, which enables lower cost, shaped auto interiors. Our large-scale facility in Hefei, China, is now fully operational and servicing our growing demand. And we continue to see strong adoption of our technology by auto OEMs. Our recent proof point is the new Mercedes-Benz Hyperscreen dashboard display, which features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. 
Similarly, in Environmental Technologies, in a year when a global pandemic temporarily shut down OEM production, our proprietary gasoline particulate filter business still grew sales year-over-year. When we introduced EPS, we said our technology increased our content opportunity per car by 3 to 4x. Like most of our innovations, it started with the customer challenge. Europe and China are addressing fine particular pollution with new emissions regulations. We applied our expertise in ceramic science with our advanced manufacturing capabilities in extrusion to rapidly develop filters that efficiently trap ion particulates. And today, we're effectively helping automakers reduce these harmful emissions, meet new regulations and produce some of the cleanest gasoline vehicles you can buy. 
Demand for our GPF has grown quickly. And with our market-leading product, we continue to win the majority of platforms awarded to date. We're well on our way to building a $500 million business. We're actually ahead of schedule, and the content opportunity continues to grow. We expect our GPF technology to migrate beyond Europe and China as other regions focus on improving air quality. And many new car models will soon be required to get even closer to near 0 particulate emissions.  
In response, we recently introduced our next-generation GPF featuring enhanced filtration capabilities. They're launching in upcoming models as automakers prepare for the next wave of regulations. Across our markets, we see a similar content story playing out as we respond to key industry challenges with more Corning solutions.  
Let me share some other accomplishments across our market access platforms. In Life Sciences, pandemic related demand has highlighted our strength in the industry. And we achieved major milestones towards building a significant Valor Glass franchise in 2020. At the start of the year, we entered a long-term supply agreement to provide Valor Glass vials for a portion of the currently marketed Pfizer drug products. Soon after, we were awarded $204 million in funding from the U.S. government to substantially expand domestic manufacturing capacity for Valor vials. Today, we're supplying Valor Glass to several leading COVID vaccine manufacturers. We produce millions of Valor vials and shipped enough for more than 100 million doses, supporting multiple vaccine developers.  
In our Life Sciences segment, the global health fight is driving strong demand for our consumable products. We're supporting the development of treatments in vaccines as well as mass testing efforts. We received $15 million from the U.S. government to expand domestic capacity for robotic pipette tips, which are used for COVID diagnostic testing. BioNTech recently recognized our contribution to their successful COVID vaccine development.  
Turning to Mobile Consumer Electronics. We launched the toughest Gorilla Glass yet, Victus. And it's already featured on 6 Samsung devices. Corning also invented the world's first transparent color-free glass ceramic, which is featured on the front cover of the latest iPhone. Apple and Corning partnered to develop and scale manufacturing of Ceramic Shield. It offers unparallel durability and toughness.  
I noted that Specialty Materials sales were up 20% year-over-year in quarter 4. They were up 18% for the full year in a smartphone market, that declined 7%. In Optical Communications, we returned to growth and we expect this growth to continue as customers increase spending to support growing bandwidth requirements. In 2020, we introduced new and innovative solutions that help speed the deployment of 5G. We launched our outdoor 5G-ready connectivity solutions, featuring compact easy-to-install terminals that can be deployed in any conceivable architecture. Operators can actually save up to $500 per terminal location, dramatically lowering installation cost and speeding up deployment. We're also collaborating with Verizon to enable 5G millimeter wave indoor deployments for their enterprise customers.  
We're also working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G ready, easy to install and affordable. And we're collaborating with EnerSys to simplify the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small cell wireless sites.  
Turning to Display. Retail demand for TV and IT products remain strong. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% for the full year. Large TVs are most efficiently made on Gen 10.5 plants. Corning is well positioned to capture that growth with its Gen 10.5 plants in China, including the 2 newest Gen 10.5 facilities in Wuhan and Guangzhou, which are now expanding production to meet customer demand. Ramping these sites has been no small feat in the midst of a pandemic. We are very proud of our innovative and dedicated expert engineering teams that rose to a host of unprecedented challenges to start-up tanks in both facilities. 
Looking ahead, Corning's long-term growth drivers and content opportunities are strong in each of our markets. And we believe some secular trends could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to change in the aftermath of the health crisis. And that leads to my third observation. We're living through the kind of moment that tends to bring true character to light. At Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We've unleashed our capabilities to help combat the virus. And we're proud to be creating life-changing technologies that contribute to keeping people safe and help society address the challenges of the pandemic.  
We also recognize in these unprecedented times that we have the opportunity to share resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We've launched racial and social quality programs, and our unity campaign support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. 
In conclusion, on all fronts, Corning is executing well. We're delivering outstanding results and making important progress across our strategic priorities. I am confident that we are entering the year with solid momentum and we expect to grow in 2021. Our more Corning strategy will continue to drive outperformance across the diverse industries that we serve. We're not just counting on consumers buying more cars, TVs or smartphones to grow. And I'm excited about how we're bringing our capabilities to bear in optical and life sciences as operators expand their networks and we continue to support vital drug and vaccine development. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so that he can provide additional insight on our results and expectations."
173840,699741068,2252548,"Corning Incorporated, 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. We feel good about our fourth quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, we grew sales and earnings. We expect to grow again in the first quarter, and we expect to grow for the full year driven by improving",1506,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. We feel good about our fourth quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, we grew sales and earnings. We expect to grow again in the first quarter, and we expect to grow for the full year driven by improving markets and our more Corning strategy. We are building a bigger, stronger company that delivers sustainable results while remaining agile in our ability to respond to changing market factors.  
Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter, we grew sales 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, exceeding expectations. Excluding the consolidation of Hemlock Semiconductor, sales grew 11% year-over-year, with every segment growing sales and net income. Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies delivered particularly strong year-over-year sales growth, up 20% and 19%, respectively, both outperforming their underlying markets. Optical Communications returned to year-over-year growth, and we expect that growth to continue. Our operating margin was 19.4%. That is an improvement of 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis.  
We grew operating income 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Cumulative free cash flow for the full year was $948 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. We entered 2021 in an excellent financial position.  
Now let's review the business segments. In Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $841 million, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. And net income was $217 million, up 11% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Retail demand for TV and IT products remained strong during the promotional season in Q4.  
Display's full year sales were $3.2 billion, and net income was $717 million. Our full year price declines in 2020 were mid-single digits. The glass market and our glass volume were up mid-single digits for the year. The retail market was more robust than the industry expected, resulting in panel supply being tight for the second half of 2020. Panel makers ran at high utilizations and the industry drew down inventory to satisfy demand. These dynamics also resulted in glass supply being tight, and more recently in shortage due to a power outage at a competitor's glass plant. 
Now let's look at 2021. We expect the TV and IT retail markets to remain strong. We remain confident that large size TVs will continue to grow, and we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5 and which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing.  
We expect the glass market to grow a mid- single-digit percentage in 2021. We expect glass supply to remain tight in the upcoming quarters. As a result of these supply-demand dynamics, we are experiencing a very favorable pricing environment. We expect Q1 2021 glass prices to be flat with Q4 2020. This is significantly better than the sequential declines we've seen in any other first quarter over the last decade.  
Glass prices for some customers in some gen sizes may actually see a sequential increase. We believe the following 3 factors will continue to drive the favorable pricing environment for the upcoming quarters: First, we expect glass supply to continue to be tight; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels; and third, Display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.  
Glass prices must support acceptable returns on these investments. In Optical Communications, fourth quarter sales were $976 million, up 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Our year-over-year growth can be attributed to broad improvements in demand for both carrier and enterprise customers.  
Fourth quarter core net income of $141 million was up 127% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. The improvement was driven by the incremental volume, and favorable cost performance. We have returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we expect that growth to continue. Bandwidth demand is increasing and users are demanding higher performance connections. We're seeing positive statements from customers on increasing investments in their optical networks. Our sales and order rates are picking up, and we're ready to capture demand as it materializes. We are confident we will grow sales in Optical Communications for the year. We continue to monitor and evaluate market demand signals to determine the magnitude of growth, and we'll keep -- we'll continue to keep you updated as we go through the year.  
In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $445 million, up 19% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, ahead of expectations as markets continue to improve and GPF adoptions continued in China. Net income was $93 million, up 45% year-over-year and 35% sequentially, driven by strong operational performance globally and successful ramping of additional GPF capacity in China.  
For the full year, sales were $1.4 billion, and our performance was better than the underlying market. Net income was $197 million. While our full year 2020 sales were certainly impacted by COVID-19, we are recovering faster than the market by increasing our content for both the automotive and diesel end markets. Despite severely challenged markets i.e. overgrowth in GPF sales. Strong GPF adoption continues in Europe and in China, where the China 6A regulation is being implemented nationwide this month. We are ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million GPF business.  
Specialty Materials had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year. Q4 sales of $545 million were up 20% year-over-year, full year sales were $1.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year despite a 7% decline in the smartphone market, driven by strong demand for our premium cover materials and our other innovations.  
Net income was $423 million, up 40% from 2019 on higher sales volume and strong cost performance. The importance of computing and connectivity were amplified during the pandemic. Our new product innovations, including Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, as well as our EUV products in the semiconductor market were important contributors to our strong performance.  
Now before I get to our Life Sciences results, I'd like to note something of great importance to us. Throughout the pandemic, our Life Sciences market access platform has applied its broad capabilities and full product portfolio to help the world combat the pandemic. From our traditionally research-focused consumables to our bioproduction products to our transport media and, of course, our Valor glass, we're playing a vital role in the development and supply of test kits and vaccines.  
Now let's look at our segment results. Life Sciences fourth quarter sales were $274 million, up 7% year-over-year and 23% sequentially, driven by strong demand for COVID related products, including bioproduction products used in clinical trials. Net income was $42 million, up 11% year-over-year and 50% sequentially.  
In summary, we successfully navigated a very challenging year. We strengthened our balance sheet, established growth in the second half and generated free cash flow of $948 million for the year. As we look ahead, we have strong momentum coming into 2021 and expect year-over-year growth to accelerate in the first quarter. Specifically, we expect core sales of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first quarter last year and EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, which is double last year's first quarter EPS at the low end of the range. For the full year, we expect growth in sales and earnings, and we anticipate generating more free cash flow in 2021 than in 2020. And we will share more with you as the year progresses. 
Let's turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and prudent capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward.  
We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.  
In 2021, we expect CapEx similar to 2020 as we have capacity in place to meet higher sales. Now we'll invest more if we require capacity to support additional growth, any additional capital investment would be supported by a customer commitment. We'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year. 
Given our expected strong free cash flow generation in 2021, we expect to increase our distributions to shareholders. That includes reinstating opportunistic share repurchases sometime this year. In closing, we're very pleased with our strong close to 2020, highlighted by growing sales and profitability. We continue to focus on a rich set of opportunities. Our businesses are fundamental to the long-term growth drivers in the industries they serve, and our more Corning strategy continues to deliver sales outperformance relative to our end markets. And I look forward to sharing our progress as the year goes on. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

The market overall was more robust than what we had expected. And what the industry expected, which meant that panel makers ran tight in the second half of 2020. Not only did those higher utilizations, but the industry also brought down inventory to meet that demand and that meant that glass was tight throughout the year. And as you -- we remain confident that things will remain tight on -- over the next several quarters because of where we think demand is and as that demand continues to be met, there's also a need to replenish what's happened from a supply chain standpoint and some of the tightness that's happened from a supply chain standpoint. 
So that's obviously led to very favorable pricing in the first quarter. And as we look out over the next several quarters, we think that, that environment continues, that tight environment continues."

Then with a competitor having a power outage and the planned shutdown of the Korean operations, that took everything being delayed because the market was so strong, that tipped everything in the shortage. So we went from being very tight to go into shortage. And that's what led to the very, very strong quarter 1 pricing environment. But we're going to stay tight even as we address those. I think the Koreans will still, ultimately, continue their shift to those big Gen 10.5 plants just because it's more economical. But right now, they continue to press us to be able to help them supply their Korean operations, and they're not providing a firm end date for when they'll transfer those over, primarily because they continue to see this end market is being very strong.

I think the last several calls, we really have focused in on our fundamental belief that as bandwidth demand is increasing and users demand higher performance connections that this was going to be positive from a business standpoint. And we've even talked about, I think, in the last quarter about how our customers were beginning to talk more about that in their conference calls, and there are plenty of examples of that. 
I think what's really happened over the last 3 or 4 months is that our sales and order rates have started to pick up. And it's really that pickup in the sales and order rates, which is what drove our growth on a year-over-year basis and why we're confident that, that growth is going to happen. So I think the question before was that when was it going to happen? And I think the answer is that it's happening now. And so I think that's how we think about it there. And then I think from an overall economic standpoint, clearly, as we enter into the year, we had a very strong fourth quarter, and we expect to have a strong first quarter. 
But there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world and we're not in the greatest position to sort through how that uncertainty is actually going to play out. We think there's 2 places where we can provide unique insights. One was Optical that we just talked about.

Normally, you have a big step down in Q1 and then you have very moderate in through the rest of the year, this year, you're not really seeing a step down. In fact, with some customers, you're seeing a step up. So should we expect that pace of pricing to remain as it has in past years, just very, very moderate?

I think from an OpEx standpoint, Asiya, clearly, we got into the early parts of 2020 and things were changing, we did a number of things to adjust our operating cost. Some of them were set up so that we would be able to as the economy has recovered, be able to respond to that. Some of them were compensation related, for example, furloughs and things like that. And certainly, to the degree that business has returned, of course, those costs will also return. But from an overall standpoint, we've remained very focused from an OpEx standpoint to make sure that we're getting leverage as we grow and that we don't grow our OpEx over a longer period of time as fast as we grow our sales. And that's really our underlying philosophy from an OpEx standpoint. 
I think what structurally makes it possible for us to do is when you us lay out our 3, 4, 5 framework, what that allows us to do as we build on our market access platforms, is that ability to sort of reuse and share those platforms, both in our -- we've seen that both on our technology side as well now in our customer-facing organizations. And so that should allow us to more efficiently address the growth that we see. And over time, we do expect that at operating margin leverage to be sort of a more powerful generator for us than just at the manufacturing gross margin levels. So you're going to see us really addressing that more because that's where we're seeing the synergy really start to drive across our portfolio. 
Let's touch briefly on Specialty for you. We would expect that our outperformance versus the smartphone market to continue. And sort of the -- I'm not calling what happens with the smartphone market. So that kind of takes me to a sort of a broader point. And I'd be really interested in [indiscernible] from investors, both sell-side and buy, which is -- we saw the strong momentum. We knew it was coming, but we saw the strong momentum and really strong order book in Q4. And that continues into this quarter. So that increasing clarity enabled us to provide the sales in EPS guidance that we just did for quarter 1. 
Now we listened to our investors and made it simple and clear by providing sales and EPS for the entire company rather than the more complicated and detailed market-by-market guidance that we previously provided. Now as we turn to the total year, simply put, we expect our momentum and our outperformance versus our markets to continue. 
So then the question really becomes what happens in the macro environment. Now you all have your own experts and opinions on what's going to happen in the macro. At Corning, we approach our ability to predict macroeconomic and geopolitical events and tensions with great humility. Hence, we don't think it's helpful for us at this time to predict these forces, and therefore, what exactly our revenue for the year will be. What we are confident of is that we're going to outperform these markets. So as you pick your geopolitical or macroeconomic scenario, for our various markets, what you can count on is we're going to do better than that. So that may be more than you wanted to know, Asiya, but that's how we think about it."

Can you walk us through what you've been doing on the optical side, particularly as it relates to temporary versus permanent measures as well as if there's any weighting towards carrier versus the enterprise portions of those businesses?

You're not seeing that as much. But we're really seeing growth in both parts of those businesses. And from an operational standpoint, I mean, I think what's important to note is, is that even though our revenues were down. We didn't change our ability to supply that because we always knew it was going to come back. And there's costs that you carry during those kind of periods. And how do you fill those factories back up, you see expansions from a margin standpoint. And we saw that in the third and fourth quarter of this year, and we'd expect to see that going forward."

Can we, with our capabilities, make it accelerate or vice versa?

I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data.  
Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the fourth quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stem from restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash as well as noncash mark-to-market losses associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.  
For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q4 by $63 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.  
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center.

173840,699741068,2252550,"Corning Incorporated, 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3",1837,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported an outstanding finish to the year. Each of our segments grew sales and profits year-over-year, and we continue to progress our strategic initiatives. 
For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.3 billion, up 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Our operating margin expanded 500 basis points year-over-year to 19.4%. Operating income grew 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, $948 million for the full year, and we finished the year with $2.7 billion in cash on our balance sheet.  
It goes without saying, 2020 was an incredibly difficult year. We joined the rest of the world to confront the pandemic, economic uncertainty and social unrest. Throughout the year, we focused on our customers and executed on strategic priorities while protecting our people. For more perspective on our performance, I'll share 3 observations. First, we demonstrated our ability to adapt rapidly and remain resilient in the face of uncertainty. Second, our More Corning content strategy clearly contributed to our growth and outperformed against our end markets. And finally, throughout this difficult period, we're embracing the opportunity to make a difference, wherever we are, with what we have to contribute.  
Now I'll expand on my first observation. Our decisive actions and strong operational execution have resulted in continued leadership in the capabilities that make Corning distinctive. Like many companies, we focused on bolstering our financial strength, reducing production levels and operating cost, carefully managing inventory, reducing capital expenditures and pausing share buybacks. However, it's not about what we cut, but what we kept. While we adjusted production, we didn't reduce capacity, keeping us positioned to meet increasing demand when the economy improved. We continue to make strategic investments and advance major innovations with our customers to capture the growth playing out across our market access platforms. And we developed multifaceted programs to protect our talent and preserve our capabilities. 
Our first half actions generated significant cost savings in second half of the year. And as the economy started showing signs of green shoots, we effectively adjusted our operations keeping pace as demand started to recover in many of the markets we serve. Our results tell the story. Our sales were down 12% in the first half as most economies were impacted by pandemic related lockdowns. But in the second half, we improved sales 24% over the first, while growing operating income 122%, returning the year-over-year growth and generating very strong free cash flow. For the year, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow, and our balance sheet remains very strong. We expect this strong momentum to continue heading into 2021. We will continue to adapt and focus on execution as we have proven that our approach is working. 
Turning to my second observation. In all the industries we serve, important market trends continue to offer new challenges that Corning is just uniquely qualified to address, and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into our customers' products. In this difficult year, we have proven that this is an especially powerful value creation ladder. We aren't relying exclusively on people buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. In the fourth quarter, this strategy paid off as we grew sales year-over-year in every one of our businesses.  
At the top were Specialty Materials, with sales up 20% year-over-year, and Environmental Technologies up 19% year-over-year, both significantly outperforming their end markets. Last quarter, I described our innovations in Mobile Consumer Electronics, looking at how we're investing to create additional revenue streams and capture content opportunities.  
Today, I'll focus on our Automotive Market-Access platform. The auto industry is undergoing major disruptions. Automakers are designing cleaner and safer vehicles while featuring technology that provides immersive experiences. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. And for us, the opportunity is large in the range of $100 per car in Corning content. We're collaborating with more OEMS, and we're offering more solutions to help move the industry forward. Let's look at 2 of our biggest successes right now. Starting with our Automotive Glass Solutions business. We're building strong momentum. Our advantaged solutions are enabling the very rapid shift towards in-vehicle displays that are interactive, that are integrated and shaped.  
We're collaborating with industry leaders across the auto ecosystem, including Visteon, LGE, BOE, and VIA Optronics to accelerate the adoption of our patented 3D ColdForm technology, which enables lower cost, shaped auto interiors. Our large-scale facility in Hefei, China, is now fully operational and servicing our growing demand. And we continue to see strong adoption of our technology by auto OEMs. Our recent proof point is the new Mercedes-Benz Hyperscreen dashboard display, which features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. 
Similarly, in Environmental Technologies, in a year when a global pandemic temporarily shut down OEM production, our proprietary gasoline particulate filter business still grew sales year-over-year. When we introduced EPS, we said our technology increased our content opportunity per car by 3 to 4x. Like most of our innovations, it started with the customer challenge. Europe and China are addressing fine particular pollution with new emissions regulations. We applied our expertise in ceramic science with our advanced manufacturing capabilities in extrusion to rapidly develop filters that efficiently trap ion particulates. And today, we're effectively helping automakers reduce these harmful emissions, meet new regulations and produce some of the cleanest gasoline vehicles you can buy. 
Demand for our GPF has grown quickly. And with our market-leading product, we continue to win the majority of platforms awarded to date. We're well on our way to building a $500 million business. We're actually ahead of schedule, and the content opportunity continues to grow. We expect our GPF technology to migrate beyond Europe and China as other regions focus on improving air quality. And many new car models will soon be required to get even closer to near 0 particulate emissions.  
In response, we recently introduced our next-generation GPF featuring enhanced filtration capabilities. They're launching in upcoming models as automakers prepare for the next wave of regulations. Across our markets, we see a similar content story playing out as we respond to key industry challenges with more Corning solutions.  
Let me share some other accomplishments across our market access platforms. In Life Sciences, pandemic related demand has highlighted our strength in the industry. And we achieved major milestones towards building a significant Valor Glass franchise in 2020. At the start of the year, we entered a long-term supply agreement to provide Valor Glass vials for a portion of the currently marketed Pfizer drug products. Soon after, we were awarded $204 million in funding from the U.S. government to substantially expand domestic manufacturing capacity for Valor vials. Today, we're supplying Valor Glass to several leading COVID vaccine manufacturers. We produce millions of Valor vials and shipped enough for more than 100 million doses, supporting multiple vaccine developers.  
In our Life Sciences segment, the global health fight is driving strong demand for our consumable products. We're supporting the development of treatments in vaccines as well as mass testing efforts. We received $15 million from the U.S. government to expand domestic capacity for robotic pipette tips, which are used for COVID diagnostic testing. BioNTech recently recognized our contribution to their successful COVID vaccine development.  
Turning to Mobile Consumer Electronics. We launched the toughest Gorilla Glass yet, Victus. And it's already featured on 6 Samsung devices. Corning also invented the world's first transparent color-free glass ceramic, which is featured on the front cover of the latest iPhone. Apple and Corning partnered to develop and scale manufacturing of Ceramic Shield. It offers unparallel durability and toughness.  
I noted that Specialty Materials sales were up 20% year-over-year in quarter 4. They were up 18% for the full year in a smartphone market, that declined 7%. In Optical Communications, we returned to growth and we expect this growth to continue as customers increase spending to support growing bandwidth requirements. In 2020, we introduced new and innovative solutions that help speed the deployment of 5G. We launched our outdoor 5G-ready connectivity solutions, featuring compact easy-to-install terminals that can be deployed in any conceivable architecture. Operators can actually save up to $500 per terminal location, dramatically lowering installation cost and speeding up deployment. We're also collaborating with Verizon to enable 5G millimeter wave indoor deployments for their enterprise customers.  
We're also working with Qualcomm Technologies to deliver indoor networks that are 5G ready, easy to install and affordable. And we're collaborating with EnerSys to simplify the delivery of fiber and electrical power to small cell wireless sites.  
Turning to Display. Retail demand for TV and IT products remain strong. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% for the full year. Large TVs are most efficiently made on Gen 10.5 plants. Corning is well positioned to capture that growth with its Gen 10.5 plants in China, including the 2 newest Gen 10.5 facilities in Wuhan and Guangzhou, which are now expanding production to meet customer demand. Ramping these sites has been no small feat in the midst of a pandemic. We are very proud of our innovative and dedicated expert engineering teams that rose to a host of unprecedented challenges to start-up tanks in both facilities. 
Looking ahead, Corning's long-term growth drivers and content opportunities are strong in each of our markets. And we believe some secular trends could accelerate as consumer lifestyles continue to change in the aftermath of the health crisis. And that leads to my third observation. We're living through the kind of moment that tends to bring true character to light. At Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We've unleashed our capabilities to help combat the virus. And we're proud to be creating life-changing technologies that contribute to keeping people safe and help society address the challenges of the pandemic.  
We also recognize in these unprecedented times that we have the opportunity to share resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We've launched racial and social quality programs, and our unity campaign support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. 
In conclusion, on all fronts, Corning is executing well. We're delivering outstanding results and making important progress across our strategic priorities. I am confident that we are entering the year with solid momentum and we expect to grow in 2021. Our more Corning strategy will continue to drive outperformance across the diverse industries that we serve. We're not just counting on consumers buying more cars, TVs or smartphones to grow. And I'm excited about how we're bringing our capabilities to bear in optical and life sciences as operators expand their networks and we continue to support vital drug and vaccine development. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so that he can provide additional insight on our results and expectations."

We feel good about our fourth quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, we grew sales and earnings. We expect to grow again in the first quarter, and we expect to grow for the full year driven by improving markets and our more Corning strategy. We are building a bigger, stronger company that delivers sustainable results while remaining agile in our ability to respond to changing market factors.  
Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter performance. In the fourth quarter, we grew sales 11% sequentially and 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, exceeding expectations. Excluding the consolidation of Hemlock Semiconductor, sales grew 11% year-over-year, with every segment growing sales and net income. Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies delivered particularly strong year-over-year sales growth, up 20% and 19%, respectively, both outperforming their underlying markets. Optical Communications returned to year-over-year growth, and we expect that growth to continue. Our operating margin was 19.4%. That is an improvement of 500 basis points on a year-over-year basis.  
We grew operating income 18% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. EPS of $0.52 was up 21% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. We generated $464 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Cumulative free cash flow for the full year was $948 million. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.7 billion. We entered 2021 in an excellent financial position.  
Now let's review the business segments. In Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $841 million, up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. And net income was $217 million, up 11% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Retail demand for TV and IT products remained strong during the promotional season in Q4.  
Display's full year sales were $3.2 billion, and net income was $717 million. Our full year price declines in 2020 were mid-single digits. The glass market and our glass volume were up mid-single digits for the year. The retail market was more robust than the industry expected, resulting in panel supply being tight for the second half of 2020. Panel makers ran at high utilizations and the industry drew down inventory to satisfy demand. These dynamics also resulted in glass supply being tight, and more recently in shortage due to a power outage at a competitor's glass plant. 
Now let's look at 2021. We expect the TV and IT retail markets to remain strong. We remain confident that large size TVs will continue to grow, and we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5 and which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing.  
We expect the glass market to grow a mid- single-digit percentage in 2021. We expect glass supply to remain tight in the upcoming quarters. As a result of these supply-demand dynamics, we are experiencing a very favorable pricing environment. We expect Q1 2021 glass prices to be flat with Q4 2020. This is significantly better than the sequential declines we've seen in any other first quarter over the last decade.  
Glass prices for some customers in some gen sizes may actually see a sequential increase. We believe the following 3 factors will continue to drive the favorable pricing environment for the upcoming quarters: First, we expect glass supply to continue to be tight; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels; and third, Display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.  
Glass prices must support acceptable returns on these investments. In Optical Communications, fourth quarter sales were $976 million, up 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Our year-over-year growth can be attributed to broad improvements in demand for both carrier and enterprise customers.  
Fourth quarter core net income of $141 million was up 127% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. The improvement was driven by the incremental volume, and favorable cost performance. We have returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we expect that growth to continue. Bandwidth demand is increasing and users are demanding higher performance connections. We're seeing positive statements from customers on increasing investments in their optical networks. Our sales and order rates are picking up, and we're ready to capture demand as it materializes. We are confident we will grow sales in Optical Communications for the year. We continue to monitor and evaluate market demand signals to determine the magnitude of growth, and we'll keep -- we'll continue to keep you updated as we go through the year.  
In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $445 million, up 19% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, ahead of expectations as markets continue to improve and GPF adoptions continued in China. Net income was $93 million, up 45% year-over-year and 35% sequentially, driven by strong operational performance globally and successful ramping of additional GPF capacity in China.  
For the full year, sales were $1.4 billion, and our performance was better than the underlying market. Net income was $197 million. While our full year 2020 sales were certainly impacted by COVID-19, we are recovering faster than the market by increasing our content for both the automotive and diesel end markets. Despite severely challenged markets i.e. overgrowth in GPF sales. Strong GPF adoption continues in Europe and in China, where the China 6A regulation is being implemented nationwide this month. We are ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million GPF business.  
Specialty Materials had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year. Q4 sales of $545 million were up 20% year-over-year, full year sales were $1.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year despite a 7% decline in the smartphone market, driven by strong demand for our premium cover materials and our other innovations.  
Net income was $423 million, up 40% from 2019 on higher sales volume and strong cost performance. The importance of computing and connectivity were amplified during the pandemic. Our new product innovations, including Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, as well as our EUV products in the semiconductor market were important contributors to our strong performance.  
Now before I get to our Life Sciences results, I'd like to note something of great importance to us. Throughout the pandemic, our Life Sciences market access platform has applied its broad capabilities and full product portfolio to help the world combat the pandemic. From our traditionally research-focused consumables to our bioproduction products to our transport media and, of course, our Valor glass, we're playing a vital role in the development and supply of test kits and vaccines.  
Now let's look at our segment results. Life Sciences fourth quarter sales were $274 million, up 7% year-over-year and 23% sequentially, driven by strong demand for COVID related products, including bioproduction products used in clinical trials. Net income was $42 million, up 11% year-over-year and 50% sequentially.  
In summary, we successfully navigated a very challenging year. We strengthened our balance sheet, established growth in the second half and generated free cash flow of $948 million for the year. As we look ahead, we have strong momentum coming into 2021 and expect year-over-year growth to accelerate in the first quarter. Specifically, we expect core sales of $3.0 billion to $3.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first quarter last year and EPS of $0.40 to $0.44, which is double last year's first quarter EPS at the low end of the range. For the full year, we expect growth in sales and earnings, and we anticipate generating more free cash flow in 2021 than in 2020. And we will share more with you as the year progresses. 
Let's turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and prudent capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward.  
We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.  
In 2021, we expect CapEx similar to 2020 as we have capacity in place to meet higher sales. Now we'll invest more if we require capacity to support additional growth, any additional capital investment would be supported by a customer commitment. We'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year. 
Given our expected strong free cash flow generation in 2021, we expect to increase our distributions to shareholders. That includes reinstating opportunistic share repurchases sometime this year. In closing, we're very pleased with our strong close to 2020, highlighted by growing sales and profitability. We continue to focus on a rich set of opportunities. Our businesses are fundamental to the long-term growth drivers in the industries they serve, and our more Corning strategy continues to deliver sales outperformance relative to our end markets. And I look forward to sharing our progress as the year goes on. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

The market overall was more robust than what we had expected. And what the industry expected, which meant that panel makers ran tight in the second half of 2020. Not only did those higher utilizations, but the industry also brought down inventory to meet that demand and that meant that glass was tight throughout the year. And as you -- we remain confident that things will remain tight on -- over the next several quarters because of where we think demand is and as that demand continues to be met, there's also a need to replenish what's happened from a supply chain standpoint and some of the tightness that's happened from a supply chain standpoint. 
So that's obviously led to very favorable pricing in the first quarter. And as we look out over the next several quarters, we think that, that environment continues, that tight environment continues."

Glass was tight, and glass is going to stay tight for as far as we can see right now. Then with a competitor having a power outage and the planned shutdown of the Korean operations, that took everything being delayed because the market was so strong, that tipped everything in the shortage. So we went from being very tight to go into shortage. And that's what led to the very, very strong quarter 1 pricing environment. But we're going to stay tight even as we address those. I think the Koreans will still, ultimately, continue their shift to those big Gen 10.5 plants just because it's more economical. But right now, they continue to press us to be able to help them supply their Korean operations, and they're not providing a firm end date for when they'll transfer those over, primarily because they continue to see this end market is being very strong.

And we've even talked about, I think, in the last quarter about how our customers were beginning to talk more about that in their conference calls, and there are plenty of examples of that. 
I think what's really happened over the last 3 or 4 months is that our sales and order rates have started to pick up. And it's really that pickup in the sales and order rates, which is what drove our growth on a year-over-year basis and why we're confident that, that growth is going to happen. So I think the question before was that when was it going to happen? And I think the answer is that it's happening now. And so I think that's how we think about it there. And then I think from an overall economic standpoint, clearly, as we enter into the year, we had a very strong fourth quarter, and we expect to have a strong first quarter.

I think from an OpEx standpoint, Asiya, clearly, we got into the early parts of 2020 and things were changing, we did a number of things to adjust our operating cost. Some of them were set up so that we would be able to as the economy has recovered, be able to respond to that. Some of them were compensation related, for example, furloughs and things like that. And certainly, to the degree that business has returned, of course, those costs will also return. But from an overall standpoint, we've remained very focused from an OpEx standpoint to make sure that we're getting leverage as we grow and that we don't grow our OpEx over a longer period of time as fast as we grow our sales. And that's really our underlying philosophy from an OpEx standpoint. 
I think what structurally makes it possible for us to do is when you us lay out our 3, 4, 5 framework, what that allows us to do as we build on our market access platforms, is that ability to sort of reuse and share those platforms, both in our -- we've seen that both on our technology side as well now in our customer-facing organizations. And so that should allow us to more efficiently address the growth that we see. And over time, we do expect that at operating margin leverage to be sort of a more powerful generator for us than just at the manufacturing gross margin levels. So you're going to see us really addressing that more because that's where we're seeing the synergy really start to drive across our portfolio. 
Let's touch briefly on Specialty for you. We would expect that our outperformance versus the smartphone market to continue. And sort of the -- I'm not calling what happens with the smartphone market. So that kind of takes me to a sort of a broader point. And I'd be really interested in [indiscernible] from investors, both sell-side and buy, which is -- we saw the strong momentum. We knew it was coming, but we saw the strong momentum and really strong order book in Q4. And that continues into this quarter. So that increasing clarity enabled us to provide the sales in EPS guidance that we just did for quarter 1. 
Now we listened to our investors and made it simple and clear by providing sales and EPS for the entire company rather than the more complicated and detailed market-by-market guidance that we previously provided. Now as we turn to the total year, simply put, we expect our momentum and our outperformance versus our markets to continue. 
So then the question really becomes what happens in the macro environment. Now you all have your own experts and opinions on what's going to happen in the macro. At Corning, we approach our ability to predict macroeconomic and geopolitical events and tensions with great humility. Hence, we don't think it's helpful for us at this time to predict these forces, and therefore, what exactly our revenue for the year will be. What we are confident of is that we're going to outperform these markets. So as you pick your geopolitical or macroeconomic scenario, for our various markets, what you can count on is we're going to do better than that. So that may be more than you wanted to know, Asiya, but that's how we think about it."

I'd like to remind you that today's [ remarks contain forward-looking statements within the ] meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. 
You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. 
For the first quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stemmed from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this increased GAAP earnings in Q1 by $308 million. 
To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges provide us -- protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. 
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst segment.

Today, we reported a strong start to what we expect to be an outstanding year. For the first quarter, we grew sales 29% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. We grew EPS by 125% to $0.45. Free cash flow of $372 millio",2103,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported a strong start to what we expect to be an outstanding year. For the first quarter, we grew sales 29% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. We grew EPS by 125% to $0.45. Free cash flow of $372 million builds on the momentum we established in the second half of 2020. 
All 5 of our segments delivered double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year, with sales growth rates ranging from 15% for display to 38% for environmental. But last year was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that total company sales are up 14% since the first quarter of 2019. 
No question, we're in a strong position. This morning, I want to take a closer look at how all our businesses are achieving key milestones and contributing to Corning's success. 
I'll frame my remarks around 3 points. First, invention is fundamental to our long-term strategy. Through our relentless commitment to R&D, we developed category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. 
Second, as we partner closely with our customers to move their industries forward, we unlock new ways to integrate more Corning content into their ecosystems. This is a powerful growth mechanism. 
And finally, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company, one that is committed to rewarding shareholders while supporting our customers, our people and our communities. 
Now let me expand on my first point. We're living in a world that Corning anticipated exactly a decade ago in our video, A Day Made of Glass. It's a world where technology underpins every facet of human life; a world of communication and connection, where massive bandwidth facilitates real-time information and on-demand connections and people stay connected through a virtual environment that is literally at their fingertips. 
Let's think about what it means as displays and touchscreen devices make their way to the very center of daily life. The demands we're putting on today's screens and the expectations we have for tomorrow's imply a very specific set of properties. The requirements for precision glass and ceramics become more and more exacting. We need a material that is strong, yet thin and lightweight, flexible and conformable, durable, damage-resistant and impermeable, stable enough to withstand hostile weather, extreme temperatures and cleaning agents. It needs to be touch-friendly and look elegant. It must scale for very large applications and yet be useful in the palm of your hand or on your wrist. The material must also be operable with a world of technical capabilities that lie just below the surface, enabling complex electronic circuits and nano scale structure. And it must be mindful of the environment. 
When it comes to the critical components that enable high-technology systems in multiple markets that we serve, the bar just keeps getting higher. This leads to a world where precision glass and ceramics win. And we have been winning. 
When we examine the growth in all our business today, we see key trends converging around our capabilities at a very exciting pace. In short, we're vital to progress. We succeed through sustained investments in R&D and years of material science and process engineering knowledge. 
Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. Corning is one of the world's most proficient innovators in materials science. We combine our unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms to develop category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. 
Today, our inventions clean the air we all breathe, connect people to information and each other, provide the window through which we access information and entertainment. And they help facilitate the discovery and delivery of new medicines. And we're building in each of these areas. 
We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth; with large lifelike displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more right from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that can withstand even greater reviews. 
That leads me to my second point. As we work closely with our customers to advance these visions, we find ways to solve their toughest technology challenges. Our probability of success increases as we apply more of our world-class capabilities, and our cost of innovation declines as we reapply talent and repurpose our existing assets. 
As we apply our focused portfolio, we invent solutions that add even more value to our customers' offerings, and this provides a powerful growth mechanism. We aren't exclusively relying on people just buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. 
Now through that lens, let's look at our progress across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. And we're capturing significant growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. As we advance state-of-the-art cover materials, we drive sustained outperformance across up and down markets. 
We've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat or down each year. Over that 5-year period, we've added more than $750 million in sales on a base of more than $1 billion. 
Fast Company recently recognized our achievements in this space. Noting both Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, the magazine named Corning The Most Innovative Company in Consumer Electronics for 2021. 
We see a similar growth story playing out in automotive since 2017, the peak year for car sales. Our auto sales are up more than 40%, while global car sales are down 20%. 
We're helping customers navigate an industry that is expected to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 50. And as we do, we're working to capture and expand $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, auto glass solutions and other technical glass products, including our patented 3D ColdForm technology. 
We were thrilled to see the world premier event for the all-electric EQS for Mercedes. Its hyper screen features a Gorilla Glass cover almost 5 feet wide. We've also launched a new generation of GPS. They're helping vehicles, including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate emissions. And they're helping us exceed a $500 million GPF business ahead of our original time frame. 
In Life Sciences, we are delivering growth on 2 fronts. First, demand is growing based on COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostics. Second, we're becoming increasingly relevant as we help the industry move towards cell engine-based therapies, and that shift translates into more of our content per drug sold. 
Looking longer term, we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging markets. We doubled Valor vial production in quarter 1 versus quarter 4. And to date, the company has shipped enough Valor vials for hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Corning also expanded its agreement with the U.S. government to boost capacity for vials to $261 million, a $57 million increase from our initial June 2020 agreement. 
Turning to display. We're leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver stable returns. I'm pleased to note that in quarter 1, we experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment in more than a decade. And we announced a moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices for the second quarter. 
Stepping back. We're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to maintain our leadership position. And our flexible fusion manufacturing platform allows us to match operating capacity with demand. 
Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% last year. These TVs are most efficiently made on the largest fabs, and Corning is well positioned to drive more content into the market in 2021 with its Gen 10.5 plants in China. 
Finally, let's look at optical. I'm energized by the outlook for this business. We gauge the market by 3 indicators. First is network need, and we can all see that demand on the network is only increasing. 
Second is customer statements. Broadly, network operators are making encouraging announcements on capital investment for 5G and hyperscale data center deployments. And there's also good news on fiber to the home. AT&T's CEO, John Stankey, recently said that fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, serving both wired and wireless. His company announced plans to increase its fiber-to-the-home footprint by an additional 3 million customer locations across more than 90 metro areas in 2021. 
Verizon CFO, Matt Ellis, said the fiber serves as the critical backbone to our 5G deployment. Our commitments with our vendor partners, such as Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson and Corning, represent key strategic agreements to drive innovation in 5G. 
And finally, the third indicator that we watch is our order book. We're seeing orders and sales increase. And we're also seeing multiple governments starting to shape policy that asserts broadband is a basic right. They're developing action plans to take optical solutions to many more homes. The White House is calling for more than $120 billion to bring high-speed Internet to every American. 
Just looking at the 2 biggest efforts, the Rural Opportunity Development Fund and the President's infrastructure plan, we see a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Corning. Additionally, the U.K. launched its GBP 5 billion Project Gigabit. The plan is to bring next-generation broadband to more than 1 million hard-to-reach homes and businesses. And the European Commission is calling for EUR 135 billion to support the rollout of rapid broadband services to all regions and households starting in 2021. 
In addition, we remain the unquestioned technology and market leader. We consistently create new products and extend our lead by delivering solutions that help our customers realize their network visions faster, better and cheaper. Simultaneously, we're driving productivity improvements to increase capacity and lower our cost. In total, we're feeling very good about optical. 
So I've talked about how we invest to create and make innovations that solve tough challenges, deliver for our customers and grow. Now I want to add on my final point. As we effectively build our strength as a company, we will continue to reward our shareholders. The strength of our businesses results in significant cash generation. 
Our first priority is to invest for growth. And we are committed to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. In the first quarter, we announced a 9% increase to our dividend. And earlier this month, we seized a great opportunity to resume share buybacks. 
Through our recent transaction with Samsung display, we repurchased 4% of our outstanding shares. This is a great deal for our shareholders, and it's great news for Corning that Samsung retained a 9% long-term ownership stake in the company. We see their investment as validation of Corning's innovation road map and the value of our capabilities. As we look ahead, this only adds to our confidence. 
Shifting to a broader view of our stakeholder base, we're committed to sharing resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We continue to support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. 
Our Office of Racial Equality and Social Unity has made significant strides. In North Carolina, we've established a 5-year partnership with NCANT, the largest historically black university in the United States to provide scholarships through 2026. The funding focuses on enhancing STEM education, helping students become community classroom teachers and boosting the number of graduates in other fields critical to the nation's workforce. 
In New York, we're providing hands-on support on police reform. We're also energized around our sustainability efforts. The U.S. EPA has once again named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Recently, Verizon publicly recognized our sustainable practices. And I am pleased to announce that we'll publish our first sustainability report in the coming months. 
On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, and our capabilities are vital to progress on multiple fronts. We're succeeding at building a stronger, more resilient company. 
I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their commitment to our company, to the communities we serve and to each other. And I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter."
173840,709779576,2258902,"Corning Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, EPS and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a grea",1494,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, EPS and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a great start, and we expect that strong demand and positive momentum to continue throughout the year. 
Now let me walk you through our first quarter performance. Sales were $3.3 billion, which translates to a year-over-year increase of 29%. We posted double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year across all of our segments. 
Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials delivered particularly strong year-over-year growth, posting sales increases of 38% and 28%, respectively, and net income gains of 111% and 78%, respectively. Optical Communications posted its second quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. And notably, Display experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment we've seen in more than a decade. 
During the quarter, multiple events disrupted global supply chains. Like many other companies, we experienced elevated freight and logistics costs across our businesses, and we expedited shipments to meet our customers' expanding demand. This ultimately reduced profits by approximately $50 million. 
As a result, our margins were below normalized levels. This was most pronounced in our Environmental Technologies, Optical Communications and Display businesses. We will continue to do what it takes to deliver for our customers. But we'll also take steps to mitigate these costs, and we expect to see them begin to decline in the second quarter and normalize longer term. 
Operating margin was 17.1%. That's an improvement of 730 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We grew operating income of 125% year-over-year. EPS came in at $0.45, which is more than double year-over-year. Free cash flow of $372 million was up $691 million versus first quarter 2020, and it equates to 39% of our 2020 total. This adds to our confidence that we will generate significantly more free cash flow than 2020. So even with the disruptions from the Suez to storms, to continued COVID challenges, it was a very strong quarter. 
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, first quarter sales were $863 million, up 3% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $213 million, up 40% year-over-year. Now net income declined slightly sequentially because of the timing and flows of incentives associated with expansions in China. 
Corning's volume grew by a low single-digit percentage sequentially, and Q1 sequential prices remain consistent with Q4 levels. Now we continue to see strong in-market demand. Retail demand for large-sized TVs and IT products, including notebook PCs, are both on track for another year of double-digit growth. As a reminder, growth in large-sized TVs is the most important driver for us as we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. 
Panel makers are running at high utilizations, and glass demand is robust. And we continue to expect the glass market to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2021. Against this backdrop, issues at our competitors have created glass shortages in an already tight supply environment. Our primary operational focus is to supply our customers' demand. 
Corning experienced the most favorable first quarter glass pricing environment in more than a decade. And we have increased cost in logistics, energy, raw materials and other operational expenses. As a result, we are moderately increasing glass prices in the second quarter. 
We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Looking ahead, we expect that glass supply will continue to be short to tight, and we will continue to partner with our customers to maximize our glass supply. 
In Optical Communications, first quarter sales were $937 million, up 18% year-over-year. Sales were up in both enterprise and carrier networks driven by the accelerated pace of data center builds and increased capital spending on network capacity expansion and fiber-to-the-home projects. 
Net income was $111 million, up 283%. The improvement was driven by incremental volume and strong cost performance. There are some extremely encouraging announcements coming from leading network operators as well as governments around the world that point to the start of a strong investment phase across the industry. Clearly, there is a lot of excitement surrounding network deployment and optical fiber's role in delivering both basic and next-generation services to end customers. 
We are well positioned to capture a significant amount of that upside in the market. Corning is the industry leader and the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. This puts us squarely at the center of growth trajectories in fiber to the home, 5G and hyperscale data centers. We've returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we remain confident that we will continue to grow. 
In Environmental Technologies, first quarter sales were $441 million, up 38% year-over-year. Net income was $74 million, up 111% year-over-year. Diesel sales grew 44% year-over-year driven by customers continuing to adopt more advanced after-treatment in China and by a stronger-than-expected North America heavy-duty truck market. 
Automotive sales were up 34% year-over-year as the global auto market improved and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. And we are well on our way and ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million gas particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and adoption in China continues as China's 6A implementation of the regulations began during the first quarter. 
In Specialty Materials, first quarter sales of $451 million were up 28% year-over-year due to strong demand for premium cover materials, strength in the IT market and demand for semiconductor-related optical glasses. Net income was $91 million, up 78% from 2020 as a result of higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs. 
Connectivity and computation continues to grow in importance, creating strength and resilience in the smartphone, IT and semiconductor markets. And we outperformed that strong market. Our premium glasses and surfaces supported new phones and IT launches, including more than 25 smartphones and 12 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass. And we are capturing high demand for our industry-leading advanced optics materials, which are essential for deep and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. 
In 2020, EUV systems accounted for more than 30% of all semiconductor lithography equipment expenditures. Our customers believe these systems will grow significantly over the next 5 years. So we see growth for our semiconductor-related materials well beyond resolution of the current and well-publicized capacity tightness. 
Life Sciences first quarter sales were $300 million, up 16% year-over-year and 9% sequentially driven by continued strong demand for diagnostics, growth in bioproduction and recovery in lab research markets. Net income was $48 million, up 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. 
Now I'd like to turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. 
Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
In February, we announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend. In April, share -- we resumed share buybacks by repurchasing 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung display. We are pleased that Samsung will remain a significant shareholder. Their ownership demonstrates confidence in the value of Corning's capabilities, our ongoing technology collaborations and our combined innovation leadership. The repurchases will be immediately accretive to EPS starting in Q2. We will remain opportunistic during the year surrounding additional share repurchases. 
In closing, we had an excellent quarter relative to both 2020 and in 2019. Demand is high across our businesses. Our more Corning strategy is working, and we are operating very well with all segments growing year-over-year. We are growing our top and bottom line and generating strong free cash flow. 
For the second quarter, we expect core sales of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.53. And for the rest of the year, we expect that momentum to continue. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

173840,709779576,2258902,"Corning Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steven. In terms of this build cycle, I think the most interesting thing about it is how [ demanding ] it is. The nature of network builds is the big civil works projects, and they're big capital investments. And so they tend to be made with very",472,"Thanks, Steven. In terms of this build cycle, I think the most interesting thing about it is how [ demanding ] it is. The nature of network builds is the big civil works projects, and they're big capital investments. And so they tend to be made with very long-term anticipation of growing demand. 
What's happened is during the pandemic, the networks sort of burn through their guardrail that they always tend to have. That was try to be about 18 months ahead of any demand. And so now you're feeling it. They're feeling the revenue opportunity even earlier as they build. So that provides a little more impetus. So that's like the first thing, I think, that's a little different than build cycles that you and I have seen in the past, Steven. 
There's much less on spec, more on, hey, the baseline demand has just moved up. There's more work from home. There's more need for bandwidth. There's more cloud. There's more -- and it's here today. And so I think that's one thing. 
I think the second thing is our -- the entry of fiber optics in a significant way into wireless. So historically in 4G systems or 3G, they've been relatively fiber-poor. They haven't been big consumers of fiber. But with 5G, those cells need to be so much closer to the consumer, to their customers. You need more densification, and that's driving a lot more glass into the wireless network. So it sort of put us in this position, Steven, where sort of like whichever network wins or whichever network, they tend to emphasize, it will be glass-rich. 
Now if that wasn't already more than you wanted to know, I think the third thing is that operators are building more converged networks. Especially the big folks used to run a wireless network separate from wireline, there would even be separation between what is aimed at consumers versus businesses. And now they're realizing that their very best returns were by putting in fixed glass networks and then being able to serve as many different offerings off the tip of that fiber. 
So in general, this has built a pretty good build case for the technology cycle continuing to move our way along with the build cycle. As you heard me say in the opening, one of the things we're doing when you sort of see that converged nature and you see more cloud is it's driving our innovation wheel to be able to find ways for people to install networks and have them be able to go in faster, less expensively and now greater using much less materials. And we have a whole suite of products that we're just starting to introduce that are going to help make this build cycle be a more effective investment for our customers."

I think one of the other changes that have happened over the last couple of years is IT is also having stronger demand and what we've seen in the last couple of years. And given the work-from-home and study-from-home environment, we expect that to continue. So I mean, we expect our what really drives this market, as you know, Samik, is what happens from a screen size standpoint. We'd expect our screen size to be up in that 1.5 inch plus just like it has in the past, and that would drive that marketplace. 
The one thing I would note is the one market where demand isn't as strong from a TV standpoint is in China. And China hasn't been as strong in the last couple of years. And we would expect that to change over time. And when that changes, we do think that, that will be additional demand that isn't in the marketplace today. Whether that happens in the back half of this year or next year, we'll just have to wait to see."

I mean, Wamsi, as you know, our stated goal is to expand our operating margins and improve our return on invested capital. And the good news is we're doing just that. And we believe these results are very good. 
And we think operating margin is the right place to judge our profitability. And the reason we focus on it, it's where we're utilizing our focus portfolio to capture synergies across our businesses. And you saw this expansion in operating margin. You saw it in Q3 and Q4 last year on a year-over-year basis. And you see it again in Q1. Our Q1 operating margin was 17.1%, which was up considerably from last year, and our operating margin in terms of dollars was up 125%. 
So I mean, this is good performance and in line with where we were actually from a prepandemic standpoint. But as you noted, it was also included 150 basis points of cost from the $50 million of freight and logistics cost. And when you adjust for that, then it's extremely strong performance from a margin standpoint. 
And the good news is these costs will start to decline in Q2. They're going to normalize longer term. And as that happens, you'd expect to see continued expansions from a margin standpoint. 
Now one question we get a lot is, well, what does Hemlock do to our margins? And this is a really good example of why we think if you're going to judge our profitability, operating margins is the right place to judge it. Is it actually a drag on our gross margin percentage? On average, it's about 50 basis points. But in Q1 because we had a little bit stronger business in Hemlock, it was actually greater than that. But it is slightly accretive on an operating margin standpoint. And that's why we think it's important to think about things from an operating standpoint. 
So from where we sit, we think it was really good performance in Q1. And you'd expect to see improved profitability as we turn to a more normalized environment."

And if for some reason that were to change in a big way, of course, that always comes with committed customer demand. And so that's a good thing. 
And then in terms of our full year guidance, I mean, clearly, we're very happy about the momentum that we've experienced in Q4 and in Q1.

It takes us about 18 months to get one of these big plants up, and then it takes us a while to fill it. We're now benefiting from the wisdom of our past build cycles. And so that's going to continue to be strong. 
On guidance, we've listened really closely to our investment communities. And what we've tried to do is -- the feedback we've gotten is sort of what would be most valuable would be to move to the more macro sales and EPS level and to take it a quarter at a time for now.

I'd like to remind you that today's [ remarks contain forward-looking statements within the ] meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. 
You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. 
For the first quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stemmed from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this increased GAAP earnings in Q1 by $308 million. 
To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges provide us -- protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. 
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst segment.

Free cash flow of $372 million builds on the momentum we established in the second half of 2020. 
All 5 of our segments delivered double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year, with sales growth rates ranging from 15% for display to 38% for environmental. But last year was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that total company sales are up 14% since the first quarter of 2019. 
No question, we're in a strong position. This morning, I want to take a closer look at how all our businesses are achieving key milestones and contributing to Corning's success. 
I'll frame my remarks around 3 points. First, invention is fundamental to our long-term strategy. Through our relentless commitment to R&D, we developed category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. 
Second, as we partner closely with our customers to move their industries forward, we unlock new ways to integrate more Corning content into their ecosystems. This is a powerful growth mechanism. 
And finally, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company, one that is committed to rewarding shareholders while supporting our customers, our people and our communities. 
Now let me expand on my first point. We're living in a world that Corning anticipated exactly a decade ago in our video, A Day Made of Glass. It's a world where technology underpins every facet of human life; a world of communication and connection, where massive bandwidth facilitates real-time information and on-demand connections and people stay connected through a virtual environment that is literally at their fingertips. 
Let's think about what it means as displays and touchscreen devices make their way to the very center of daily life. The demands we're putting on today's screens and the expectations we have for tomorrow's imply a very specific set of properties. The requirements for precision glass and ceramics become more and more exacting. We need a material that is strong, yet thin and lightweight, flexible and conformable, durable, damage-resistant and impermeable, stable enough to withstand hostile weather, extreme temperatures and cleaning agents. It needs to be touch-friendly and look elegant. It must scale for very large applications and yet be useful in the palm of your hand or on your wrist. The material must also be operable with a world of technical capabilities that lie just below the surface, enabling complex electronic circuits and nano scale structure. And it must be mindful of the environment. 
When it comes to the critical components that enable high-technology systems in multiple markets that we serve, the bar just keeps getting higher. This leads to a world where precision glass and ceramics win. And we have been winning. 
When we examine the growth in all our business today, we see key trends converging around our capabilities at a very exciting pace. In short, we're vital to progress. We succeed through sustained investments in R&D and years of material science and process engineering knowledge. 
Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. Corning is one of the world's most proficient innovators in materials science. We combine our unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms to develop category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. 
Today, our inventions clean the air we all breathe, connect people to information and each other, provide the window through which we access information and entertainment. And they help facilitate the discovery and delivery of new medicines. And we're building in each of these areas. 
We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth; with large lifelike displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more right from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that can withstand even greater reviews. 
That leads me to my second point. As we work closely with our customers to advance these visions, we find ways to solve their toughest technology challenges. Our probability of success increases as we apply more of our world-class capabilities, and our cost of innovation declines as we reapply talent and repurpose our existing assets. 
As we apply our focused portfolio, we invent solutions that add even more value to our customers' offerings, and this provides a powerful growth mechanism. We aren't exclusively relying on people just buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. 
Now through that lens, let's look at our progress across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. And we're capturing significant growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. As we advance state-of-the-art cover materials, we drive sustained outperformance across up and down markets. 
We've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat or down each year. Over that 5-year period, we've added more than $750 million in sales on a base of more than $1 billion. 
Fast Company recently recognized our achievements in this space. Noting both Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, the magazine named Corning The Most Innovative Company in Consumer Electronics for 2021. 
We see a similar growth story playing out in automotive since 2017, the peak year for car sales. Our auto sales are up more than 40%, while global car sales are down 20%. 
We're helping customers navigate an industry that is expected to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 50. And as we do, we're working to capture and expand $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, auto glass solutions and other technical glass products, including our patented 3D ColdForm technology. 
We were thrilled to see the world premier event for the all-electric EQS for Mercedes. Its hyper screen features a Gorilla Glass cover almost 5 feet wide. We've also launched a new generation of GPS. They're helping vehicles, including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate emissions. And they're helping us exceed a $500 million GPF business ahead of our original time frame. 
In Life Sciences, we are delivering growth on 2 fronts. First, demand is growing based on COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostics. Second, we're becoming increasingly relevant as we help the industry move towards cell engine-based therapies, and that shift translates into more of our content per drug sold. 
Looking longer term, we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging markets. We doubled Valor vial production in quarter 1 versus quarter 4. And to date, the company has shipped enough Valor vials for hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Corning also expanded its agreement with the U.S. government to boost capacity for vials to $261 million, a $57 million increase from our initial June 2020 agreement. 
Turning to display. We're leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver stable returns. I'm pleased to note that in quarter 1, we experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment in more than a decade. And we announced a moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices for the second quarter. 
Stepping back. We're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to maintain our leadership position. And our flexible fusion manufacturing platform allows us to match operating capacity with demand. 
Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% last year. These TVs are most efficiently made on the largest fabs, and Corning is well positioned to drive more content into the market in 2021 with its Gen 10.5 plants in China. 
Finally, let's look at optical. I'm energized by the outlook for this business. We gauge the market by 3 indicators. First is network need, and we can all see that demand on the network is only increasing. 
Second is customer statements. Broadly, network operators are making encouraging announcements on capital investment for 5G and hyperscale data center deployments. And there's also good news on fiber to the home. AT&T's CEO, John Stankey, recently said that fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, serving both wired and wireless. His company announced plans to increase its fiber-to-the-home footprint by an additional 3 million customer locations across more than 90 metro areas in 2021. 
Verizon CFO, Matt Ellis, said the fiber serves as the critical backbone to our 5G deployment. Our commitments with our vendor partners, such as Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson and Corning, represent key strategic agreements to drive innovation in 5G. 
And finally, the third indicator that we watch is our order book. We're seeing orders and sales increase. And we're also seeing multiple governments starting to shape policy that asserts broadband is a basic right. They're developing action plans to take optical solutions to many more homes. The White House is calling for more than $120 billion to bring high-speed Internet to every American. 
Just looking at the 2 biggest efforts, the Rural Opportunity Development Fund and the President's infrastructure plan, we see a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Corning. Additionally, the U.K. launched its GBP 5 billion Project Gigabit. The plan is to bring next-generation broadband to more than 1 million hard-to-reach homes and businesses. And the European Commission is calling for EUR 135 billion to support the rollout of rapid broadband services to all regions and households starting in 2021. 
In addition, we remain the unquestioned technology and market leader. We consistently create new products and extend our lead by delivering solutions that help our customers realize their network visions faster, better and cheaper. Simultaneously, we're driving productivity improvements to increase capacity and lower our cost. In total, we're feeling very good about optical. 
So I've talked about how we invest to create and make innovations that solve tough challenges, deliver for our customers and grow. Now I want to add on my final point. As we effectively build our strength as a company, we will continue to reward our shareholders. The strength of our businesses results in significant cash generation. 
Our first priority is to invest for growth. And we are committed to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. In the first quarter, we announced a 9% increase to our dividend. And earlier this month, we seized a great opportunity to resume share buybacks. 
Through our recent transaction with Samsung display, we repurchased 4% of our outstanding shares. This is a great deal for our shareholders, and it's great news for Corning that Samsung retained a 9% long-term ownership stake in the company. We see their investment as validation of Corning's innovation road map and the value of our capabilities. As we look ahead, this only adds to our confidence. 
Shifting to a broader view of our stakeholder base, we're committed to sharing resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We continue to support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. 
Our Office of Racial Equality and Social Unity has made significant strides. In North Carolina, we've established a 5-year partnership with NCANT, the largest historically black university in the United States to provide scholarships through 2026. The funding focuses on enhancing STEM education, helping students become community classroom teachers and boosting the number of graduates in other fields critical to the nation's workforce. 
In New York, we're providing hands-on support on police reform. We're also energized around our sustainability efforts. The U.S. EPA has once again named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Recently, Verizon publicly recognized our sustainable practices. And I am pleased to announce that we'll publish our first sustainability report in the coming months. 
On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, and our capabilities are vital to progress on multiple fronts. We're succeeding at building a stronger, more resilient company. 
I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their commitment to our company, to the communities we serve and to each other. And I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter."
173840,709779576,2259094,"Corning Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, EPS and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a grea",1494,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, EPS and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a great start, and we expect that strong demand and positive momentum to continue throughout the year. 
Now let me walk you through our first quarter performance. Sales were $3.3 billion, which translates to a year-over-year increase of 29%. We posted double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year across all of our segments. 
Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials delivered particularly strong year-over-year growth, posting sales increases of 38% and 28%, respectively, and net income gains of 111% and 78%, respectively. Optical Communications posted its second quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. And notably, Display experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment we've seen in more than a decade. 
During the quarter, multiple events disrupted global supply chains. Like many other companies, we experienced elevated freight and logistics costs across our businesses, and we expedited shipments to meet our customers' expanding demand. This ultimately reduced profits by approximately $50 million. 
As a result, our margins were below normalized levels. This was most pronounced in our Environmental Technologies, Optical Communications and Display businesses. We will continue to do what it takes to deliver for our customers. But we'll also take steps to mitigate these costs, and we expect to see them begin to decline in the second quarter and normalize longer term. 
Operating margin was 17.1%. That's an improvement of 730 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We grew operating income of 125% year-over-year. EPS came in at $0.45, which is more than double year-over-year. Free cash flow of $372 million was up $691 million versus first quarter 2020, and it equates to 39% of our 2020 total. This adds to our confidence that we will generate significantly more free cash flow than 2020. So even with the disruptions from the Suez to storms, to continued COVID challenges, it was a very strong quarter. 
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, first quarter sales were $863 million, up 3% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $213 million, up 40% year-over-year. Now net income declined slightly sequentially because of the timing and flows of incentives associated with expansions in China. 
Corning's volume grew by a low single-digit percentage sequentially, and Q1 sequential prices remain consistent with Q4 levels. Now we continue to see strong in-market demand. Retail demand for large-sized TVs and IT products, including notebook PCs, are both on track for another year of double-digit growth. As a reminder, growth in large-sized TVs is the most important driver for us as we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. 
Panel makers are running at high utilizations, and glass demand is robust. And we continue to expect the glass market to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2021. Against this backdrop, issues at our competitors have created glass shortages in an already tight supply environment. Our primary operational focus is to supply our customers' demand. 
Corning experienced the most favorable first quarter glass pricing environment in more than a decade. And we have increased cost in logistics, energy, raw materials and other operational expenses. As a result, we are moderately increasing glass prices in the second quarter. 
We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Looking ahead, we expect that glass supply will continue to be short to tight, and we will continue to partner with our customers to maximize our glass supply. 
In Optical Communications, first quarter sales were $937 million, up 18% year-over-year. Sales were up in both enterprise and carrier networks driven by the accelerated pace of data center builds and increased capital spending on network capacity expansion and fiber-to-the-home projects. 
Net income was $111 million, up 283%. The improvement was driven by incremental volume and strong cost performance. There are some extremely encouraging announcements coming from leading network operators as well as governments around the world that point to the start of a strong investment phase across the industry. Clearly, there is a lot of excitement surrounding network deployment and optical fiber's role in delivering both basic and next-generation services to end customers. 
We are well positioned to capture a significant amount of that upside in the market. Corning is the industry leader and the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. This puts us squarely at the center of growth trajectories in fiber to the home, 5G and hyperscale data centers. We've returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we remain confident that we will continue to grow. 
In Environmental Technologies, first quarter sales were $441 million, up 38% year-over-year. Net income was $74 million, up 111% year-over-year. Diesel sales grew 44% year-over-year driven by customers continuing to adopt more advanced after-treatment in China and by a stronger-than-expected North America heavy-duty truck market. 
Automotive sales were up 34% year-over-year as the global auto market improved and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. And we are well on our way and ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million gas particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and adoption in China continues as China's 6A implementation of the regulations began during the first quarter. 
In Specialty Materials, first quarter sales of $451 million were up 28% year-over-year due to strong demand for premium cover materials, strength in the IT market and demand for semiconductor-related optical glasses. Net income was $91 million, up 78% from 2020 as a result of higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs. 
Connectivity and computation continues to grow in importance, creating strength and resilience in the smartphone, IT and semiconductor markets. And we outperformed that strong market. Our premium glasses and surfaces supported new phones and IT launches, including more than 25 smartphones and 12 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass. And we are capturing high demand for our industry-leading advanced optics materials, which are essential for deep and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. 
In 2020, EUV systems accounted for more than 30% of all semiconductor lithography equipment expenditures. Our customers believe these systems will grow significantly over the next 5 years. So we see growth for our semiconductor-related materials well beyond resolution of the current and well-publicized capacity tightness. 
Life Sciences first quarter sales were $300 million, up 16% year-over-year and 9% sequentially driven by continued strong demand for diagnostics, growth in bioproduction and recovery in lab research markets. Net income was $48 million, up 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. 
Now I'd like to turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. 
Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
In February, we announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend. In April, share -- we resumed share buybacks by repurchasing 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung display. We are pleased that Samsung will remain a significant shareholder. Their ownership demonstrates confidence in the value of Corning's capabilities, our ongoing technology collaborations and our combined innovation leadership. The repurchases will be immediately accretive to EPS starting in Q2. We will remain opportunistic during the year surrounding additional share repurchases. 
In closing, we had an excellent quarter relative to both 2020 and in 2019. Demand is high across our businesses. Our more Corning strategy is working, and we are operating very well with all segments growing year-over-year. We are growing our top and bottom line and generating strong free cash flow. 
For the second quarter, we expect core sales of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.53. And for the rest of the year, we expect that momentum to continue. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

In terms of this build cycle, I think the most interesting thing about it is how [ demanding ] it is.

In terms of this build cycle, I think the most interesting thing about it is how [ demanding ] it is. The nature of network builds is the big civil works projects, and they're big capital investments. And so they tend to be made with very long-term anticipation of growing demand. 
What's happened is during the pandemic, the networks sort of burn through their guardrail that they always tend to have. That was try to be about 18 months ahead of any demand. And so now you're feeling it. They're feeling the revenue opportunity even earlier as they build. So that provides a little more impetus. So that's like the first thing, I think, that's a little different than build cycles that you and I have seen in the past, Steven. 
There's much less on spec, more on, hey, the baseline demand has just moved up. There's more work from home. There's more need for bandwidth. There's more cloud. There's more -- and it's here today. And so I think that's one thing. 
I think the second thing is our -- the entry of fiber optics in a significant way into wireless. So historically in 4G systems or 3G, they've been relatively fiber-poor. They haven't been big consumers of fiber. But with 5G, those cells need to be so much closer to the consumer, to their customers. You need more densification, and that's driving a lot more glass into the wireless network. So it sort of put us in this position, Steven, where sort of like whichever network wins or whichever network, they tend to emphasize, it will be glass-rich. 
Now if that wasn't already more than you wanted to know, I think the third thing is that operators are building more converged networks. Especially the big folks used to run a wireless network separate from wireline, there would even be separation between what is aimed at consumers versus businesses. And now they're realizing that their very best returns were by putting in fixed glass networks and then being able to serve as many different offerings off the tip of that fiber. 
So in general, this has built a pretty good build case for the technology cycle continuing to move our way along with the build cycle. As you heard me say in the opening, one of the things we're doing when you sort of see that converged nature and you see more cloud is it's driving our innovation wheel to be able to find ways for people to install networks and have them be able to go in faster, less expensively and now greater using much less materials. And we have a whole suite of products that we're just starting to introduce that are going to help make this build cycle be a more effective investment for our customers."

And so what we're pointing out is how important, not only those are, but that's where we're seeing a lot of good demand. 
I think one of the other changes that have happened over the last couple of years is IT is also having stronger demand and what we've seen in the last couple of years. And given the work-from-home and study-from-home environment, we expect that to continue. So I mean, we expect our what really drives this market, as you know, Samik, is what happens from a screen size standpoint. We'd expect our screen size to be up in that 1.5 inch plus just like it has in the past, and that would drive that marketplace. 
The one thing I would note is the one market where demand isn't as strong from a TV standpoint is in China. And China hasn't been as strong in the last couple of years. And we would expect that to change over time. And when that changes, we do think that, that will be additional demand that isn't in the marketplace today. Whether that happens in the back half of this year or next year, we'll just have to wait to see."

I mean, Wamsi, as you know, our stated goal is to expand our operating margins and improve our return on invested capital. And the good news is we're doing just that. And we believe these results are very good. 
And we think operating margin is the right place to judge our profitability. And the reason we focus on it, it's where we're utilizing our focus portfolio to capture synergies across our businesses. And you saw this expansion in operating margin. You saw it in Q3 and Q4 last year on a year-over-year basis. And you see it again in Q1. Our Q1 operating margin was 17.1%, which was up considerably from last year, and our operating margin in terms of dollars was up 125%. 
So I mean, this is good performance and in line with where we were actually from a prepandemic standpoint. But as you noted, it was also included 150 basis points of cost from the $50 million of freight and logistics cost. And when you adjust for that, then it's extremely strong performance from a margin standpoint. 
And the good news is these costs will start to decline in Q2. They're going to normalize longer term. And as that happens, you'd expect to see continued expansions from a margin standpoint. 
Now one question we get a lot is, well, what does Hemlock do to our margins? And this is a really good example of why we think if you're going to judge our profitability, operating margins is the right place to judge it. Is it actually a drag on our gross margin percentage? On average, it's about 50 basis points. But in Q1 because we had a little bit stronger business in Hemlock, it was actually greater than that. But it is slightly accretive on an operating margin standpoint. And that's why we think it's important to think about things from an operating standpoint. 
So from where we sit, we think it was really good performance in Q1. And you'd expect to see improved profitability as we turn to a more normalized environment."

And if for some reason that were to change in a big way, of course, that always comes with committed customer demand. And so that's a good thing. 
And then in terms of our full year guidance, I mean, clearly, we're very happy about the momentum that we've experienced in Q4 and in Q1.

It takes us about 18 months to get one of these big plants up, and then it takes us a while to fill it. We're now benefiting from the wisdom of our past build cycles. And so that's going to continue to be strong. 
On guidance, we've listened really closely to our investment communities.

Kind of the historic operating expense percentages that we've had, I think that's where you're going to end up from an overtime standpoint. 
Clearly, we remain very focused on it, but I just -- I do think that you do see increases as business goes up. But the thing to keep in mind is that, of course, with the leverage that we're getting from a margin standpoint that we'd expect our operating margins to go up, just like they experienced as we did on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and also as we saw in Q3 and Q4.

With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. 
I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.
You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.
For the first quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stemmed from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this increased GAAP earnings in Q1 by $308 million. 
To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges provide us -- protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. 
We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst segment. 
Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading.

Free cash flow of $372 million builds on the momentum we established in the second half of 2020. 
All 5 of our segments delivered double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year, with sales growth rates ranging from 15% for display to 38% for environmental. But last year was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that total company sales are up 14% since the first quarter of 2019.
No question, we're in a strong position. This morning, I want to take a closer look at how all our businesses are achieving key milestones and contributing to Corning's success. 
I'll frame my remarks around 3 points. First, invention is fundamental to our long-term strategy. Through our relentless commitment to R&D, we developed category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. 
Second, as we partner closely with our customers to move their industries forward, we unlock new ways to integrate more Corning content into their ecosystems. This is a powerful growth mechanism. 
And finally, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company, one that is committed to rewarding shareholders while supporting our customers, our people and our communities. 
Now let me expand on my first point. We're living in a world that Corning anticipated exactly a decade ago in our video, A Day Made of Glass. It's a world where technology underpins every facet of human life; a world of communication and connection, where massive bandwidth facilitates real-time information and on-demand connections and people stay connected through a virtual environment that is literally at their fingertips. 
Let's think about what it means as displays and touchscreen devices make their way to the very center of daily life. The demands we're putting on today's screens and the expectations we have for tomorrow's imply a very specific set of properties. The requirements for precision glass and ceramics become more and more exacting. We need a material that is strong, yet thin and lightweight, flexible and conformable, durable, damage-resistant and impermeable, stable enough to withstand hostile weather, extreme temperatures and cleaning agents. It needs to be touch-friendly and look elegant. It must scale for very large applications and yet be useful in the palm of your hand or on your wrist. The material must also be operable with a world of technical capabilities that lie just below the surface, enabling complex electronic circuits and nano scale structure. And it must be mindful of the environment.
When it comes to the critical components that enable high-technology systems in multiple markets that we serve, the bar just keeps getting higher. This leads to a world where precision glass and ceramics win. And we have been winning.
When we examine the growth in all our business today, we see key trends converging around our capabilities at a very exciting pace. In short, we're vital to progress. We succeed through sustained investments in R&D and years of material science and process engineering knowledge.
Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. Corning is one of the world's most proficient innovators in materials science. We combine our unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms to develop category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives.
Today, our inventions clean the air we all breathe, connect people to information and each other, provide the window through which we access information and entertainment. And they help facilitate the discovery and delivery of new medicines. And we're building in each of these areas.
We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth; with large lifelike displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more right from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that can withstand even greater reviews.
That leads me to my second point. As we work closely with our customers to advance these visions, we find ways to solve their toughest technology challenges. Our probability of success increases as we apply more of our world-class capabilities, and our cost of innovation declines as we reapply talent and repurpose our existing assets.
As we apply our focused portfolio, we invent solutions that add even more value to our customers' offerings, and this provides a powerful growth mechanism. We aren't exclusively relying on people just buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying.  
Now through that lens, let's look at our progress across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. And we're capturing significant growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. As we advance state-of-the-art for cover materials, we drive sustained outperformance across up and down markets.
We've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat or down each year. Over that 5-year period, we've added more than $750 million in sales on a base of more than $1 billion.
Fast Company recently recognized our achievements in this space. Noting both Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, the magazine named Corning, The Most Innovative Company in Consumer Electronics for 2021.
We see a similar growth story playing out in automotive since 2017, the peak year for car sales. Our auto sales are up more than 40%, while global car sales are down 20%.
We're helping customers navigate an industry that is expected to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 50. And as we do, we're working to capture and expand $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, auto glass solutions and other technical glass products, including our patented 3D ColdForm technology.  
We were thrilled to see the world premier event for the all-electric EQS for Mercedes. Its hyper screen features a Gorilla Glass cover almost 5-feet wide. We've also launched a new generation of GPS. They're helping vehicles, including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate emissions. And they're helping us exceed a $500 million GPF business ahead of our original time frame.  
In Life Sciences, we are delivering growth on 2 fronts. First, demand is growing based on COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostics. Second, we're becoming increasingly relevant as we help the industry move towards cell- and gene-based therapies, and that shift translates into more of our content per drug sold.
Looking longer term, we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging markets. We doubled Valor vial production in quarter 1 versus quarter 4. And to date, the company has shipped enough Valor vials for hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Corning also expanded its agreement with the U.S. government to boost capacity for vials to $261 million, a $57 million increase from our initial June 2020 agreement.
Turning to display. We're leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver stable returns. I'm pleased to note that in quarter 1, we experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment in more than a decade. And we announced a moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices for the second quarter.
Stepping back. We're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to maintain our leadership position. And our flexible fusion manufacturing platform allows us to match operating capacity with demand.
Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. 75-inch sets were up more than 60% last year. These TVs are most efficiently made on the largest fabs, and Corning is well positioned to drive more content into the market in 2021 with its Gen 10.5 plants in China.
Finally, let's look at optical. I'm energized by the outlook for this business. We gauge the market by 3 indicators. First is network need, and we can all see that demand on the network is only increasing.
Second is customer statements. Broadly, network operators are making encouraging announcements on capital investment for 5G and hyperscale data center deployments. And there's also good news on fiber to the home. AT&T's CEO, John Stankey, recently said that fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, serving both wired and wireless. His company announced plans to increase its fiber-to-the-home footprint by an additional 3 million customer locations across more than 90 metro areas in 2021.
Verizon CFO, Matt Ellis, said the fiber serves as the critical backbone to our 5G deployment. Our commitments with our vendor partners, such as Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson and Corning, represent key strategic agreements to drive innovation in 5G.
And finally, the third indicator that we watch is our order book. We're seeing orders and sales increase. And we're also seeing multiple governments starting to shape policy that asserts broadband is a basic right. They're developing action plans to take optical solutions to many more homes. The White House is calling for more than $120 billion to bring high-speed Internet to every American.
Just looking at the 2 biggest efforts, the Rural Opportunity Development Fund and the President's infrastructure plan, we see a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Corning. Additionally, the U.K. launched its GBP 5 billion Project Gigabit. The plan is to bring next-generation broadband to more than 1 million hard-to-reach homes and businesses. And the European Commission is calling for EUR 135 billion to support the rollout of rapid broadband services to all regions and households starting in 2021.
In addition, we remain the unquestioned technology and market leader. We consistently create new products and extend our lead by delivering solutions that help our customers realize their network visions faster, better and cheaper. Simultaneously, we're driving productivity improvements to increase capacity and lower our cost. In total, we're feeling very good about optical.
So I've talked about how we invest to create and make innovations that solve tough challenges, deliver for our customers and grow. Now I want to add on my final point. As we effectively build our strength as a company, we will continue to reward our shareholders. The strength of our businesses results in significant cash generation.
Our first priority is to invest for growth. And we are committed to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. In the first quarter, we announced a 9% increase to our dividend. And earlier this month, we seized a great opportunity to resume share buybacks.
Through our recent transaction with Samsung Display, we repurchased 4% of our outstanding shares. This is a great deal for our shareholders, and it's great news for Corning that Samsung retained a 9% long-term ownership stake in the company. We see their investment as validation of Corning's innovation road map and the value of our capabilities. As we look ahead, this only adds to our confidence.  
Shifting to a broader view of our stakeholder base, we're committed to sharing resources and leadership on a range of important issues. We continue to support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world.
Our Office of Racial Equality & Social Unity has made significant strides. In North Carolina, we've established a 5-year partnership with N.C. A&T, the largest historically black university in the United States to provide scholarships through 2026. The funding focuses on enhancing STEM education, helping students become community classroom teachers and boosting the number of graduates in other fields critical to the nation's workforce.
In New York, we're providing hands-on support on police reform. We're also energized around our sustainability efforts. The U.S. EPA has once again named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. Recently, Verizon publicly recognized our sustainable practices. And I am pleased to announce that we'll publish our first sustainability report in the coming months.
On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, and our capabilities are vital to progress on multiple fronts. We're succeeding at building a stronger, more resilient company.
I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their commitment to our company, to the communities we serve and to each other. And I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter."

I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, EPS and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a grea",1493,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, EPS and cash flow above our expectations. We are off to a great start, and we expect that strong demand and positive momentum to continue throughout the year.
Now let me walk you through our first quarter performance. Sales were $3.3 billion, which translates to a year-over-year increase of 29%. We posted double-digit sales and net income growth year-over-year across all of our segments.
Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials delivered particularly strong year-over-year growth, posting sales increases of 38% and 28%, respectively, and net income gains of 111% and 78%, respectively. Optical Communications posted its second quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. And notably, Display experienced the most favorable first quarter pricing environment we've seen in more than a decade. 
During the quarter, multiple events disrupted global supply chains. Like many other companies, we experienced elevated freight and logistics costs across our businesses, and we expedited shipments to meet our customers' expanding demand. This ultimately reduced profits by approximately $50 million.
As a result, our margins were below normalized levels. This was most pronounced in our Environmental Technologies, Optical Communications and Display businesses. We will continue to do what it takes to deliver for our customers. But we'll also take steps to mitigate these costs, and we expect to see them begin to decline in the second quarter and normalize longer term.
Operating margin was 17.1%. That's an improvement of 730 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We grew operating income 125% year-over-year. EPS came in at $0.45, which is more than double year-over-year. Free cash flow of $372 million was up $691 million versus first quarter 2020, and it equates to 39% of our 2020 total. This adds to our confidence that we will generate significantly more free cash flow than 2020. So even with the disruptions from the Suez to storms, to continued COVID challenges, it was a very strong quarter.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, first quarter sales were $863 million, up 3% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Net income was $213 million, up 40% year-over-year. Now net income declined slightly sequentially because of the timing and flows of incentives associated with expansions in China.
Corning's volume grew by a low single-digit percentage sequentially, and Q1 sequential prices remain consistent with Q4 levels. Now we continue to see strong in-market demand. Retail demand for large-sized TVs and IT products, including notebook PCs, are both on track for another year of double-digit growth. As a reminder, growth in large-sized TVs is the most important driver for us as we are well positioned to capture that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing.
Panel makers are running at high utilizations, and glass demand is robust. And we continue to expect the glass market to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2021. Against this backdrop, issues at our competitors have created glass shortages in an already tight supply environment. Our primary operational focus is to supply our customers' demand.
Corning experienced the most favorable first quarter glass pricing environment in more than a decade. And we have increased cost in logistics, energy, raw materials and other operational expenses. As a result, we are moderately increasing glass prices in the second quarter.
We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Looking ahead, we expect that glass supply will continue to be short to tight, and we will continue to partner with our customers to maximize our glass supply.
In Optical Communications, first quarter sales were $937 million, up 18% year-over-year. Sales were up in both enterprise and carrier networks, driven by the accelerated pace of data center builds and increased capital spending on network capacity expansion and fiber-to-the-home projects. 
Net income was $111 million, up 283%. The improvement was driven by incremental volume and strong cost performance. There are some extremely encouraging announcements coming from leading network operators as well as governments around the world that point to the start of a strong investment phase across the industry. Clearly, there is a lot of excitement surrounding network deployment and optical fiber's role in delivering both basic and next-generation services to end customers.
We are well positioned to capture a significant amount of that upside in the market. Corning is the industry leader and the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. This puts us squarely at the center of growth trajectories in fiber to the home, 5G and hyperscale data centers. We've returned to growth in Optical Communications, and we remain confident that we will continue to grow.
In Environmental Technologies, first quarter sales were $441 million, up 38% year-over-year. Net income was $74 million, up 111% year-over-year. Diesel sales grew 44% year-over-year driven by customers continuing to adopt more advanced after-treatment in China and by a stronger-than-expected North America heavy-duty truck market.
Automotive sales were up 34% year-over-year as the global auto market improved and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. And we are well on our way and ahead of our original time frame to build a $500 million gas particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect, and adoption in China continues as China's 6a implementation of the regulations began during the first quarter. 
In Specialty Materials, first quarter sales of $451 million were up 28% year-over-year due to strong demand for premium cover materials, strength in the IT market and demand for semiconductor-related optical glasses. Net income was $91 million, up 78% from 2020 as a result of higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs.
Connectivity and computation continues to grow in importance, creating strength and resilience in the smartphone, IT and semiconductor markets. And we outperformed that strong market. Our premium glasses and surfaces supported new phones and IT launches, including more than 25 smartphones and 12 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass. And we are capturing high demand for our industry-leading advanced optics materials, which are essential for deep and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. 
In 2020, EUV systems accounted for more than 30% of all semiconductor lithography equipment expenditures. Our customers believe these systems will grow significantly over the next 5 years. So we see growth for our semiconductor-related materials well beyond resolution of the current and well-publicized capacity tightness.
Life Sciences first quarter sales were $300 million, up 16% year-over-year and 9% sequentially driven by continued strong demand for diagnostics, growth in bioproduction and recovery in lab research markets. Net income was $48 million, up 26% year-over-year and 14% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. 
Now I'd like to turn to our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders.
Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic M&A. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
In February, we announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend. In April, share -- we resumed share buybacks by repurchasing 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung Display. We are pleased that Samsung will remain a significant shareholder. Their ownership demonstrates confidence in the value of Corning's capabilities, our ongoing technology collaborations and our combined innovation leadership. The repurchases will be immediately accretive to EPS starting in Q2. We will remain opportunistic during the year surrounding additional share repurchases. 
In closing, we had an excellent quarter relative to both 2020 and to 2019. Demand is high across our businesses. Our more Corning strategy is working, and we are operating very well with all segments growing year-over-year. We are growing our top and bottom line and generating strong free cash flow. 
For the second quarter, we expect core sales of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion and earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.53. And for the rest of the year, we expect that momentum to continue. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

The nature of network builds is the big civil works projects, and their big capital investments. And so they tend to be made with very long-term anticipation of growing demand.
What's happened is during the pandemic, the networks sort of burn through their guardrail that they always tend to have. They always try to be about 18 months ahead of any demand. And so now you're feeling it. They're feeling the revenue opportunity even earlier as they build. So that provides a little more impetus. So that's like the first thing, I think, that's a little different than build cycles that you and I have seen in the past, Steven.
There's much less on spec, more on, hey, the baseline demand has just moved up. There's more work from home. There's more need for bandwidth. There's more cloud. There's more -- and it's here today. And so I think that's one thing.
I think the second thing is our -- the entry of fiber optics in a significant way into wireless. So historically in 4G systems or 3G, they've been relatively fiber-poor. They haven't been big consumers of fiber. But with 5G, those cells need to be so much closer to the consumer, to their customers. You need more densification, and that's driving a lot more glass into the wireless network. So it sort of put us in this position, Steven, where sort of like whichever network wins or whichever network, they tend to emphasize, it will be glass-rich.
Now if that wasn't already more than you wanted to know, I think the third thing is that operators are building more converged networks. Especially the big folks used to run a wireless network separate from wireline, there would even be separation between what is aimed at consumers versus businesses. And now they're realizing that their very best returns were by putting in fixed glass networks and then being able to serve as many different offerings off the tip of that fiber.
So in general, this has built a pretty good build case for the technology cycle continuing to move our way along with the build cycle. As you heard me say in the opening, one of the things we're doing when you sort of see that converged nature and you see more cloud is it's driving our innovation wheel to be able to find ways for people to install networks and have them be able to go in faster, less expensively and now greener using much less materials. And we have a whole suite of products that we're just starting to introduce that are going to help make this build cycle be a more effective investment for our customers."

And so what we're pointing out is how important, not only those are, but that's where we're seeing a lot of good demand. 
I think one of the other changes that have happened over the last couple of years is IT is also having stronger demand and what we've seen in the last couple of years. And given the work-from-home and study-from-home environment, we expect that to continue. So I mean, we expect our -- what really drives this market, as you know, Samik, is what happens from a screen size standpoint. We'd expect our screen size to be up in that 1.5-inch plus just like it has in the past, and that would drive that marketplace.
The one thing I would note is the one market where demand isn't as strong from a TV standpoint is in China. And China hasn't been as strong in the last couple of years. And we would expect that, that to change over time. And when that changes, we do think that, that will be additional demand that isn't in the marketplace today. Whether that happens in the back half of this year or next year, we'll just have to wait to see."

And we believe these results are very good.
And we think operating margin is the right place to judge our profitability. And the reason we focus on it, it's where we're utilizing our focus portfolio to capture synergies across our businesses. And you saw this expansion in operating margin. You saw it in Q3 and Q4 last year on a year-over-year basis. And you see it again in Q1. Our Q1 operating margin was 17.1%, which was up considerably from last year, and our operating margin in terms of dollars was up 125%.
So I mean, this is good performance and in line with where we were actually from a prepandemic standpoint. But as you noted, it was also, included 150 basis points of cost from the $50 million of freight and logistics cost. And when you adjust for that, then it's extremely strong performance from a margin standpoint.
And the good news is these costs will start to decline in Q2. They're going to normalize longer term. And as that happens, you'd expect to see continued expansions from a margin standpoint.
Now one question we get a lot is, well, what does Hemlock do to our margins? And this is a really good example of why we think if you're going to judge our profitability, operating margins is the right place to judge it. Is it actually a drag on our gross margin percentage? On average, it's about 50 basis points. But in Q1 because we had a little bit stronger business in Hemlock, it was actually greater than that. But it is slightly accretive on an operating margin standpoint. And that's why we think it's important to think about things from an operating standpoint. 
So from where we sit, we think it was really good performance in Q1. And you'd expect to see improved profitability as we turn to a more normalized environment."

I think from a CapEx standpoint, what we said back in January is we thought CapEx would be pretty similar to what occurred in 2020. And we still think that's likely to be the case.

I think from a CapEx standpoint, what we said back in January is we thought CapEx would be pretty similar to what occurred in 2020. And we still think that's likely to be the case. 
As you noted, our demand is very strong. And so as we get out further into the year, is it possible we'd spend a little bit more CapEx in order to meet that demand? That's certainly always a possibility. But I think from an overall standpoint, where we were back in January is still the right place. And if for some reason that were to change in a big way, of course, that always comes with committed customer demand. And so that's a good thing. 
And then in terms of our full year guidance, I mean, clearly, we're very happy about the momentum that we've experienced in Q4 and in Q1. And as with the guide we gave, we expect to continue from a Q2 standpoint. There's just still a lot of uncertainty in the world and a lot of general uncertainty.

It takes us about 18 months to get one of these big plants up, and then it takes us a while to fill it. We're now benefiting from the wisdom of our past build cycles. And so that's going to continue to be strong. 
On guidance, we've listened really closely to our investment communities. And what we've tried to do is -- the feedback we've gotten is sort of what would be most valuable would be to move to the more macro sales and EPS level and to take it a quarter at a time for now.

Welcome to Corning's Quarter 2 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. 
I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. 
You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. 
In the second quarter, GAAP net income was $449 million. However, GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.42 due to the GAAP accounting treatment required for the transaction entered into with Samsung Display. Let me take you through why this was the case. 
As a reminder, on April 5, 2021, Corning entered into a share repurchase agreement with Samsung Display. As part of the agreement, Samsung converted preferred stock into common stock, and Corning immediately repurchased 35 million shares of that common stock from Samsung. The common shares were [ then ] traded on the open exchange, so GAAP requires a special accounting treatment of the repurchase as an extinguishment of the original preferred shares. 
The accounting treatment for an extinguishment of preferred shares is to record the difference between the repurchase price and the original book value in retained earnings. This adjustment to retained earnings is also removed from net income available to common shareholders when calculating GAAP earnings per share. Excluding this, U.S. GAAP EPS would have been $0.52. 
Differences between our GAAP and core results can also stem from noncash mark-to-market gains or losses associated with hedging contracts. They were de minimis this quarter. 
A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP values can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst center. 
Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along, and they're also available on our website for downloading. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell."
173840,1672695586,2351455,"Corning Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported outstanding second quarter results, and we're on track for a strong year. Versus second quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion.

Today, we reported outstanding second quarter results, and we're on track for a strong year. 
Versus second quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion. EPS grew 112% to $0.53 on the higher sales and expanding margins. Free cash flow grew 65% to $471 million, with first half cash generation of $843 million. 
No question, we're in great shape. And we see a clear growth story playing out across our businesses. Each of our 5 segments grew sales by a double-digit percentage year-over-year ranging from 16% for Specialty Materials to 80% for Environmental Technologies. 
Now of course, 2020 was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that even versus second quarter of 2019, we grew total company sales and EPS 17% and 18%, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2019, we've added more than $0.5 billion in quarterly sales. About $200 million is from Hemlock, and more than $300 million is organic growth, with about 70% of that coming from success of our More Corning content strategy and outperforming the competition. 
The other 30% of organic growth is from rising with the market. In each of our market access platforms, we're addressing significant and transformational trends. We seek to drive content and expand our total addressable market by combining capabilities from our focused portfolio and prioritizing opportunities for More Corning. 
Our long-term strategy is built on a complementary set of 3 core technologies, 4 proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We are leaders in each. And the synergies among them allow us to create distinctive benefits for our customers, improve the return on our investments in R&D and reduce our capital intensity. 
We create breakthrough products and processes by leveraging the synergies among our core capabilities, capitalizing on insights we gain through close collaboration with our customers and taking advantage of our existing plants and pilot facilities for early-stage production. For example, over the past few years, we have created new-to-the-world products, including Ceramic Shield, tougher Gorilla Glasses, AutoGrade glass, Valor drug packaging, Gen 10.5 display glass and innovative passive optical solutions that are dramatically increasing the ease and cost efficiency of network deployments. 
But we're not just creators. We're also builders. We do the manufacturing ourselves using processes that we invent and proprietary equipment that we design and build. When growth opportunities arise and demand exceeds our existing capacity, we build state-of-the-art plants to manufacture products at scale. And we locate these plants in close proximity to our customers, a strategy that is likely to continue to pay off in a postpandemic world. 
We derisk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers, often including funding before beginning construction. We last detailed our build investments with you in 2019 when we described our focus, create, build, extend value creation cycle. We pointed out how our build projects were directly responding to customer needs and commitments. 
We knew that carriers like AT&T and Verizon would need more fiber to densify their networks for 5G. We knew that BOE would need glass for its Gen 10.5 panels, that car companies would need gasoline particulate filters to meet new regulations, that biotech companies would need high-density cell culture to support gene therapy and that smartphone OEMs would need increasingly durable scratch-resistant cover glass as they design thinner phones and bigger cameras. 
We told you these build projects would increase our capacity to meet committed demand. And that as we delivered on that demand, they would increase our revenue and generate excellent returns. 
We are delivering. Today, the build projects we undertook from 2016 to 2019 are collectively delivering return on invested capital above 20%. They've helped us increase our sales run rate from $10 billion in 2015 and 2016 to our current run rate of $14 billion. And they've helped us improve total company ROIC by 3 percentage points. 
Importantly, each time we build, we increase our scale, and we enhance the opportunity to extend our leadership and create new innovations. And because we're constantly improving our productivity and capabilities, we can often manufacture these innovations and drive revenue growth without building new facilities. 
Now we actually spend most of our time in this extend part of the cycle. It's where we are today. In this phase, we keep creating and extending until we're so successful that demand exceeds our capacity. 
As we reapply our insights and repurpose our assets, our best-in-the-world capabilities just keep getting better. Every time we pursue an adjacent opportunity, we explore new combinations of capabilities. We push the boundaries in areas where we already lead, and we cross-train our people in deep and important ways. 
In other words, we've created a positive feedback loop that expands our knowledge, increases the relevance of our capabilities and enhances our value to customers. And this directly fuels our content strategy. We aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff, we're putting More Corning into the products that people are already buying. 
With that in mind, let's look at some of the initiatives we're advancing across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. We capture growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. 
In the quarter, consistent with our strategy to obtain customer commitments in support of build initiatives, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to help expand our manufacturing capacity in the United States and to support our R&D. To date, we've received $495 million in total from Apple's fund. 
We've also launched another chapter in our More Corning strategy with an important application of our capabilities to enhance the optics of smartphone cameras, which is a new category for us. The social media experience is centered around photos. Device designers are adding cameras and increasing lens size. They're also integrating more advanced capabilities such as telephoto, wide-angle lenses and infrared sensors. 
These features naturally increase the prominence of the lens surface area, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of scratches and damage and to Corning. Just last week, we announced Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ for mobile phone cameras. Our DX family increases image quality and camera durability by providing a composite glass material that combines low reflection with scratch resistance approaching sapphire. Samsung is the first adopter. 
Turning to automotive. OEMs are designing cleaner and safer vehicles with technology that enhances the driving experience. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. We're pursuing $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, precision glass products and auto glass solutions. 
And we recently entered a new product category in automotive, curved mirror solutions. Our solutions are enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai's new electric crossover, the Ionic 5. The system essentially turns the windshield into a display screen, letting drivers keep their eyes on the road while assessing navigation and speed information directly in their line of sight. Additionally, a new generation of gasoline particulate filters is helping us on our way to surpassing $500 million in annual GPF sales well ahead of our original time frame. 
Turning to Life Sciences. We're delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. Our inventions are helping advance the transition to cell and gene therapies. And we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in the pharmaceutical packaging market. 
In the second quarter, we further increased Valor production capacity and secured additional customer wins. We worked with Thermo Fisher and OPTIMA pharma to demonstrate solutions that increase [ vial-filling ] speed by nearly 70%, thereby alleviating a critical bottleneck in the medical supply chain. Our collaboration features a combination of Corning's Valor vials and OPTIMA's ultra-high speed fill and finish solutions. Thermo Fisher called the results ""a game changer in their ability to serve patients.""  
Turning to Display. We're -- experienced the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade, and we announced a second moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices. 
Stepping back. We're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to enhance our leadership position. 
Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. The market for large-sized TVs is expected and projected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2024. And Gen 10.5 glass provides the most economical approach for larger sets. 
We recently hosted the official opening ceremony for our Gen 10.5 facility in the City of Wuhan. This site is co-located with a large BOE plant, allowing Corning to deliver Gen 10.5 glass substrates more efficiently to our customer for its production of large-sized display panels. Gen 10.5 provides strong economics for our shareholders, while creating options to use earlier-generation fusion tanks for new applications such as automotive and cover glass. 
To illustrate, remember that we launched our Gorilla Glass business back in 2007 by repurposing some of our existing fusion assets. Over time, repurposing has resulted in us avoiding more than $1 billion in capital spending. 
Finally, let's look at Optical Communications. We're energized by the momentum that is building in this business. We see that momentum confirmed by multiple sources. 
First is network need. Demand on the network has only been increasing. Broadband usage for June was up 33% versus prepandemic levels and up 10% versus June 2020, which was a peak quarantine period. Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost 300 million, and they're on track to double that by the end of 2021 according to industry projections. 
The second confirmation is customer commitments. And many of our customers are actually being quite public about their plans. We believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber to the home and hyperscale data centers. 
On AT&T's earnings call last week, their CEO said that by year-end, they expect to have expanded their fiber footprint by 3 million locations, including both business and consumer customers. Deutsche Telekom's Managing Director recently shared that by 2024, they're planning to have about 10 million homes passed and 97% 5G coverage. He said, ""The expansion of high-performance networks is our top priority whether with 5G and mobile communications or fiber optic broadband expansion. To achieve this, we are massively increasing the investments in our network."" 
And Microsoft CEO recently shared his perspective on expanding data center capacity to meet cloud demand. He said, ""Digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating, and it's just the beginning."" 
Of course, the third confirmation is our order book, which is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. Here, we're seeing year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks. 
During the quarter, we extended our technology and market leadership in Optical Communications by introducing new solutions that speed network deployment. We launched Corning SMF-28 Contour fiber, which offers an industry first combination of superior bendability, compatibility with other fibers and low signal loss. We also launched EDGE Rapid Connect solutions that increase fiber density and reduce customer installation time by up to 70%. 
Across our markets, you can see that our value creation model is driving growth, and the key trends are converging around our capabilities. We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth with large life-like displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that are more and more capable. 
Now I'll wrap up my remarks today with one final point. I've always said that how we do things is as important as what we accomplish. So I'd like to take a moment to emphasize that we're committed to making a difference wherever we can. 
We're building on more than a century of honest, respectful and fair behavior. And such behavior must continuously characterize all our actions, including progress toward improving our environmental, social and governance programs. 
To share insight into our approach, we recently issued our annual report on diversity, equity and inclusion. And we published our first sustainability report. 
On all dimensions. Corning is operating exceptionally well, focused on providing value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their continued hard work. And I look forward to updating you on our progress as we build on our momentum in the second half of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter."

As Wendell said, we are on track for a strong year. 
Second quarter results were outstanding. We added almost $1 billion in sales year-over-year, $0.5 billion in sales over prepandemic levels, and we generated significant operating and free cash flow. We also improved margins both sequentially and year-over-year, which contributed to our strong EPS. 
Across the board, our progress has been 
[Audio Gap]
and very positive. In particular, prepandemic comparisons highlight our strength. We are confident this momentum will continue. 
In all our markets, Corning's unique capabilities put us at the center of a substantial growth trend, while our content strategy drives outperformance. And we have a highly effective value creation model in place to deliver profitable growth and create shareholder value. 
Now let me walk you through the key metrics and drivers of our second quarter performance. Sales increased 35% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, a strong run rate. Net income was $459 million, up 111%. And EPS was $0.53, up 112% year-over-year. 
We saw continued strength across our business segments. Optical Communications delivered its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. Display Technologies was up sequentially and year-over-year and continues to experience the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. Life Sciences and Environmental outperformed their markets and grew significantly versus last year's pandemic lows. 
Our margins expanded. Sequentially, gross margin improved 200 basis points to 37.8%, and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 18.3%. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin expanded 450 basis points, and operating margin expanded 710 basis points. 
Now during the quarter, we continue to face supply chain disruptions and inflationary headwinds. Planning and increased output allowed us to reduce costly airfreight, but the sequential improvement was offset by increases in shipping rates and the cost of certain raw materials such as resin, a key component in our Optical and Life Sciences businesses. In total, we felt about the same 150 basis points drag on margins as in Q1. 
Now while we don't expect significant improvement on the supply chain costs in the short term, we do expect them to normalize over time. And we're taking mitigating actions, including raising prices in selected product lines. 
Now as is usual in the second quarter, operating expenses in dollars increased sequentially. The increase was greater than in prior years because of a larger -- because of larger variable compensation accruals consistent with our rising outlook. 
Free cash flow was $471 million, up $186 million year-over-year. Cumulative free cash flow for the first half of 2021 was $843 million. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the second half of the year and to surpass our 2020 total by a wide margin. 
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, second quarter sales were $939 million, up 9% sequentially and 25% versus 2020. Net income was $248 million, up 16% sequentially and 63% year-over-year. 
And Q2 sequential prices increased moderately as we implemented a price increase during the quarter. For the third quarter, we are moderately increasing glass prices once again. We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. 
Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. 
Now we receive a lot of questions on how pandemic has impacted the display industry. For example, will there be fewer TVs sold in 2021 or in 2022, and what's the impact on the glass market? So let me take a moment to explain our view. 
I'll focus on televisions since they represent about 70% of the glass market. Since LCD TVs emerged as mainstream technology in 2004, LCD television units have only been down 3x and never 2 years in a row. And annual glass demand has never declined. 
Now since 2014, television [indiscernible] units are typically range bound between 225 million and 235 million, while average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year. In 2020, global TV units increased 4% above the trend line to about 242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TVs sold probably to accommodate more people living, working and studying from home. In total, glass demand was up mid-single digits. 
Now entering the year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller TVs and for normal growth of 1.5 inches in screen size to return. We now have retail data through the first half of 2021, and it is largely confirmatory. 
TV units declined by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, while average screen size growth returned to the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TVs 65 inches and larger increased over 20% and smaller televisions were down by a high single-digit percentage. 
Now consistent with math and history, the glass market grew. So halfway through the year, our expectations for TV units being down year-over-year and screen sizes growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out. 
Looking ahead to 2022, we think TV units and screen sizes will continue to follow historical trends. That means TV units will be within the typical range, and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches. 
Now we have yet to see how the current holiday retail season plays out. So we don't have enough information to definitively comment too much on next year. But it is worth noting that TV units, which are declining this year, have never declined 2 years in a row. And next year is a World Cup year, and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year. 
And finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size. We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year. Now we'll refine our views based on this year's holiday retail season, which is still in front of us, and we will keep you updated. 
Let's move to Optical Communications, which continues its growth in -- with sales surpassing $1 billion, up 21% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Sales increased by a double-digit percentage in both carrier and enterprise networks sequentially and year-over-year. 
Net income was $148 million, up 83% year-over-year and 33% sequentially. Higher volume and better operational performance drove the improvement. 
The environment is extremely favorable. Demand on networks is at an all-time high. In response, operators are expanding network capacity, capabilities and access. The pace of data centers build is accelerating, and capital spending by our customers is increasing. Governments around the world are announcing and initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband. All this points to the start of a strong sustained investment phase across the industry. 
We are the market leaders, and we're well positioned to capture significant growth as network investment increases. Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency of [indiscernible]. Additionally, Corning is the only large-scale Indian manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. Our broad customer base and unquestioned technology leadership puts us squarely at the center of customer investments for fiber to the home, world broadband, 5G and hyperscale data centers. 
In Environmental Technologies, second quarter results were $407 million, up 81% year-over-year but down 8% sequentially. Net income improved year-over-year to $81 million and also grew sequentially partly due to improved freight and logistics costs versus Q1. 
Car-related sales increased 68% year-over-year as vehicle production has improved from pandemic lows and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. Auto markets continue to be constrained by chip shortages, which impacted our automotive sales sequentially in the second quarter. 
We are monitoring end market demand and supply chain activity as we go through the second half of the year. We remain on track to build a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business ahead of our original time frame. We continue to innovate to solve our customers' most challenging problems and have recently begun to ship next-generation GPFs to help OEMs achieve even lower levels of emission. 
In diesel, sales grew 101% year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of advanced aftertreatment in China and continued strength in the North American heavy-duty truck market. 
Specialty Materials delivered another outstanding quarter. Following first quarter year-over-year growth of 28%, the second quarter was up 16% year-over-year with sales of $483 million. 
Demand remains strong for our premium cover glass materials and IT products. During the quarter, our premium glasses and surfaces supported multiple new phone and IT launches, including 16 smartphones, along with 6 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass. 
Demand also remains strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing, which are essential for deep ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. Now investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income than in 2020. As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing processes. We anticipate that profitability will improve as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization. 
Life Sciences second quarter sales were $312 million, up 28% year-over-year and 4% sequentially driven by ongoing recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and continued strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Net income was $52 million, up 68% year-over-year and 8% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. So our businesses performed very well, and our markets are strong. 
That said, let me take a moment to reiterate our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders. 
Our first priority for use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic acquisitions. 
Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. This year, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9% and resume share buybacks by repurchasing and retiring 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung Display. 
In closing, we had an excellent quarter. Our performance relative to both 2020 and 2019 adds to our confidence that we are on track for an outstanding year. 
For the third quarter, we expect core sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.54 to $0.59. Our value creation model is working. We are pursuing opportunities that utilize capabilities from our focused and cohesive portfolio to drive growth. By repurposing and reapplying capabilities, we're increasing our probability of success, lowering our cost of innovation and becoming more capital efficient. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

So there's always a degree of mitigation of the impact of what's going on with consumer behavior at any given point of time. So that's first to put in context. 
Rolling forward, what we've tried to do is place that range of outcomes of consumer behavior into our guides and into the way in which we're thinking about and planning our business in the near term.

The way the supply chain works is we will literally provide that part, that cover part. So both the underlying structure, the glass structures as well as the material we use to drive the composite to be able to improve the optics and durability of those cameras. 
So we have built the supply chain to be able to have that roll into really the same plants that ultimately glass parts go to build phones. So we feel pretty good that we have the capability and we've built the capability to serve the market. And so now it will be how quickly will the technology be adopted because it is new. It is a new feature for phones. It does improve camera performance pretty darn significantly. So we're hoping that, that becomes pretty rapidly adopted. 
One thing that's going to impact pacing though is when you change the light-capturing capabilities of a camera. Remember that cameras are pretty complex devices, right? So you have the whole end system, and you have different chipsets to deal with that imaging. And they're built around an optical chain that is a certain amount of light that's available. 
So we're actually improving that. And so as you improve that to take full advantage of it, you probably need to optimize some other components. So we do think that, though it is relatively easy, adoptable, there are things that you would need to do differently to take full advantage of this to deliver an advantaged end customer experience."

Welcome to Corning's Quarter 2 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.
I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.
You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.
In the second quarter, GAAP net income was $449 million. However, GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.42 due to the GAAP accounting treatment required for the transaction entered into with Samsung Display. Let me take you through why this was the case.
As a reminder, on April 5, 2021, Corning entered into a share repurchase agreement with Samsung Display. As part of the agreement, Samsung converted preferred stock into common stock, and Corning immediately repurchased 35 million shares of that common stock from Samsung. The common shares were then traded on the open exchange, so GAAP requires a special accounting treatment of the repurchase as an extinguishment of the original preferred shares.
The accounting treatment for an extinguishment of preferred shares is to record the difference between the repurchase price and the original book value in retained earnings. This adjustment to retained earnings is also removed from net income available to common shareholders when calculating GAAP earnings per share. Excluding this, U.S. GAAP EPS would have been $0.52.
Differences between our GAAP and core results can also stem from noncash mark-to-market gains or losses associated with hedging contracts. They were de minimis this quarter. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP values can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along, and they're also available on our website for downloading.
And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell."

Today, we reported outstanding second quarter results, and we're on track for a strong year.
Versus second quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion. EPS grew 112% to $0.53 on the higher sales and expanding margins. Free cash flow grew 65% to $471 million, with first half cash generation of $843 million. No question we're in great shape, and we see a clear growth story playing out across our businesses. Each of our 5 segments grew sales by a double-digit percentage year-over-year ranging from 16% for Specialty Materials to 80% for Environmental Technologies.
Now of course, 2020 was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that even versus second quarter of 2019, we grew total company sales and EPS 17% and 18%, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2019, we've added more than $0.5 billion in quarterly sales. About $200 million is from Hemlock, and more than $300 million is organic growth, with about 70% of that coming from success of our More Corning content strategy and outperforming the competition.
The other 30% of organic growth is from rising with the market. In each of our market access platforms, we're addressing significant and transformational trends. We seek to drive content and expand our total addressable market by combining capabilities from our focused portfolio and prioritizing opportunities for More Corning.
Our long-term strategy is built on a complementary set of 3 core technologies, 4 proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We are leaders in each. And the synergies among them allow us to create distinctive benefits for our customers, improve the return on our investments in R&D and reduce our capital intensity.
We create breakthrough products and processes by leveraging the synergies among our core capabilities, capitalizing on insights we gain through close collaboration with our customers and taking advantage of our existing plants and pilot facilities for early-stage production. For example, over the past few years, we have created new-to-the-world products, including Ceramic Shield, tougher Gorilla Glasses, Autograde glass, Valor drug packaging, Gen 10.5 display glass and innovative passive optical solutions that are dramatically increasing the ease and cost efficiency of network deployments.
But we're not just creators. We're also builders. We do the manufacturing ourselves using processes that we invent and proprietary equipment that we design and build. When growth opportunities arise and demand exceeds our existing capacity, we build state-of-the-art plants to manufacture products at scale. And we locate these plants in close proximity to our customers, a strategy that is likely to continue to pay off in a postpandemic world.
We derisk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers, often including funding before beginning construction. We last detailed our build investments with you in 2019 when we described our focus, create, build, extend value creation cycle. We pointed out how our build projects were directly responding to customer needs and commitments.
We knew that carriers like AT&T and Verizon would need more fiber to densify their networks for 5G. We knew that BOE would need glass for its Gen 10.5 panels; that car companies would need gasoline particulate filters to meet new regulations; that biotech companies would need high-density cell culture to support gene therapy; and that smartphone OEMs would need increasingly durable scratch-resistant cover glass as they design thinner phones and bigger cameras.
We told you these build projects would increase our capacity to meet committed demand. And that as we delivered on that demand, they would increase our revenue and generate excellent returns.
We are delivering. Today, the build projects we undertook from 2016 to 2019 are collectively delivering return on invested capital above 20%. They've helped us increase our sales run rate from $10 billion in 2015 and 2016 to our current run rate of $14 billion. And they've helped us improve total company ROIC by 3 percentage points.
Importantly, each time we build, we increase our scale, and we enhance the opportunity to extend our leadership and create new innovations. And because we're constantly improving our productivity and capabilities, we can often manufacture these innovations and drive revenue growth without building new facilities. Now we actually spend most of our time in this extend part of the cycle. It's where we are today. In this phase, we keep creating and extending until we're so successful that demand exceeds our capacity.
As we reapply our insights and repurpose our assets, our best-in-the-world capabilities just keep getting better. Every time we pursue an adjacent opportunity, we explore new combinations of capabilities. We push the boundaries in areas where we already lead, and we cross-train our people in deep and important ways.
In other words, we've created a positive feedback loop that expands our knowledge, increases the relevance of our capabilities and enhances our value to customers. And this directly fuels our content strategy. We aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying.
With that in mind, let's look at some of the initiatives we're advancing across our market access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. We capture growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices.
In the quarter, consistent with our strategy to obtain customer commitments in support of build initiatives, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to help expand our manufacturing capacity in the United States and to support our R&D. To date, we've received $495 million in total from Apple's fund.
We've also launched another chapter in our More Corning strategy with an important application of our capabilities to enhance the optics of smartphone cameras, which is a new category for us. The social media experience is centered around photos. Device designers are adding cameras and increasing lens size. They're also integrating more advanced capabilities such as telephoto, wide-angle lenses and infrared sensors.
These features naturally increase the prominence of the lens surface area, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of scratches and damage and to Corning. Just last week, we announced Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ for mobile phone cameras. Our DX family increases image quality and camera durability by providing a composite glass material that combines low reflection with scratch resistance approaching sapphire. Samsung is the first adopter.
Turning to automotive. OEMs are designing cleaner and safer vehicles with technology that enhances the driving experience. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. We're pursuing $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, precision glass products and auto-glass solutions.
And we recently entered a new product category in automotive, Curved Mirror Solutions. Our solutions are enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai's new electric crossover, the IONIQ 5. The system essentially turns the windshield into a display screen, letting drivers keep their eyes on the road while assessing navigation and speed information directly in their line of sight. Additionally, a new generation of gasoline particulate filters is helping us on our way to surpassing $500 million in annual GPF sales well ahead of our original time frame.
Turning to Life Sciences. We're delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. Our inventions are helping advance the transition to cell and gene therapies. And we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in the pharmaceutical packaging market.
In the second quarter, we further increased Valor production capacity and secured additional customer wins. We worked with Thermo Fisher and OPTIMA pharma to demonstrate solutions that increase vial-filling speed by nearly 70%, thereby alleviating a critical bottleneck in the medical supply chain. Our collaboration features a combination of Corning's Valor vials and OPTIMA's ultra-high speed fill and finish solutions. Thermo Fisher called the results ""a game-changer in their ability to serve patients.""
Turning to Display. We've experienced the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade, and we announced a second moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices. Stepping back, we're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to enhance our leadership position.
Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. The market for large-sized TVs is expected and projected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2024. And Gen 10.5 glass provides the most economical approach for larger sets.
We recently hosted the official opening ceremony for our Gen 10.5 facility in the City of Wuhan. This site is co-located with a large BOE plant, allowing Corning to deliver Gen 10.5 glass substrates more efficiently to our customer for its production of large-sized display panels. Gen 10.5 provides strong economics for our shareholders, while creating options to use earlier-generation fusion tanks for new applications such as automotive and cover glass.
To illustrate, remember that we launched our Gorilla Glass business back in 2007 by repurposing some of our existing fusion assets. Over time, repurposing has resulted in us avoiding more than $1 billion in capital spending.
Finally, let's look at Optical Communications. We're energized by the momentum that is building in this business. We see that momentum confirmed by multiple sources. First is network need. Demand on the network has only been increasing. Broadband usage for June was up 33% versus prepandemic levels and up 10% versus June 2020, which was a peak quarantine period. Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost 300 million, and they're on track to double that by the end of 2021 according to industry projections.
The second confirmation is customer commitments. And many of our customers are actually being quite public about their plans. We believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber to the home and hyperscale data centers.
On AT&T's earnings call last week, their CEO said that by year-end, they expect to have expanded their fiber footprint by 3 million locations, including both business and consumer customers. Deutsche Telekom's Managing Director recently shared that by 2024, they're planning to have about 10 million homes passed and 97% 5G coverage. He said, ""The expansion of high-performance networks is our top priority, whether with 5G and mobile communications or fiberoptic broadband expansion. To achieve this, we are massively increasing the investments in our network.""
And Microsoft CEO recently shared his perspective on expanding data center capacity to meet cloud demand. He said, ""Digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating, and it's just the beginning.""
Of course, the third confirmation is our order book, which is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. Here, we're seeing year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks.
During the quarter, we extended our technology and market leadership in Optical Communications by introducing new solutions that speed network deployment. We launched Corning SMF-28 Contour fiber, which offers an industry-first combination of superior bendability, compatibility with other fibers and low signal loss. We also launched EDGE Rapid Connect solutions that increase fiber density and reduce customer installation time by up to 70%.
Across our markets, you can see that our value creation model is driving growth, and the key trends are converging around our capabilities. We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth with large life-like displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that are more and more capable.
Now I'll wrap up my remarks today with one final point. I've always said that how we do things is as important as what we accomplish. So I'd like to take a moment to emphasize that we're committed to making a difference wherever we can. We're building on more than a century of honest, respectful and fair behavior. And such behavior must continuously characterize all our actions, including progress toward improving our environmental, social and governance programs. To share insight into our approach, we recently issued our annual report on diversity, equity and inclusion. And we published our first sustainability report.
On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, focused on providing value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their continued hard work. And I look forward to updating you on our progress as we build on our momentum in the second half of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter."

Now let me walk you through the key metrics and drivers of our second quarter performance. Sales increased 35% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, a strong run rate. Net income was $459 million, up 111%. And EPS was $0.53, up 112% year-over-year.
We saw continued strength across our business segments. Optical Communications delivered its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. Display Technologies was up sequentially and year-over-year and continues to experience the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. Life Sciences and Environmental outperformed their markets and grew significantly versus last year's pandemic lows.
Our margins expanded. Sequentially, gross margin improved 200 basis points to 37.8%, and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 18.3%. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin expanded 450 basis points, and operating margin expanded 710 basis points.
Now during the quarter, we continue to face supply chain disruptions and inflationary headwinds. Planning and increased output allowed us to reduce costly airfreight, but the sequential improvement was offset by increases in shipping rates and the cost of certain raw materials such as resin, a key component in our Optical and Life Sciences businesses. In total, we felt about the same 150 basis points drag on margins as in Q1.
Now while we don't expect significant improvement on the supply chain costs in the short term, we do expect them to normalize over time. And we're taking mitigating actions, including raising prices in selected product lines.
Now as is usual in the second quarter, operating expenses in dollars increased sequentially. The increase was greater than in prior years because of larger variable compensation accruals consistent with our rising outlook.
Free cash flow was $471 million, up $186 million year-over-year. Cumulative free cash flow for the first half of 2021 was $843 million. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the second half of the year and to surpass our 2020 total by a wide margin.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, second quarter sales were $939 million, up 9% sequentially and 25% versus 2020. Net income was $248 million, up 16% sequentially and 63% year-over-year.
And Q2 sequential prices increased moderately as we implemented a price increase during the quarter. For the third quarter, we are moderately increasing glass prices once again. We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this. First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters; second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels; and third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.
Now we receive a lot of questions on how pandemic has impacted the display industry. For example, will there be fewer TVs sold in 2021 or in 2022, and what's the impact on the glass market? So let me take a moment to explain our view. I'll focus on televisions since they represent about 70% of the glass market. Since LCD TVs emerged as mainstream technology in 2004, LCD television units have only been down 3x and never 2 years in a row. And annual glass demand has never declined.
Now since 2014, television units are typically range bound between 225 million and 235 million, while average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year. In 2020, global TV units increased 4% above the trend line to about 242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TVs sold probably to accommodate more people living, working and studying from home. In total, glass demand was up mid-single digits.
Now entering the year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller TVs and for normal growth of 1.5 inches in screen size to return. We now have retail data through the first half of 2021, and it is largely confirmatory.
TV units declined by mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, while average screen size growth returned to the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TVs 65 inches and larger increased over 20% and smaller televisions were down by a high single-digit percentage. 
Now consistent with math and history, the glass market grew. So halfway through the year, our expectations for TV units being down year-over-year and screen sizes growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out.
Looking ahead to 2022, we think TV units and screen sizes will continue to follow historical trends. That means TV units will be within the typical range, and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches. Now we have yet to see how the current holiday retail season plays out. So we don't have enough information to definitively comment too much on next year. But it is worth noting that TV units, which are declining this year, have never declined 2 years in a row. And next year is a World Cup year, and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year.
And finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size. We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year. Now we'll refine our views based on this year's holiday retail season, which is still in front of us, and we will keep you updated.
Let's move to Optical Communications, which continues its growth in -- with sales surpassing $1 billion, up 21% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Sales increased by a double-digit percentage in both carrier and enterprise networks sequentially and year-over-year. Net income was $148 million, up 83% year-over-year and 33% sequentially. Higher volume and better operational performance drove the improvement.
The environment is extremely favorable. Demand on networks is at an all-time high. In response, operators are expanding network capacity, capabilities and access. The pace of data centers build is accelerating, and capital spending by our customers is increasing. Governments around the world are announcing and initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband. All this points to the start of a strong sustained investment phase across the industry. We are the market leaders, and we're well positioned to capture significant growth as network investment increases.
Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency of our customers. Additionally, Corning is the only large-scale Indian manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. Our broad customer base and unquestioned technology leadership puts us squarely at the center of customer investments for fiber to the home, world broadband, 5G and hyperscale data centers.
In Environmental Technologies, second quarter results were $407 million, up 81% year-over-year but down 8% sequentially. Net income improved year-over-year to $81 million and also grew sequentially partly due to improved freight and logistics costs versus Q1.
Car-related sales increased 68% year-over-year as vehicle production has improved from pandemic lows and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. Auto markets continue to be constrained by chip shortages, which impacted our automotive sales sequentially in the second quarter.
We are monitoring end market demand and supply chain activity as we go through the second half of the year. We remain on track to build a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business ahead of our original time frame. We continue to innovate to solve our customers' most challenging problems and have recently begun to ship next-generation GPFs to help OEMs achieve even lower levels of emission.
In diesel, sales grew 101% year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of advanced aftertreatment in China and continued strength in the North American heavy-duty truck market.
Specialty Materials delivered another outstanding quarter. Following first quarter year-over-year growth of 28%, the second quarter was up 16% year-over-year with sales of $483 million.
Demand remains strong for our premium cover glass materials and IT products. During the quarter, our premium glasses and surfaces supported multiple new phone and IT launches, including 16 smartphones, along with 6 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass.
Demand also remains strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing, which are essential for deep ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. Now investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income than in 2020. As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing processes. We anticipate that profitability will improve as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization.
Life Sciences second quarter sales were $312 million, up 28% year-over-year and 4% sequentially driven by ongoing recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and continued strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Net income was $52 million, up 68% year-over-year and 8% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. So our businesses performed very well, and our markets are strong.
That said, let me take a moment to reiterate our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders.
Our first priority for use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic acquisitions. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. This year, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9% and resumed share buybacks by repurchasing and retiring 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung Display.
In closing, we had an excellent quarter. Our performance relative to both 2020 and 2019 adds to our confidence that we are on track for an outstanding year. For the third quarter, we expect core sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.54 to $0.59.
Our value creation model is working. We are pursuing opportunities that utilize capabilities from our focused and cohesive portfolio to drive growth. By repurposing and reapplying capabilities, we're increasing our probability of success, lowering our cost of innovation and becoming more capital efficient. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

Meanwhile, our revenues have grown in excess of 40%. And so that content story really plays out across really all the different device categories. So there's always a degree of mitigation of the impact of what's going on with consumer behavior any given point of time. So that's first to put in context.

The way the supply chain works is we will literally provide that part, the cover part. So both the underlying structure, the glass structures as well as the material we use to drive the composite to be able to improve the optics and durability of those cameras.
So we have built the supply chain to be able to have that roll into really the same plants that ultimately glass parts go to build phones. So we feel pretty good that we have the capability, and we've built the capability to serve the market. And so now it will be how quickly will the technology be adopted because it is new. It is a new feature for phones. It does improve camera performance pretty darn significantly. So we're hoping that, that becomes pretty rapidly adopted. 
One thing that's going to impact pacing though is when you change the light-capturing capabilities of a camera, remember that cameras are pretty complex devices, right? So you have the whole lens system, and you have different chipsets to deal with that imaging. And they're built around an optical chain that is a certain amount of light that's available, so we're actually improving that. And so as you improve that to take full advantage of it, you probably need to optimize some other components. So we do think that, though it is relatively easy, adoptable, there are things that you would need to do differently to take full advantage of this to deliver an advantaged end customer experience."

Welcome to Corning's Quarter 2 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.
I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.
You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.
In the second quarter, GAAP net income was $449 million. However, GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.42 due to the GAAP accounting treatment required for the transaction entered into with Samsung Display. Let me take you through why this was the case.
As a reminder, on April 5, 2021, Corning entered into a share repurchase agreement with Samsung Display. As part of the agreement, Samsung converted preferred stock into common stock, and Corning immediately repurchased 35 million shares of that common stock from Samsung. The common shares were then traded on the open exchange, so GAAP requires a special accounting treatment of the repurchase as an extinguishment of the original preferred shares.
The accounting treatment for an extinguishment of preferred shares is to record the difference between the repurchase price and the original book value in retained earnings. This adjustment to retained earnings is also removed from net income available to common shareholders when calculating GAAP earnings per share. Excluding this, U.S. GAAP EPS would have been $0.52.
Differences between our GAAP and core results can also stem from noncash mark-to-market gains or losses associated with hedging contracts. They were de minimis this quarter. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP values can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along, and they're also available on our website for downloading.
And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell."

Today, we reported outstanding second quarter results, and we're on track for a strong year.
Versus second quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion. EPS grew 112% to $0.53 on the higher sales and expanding margins. Free cash flow grew 65% to $471 million, with first half cash generation of $843 million. No question we're in great shape, and we see a clear growth story playing out across our businesses. Each of our 5 segments grew sales by a double-digit percentage year-over-year, ranging from 16% for Specialty Materials to 80% for Environmental Technologies.
Now of course, 2020 was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that even versus second quarter of 2019, we grew total company sales and EPS 17% and 18%, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2019, we've added more than $0.5 billion in quarterly sales. About $200 million is from Hemlock, and more than $300 million is organic growth, with about 70% of that coming from success of our More Corning content strategy and outperforming the competition.
The other 30% of organic growth is from rising with the market. In each of our market access platforms, we're addressing significant and transformational trends. We seek to drive content and expand our total addressable market by combining capabilities from our focused portfolio and prioritizing opportunities for More Corning.
Our long-term strategy is built on a complementary set of 3 core technologies, 4 proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We are leaders in each. And the synergies among them allow us to create distinctive benefits for our customers, improve the return on our investments in R&D and reduce our capital intensity.
We create breakthrough products and processes by leveraging the synergies among our core capabilities, capitalizing on insights we gain through close collaboration with our customers and taking advantage of our existing plants and pilot facilities for early-stage production. For example, over the past few years, we have created new-to-the-world products, including Ceramic Shield, tougher Gorilla Glasses, AutoGrade glass, Valor drug packaging, Gen 10.5 display glass and innovative passive optical solutions that are dramatically increasing the ease and cost efficiency of network deployments.
But we're not just creators. We're also builders. We do the manufacturing ourselves using processes that we invent and proprietary equipment that we design and build. When growth opportunities arise and demand exceeds our existing capacity, we build state-of-the-art plants to manufacture products at scale. And we locate these plants in close proximity to our customers, a strategy that is likely to continue to pay off in a post-pandemic world.
We derisk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers, often including funding before beginning construction. We last detailed our build investments with you in 2019 when we described our focus, create, build, extend value creation cycle. We pointed out how our build projects were directly responding to customer needs and commitments.
We knew that carriers like AT&T and Verizon would need more fiber to densify their networks for 5G. We knew that BOE would need glass for its Gen 10.5 panels, that car companies would need gasoline particulate filters to meet new regulations, that biotech companies would need high-density cell culture to support gene therapy and that smartphone OEMs would need increasingly durable scratch-resistant cover glass as they design thinner phones and bigger cameras.
We told you these build projects would increase our capacity to meet committed demand and that as we delivered on that demand, they would increase our revenue and generate excellent returns.
We are delivering. Today, the build projects we undertook from 2016 to 2019 are collectively delivering return on invested capital above 20%. They've helped us increase our sales run rate from $10 billion in 2015 and 2016 to our current run rate of $14 billion. And they've helped us improve total company ROIC by 3 percentage points.
Importantly, each time we build, we increase our scale, and we enhance the opportunity to extend our leadership and create new innovations. And because we're constantly improving our productivity and capabilities, we can often manufacture these innovations and drive revenue growth without building new facilities. Now we actually spend most of our time in this extend part of the cycle. It's where we are today. In this phase, we keep creating and extending until we're so successful that demand exceeds our capacity.
As we reapply our insights and repurpose our assets, our best-in-the-world capabilities just keep getting better. Every time we pursue an adjacent opportunity, we explore new combinations of capabilities. We push the boundaries in areas where we already lead, and we cross-train our people in deep and important ways. In other words, we've created a positive feedback loop that expands our knowledge, increases the relevance of our capabilities and enhances our value to customers. And this directly fuels our content strategy. We aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying.
With that in mind, let's look at some of the initiatives we're advancing across our market-access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. We capture growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices.
In the quarter, consistent with our strategy to obtain customer commitments in support of build initiatives, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to help expand our manufacturing capacity in the United States and to support our R&D. To date, we've received $495 million in total from Apple's fund.
We've also launched another chapter in our More Corning strategy with an important application of our capabilities to enhance the optics of smartphone cameras, which is a new category for us. The social media experience is centered around photos. Device designers are adding cameras and increasing lens size. They're also integrating more advanced capabilities such as telephoto, wide-angle lenses and infrared sensors.
These features naturally increase the prominence of the lens surface area, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of scratches and damage, until Corning. Just last week, we announced Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ for mobile phone cameras. Our DX family increases image quality and camera durability by providing a composite glass material that combines low reflection with scratch resistance approaching sapphire. Samsung is the first adopter.
Turning to automotive. OEMs are designing cleaner and safer vehicles with technology that enhances the driving experience. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. We're pursuing $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, precision-glass products and auto-glass solutions.
And we recently entered a new product category in automotive, Curved Mirror Solutions. Our solutions are enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai's new electric crossover, the IONIQ 5. The system essentially turns the windshield into a display screen, letting drivers keep their eyes on the road while assessing navigation and speed information directly in their line of sight. Additionally, a new generation of gasoline particulate filters is helping us on our way to surpassing $500 million in annual GPF sales well ahead of our original time frame.
Turning to Life Sciences. We're delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. Our inventions are helping advance the transition to cell and gene therapies. And we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in the pharmaceutical packaging market.
In the second quarter, we further increased Valor production capacity and secured additional customer wins. We worked with Thermo Fisher and OPTIMA pharma to demonstrate solutions that increase vial-filling speed by nearly 70%, thereby alleviating a critical bottleneck in the medical supply chain. Our collaboration features a combination of Corning's Valor vials and OPTIMA's ultra-high-speed fill-and-finish solutions. Thermo Fisher called the results ""a game-changer in their ability to serve patients.""
Turning to Display. We've experienced the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade, and we announced a second moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices. Stepping back, we're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to enhance our leadership position.
Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. The market for large-sized TVs is expected and projected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2024. And Gen 10.5 glass provides the most economical approach for larger sets.
We recently hosted the official opening ceremony for our Gen 10.5 facility in the City of Wuhan. This site is co-located with a large BOE plant, allowing Corning to deliver Gen 10.5 glass substrates more efficiently to our customer for its production of large-sized display panels. Gen 10.5 provides strong economics for our shareholders while creating options to use earlier-generation fusion tanks for new applications such as automotive and cover glass.
To illustrate, remember that we launched our Gorilla Glass business back in 2007 by repurposing some of our existing fusion assets. Over time, repurposing has resulted in us avoiding more than $1 billion in capital spending.
Finally, let's look at Optical Communications. We're energized by the momentum that is building in this business. We see that momentum confirmed by multiple sources. First is network need. Demand on the network has only been increasing. Broadband usage for June was up 33% versus pre-pandemic levels and up 10% versus June 2020, which was a peak quarantine period. Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost 300 million, and they're on track to double that by the end of 2021 according to industry projections.
The second confirmation is customer commitments. And many of our customers are actually being quite public about their plans. We believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data centers.
On AT&T's earnings call last week, their CEO said that by year-end, they expect to have expanded their fiber footprint by 3 million locations, including both business and consumer customers. Deutsche Telekom's Managing Director recently shared that by 2024, they're planning to have about 10 million homes passed and 97% 5G coverage. He said, ""The expansion of high-performance networks is our top priority, whether with 5G and mobile communications or fiberoptic broadband expansion. To achieve this, we are massively increasing the investments in our network."" And Microsoft's CEO recently shared his perspective on expanding data center capacity to meet cloud demand. He said, ""Digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating, and it's just the beginning."" 
Of course, the third confirmation is our order book, which is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. Here, we're seeing year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks.
During the quarter, we extended our technology and market leadership in optical communications by introducing new solutions that speed network deployment. We launched Corning SMF-28 Contour fiber, which offers an industry-first combination of superior bendability, compatibility with other fibers and low signal loss. We also launched EDGE Rapid Connect solutions that increase fiber density and reduce customer installation time by up to 70%.
Across our markets, you can see that our value-creation model is driving growth, and the key trends are converging around our capabilities. We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth with large life-like displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that are more and more capable.
Now I'll wrap up my remarks today with one final point. I've always said that how we do things is as important as what we accomplish. So I'd like to take a moment to emphasize that we're committed to making a difference wherever we can. We're building on more than a century of honest, respectful and fair behavior. And such behavior must continuously characterize all our actions, including progress toward improving our environmental, social and governance programs. To share insight into our approach, we recently issued our annual report on diversity, equity and inclusion. And we published our first sustainability report.
On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, focused on providing value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their continued hard work. And I look forward to updating you on our progress as we build on our momentum in the second half of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter."
173840,1672695586,2386095,"Corning Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone.

As Wendell said, we are on track for a strong year.
Second quarter results were outstanding. We added almost $1 billion in sales year-over-year, $0.5 billion in sales over pre-pandemic levels, and we generated significant operating and free cash flow. We also improved margins both sequentially and year-over-year, which contributed to our strong EPS. Across the board, our progress has been very positive. In particular, pre-pandemic comparisons highlight our strength. We are confident this momentum will continue.
In all our markets, Corning's unique capabilities put us at the center of a substantial growth trend, while our content strategy drives outperformance. And we have a highly effective value-creation model in place to deliver profitable growth and create shareholder value.
Now let me walk you through the key metrics and drivers of our second quarter performance. Sales increased 35% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, a strong run rate. Net income was $459 million, up 111%. And EPS was $0.53, up 112% year-over-year.
We saw continued strength across our business segments. Optical Communications delivered its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. Display Technologies was up sequentially and year-over-year and continues to experience the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. Life Sciences and Environmental outperformed their markets and grew significantly versus last year's pandemic lows.
Our margins expanded. Sequentially, gross margin improved 200 basis points to 37.8%, and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 18.3%. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin expanded 450 basis points, and operating margin expanded 710 basis points.
Now during the quarter, we continue to face supply chain disruptions and inflationary headwinds. Planning and increased output allowed us to reduce costly airfreight, but the sequential improvement was offset by increases in shipping rates and the cost of certain raw materials such as resin, a key component in our Optical and Life Sciences businesses. In total, we felt about the same 150 basis points drag on margins as in Q1.
Now while we don't expect significant improvement on the supply chain costs in the short term, we do expect them to normalize over time. And we're taking mitigating actions, including raising prices in selected product lines.
Now as is usual in the second quarter, operating expenses in dollars increased sequentially. The increase was greater than in prior years because of larger variable compensation accruals consistent with our rising outlook.
Free cash flow was $471 million, up $186 million year-over-year. Cumulative free cash flow for the first half of 2021 was $843 million. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the second half of the year and to surpass our 2020 total by a wide margin.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, second quarter sales were $939 million, up 9% sequentially and 25% versus 2020. Net income was $248 million, up 16% sequentially and 63% year-over-year.
And Q2 sequential prices increased moderately as we implemented a price increase during the quarter. For the third quarter, we are moderately increasing glass prices once again. We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this: First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.
Now we receive a lot of questions on how pandemic has impacted the display industry. For example, will there be fewer TVs sold in 2021 or in 2022, and what's the impact on the glass market? So let me take a moment to explain our view. I'll focus on televisions since they represent about 70% of the glass market. Since LCD TVs emerged as mainstream technology in 2004, LCD television units have only been down 3x and never 2 years in a row. And annual glass demand has never declined.
Now since 2014, television [indiscernible] units are typically range-bound between 225 million and 235 million, while average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year. In 2020, global TV units increased 4% above the trend line to about 242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TV is sold probably to accommodate more people living, working and studying from home. In total, glass demand was up mid-single-digits.
Now entering the year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller TVs and for normal growth of 1.5 inches in screen size to return. We now have retail data through the first half of 2021, and it is largely confirmatory.
TV units declined by mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, while average screen size growth returned to the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TVs 65 inches and larger increased over 20% and smaller televisions were down by a high single-digit percentage. 
Now consistent with math and history, the glass market grew. So halfway through the year, our expectations for TV units being down year-over-year and screen size growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out.
Looking ahead to 2022, we think TV units and screen sizes will continue to follow historical trends. That means TV units will be within the typical range, and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches. Now we have yet to see how the current holiday retail season plays out, so we don't have enough information to definitively comment too much on next year. But it is worth noting that TV units, which are declining this year, have never declined 2 years in a row. And next year is a World Cup year, and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year.
And finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size. We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year. Now we'll refine our views based on this year's holiday retail season, which is still in front of us, and we will keep you updated.
Let's move to Optical Communications, which continues its growth in -- with sales surpassing $1 billion, up 21% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Sales increased by a double-digit percentage in both carrier and enterprise networks sequentially and year-over-year. Net income was $148 million, up 83% year-over-year and 33% sequentially. Higher volume and better operational performance drove the improvement.
The environment is extremely favorable. Demand on networks is at an all-time high. In response, operators are expanding network capacity, capabilities and access. The pace of data centers build is accelerating, and capital spending by our customers is increasing. Governments around the world are announcing and initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband. All this points to the start of a strong sustained investment phase across the industry. We are the market leaders, and we're well positioned to capture significant growth as network investment increases.
Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency of [indiscernible]. Additionally, Corning is the only large-scale Indian manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. Our broad customer base and unquestioned technology leadership puts us squarely at the center of customer investments for fiber-to-the-home, rural broadband, 5G and hyperscale data centers.
In Environmental Technologies, second quarter results were $407 million, up 81% year-over-year but down 8% sequentially. Net income improved year-over-year to $81 million and also grew sequentially partly due to improved freight and logistics costs versus Q1.
Car-related sales increased 68% year-over-year as vehicle production has improved from pandemic lows and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. Auto markets continue to be constrained by chip shortages, which impacted our automotive sales sequentially in the second quarter. We are monitoring end-market demand and supply chain activity as we go through the second half of the year. We remain on track to build a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business ahead of our original time frame. We continue to innovate to solve our customers' most challenging problems and have recently begun to ship next-generation GPFs to help OEMs achieve even lower levels of emission.
In diesel, sales grew 101% year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of advanced aftertreatment in China and continued strength in the North American heavy-duty truck market.
Specialty Materials delivered another outstanding quarter. Following first quarter year-over-year growth of 28%, the second quarter was up 16% year-over-year with sales of $483 million.
Demand remains strong for our premium cover glass materials and IT products. During the quarter, our premium glasses and surfaces supported multiple new phone and IT launches, including 16 smartphones, along with 6 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass.
Demand also remains strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing, which are essential for deep ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. Now investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income than in 2020. As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing processes. We anticipate that profitability will improve as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization.
Life Sciences second quarter sales were $312 million, up 28% year-over-year and 4% sequentially driven by ongoing recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and continued strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Net income was $52 million, up 68% year-over-year and 8% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. So our businesses performed very well, and our markets are strong.
That said, let me take a moment to reiterate our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders.
Our first priority for use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic acquisitions. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. This year, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9% and resumed share buybacks by repurchasing and retiring 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung Display.
In closing, we had an excellent quarter. Our performance relative to both 2020 and 2019 adds to our confidence that we are on track for an outstanding year. For the third quarter, we expect core sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.54 to $0.59.
Our value creation model is working. We are pursuing opportunities that utilize capabilities from our focused and cohesive portfolio to drive growth. By repurposing and reapplying capabilities, we're increasing our probability of success, lowering our cost of innovation and becoming more capital efficient. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

So there's always a degree of mitigation of the impact of what's going on with consumer behavior any given point of time. So that's first to put in context.
Rolling forward, what we've tried to do is place that range of outcomes of consumer behavior into our guides and into the way in which we're thinking about and planning our business in the near term.

As we look out to next year, we'd expect to be back on the trend line that we had previously been on.
And just a reminder that TV units haven't been down 2 years in a row, haven't been down in a World Cup year.

We're quite excited about this opportunity as well. So thanks for calling it out. The way the supply chain works is we will literally provide that part -- that cover part, so both the underlying structure, the glass structures as well as the material we use to drive the composite to be able to improve the optics and durability of those cameras.
So we have built the supply chain to be able to have that roll into really the same plants that ultimately glass parts go to build phones. So we feel pretty good that we have the capability, and we've built the capability to serve the market. And so now it will be how quickly will the technology be adopted because it is new. It is a new feature for phones. It does improve camera performance pretty darn significantly. So we're hoping that that becomes pretty rapidly adopted. 
One thing that's going to impact pacing though is when you change the light-capturing capabilities of a camera, remember that cameras are pretty complex devices, right? So you have the whole lens system, and you have different chipsets to deal with that imaging. And they're built around an optical chain that is a certain amount of light that's available, so we're actually improving that. And so as you improve that to take full advantage of it, you probably need to optimize some other components.

Welcome to Corning's Quarter 2 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.
I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.
You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.
In the second quarter, GAAP net income was $449 million. However, GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.42 due to the GAAP accounting treatment required for the transaction entered into with Samsung Display. Let me take you through why this was the case.
As a reminder, on April 5, 2021, Corning entered into a share repurchase agreement with Samsung Display. As part of the agreement, Samsung converted preferred stock into common stock, and Corning immediately repurchased 35 million shares of that common stock from Samsung. The common shares were then traded on the open exchange, so GAAP requires a special accounting treatment of the repurchase as an extinguishment of the original preferred shares.
The accounting treatment for an extinguishment of preferred shares is to record the difference between the repurchase price and the original book value in retained earnings. This adjustment to retained earnings is also removed from net income available to common shareholders when calculating GAAP earnings per share. Excluding this, U.S. GAAP EPS would have been $0.52.
Differences between our GAAP and core results can also stem from noncash mark-to-market gains or losses associated with hedging contracts. They were de minimis this quarter. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP values can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along, and they're also available on our website for downloading.
And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell."

Today, we reported outstanding second quarter results, and we're on track for a strong year.Versus second quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion. EPS grew 112% to $0.53 on the higher sales and expanding",2117,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported outstanding second quarter results, and we're on track for a strong year.
Versus second quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion. EPS grew 112% to $0.53 on the higher sales and expanding margins. Free cash flow grew 65% to $471 million, with first half cash generation of $843 million. No question we're in great shape, and we see a clear growth story playing out across our businesses. Each of our 5 segments grew sales by a double-digit percentage year-over-year, ranging from 16% for Specialty Materials to 80% for Environmental Technologies.
Now of course, 2020 was an easy compare. So I think it's worth noting that even versus second quarter of 2019, we grew total company sales and EPS 17% and 18%, respectively. Since the second quarter of 2019, we've added more than $0.5 billion in quarterly sales. About $200 million is from Hemlock, and more than $300 million is organic growth, with about 70% of that coming from success of our More Corning content strategy and outperforming the competition.
The other 30% of organic growth is from rising with the market. In each of our market access platforms, we're addressing significant and transformational trends. We seek to drive content and expand our total addressable market by combining capabilities from our focused portfolio and prioritizing opportunities for More Corning.
Our long-term strategy is built on a complementary set of 3 core technologies, 4 proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We are leaders in each. And the synergies among them allow us to create distinctive benefits for our customers, improve the return on our investments in R&D and reduce our capital intensity.
We create breakthrough products and processes by leveraging the synergies among our core capabilities, capitalizing on insights we gain through close collaboration with our customers and taking advantage of our existing plants and pilot facilities for early-stage production. For example, over the past few years, we have created new-to-the-world products, including Ceramic Shield, tougher Gorilla Glasses, AutoGrade glass, Valor drug packaging, Gen 10.5 display glass and innovative passive optical solutions that are dramatically increasing the ease and cost efficiency of network deployments.
But we're not just creators. We're also builders. We do the manufacturing ourselves using processes that we invent and proprietary equipment that we design and build. When growth opportunities arise and demand exceeds our existing capacity, we build state-of-the-art plants to manufacture products at scale. And we locate these plants in close proximity to our customers, a strategy that is likely to continue to pay off in a post-pandemic world.
We derisk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers, often including funding before beginning construction. We last detailed our build investments with you in 2019 when we described our focus, create, build, extend value creation cycle. We pointed out how our build projects were directly responding to customer needs and commitments.
We knew that carriers like AT&T and Verizon would need more fiber to densify their networks for 5G. We knew that BOE would need glass for its Gen 10.5 panels, that car companies would need gasoline particulate filters to meet new regulations, that biotech companies would need high-density cell culture to support gene therapy and that smartphone OEMs would need increasingly durable scratch-resistant cover glass as they design thinner phones and bigger cameras.
We told you these build projects would increase our capacity to meet committed demand and that as we delivered on that demand, they would increase our revenue and generate excellent returns.
We are delivering. Today, the build projects we undertook from 2016 to 2019 are collectively delivering return on invested capital above 20%. They've helped us increase our sales run rate from $10 billion in 2015 and 2016 to our current run rate of $14 billion. And they've helped us improve total company ROIC by 3 percentage points.
Importantly, each time we build, we increase our scale, and we enhance the opportunity to extend our leadership and create new innovations. And because we're constantly improving our productivity and capabilities, we can often manufacture these innovations and drive revenue growth without building new facilities. Now we actually spend most of our time in this extend part of the cycle. It's where we are today. In this phase, we keep creating and extending until we're so successful that demand exceeds our capacity.
As we reapply our insights and repurpose our assets, our best-in-the-world capabilities just keep getting better. Every time we pursue an adjacent opportunity, we explore new combinations of capabilities. We push the boundaries in areas where we already lead, and we cross-train our people in deep and important ways. In other words, we've created a positive feedback loop that expands our knowledge, increases the relevance of our capabilities and enhances our value to customers. And this directly fuels our content strategy. We aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying.
With that in mind, let's look at some of the initiatives we're advancing across our market-access platforms. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. We capture growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices.
In the quarter, consistent with our strategy to obtain customer commitments in support of build initiatives, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to help expand our manufacturing capacity in the United States and to support our R&D. To date, we've received $495 million in total from Apple's fund.
We've also launched another chapter in our More Corning strategy with an important application of our capabilities to enhance the optics of smartphone cameras, which is a new category for us. The social media experience is centered around photos. Device designers are adding cameras and increasing lens size. They're also integrating more advanced capabilities such as telephoto, wide-angle lenses and infrared sensors.
These features naturally increase the prominence of the lens surface area, which, in turn, increases the likelihood of scratches and damage, until Corning. Just last week, we announced Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ for mobile phone cameras. Our DX family increases image quality and camera durability by providing a composite glass material that combines low reflection with scratch resistance approaching sapphire. Samsung is the first adopter.
Turning to automotive. OEMs are designing cleaner and safer vehicles with technology that enhances the driving experience. We're uniquely suited to address these trends. We're pursuing $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, precision-glass products and auto-glass solutions.
And we recently entered a new product category in automotive, Curved Mirror Solutions. Our solutions are enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai's new electric crossover, the IONIQ 5. The system essentially turns the windshield into a display screen, letting drivers keep their eyes on the road while assessing navigation and speed information directly in their line of sight. Additionally, a new generation of gasoline particulate filters is helping us on our way to surpassing $500 million in annual GPF sales well ahead of our original time frame.
Turning to Life Sciences. We're delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. Our inventions are helping advance the transition to cell and gene therapies. And we're making significant strides toward building a Valor Glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in the pharmaceutical packaging market.
In the second quarter, we further increased Valor production capacity and secured additional customer wins. We worked with Thermo Fisher and OPTIMA pharma to demonstrate solutions that increase vial-filling speed by nearly 70%, thereby alleviating a critical bottleneck in the medical supply chain. Our collaboration features a combination of Corning's Valor vials and OPTIMA's ultra-high-speed fill-and-finish solutions. Thermo Fisher called the results ""a game-changer in their ability to serve patients.""
Turning to Display. We've experienced the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade, and we announced a second moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices. Stepping back, we're the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to enhance our leadership position.
Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. The market for large-sized TVs is expected and projected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2024. And Gen 10.5 glass provides the most economical approach for larger sets.
We recently hosted the official opening ceremony for our Gen 10.5 facility in the City of Wuhan. This site is co-located with a large BOE plant, allowing Corning to deliver Gen 10.5 glass substrates more efficiently to our customer for its production of large-sized display panels. Gen 10.5 provides strong economics for our shareholders while creating options to use earlier-generation fusion tanks for new applications such as automotive and cover glass.
To illustrate, remember that we launched our Gorilla Glass business back in 2007 by repurposing some of our existing fusion assets. Over time, repurposing has resulted in us avoiding more than $1 billion in capital spending.
Finally, let's look at Optical Communications. We're energized by the momentum that is building in this business. We see that momentum confirmed by multiple sources. First is network need. Demand on the network has only been increasing. Broadband usage for June was up 33% versus pre-pandemic levels and up 10% versus June 2020, which was a peak quarantine period. Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost 300 million, and they're on track to double that by the end of 2021 according to industry projections.
The second confirmation is customer commitments. And many of our customers are actually being quite public about their plans. We believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data centers.
On AT&T's earnings call last week, their CEO said that by year-end, they expect to have expanded their fiber footprint by 3 million locations, including both business and consumer customers. Deutsche Telekom's Managing Director recently shared that by 2024, they're planning to have about 10 million homes passed and 97% 5G coverage. He said, ""The expansion of high-performance networks is our top priority, whether with 5G and mobile communications or fiberoptic broadband expansion. To achieve this, we are massively increasing the investments in our network."" And Microsoft's CEO recently shared his perspective on expanding data center capacity to meet cloud demand. He said, ""Digital adoption curves aren't slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating, and it's just the beginning."" 
Of course, the third confirmation is our order book, which is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. Here, we're seeing year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks.
During the quarter, we extended our technology and market leadership in optical communications by introducing new solutions that speed network deployment. We launched Corning SMF-28 Contour fiber, which offers an industry-first combination of superior bendability, compatibility with other fibers and low signal loss. We also launched EDGE Rapid Connect solutions that increase fiber density and reduce customer installation time by up to 70%.
Across our markets, you can see that our value-creation model is driving growth, and the key trends are converging around our capabilities. We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth with large life-like displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that are more and more capable.
Now I'll wrap up my remarks today with one final point. I've always said that how we do things is as important as what we accomplish. So I'd like to take a moment to emphasize that we're committed to making a difference wherever we can. We're building on more than a century of honest, respectful and fair behavior. And such behavior must continuously characterize all our actions, including progress toward improving our environmental, social and governance programs. To share insight into our approach, we recently issued our annual report on diversity, equity and inclusion. And we published our first sustainability report.
On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, focused on providing value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank our incredibly dedicated employees around the world for their continued hard work. And I look forward to updating you on our progress as we build on our momentum in the second half of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insight on the quarter."
173840,1672695586,2386098,"Corning Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Corning Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone.

We added almost $1 billion in sales year-over-year, $0.5 billion in sales over pre-pandemic levels, and we genera",1869,"Thank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. As Wendell said, we are on track for a strong year.
Second quarter results were outstanding. We added almost $1 billion in sales year-over-year, $0.5 billion in sales over pre-pandemic levels, and we generated significant operating and free cash flow. We also improved margins both sequentially and year-over-year, which contributed to our strong EPS. Across the board, our progress has been very positive. In particular, pre-pandemic comparisons highlight our strength. We are confident this momentum will continue.
In all our markets, Corning's unique capabilities put us at the center of a substantial growth trend, while our content strategy drives outperformance. And we have a highly effective value-creation model in place to deliver profitable growth and create shareholder value.
Now let me walk you through the key metrics and drivers of our second quarter performance. Sales increased 35% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, a strong run rate. Net income was $459 million, up 111%. And EPS was $0.53, up 112% year-over-year.
We saw continued strength across our business segments. Optical Communications delivered its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, and we expect to see that trend continue. Display Technologies was up sequentially and year-over-year and continues to experience the most favorable pricing environment in more than a decade. Life Sciences and Environmental outperformed their markets and grew significantly versus last year's pandemic lows.
Our margins expanded. Sequentially, gross margin improved 200 basis points to 37.8%, and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 18.3%. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin expanded 450 basis points, and operating margin expanded 710 basis points.
Now during the quarter, we continue to face supply chain disruptions and inflationary headwinds. Planning and increased output allowed us to reduce costly airfreight, but the sequential improvement was offset by increases in shipping rates and the cost of certain raw materials such as resin, a key component in our Optical and Life Sciences businesses. In total, we felt about the same 150 basis points drag on margins as in Q1.
Now while we don't expect significant improvement on the supply chain costs in the short term, we do expect them to normalize over time. And we're taking mitigating actions, including raising prices in selected product lines.
Now as is usual in the second quarter, operating expenses in dollars increased sequentially. The increase was greater than in prior years because of larger variable compensation accruals consistent with our rising outlook.
Free cash flow was $471 million, up $186 million year-over-year. Cumulative free cash flow for the first half of 2021 was $843 million. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the second half of the year and to surpass our 2020 total by a wide margin.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses. In Display Technologies, second quarter sales were $939 million, up 9% sequentially and 25% versus 2020. Net income was $248 million, up 16% sequentially and 63% year-over-year.
And Q2 sequential prices increased moderately as we implemented a price increase during the quarter. For the third quarter, we are moderately increasing glass prices once again. We believe the pricing environment will remain favorable going forward. Three factors will continue to drive this: First, we expect glass supply to remain short to tight in the upcoming quarters. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.
Now we receive a lot of questions on how pandemic has impacted the display industry. For example, will there be fewer TVs sold in 2021 or in 2022, and what's the impact on the glass market? So let me take a moment to explain our view. I'll focus on televisions since they represent about 70% of the glass market. Since LCD TVs emerged as mainstream technology in 2004, LCD television units have only been down 3x and never 2 years in a row. And annual glass demand has never declined.
Now since 2014, television [indiscernible] units are typically range-bound between 225 million and 235 million, while average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year. In 2020, global TV units increased 4% above the trend line to about 242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TV is sold probably to accommodate more people living, working and studying from home. In total, glass demand was up mid-single-digits.
Now entering the year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller TVs and for normal growth of 1.5 inches in screen size to return. We now have retail data through the first half of 2021, and it is largely confirmatory.
TV units declined by mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, while average screen size growth returned to the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TVs 65 inches and larger increased over 20% and smaller televisions were down by a high single-digit percentage. 
Now consistent with math and history, the glass market grew. So halfway through the year, our expectations for TV units being down year-over-year and screen size growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out.
Looking ahead to 2022, we think TV units and screen sizes will continue to follow historical trends. That means TV units will be within the typical range, and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches. Now we have yet to see how the current holiday retail season plays out, so we don't have enough information to definitively comment too much on next year. But it is worth noting that TV units, which are declining this year, have never declined 2 years in a row. And next year is a World Cup year, and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year.
And finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size. We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year. Now we'll refine our views based on this year's holiday retail season, which is still in front of us, and we will keep you updated.
Let's move to Optical Communications, which continues its growth in -- with sales surpassing $1 billion, up 21% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Sales increased by a double-digit percentage in both carrier and enterprise networks sequentially and year-over-year. Net income was $148 million, up 83% year-over-year and 33% sequentially. Higher volume and better operational performance drove the improvement.
The environment is extremely favorable. Demand on networks is at an all-time high. In response, operators are expanding network capacity, capabilities and access. The pace of data centers build is accelerating, and capital spending by our customers is increasing. Governments around the world are announcing and initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband. All this points to the start of a strong sustained investment phase across the industry. We are the market leaders, and we're well positioned to capture significant growth as network investment increases.
Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency of [indiscernible]. Additionally, Corning is the only large-scale Indian manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. Our broad customer base and unquestioned technology leadership puts us squarely at the center of customer investments for fiber-to-the-home, rural broadband, 5G and hyperscale data centers.
In Environmental Technologies, second quarter results were $407 million, up 81% year-over-year but down 8% sequentially. Net income improved year-over-year to $81 million and also grew sequentially partly due to improved freight and logistics costs versus Q1.
Car-related sales increased 68% year-over-year as vehicle production has improved from pandemic lows and GPF adoption continued in Europe and China. Auto markets continue to be constrained by chip shortages, which impacted our automotive sales sequentially in the second quarter. We are monitoring end-market demand and supply chain activity as we go through the second half of the year. We remain on track to build a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business ahead of our original time frame. We continue to innovate to solve our customers' most challenging problems and have recently begun to ship next-generation GPFs to help OEMs achieve even lower levels of emission.
In diesel, sales grew 101% year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of advanced aftertreatment in China and continued strength in the North American heavy-duty truck market.
Specialty Materials delivered another outstanding quarter. Following first quarter year-over-year growth of 28%, the second quarter was up 16% year-over-year with sales of $483 million.
Demand remains strong for our premium cover glass materials and IT products. During the quarter, our premium glasses and surfaces supported multiple new phone and IT launches, including 16 smartphones, along with 6 laptops and tablets featuring Gorilla Glass.
Demand also remains strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing, which are essential for deep ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet or EUV lithography. Now investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income than in 2020. As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing processes. We anticipate that profitability will improve as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization.
Life Sciences second quarter sales were $312 million, up 28% year-over-year and 4% sequentially driven by ongoing recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and continued strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Net income was $52 million, up 68% year-over-year and 8% sequentially driven by the higher sales and solid operating performance. So our businesses performed very well, and our markets are strong.
That said, let me take a moment to reiterate our commitment to financial stewardship and capital allocation. Our fundamental approach remains the same. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We generate very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue going forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership and reward shareholders.
Our first priority for use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership. We do this through RD&E investments, capital spending and strategic acquisitions. Our next priority is to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. This year, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9% and resumed share buybacks by repurchasing and retiring 4% of our outstanding common shares from Samsung Display.
In closing, we had an excellent quarter. Our performance relative to both 2020 and 2019 adds to our confidence that we are on track for an outstanding year. For the third quarter, we expect core sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, and we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.54 to $0.59.
Our value creation model is working. We are pursuing opportunities that utilize capabilities from our focused and cohesive portfolio to drive growth. By repurposing and reapplying capabilities, we're increasing our probability of success, lowering our cost of innovation and becoming more capital efficient. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year goes on.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

I think, Mehdi, the way we always think about this is what really matters over time is what happens in the end consumer demand. And where the channels go in any given quarter will, of course, make a difference in any quarterly number, but what we're really focused on is the longer-term trend there. And as I pointed out is that we expect that coming into the year for TV units to be down and for screen size to grow the 1.5 inches. And at least halfway through the year, that's what we're seeing. As we look out to next year, we'd expect to be back on the trend line that we had previously been on.
And just a reminder that TV units haven't been down 2 years in a row, haven't been down in a World Cup year. And what really drives the growth is the screen size growth, and we expect that to be up 1.5 inches. So what we need to do is actually get through the big selling season, and then we'll have more insights once we do that."

The way the supply chain works is we will literally provide that part -- that cover part, so both the underlying structure, the glass structures as well as the material we use to drive the composite to be able to improve the optics and durability of those cameras.
So we have built the supply chain to be able to have that roll into really the same plants that ultimately glass parts go to build phones. So we feel pretty good that we have the capability, and we've built the capability to serve the market. And so now it will be how quickly will the technology be adopted because it is new. It is a new feature for phones. It does improve camera performance pretty darn significantly. So we're hoping that that becomes pretty rapidly adopted. 
One thing that's going to impact pacing though is when you change the light-capturing capabilities of a camera, remember that cameras are pretty complex devices, right? So you have the whole lens system, and you have different chipsets to deal with that imaging. And they're built around an optical chain that is a certain amount of light that's available, so we're actually improving that. And so as you improve that to take full advantage of it, you probably need to optimize some other components. So we do think that, though it is relatively easy, adoptable, there are things that you would need to do differently to take full advantage of this to deliver an advantaged end customer experience."

Welcome to Corning's Quarter 3 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. 
You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. 
For the third quarter, the largest differences between our GAAP and core results stemmed from noncash mark-to-market losses associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and noncash impairment charges. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. 
For us, this decreased GAAP earnings in Q3 by $16 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. 
Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received more than $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell."

Today, we reported strong third quarter results that continue a year of outstanding sales growth, margin expansion and significant cash generation. Sales grew 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, a new all-time high. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year to 38.3%. EPS grew 30% year-over-year to $0.56. And free cash flow of $0.5 billion brought cumulative free cash generation for the first 9 months of 2021 to $1.3 billion. Our outstanding results in this period of global disruption are due to excellent execution at all levels of the company. And driven by a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities that we're capturing through our innovations and broad market access, as we strengthen our commercial relationships and scale operations to meet demand. 
Like everyone, we're dealing with numerous factors caused by the pandemic and the resulting inflation. In this quarter, the largest macro impact was constraints in the automotive industry, stemming from chip and component challenges. Auto production in the third quarter is estimated to be down nearly 20% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As a result, we stepped down in light-duty sales. Across our businesses, we prioritized delivering for our customers in a complex inflationary environment, and we have delivered despite incurring extra costs. 
Now we're taking additional actions, including pricing, to address these costs and maintain our ability to invest and support our customers. And you'll hear more from Tony on this in just a few minutes. 
Against this backdrop, we feel really good about our performance. In the quarter, announcements with industry leaders illustrated the power of our portfolio, demonstrating not only our relevance across multiple markets but also our role as a key innovation partner. Our strong position stems from a complementary set of 3 core technologies for proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We're leaders in each. We generate growth opportunities by delivering combinations and new applications of these capabilities to help our customers to drive their industries forward. And in doing so, we drive more Corning content into the products people are already buying. 
Let me share some highlights from the quarter. In Optical Communications, the industry is in the early innings of large deployments in support of 5G, broadband and the cloud. Momentum is building, and we see it confirm high multiple sources. First is network need.  Demand on networks is significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Broadband usage for September was up 32% versus pre-pandemic  levels and up 9% on versus September 2020, when remote work and school were largely in play. 
Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost $0.5 billion this year. More applications are moving to the cloud and global data creation is expected to grow at 23% compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2025. Versus 2020, cloud revenue industry-wide is up nearly 50%. The second confirmation of strong industry momentum can be seen in the announcements from leading companies. On AT&T's earnings call last week, their CEO said they're on a march to deploy fiber at scale. We are working toward passing 5 million homes per year. 
In the quarter, we announced a strategic investment to support their growth plans. Speaking about our expanded collaboration. AT&T said the expansion of fiber infrastructure is central to the growth of broadband reach for consumers as well as business customers. France recently shared that they plan to reach 10 million more homes with fiber by the end of 2025 with their CEO saying, ""Our future is fiber."" 
Cloud deployments are also expanding Microsoft CEO said that over the past year, they've added new data center clusters in 15 countries across 5 continents in support of their cloud business. The third confirmation is our substantial increase in sales and continued order book momentum. This is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. 
We are full. We are ramping capacity and we are energized. Across the business, we're driving strong year-over-year is growth, and we're outperforming the optical market as we continue to commercialize innovations that extend our competitive advantage. And as we provide more solutions to more customers at both the regional and national levels. 
During the quarter, we introduced the newest additions to our Evolv portfolio, which includes solutions designed to support real deployments. We also introduced our Everon millimeter wave indoor small cell systems, which deliver 5G-ready coverage in high-density environments, including office buildings, factories, hotels, hospitals and classrooms. 
Let's turn to mobile consumer electronics. Here, we're helping transform the smartphone experience. As we help our customers deliver new value to their users, we drive more of our content into each device sold. I displayed out well during the quarter with the launch of Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3. Both devices feature Gorilla Glass Victus. Now they also utilize our new Gorilla Glass with DX on the lenses of the rear cameras. This is more Corning and action. We've expanded our capabilities into a new category, device cameras.  Even though the lens is a fraction of the surface area we address with our cover materials. The value we add is high, and we're capturing a very attractive opportunity to increase our revenue per device. Samsung is also featuring Gorilla Glass with DX on the new Galaxy Watch 4. 
Turning to automotive. OEMs are designing cleaner, safer vehicles and distinguishing themselves with technologies that enhance the driving experience. Corning is uniquely sued to address these trends. And we're pursuing $100 per car content opportunity across emissions and auto glass solutions. 
In the quarter, Jeep announced a product that brings our top technical glass into their iconic vehicles, the new Jeep performance parts Windshield featuring Gorilla Glass is now a factory installed option on the 2021 Wrangler and Gladiator. We're making the windshield lightweight, durable and up to 3x more impact resistant than regular windshields. Additionally, tighter emissions regulations continue to provide a strong content opportunity for our environmental solutions. OEMs need higher filtration performance, and we responded with a new generation of gasoline particulate filters. The importance of our GPF business drives home my ongoing point. It's not about more cars, it's about more Corning in those cars. Since 2017, our auto sales are up more than 40%, while global car sales are down 20%. 
Turning to display. We're in a position of strength for 2 reasons are significantly more profitable than our competitors. Second, the market for large-sized TVs is projected to grow at a double-digit compound annual growth rate through 2024. And we're the leader in Gen 10.5, which is the most economical approach for larger sets. 
Stepping back. We've all seen the declines in panel pricing, and we're beginning to see panel maker utilization adjustments. Now longer demand provides us an opportunity to minimize expedited freight and to rebuild tanks that have operated beyond end of life. Taking these actions will allow us to keep our supply balance to demand. 
We expect the overall glass supply to remain tight, and the glass pricing environment to remain attractive. Tony will give you more details on our industry position and our outlook. 
Finally, in Life Sciences, we're delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. And our inventions are helping advance the transition to sell and gene-based therapies. Additionally, we're making progress on our multibillion dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging. We're expanding our comprehensive portfolio, advancing key partnerships and building our custom base Corning continues to support the pandemic response and its portfolio of advanced vials and pharmaceutical glass tubing has enabled the delivery of more than 3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Our high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina is now operational, which will help us scale with demand. 
In total, we believe our efforts to address the pandemic are enabling permanent industry shifts. That means a future pharmaceutical packaging landscape defined by enhanced patient safety, lower cost, minimal regulatory hurdles and increased capacity for life-saving drugs. Other efforts that have gained increased attention do pandemic are finding broader long-term applications. we introduced Corning Guardian, a paint additive that uses a glass matrix to trapped copper ions, a powerful and long used antimicrobial material. Paint with Guardiant has been proven to kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. -- including the 1 that causes COVID-19. This month, PPG announced that their copper armor paint, powered by Guardiant received EPA registration and will be available in major U.S. retail and home improvement stores. PPG noted that it's the first virus killing paint in the United States. And our collaboration builds on an EPA statement ascertain that public health would benefit from services with built-in antimicrobial capabilities  stepping back. 
I am proud of the many ways our people unleased the power of our portfolio in the quarter and what our performance says about Corning's strong position today. Key trends are converging around our capabilities as we become more and more vital to industry transformations driving the world forward. This provides a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities. And we're executing well to bring those opportunities to life  and make a difference wherever we can. So I want to thank our dedicated employees for their contributions. 
Now I'll close by briefly looking back at 2019, when we outlined our priorities for growth and shareholder returns for the next several years. We provided attractive targets as we laid out our plans to build an even bigger, stronger company that delivers sustainable results. Today, the growth drivers we laid out remain in -- And we're delivering on our goals. We are a bigger, stronger company than we were in 2019, and we are continuing to grow. -- to he will get into more specifics. But I feel really good about our position and the progress that we've made. I look forward to updating you when we close out a strong year and as we grow again in 2022. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony so that he can give you some more insight on the quarter."

Strong execution resulted in another outstanding quarter. We are on track to reach $14 billion in sales and over $2 in EPS.

We are on track to reach $14 billion in sales and over $2 in EPS. We're making significant progress extending our market leadership while scaling operations to meet demand, and we expect to grow again in 2022. I -- During the third quarter, sales increased 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, led by the strength in Optical Communications and the strong performance in our other businesses grew 30% year-over-year to $0.56. Sales and earnings reflect lower production levels in the automotive industry due to the semiconductor chip shortage. The impact to Corning's results was approximately $40 million in sales and $0.02 of EPS. 
Gross margin percent expanded 50 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year to 38.3% despite a net impact of 150 basis points from supply chain challenges and inflationary headwinds. Free cash flow grew to $497 million with cash generation of $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of the year. 
Now these achievements are particularly noteworthy because we are operating in the face of unprecedented logistical challenges and component shortages.  Delivering for customers in this complex environment requires both decisive action and agility. Our ability to sense disruption and act quickly has been key to running our plants well and meeting our customers' needs. And we're leveraging our diversified global supply chain to continue to meet customer demand. 
In fact, I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize the efforts of our global supply management and operations teams that have allowed us to maintain a steady supply of raw materials while finding creative shipping strategies. Their actions have enabled us to effectively deliver for our customers, and they're providing actionable insight into the current dynamic environment. At the same time, we continue to incur additional costs as we work to meet strong customer demand. And while we've been taking actions to mitigate them, certain costs continue to elevate in the third quarter. For example, we were able to offset a significant portion of elevated freight costs, but resin prices increased again. 
Therefore, our margin is temporarily muted. Given this ongoing inflationary environment, we have price increases underway across all of our businesses. We saw some benefit from these actions in the third quarter and their impact should accelerate in the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
Now we don't expect the environment to improve in the short term, but our digital supply chain capabilities enable real-time visibility into emerging situations, allowing us to proactively address the issues. We remain focused on meeting demand, expanding our margins and protecting our ability to invest for customers. 
Now let's take a closer look at the performance in each of our businesses during the third quarter. In Display Technologies, sales were $956 million, up 2% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Corning's glass volume grew slightly and glass prices increased moderately sequentially as expected. Glass supply continues to be tight, and we continue to do everything we can to meet customer demand. 
We expect fourth quarter glass prices to be consistent with the third quarter. Now I know there's a lot of discussion about the display industry. Briefly, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable as glass supply remains tight to balanced throughout 2022. Now as we've discussed previously, we based our perspective on what will happen in the display market on 3 main factors: retail demand, panel makers production and glass makers' ability to supply the panel makers. With those factors in mind, I'll start with what I said about retail demand on our last earnings call in July. Since LCD televisions emerged as a mainstream technology in 2004, LCD TV units have only been down 3 times and never 2 years in a row. Since 2014, TV sell-through units are typically range bound between $225 million and $235 million, which average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year. In 2020, global television units increased 4% above the trend line to about $242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TVs sold probably to accommodate more people living, working and studying from home. 
Entering this year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller televisions and for normal screen size growth of 1.5 inches to return. We now have 9 months of retail data under our belts, and it is confirmatory. Television units declined by about 10% year-over-year while average screen size growth is in line with the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TVs 65 inches and larger increased by a mid-teen percentage, and smaller TVs were down by a mid-teen percentage. So 3 quarters through the year, our expectation for TV units being down year-over-year and screen size growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out. 
Now looking ahead to 2022, we think TV units and screen size will continue to follow historical trends and retail glass demand will be up. That means television units will be within the typical range of 225 million to 235 million units and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches. Now remember, television units, which are declining this year have never declined 2 years in a row. And next year is a World Cup year, and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year. Finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size. We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year. 
In summary, we expect glass demand at retail to be up by a high single-digit percentage in 2022 as measured in square feet. 
Now let's move from retail to panel makers. After a period of high production in 2020 and 2021 to meet strong demand,  we are now seeing panel makers temporarily reducing their utilization given the lower 2021 retail demand that we told you about all year. And that is happening just as we would expect. Now finally, let's move to the glass industry, which struggled to meet demand in 2020 and 2021 as glass has remained tight. Like other glass makers, we've depleted our inventories, expedited shipping and operated tanks beyond their targeted in the life. We will use this period of temporarily lower panel maker utilizations to shut down into life tanks and rebuild them with our latest technology. We will also take the opportunity to work our way out of expedited shipping. These actions keep our supply balanced to demand and will improve our operating cost going forward. But rest assured, we will still have capacity to supply all of our customers' anticipated glass demand. When panel maker production ramps to meet the expected high single-digit retail demand growth in 2022, we will be fully prepared with our revitalized fleet of tanks. 
Overall, we believe glass supply will be tightly balanced throughout 2022. And since glass pricing is primarily driven by glass supply-demand balance, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable in Q4 and also throughout 2022. Moving to Optical Communications. We saw strong growth across the business with sales exceeding $1.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Net income was $139 million, up 21% year-over-year. Net income declined 6% sequentially as increased raw material and shipping costs significantly impacted profitability. 
During the quarter, carriers spent more on 5G and broadband projects. This, along with the continued strong pace of enterprise cloud data center builds drove our strong performance. Demand on networks is at an all-time high, setting the stage for significant investments in fiber infrastructure as operators expand network capacity, capabilities and access. 
During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with AT&T. Our capacity expansion will allow AT&T to expand investments in fiber infrastructure, expand U.S. broadband networks and accelerate 5G deployment. We are well positioned to capture significant ongoing growth and network and data center investment increases. Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency deployments. Additionally, Corning is the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. 
In Environmental Technologies, our third quarter sales were $385 million, up 2% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. As everyone knows, chip shortages is having a big impact on the auto industry. At the start of 2021, global vehicle production was expected to be about 88 million. By July, the industry was projecting below 85 million. And given continued chip and component constraints, forecasts now anticipate auto production around 75 million for the year. This pullback in production began to impact us in the middle of third quarter, and we expect it to continue for the fourth quarter. We estimate an impact on EPS in the third quarter of about $0.02, and we expect additional impact in the fourth quarter. The good news is that when component shortages resolved, auto production will recover because the end market demand remains strong, and we will be prepared to meet the growing demand. 
Specialty Materials delivered sales of $556 million, up 15% sequentially and in line with the strong third quarter in 2020 when we introduced Ceramic Shield. We've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today, despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat. Over that 5-year period, we've almost doubled our sales on a base of more than $1 billion. Clearly, we're successfully executing our objective of driving more content into each device sold.  And strong demand continues for our premium cover materials. During the quarter, our glass innovations were featured in 30 new devices, including smartphones, wearables and laptops. Demand also remains strong for our advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing as the broader end market continues to experience robust growth. 
In the quarter, investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income than in 2020. As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing process. We anticipate that profitability will improve as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization. 
Looking into the fourth quarter, we're seeing typical volume declines in Gorilla Glass following the build supporting flagship customer product launches. 
Life Sciences third quarter sales were $305 million, up 37% year-over-year, driven by ongoing demand to support the global pandemic response, continued recovery in the academic and pharmaceutical research labs and strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Our Life Sciences segment is outpacing the overall industry as evidenced by a sales CAGR of 9% over the last 3 years. 
Stepping back, we have made strong progress across all of our businesses. We entered new product categories, announced collaborations with key industry leaders and contributed to significant industry advancements. We're building a strong foundation for future growth. This, combined with our consistent focus on innovation and deep commitment to RD&E is what continues to fuel and sustain Corning's leadership position across its markets. As we look ahead to Q4, we expect core sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion and core EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.55. Profitability is expected to decline sequentially due to the further reduction on automotive-related sales, as I mentioned, and lower Gorilla Glass sales following strong customer launches. That said, we expect to close out 2021 with both top and bottom line growth and another year of strong cash flow. And we expect our momentum to continue in 2022 with sales and EPS growth along with strong cash generation. 
Now I'd like to expand on Wendell's closing point. Back in 2019, we outlined our goals for growth and shareholder returns. We said we would leverage our focused and cohesive portfolio to extend our leadership and capture significant growth opportunities, and we said that key trends would continue to converge around our capabilities. What we said back in 2019 still rings true to  date, despite the pandemic and the resulting global disruptions. Our key growth drivers are all intact. Some are even accelerating. And we're on track or even ahead of the goals we laid out in 2019 in all our market access platforms. Since 2019, sales have grown at a 10% CAGR and ahead of the 6% to 8% target. 
Now we have been growing EPS at a rate consistent with sales, which puts us ahead of our target which -- I mean, puts us behind our target because inflationary pressures are clearly impacting profitability. But we do expect that our cost and pricing actions will deliver significant improvement over time. 
As we said we would do, we're also growing our return on invested capital. Today, our total company ROIC is in the double digits. Our most recent capacity expansions or as we like to call them, build investments are fully ramped, have enabled the $2.5 billion of sales we've added since 2019 and are delivering more than 20% ROIC. Our aggregate free cash flow generation for 2020 and 2021 is expected to be more than $2.5 billion. 
Finally, we remain steadfast in our commitment to investing in growth and extending our leadership while returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a 10% annual increase in our dividend. As you might remember, we decided early in the pandemic to ensure the stability and flexibility of our financial position by building up our cash reserve. In April, we resumed share buybacks with the Samsung transaction where we repurchased 4% of our fully diluted shares. Consistent with our strategy to opportunistically buy back shares, we plan to do more repurchases in Q4. 
In summary, we've built a strong foundation over the last several years. Our capabilities are relevant to major growth trends across our markets. Our More Corning strategy is working, and we're executing through some very volatile end markets, expanding relationships and commitments with our customers extending our leadership position and generating outstanding sales, profits and free cash flow. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

And I'm personally very proud of what all the work we've done as a company and is what you'd expect at Corning. But what tends to happen in this environment is that you see some places where we made improvements on -- from a cost and freight standpoint and others that have gone up and all of this comes at a cost. So our goal here is to increased prices across all of our businesses. We've had about 150 basis point impact for the last several quarters. I'd expect that to continue for -- in the next quarter and then for it to get better over time.

You saw it, I think in the quarter, we did about $1.1 billion of revenue. Our order book was in excess of that, is stronger than that rate.

And that is before there's any passage of -- that's in the bipartisan infrastructure bill on what it is the government wants to do with broadband. So that will layer on top of the demand that we're seeing that is largely already serving commercial and customer opportunities. So that's how we feel about demand. All those long-term trends that we see, they look like they're all continuing in both cloud and carrier networks. 
Now margin. So in margin expansion, this is a segment where we -- given the really strong demand, we have had a lot of expedited shipping. We've had a lot of challenges around freight, and we've had accelerating raw material costs. So we haven't been putting quite the increase in our margins that you would normally expect as we fill up, right? That's one of the reasons that we're going to be addressing price with our customers who we have done all these long-term build investments with. And hopefully, what that's going to do is get the type of margin growth that you would expect with our rising revenue growth, Samik. Does that make sense to you, sir?"

We want to keep our customers running, we want to keep our people safe. And this too shall pass. And our normal great job that we do reducing costs will trigger in and we got this. 
And actually, it is mainly through conversations with our supply chain head as well as our investors that have led us to look at this and say, this may last longer than we had thought. And that this looks like we could continue to have challenged supply chains for the foreseeable future. And what we needed to do was add to our priorities that we also needed to protect our investors and our ability to invest for the future, which in turn allows us to want and protect our people and protect our customers. And so as we've looked at it that way,  that is what has led us to start to externalize that cost pressure.

All of us are looking at the future when we make these investments in innovation and our plans, that is a little uncertain and so the way we always try to work through things with our customers is, okay, this is where we're at. This is reality.  How do we work through it together in a way that allows you, our customer to continue to succeed and allows us to continue to support that success.

And then glass supply/demand balance, which we believe is going to be tight to balanced in quarter 4 and throughout 2022. And as a result, we believe the glass environment for pricing is going to continue to be favorable. When we say tight to balanced what we mean is that we're coming out of this time period, even if we're out of it yet, where glass has just been very tight, and we have been extending tanks beyond their planned life -- We've had very high expediting costs, and we have delayed technology upgrades really for the last year plus. 
And so what our plan is, is to take any opportunity presented by lower panel maker utilization to take targeted tanks down for upgrades while improving service levels with lower expediting costs. Now the timing for these is solely within Corning's control, right? 
So first goal is we plan to meet our customers' demand. We are going to continue to protect our customers and meet the demand that they think they need. But we're also going to get our fleet ready to lower cost and increase quality for years to come. And as a result, that's what we mean by tight to balance. Our customers get what day.

Welcome to Corning's Quarter 3 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive President and Chief Strategy Officer. 
I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. 
You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. 
For the third quarter, the largest differences between our GAAP and core results stemmed from noncash mark-to-market losses associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and noncash impairment charges. 
With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. 
For us, this decreased GAAP earnings in Q3 by $16 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. 
Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received more than $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than 5 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell."

Today, we reported strong third quarter results that continue a year of outstanding sales growth, margin expansion and significant cash generation. Sales grew 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, a new all-time h",1680,"Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong third quarter results that continue a year of outstanding sales growth, margin expansion and significant cash generation. Sales grew 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, a new all-time high. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year to 38.3%. EPS grew 30% year-over-year to $0.56. And free cash flow of $0.5 billion brought cumulative free cash generation for the first 9 months of 2021 to $1.3 billion. 
Our outstanding results in this period of global disruption are due to excellent execution at all levels of the company. And they're driven by a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities that we're capturing through our innovations and broad market access, as we strengthen our commercial relationships and scale operations to meet demand. 
Like everyone, we're dealing with numerous factors caused by the pandemic and the resulting inflation. In this quarter, the largest macro impact was constraints in the automotive industry, stemming from chip and component shortages. Auto production in the third quarter is estimated to be down nearly 20% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. As a result, we stepped down in light-duty sales. Across our businesses, we prioritized delivering for our customers in a complex inflationary environment, and we have delivered despite incurring extra costs. 
Now we're taking additional actions, including pricing, to address these costs and maintain our ability to invest and support our customers. And you'll hear more from Tony on this in just a few minutes. 
Against this backdrop, we feel really good about our performance. In the quarter, announcements with industry leaders illustrated the power of our portfolio, demonstrating not only our relevance across multiple markets but also our role as a key innovation partner. 
Our strong position stems from a complementary set of 3 core technologies for proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We're leaders in each. We generate growth opportunities by delivering combinations and new applications of these capabilities to help our customers to drive their industries forward. And in doing so, we drive more Corning content into the products people are already buying. 
Let me share some highlights from the quarter. In Optical Communications, the industry is in the early innings of large deployments in support of 5G, broadband and the cloud. Momentum is building, and we see it confirm high multiple sources. First is network need. Demand on networks is significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Broadband usage for September was up 32% versus pre-pandemic levels and up 9% versus September 2020, when remote work and school were largely in play. 
Global 5G subscriptions have grown to almost $0.5 billion this year. More applications are moving to the cloud and global data creation is expected to grow at 23% compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2025. Versus 2020, cloud revenue industry-wide is up nearly 50%. The second confirmation of strong industry momentum can be seen in the announcements from leading companies. On AT&T's earnings call last week, their CEO said they're on a march to deploy fiber at scale. We are working toward passing 5 million homes per year. 
In the quarter, we announced a strategic investment to support their growth plans. Speaking about our expanded collaboration. AT&T said the expansion of fiber infrastructure is central to the growth of broadband reach for consumers as well as business customers. France recently shared that they plan to reach 10 million more homes with fiber by the end of 2025 with their CEO saying, ""Our future is fiber."" 
Cloud deployments are also expanding. Microsoft CEO said that over the past year, they've added new data center clusters in 15 countries across 5 continents in support of their cloud business. The third confirmation is our substantial increase in sales and continued order book momentum. This is perhaps the most important indicator of growth over the next few quarters. 
We are full. We are ramping capacity and we are energized. Across the business, we're driving strong year-over-year sales growth, and we're outperforming the optical market as we continue to commercialize innovations that extend our competitive advantage. And as we provide more solutions to more customers at both the regional and national levels. 
During the quarter, we introduced the newest additions to our Evolv portfolio, which includes solutions designed to support real deployments. We also introduced our Everon millimeter wave indoor small cell systems, which deliver 5G-ready coverage in high-density environments, including office buildings, factories, hotels, hospitals and classrooms. 
Let's turn to mobile consumer electronics. Here, we're helping transform the smartphone experience. As we help our customers deliver new value to their users, we drive more of our content into each device sold. I displayed out well during the quarter with the launch of Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold3 and Galaxy Z Flip3. Both devices feature Gorilla Glass Victus. 
Now they also utilize our new Gorilla Glass with DX on the lenses of the rear cameras. This is more Corning in action. We've expanded our capabilities into a new category, device cameras. Even though the lens is a fraction of the surface area we address with our cover materials. The value we add is high, and we're capturing a very attractive opportunity to increase our revenue per device. Samsung is also featuring Gorilla Glass with DX on the new Galaxy Watch4. 
Turning to automotive. OEMs are designing cleaner, safer vehicles and distinguishing themselves with technologies that enhance the driving experience. Corning is uniquely sued to address these trends. And we're pursuing $100 per car content opportunity across emissions and auto glass solutions. 
In the quarter, Jeep announced a product that brings our top technical glass into their iconic vehicles, the new Jeep performance parts windshield featuring Gorilla Glass is now a factory installed option on the 2021 Wrangler and Gladiator. We're making the windshields lightweight, durable and up to 3x more impact resistant than regular windshields. 
Additionally, tighter emissions regulations continue to provide a strong content opportunity for our environmental solutions. OEMs need higher filtration performance, and we responded with a new generation of gasoline particulate filters. The importance of our GPF business drives home my ongoing point. It's not about more cars, it's about more Corning in those cars. Since 2017, our auto sales are up more than 40%, while global car sales are down 20%. 
Turning to display. We're in a position of strength for 2 reasons. First, we are significantly more profitable than our competitors. Second, the market for large-sized TVs is projected to grow at a double-digit compound annual growth rate through 2024. And we're the leader in Gen 10.5, which is the most economical approach for larger sets. 
Stepping back. We've all seen the declines in panel pricing, and we're beginning to see panel maker utilization adjustments. Now longer demand provides us an opportunity to minimize expedited freight and to rebuild tanks that have operated beyond end of life. Taking these actions will allow us to keep our supply balance to demand. 
We expect the overall glass supply to remain tight, and the glass pricing environment to remain attractive. Tony will give you more details on our industry position and our outlook. 
Finally, in Life Sciences, we're delivering growth on multiple fronts. We're seeing ongoing demand in support of the global pandemic response. And our inventions are helping advance the transition to cell and gene-based therapies. Additionally, we're making progress on our multibillion dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging. We're expanding our comprehensive portfolio, advancing key partnerships and building our custom base. Corning continues to support the pandemic response and its portfolio of advanced vials and pharmaceutical glass tubing has enabled the delivery of more than 3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Our high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina is now operational, which will help us scale with demand. 
In total, we believe our efforts to address the pandemic are enabling permanent industry shifts. That means a future pharmaceutical packaging landscape defined by enhanced patient safety, lower cost, minimal regulatory hurdles and increased capacity for life-saving drugs. 
Other efforts that have gained increased attention during pandemic are finding broader long-term applications. We introduced Corning Guardiant, a paint additive that uses a glass matrix to trapped copper ions, a powerful and long used antimicrobial material. Paint with Guardiant has been proven to kill 99.9% of bacteria and viruses, including the 1 that causes COVID-19. This month, PPG announced that their copper armor paint, powered by Guardiant received EPA registration and will be available in major U.S. retail and home improvement stores. PPG noted that it's the first virus killing paint in the United States. And our collaboration builds on an EPA statement ascertain that public health would benefit from surfaces with built-in antimicrobial capabilities. 
Stepping back. I am proud of the many ways our people unleased the power of our portfolio in the quarter and what our performance says about Corning's strong position today. Key trends are converging around our capabilities as we become more and more vital to industry transformations driving the world forward. This provides a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities. And we're executing well to bring those opportunities to life and make a difference wherever we can. So I want to thank our dedicated employees for their contributions. 
Now I'll close by briefly looking back at 2019, when we outlined our priorities for growth and shareholder returns for the next several years. We provided attractive targets as we laid out our plans to build an even bigger, stronger company that delivers sustainable results. Today, the growth drivers we laid out remain intact and we're delivering on our goals. We are a bigger, stronger company than we were in 2019, and we are continuing to grow. Tony will get into more specifics. But I feel really good about our position and the progress that we've made. I look forward to updating you when we close out a strong year and as we grow again in 2022. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Tony so that he can give you some more insight on the quarter."

We are on track to reach $14 billion in sales and over $2 in EPS. We're making significant progress extending our market leadership while scaling operations to meet demand, and we expect to grow again in 2022. During the third quarter, sales increased 21% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, led by the strength in Optical Communications and the strong performance in our other businesses. EPS grew 30% year-over-year to $0.56. Sales and earnings reflect lower production levels in the automotive industry due to the semiconductor chip shortage. The impact to Corning's results was approximately $40 million in sales and $0.02 of EPS. 
Gross margin percent expanded 50 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year to 38.3% despite a net impact of 150 basis points from supply chain challenges and inflationary headwinds. Free cash flow grew to $497 million with cash generation of $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of the year. 
Now these achievements are particularly noteworthy because we are operating in the face of unprecedented logistical challenges and component shortages. Delivering for customers in this complex environment requires both decisive action and agility. Our ability to sense disruption and act quickly has been key to running our plants well and meeting our customers' needs. And we're leveraging our diversified global supply chain to continue to meet customer demand. 
In fact, I'd be remiss if I didn't recognize the efforts of our global supply management and operations teams that have allowed us to maintain a steady supply of raw materials while finding creative shipping strategies. Their actions have enabled us to effectively deliver for our customers, and they're providing actionable insight into the current dynamic environment. 
At the same time, we continue to incur additional costs as we work to meet strong customer demand. And while we've been taking actions to mitigate them, certain costs continue to elevate in the third quarter. For example, we were able to offset a significant portion of elevated freight costs, but resin prices increased again. Therefore, our margin is temporarily muted. Given this ongoing inflationary environment, we have price increases underway across all of our businesses. We saw some benefit from these actions in the third quarter and their impact should accelerate in the fourth quarter and into 2022. 
Now we don't expect the environment to improve in the short term, but our digital supply chain capabilities enable real-time visibility into emerging situations, allowing us to proactively address the issues. We remain focused on meeting demand, expanding our margins and protecting our ability to invest for customers. 
Now let's take a closer look at the performance in each of our businesses during the third quarter. In Display Technologies, sales were $956 million, up 2% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Corning's glass volume grew slightly and glass prices increased moderately sequentially as expected. Glass supply continues to be tight, and we continue to do everything we can to meet customer demand. 
We expect fourth quarter glass prices to be consistent with the third quarter. Now I know there's a lot of discussion about the display industry. Briefly, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable as glass supply remains tight to balanced throughout 2022. Now as we've discussed previously, we based our perspective on what will happen in the display market on 3 main factors: retail demand, panel makers production and glass makers' ability to supply the panel makers. With those factors in line, I'll start with what I said about retail demand on our last earnings call in July. 
Since LCD televisions emerged as a mainstream technology in 2004, LCD TV units have only been down 3 times and never 2 years in a row. Since 2014, TV sell-through units are typically range bound between 225 million and 235 million, which average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year. 
In 2020, global television units increased 4% above the trend line to about $242 million. Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend. A lot of smaller TVs sold probably to accommodate more people living, working and studying from home. 
Entering this year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller televisions and for normal screen size growth of 1.5 inches to return. With that we now have 9 months of retail data under our belts, and it is confirmatory. 
Television units declined by about 10% year-over-year while average screen size growth is in line with the 1.5 inches per year trend. Unit volume for TVs 65 inches and larger increased by a mid-teen percentage, and smaller TVs were down by a mid-teen percentage. So 3 quarters through the year, our expectation for TV units being down year-over-year and screen size growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out. 
Now looking ahead to 2022, we think TV units and screen size will continue to follow historical trends and retail glass demand will be up. That means television units will be within the typical range of 225 million to 235 million units and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches. 
Now remember, television units, which are declining this year have never declined 2 years in a row. And next year is a World Cup year, and TV units have never declined in a World Cup year. Finally, the biggest driver of retail glass growth in most years is the increase in screen size. We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year. 
In summary, we expect glass demand at retail to be up by a high single-digit percentage in 2022 as measured in square feet. Now let's move from retail to panel makers. After a period of high production in 2020 and 2021 to meet strong demand, we are now seeing panel makers temporarily reducing their utilization given the lower 2021 retail demand that we told you about all year. And that is happening just as we would expect. 
Now finally, let's move to the glass industry, which struggled to meet demand in 2020 and 2021 as glass has remained tight. Like other glass makers, we've depleted our inventories, expedited shipping and operated tanks beyond their targeted in the life. 
We will use this period of temporarily lower panel maker utilizations to shut down end-of-life tanks and rebuild them with our latest technology. We will also take the opportunity to work our way out of expedited shipping. These actions keep our supply balanced to demand and will improve our operating cost going forward. 
But rest assured, we will still have capacity to supply all of our customers' anticipated glass demand. When panel maker production ramps to meet the expected high single-digit retail demand growth in 2022, we will be fully prepared with our revitalized fleet of tanks.
Overall, we believe glass supply will be tightly balanced throughout 2022. And since glass pricing is primarily driven by glass supply-demand balance, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable in Q4 and also throughout 2022. 
Moving to Optical Communications. We saw strong growth across the business with sales exceeding $1.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Net income was $139 million, up 21% year-over-year. Net income declined 6% sequentially as increased raw material and shipping costs significantly impacted profitability. 
During the quarter, carriers spent more on 5G and broadband projects. This, along with the continued strong pace of enterprise cloud data center builds drove our strong performance. Demand on networks is at an all-time high, setting the stage for significant investments in fiber infrastructure as operators expand network capacity, capabilities and access. 
During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with AT&T. Our capacity expansion will allow AT&T to expand investments in fiber infrastructure, expand U.S. broadband networks and accelerate 5G deployment. We are well positioned to capture significant ongoing growth and network and data center investment increases. Our solutions improve the speed and capital efficiency deployments. Additionally, Corning is the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors. 
In Environmental Technologies, our third quarter sales were $385 million, up 2% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. As everyone knows, chip shortages is having a big impact on the auto industry. At the start of 2021, global vehicle production was expected to be about 88 million. By July, the industry was projecting below 85 million. And given continued chip and component constraints, forecasts now anticipate auto production around 75 million for the year. This pullback in production began to impact us in the middle of third quarter, and we expect it to continue for the fourth quarter. We estimate an impact on EPS in the third quarter of about $0.02, and we expect additional impact in the fourth quarter. The good news is that when component shortages resolved, auto production will recover because the end market demand remains strong, and we will be prepared to meet the growing demand. 
Specialty Materials delivered sales of $556 million, up 15% sequentially and in line with the strong third quarter in 2020 when we introduced Ceramic Shield. We've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today, despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat. Over that 5-year period, we've almost doubled our sales on a base of more than $1 billion. Clearly, we're successfully executing our objective of driving more content into each device sold. And strong demand continues for our premium cover materials. 
During the quarter, our glass innovations were featured in 30 new devices, including smartphones, wearables and laptops. Demand also remains strong for our advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing as the broader end market continues to experience robust growth. 
In the quarter, investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income than in 2020. As we've noted before, newer innovations can face high cost as we develop and scale our manufacturing process. We anticipate that profitability will improve as we come up the learning curve and improve utilization. Looking into the fourth quarter, we're seeing typical volume declines in Gorilla Glass following the build supporting flagship customer product launches. 
Life Sciences third quarter sales were $305 million, up 37% year-over-year, driven by ongoing demand to support the global pandemic response, continued recovery in the academic and pharmaceutical research labs and strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Our Life Sciences segment is outpacing the overall industry as evidenced by a sales CAGR of 9% over the last 3 years. 
Stepping back, we have made strong progress across all of our businesses. We entered new product categories, announced collaborations with key industry leaders and contributed to significant industry advancements. We're building a strong foundation for future growth. This, combined with our consistent focus on innovation and deep commitment to RD&E is what continues to fuel and sustain Corning's leadership position across its markets. 
As we look ahead to Q4, we expect core sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion and core EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.55. Profitability is expected to decline sequentially due to the further reduction on automotive-related sales, as I mentioned, and lower Gorilla Glass sales following strong customer launches. That said, we expect to close out 2021 with both top and bottom line growth and another year of strong cash flow. And we expect our momentum to continue in 2022 with sales and EPS growth along with strong cash generation. 
Now I'd like to expand on Wendell's closing point. Back in 2019, we outlined our goals for growth and shareholder returns. We said we would leverage our focused and cohesive portfolio to extend our leadership and capture significant growth opportunities, and we said that key trends would continue to converge around our capabilities. 
What we said back in 2019 still rings true to  date, despite the pandemic and the resulting global disruptions. Our key growth drivers are all intact. Some are even accelerating. And we're on track or even ahead of the goals we laid out in 2019 in all our market access platforms. Since 2019, sales have grown at a 10% CAGR and ahead of the 6% to 8% target. 
Now we have been growing EPS at a rate consistent with sales, which puts us ahead of our target which -- I mean, puts us behind our target because inflationary pressures are clearly impacting profitability. But we do expect that our cost and pricing actions will deliver significant improvement over time. 
As we said we would do, we're also growing our return on invested capital. Today, our total company ROIC is in the double digits. Our most recent capacity expansions or as we like to call them, build investments are fully ramped, have enabled the $2.5 billion of sales we've added since 2019 and are delivering more than 20% ROIC. Our aggregate free cash flow generation for 2020 and 2021 is expected to be more than $2.5 billion. 
Finally, we remain steadfast in our commitment to investing in growth and extending our leadership while returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a 10% annual increase in our dividend. As you might remember, we decided early in the pandemic to ensure the stability and flexibility of our financial position by building up our cash reserve. In April, we resumed share buybacks with the Samsung transaction where we repurchased 4% of our fully diluted shares. Consistent with our strategy to opportunistically buy back shares, we plan to do more repurchases in Q4. 
In summary, we've built a strong foundation over the last several years. Our capabilities are relevant to major growth trends across our markets. Our More Corning strategy is working, and we're executing through some very volatile end markets, expanding relationships and commitments with our customers extending our leadership position and generating outstanding sales, profits and free cash flow. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?"

And I'm personally very proud of what all the work we've done as a company and is what you'd expect at Corning. 
But what tends to happen in this environment is that you see some places where we made improvements on -- from a cost and freight standpoint and others that have gone up and all of this comes at a cost. So our goal here is to increased prices across all of our businesses. We've had about 150 basis point impact for the last several quarters. I'd expect that to continue for -- in the next quarter and then for it to get better over time.

So first, as I've laid out in my comments, we feel that the growth here in the business is very strong. You saw it, I think in the quarter, we did about $1.1 billion of revenue.

So that gives you an idea of the demand that we're seeing right now. And that is before there's any passage of -- that's in the bipartisan infrastructure bill on what it is the government wants to do with broadband. 
So that will layer on top of the demand that we're seeing that is largely already serving commercial and customer opportunities. So that's how we feel about demand. All those long-term trends that we see, they look like they're all continuing in both cloud and carrier networks. 
Now margin. So in margin expansion, this is a segment where we -- given the really strong demand, we have had a lot of expedited shipping. We've had a lot of challenges around freight, and we've had accelerating raw material costs. So we haven't been putting quite the increase in our margins that you would normally expect as we fill up, right? 
That's one of the reasons that we're going to be addressing price with our customers who we have done all these long-term build investments with.

I would say if you had asked us when this all began sort of, like, quarter 2, like quarter 3, like in that time period. We would have said this is probably transitory, and our top priorities are to protect our people and protect our customers and spend what it takes to make that happen. We want to keep our customers running, we want to keep our people safe. And this too shall pass. And our normal great job that we do reducing costs will trigger in and we got this. 
And actually, it is mainly through conversations with our supply chain head as well as our investors that have led us to look at this and say, this may last longer than we had thought. And that this looks like we could continue to have challenged supply chains for the foreseeable future. 
And what we needed to do was add to our priorities that we also needed to protect our investors and our ability to invest for the future, which in turn allows us to want and protect our people and protect our customers. And so as we've looked at it that way, that is what has led us to start to externalize that cost pressure. 
We began in quarter 3. We've got a lot further to go. So I think the thing to look at is pretty simply, how do we do getting our profitability working in the way you would expect when we have revenue growth because we're expecting to grow normal us as we grow because we actually make things for a living or you would expect our margins to improve. And so that -- I think that's the key thing that we're looking at, has to see that as well as we have detailed plans like by customer, by product, by region. And all that is getting rolled out, is already in motion."

All of us are looking at the future when we make these investments in innovation and our plans, that is a little uncertain and so the way we always try to work through things with our customers is, okay, this is where we're at. This is reality.  How do we work through it together in a way that allows you, our customer to continue to succeed and allows us to continue to support that success.

So the way we tend to -- I think you're on one of the real key points. So as Tony said, like the 2 key factors to keep in mind for display and they really drive display are the demand at the retail level, which we believe will be up single digits next year. And then glass supply/demand balance, which we believe are going to be tight to balanced in quarter 4 and throughout 2022. 
And as a result, we believe the glass environment for pricing is going to continue to be favorable. When we say tight to balanced what we mean is that we're coming out of this time period, even if we're out of it yet, where glass has just been very tight, and we have been extending tanks beyond their planned life, we've had very high expediting costs, and we have delayed technology upgrades really for the last year plus. 
And so what our plan is, is to take any opportunity presented by lower panel maker utilization to take targeted tanks down for upgrades while improving service levels with lower expediting costs. Now the timing for these is solely within Corning's control, right? 
So first goal is we plan to meet our customers' demand. We are going to continue to protect our customers and meet the demand that they think they need. But we're also going to get our fleet ready to lower cost and increase quality for years to come. And as a result, that's what we mean by tight to balance. Our customers get what they need.
