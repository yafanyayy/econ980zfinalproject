Let me start the call with our sentiments of support for the residents of Texas and all the other states that were impacted physically and financially by last week's frigid weather.

Let me start the call with our sentiments of support for the residents of Texas and all the other states that were impacted physically and financially by last week's frigid weather. Climate change is a major part of the story there, and our industry just has to continue our collective efforts on climate mitigation and adaptation. 
Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $4.52 for 2020. This exceeded the midpoint of our initial guidance range, and is within the narrowed range we updated on our last earnings call. 
Core EPS of $4.52 was lower than $4.70 a year ago, and the decline was due to $0.44 of equity share dilution. On an operational basis, excluding dilution, core EPS was $0.26 higher, driven by strong performance at SCE. Maria will discuss our financial performance in detail in her remarks. 
In 2020, SCE made substantial progress on its comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy. This continues to advance one of SCE's top priorities, increasing grid resiliency to adapt to the change in climate and to protect public safety. SCE accomplished the vast majority of its 2020 program targets and, in many cases, exceeded those goals despite the challenges we all faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have highlighted several measures of SCE's progress and execution on Page 2 of the slide deck that we issued with our earnings release. 
Since the end of 2018 SCE's execution of its wildfire mitigation strategy has reduced the risk of wildfires associated with utility infrastructure despite a record-setting California wildfire season in the last year. For the second consecutive year, we do not believe damages from any wildfire alleged to be caused by SCE equipment will exceed insurance. 
SCE is further accelerating its wildfire mitigation efforts. Earlier this month, the utility filed its 2021 wildfire mitigation plan update, which describes how it has matured its wildfire mitigation capabilities and outlines the long-term plan to further advance risk informed decision-making, data management, grid hardening and community engagement. A prime example is the covered conductor program, which will increase the percentage of distribution overhead circuit miles covered within SCE's high fire risk areas from approximately 15% today to over 60% by the end of 2023, subject to CPUC approval. 
The utility continues to innovate and implement technology-based solutions at options such as early fault detection for reducing ignition risks. As described in its 2021 WMP, SCE estimates a 25% reduction in ignitions in high fire risk areas by 2022 as compared to 2020, assuming the same conditions as experienced in 2020. 
SCE continues to improve its public safety power shutoff, or PSPS operations, with public safety being the Paramount consideration. SCE uses PSPS only when conditions warrant. Let me underscore the need for PSPS despite the hardships it creates. By noting that in 2019 and 2020, post PSPS petrols found at least 60 incidents of wind-related damage that could have potentially caused technicians. In 2020, the installation of more weather stations and sectionalization devices, paired with the automation of existing devices, all enabled SCE to limit PSPS footprints wherever possible based on risk assessments, achieving a 22% reduction in customer minutes of interruption. All that said, SCE recognizes there are opportunities to further improve the execution of PSPS and better support its customers. That was loud and clear in the January '19 letter from President Batcher. And in the CPUC and community input that SCE leaders received during the 4.5 hour PSPS hearing on January 26, all this especially underscored the need to improve see's communications with customers. And the PSPS action plan filed in February 12, includes important near-term commitments to be used as essential tool of last resort in a way that shows better care for our customers. 
Beyond SCE, the state has been building on significant investments in its firefighting capabilities. In his 202122 budget, the governor proposed an additional $1  billion to support a coordinated Forest health and fire prevention strategy, that maximizes technology and science-based approaches to protect state lands. This includes prioritizing firebreaks around high-risk communities and grants for individual homeowners to harden their properties. Recognizing the needs to move quickly, the governor also proposed that $323 million out of that $1 billion would be for early action to start these prevention projects before the next fire season. For fire suppression, the budget adds funding to support 30 additional statewide fire crews and 7 large air tankers. 
The state will continue phasing in Black Hawk helicopters, with 7 expected to be in operation this fire season and another 5 in 2022. These new suppression resources will help the state move more quickly to combat wildfires before they become catastrophic. 
The governor and the California Insurance Commission also announced a plan to establish state-wide standards for home and community hardening that will reduce wildfire risk and help make insurance available and affordable to residents and businesses. 
Shifting to past wildfires. SCE has made significant progress toward resolving pending litigation. Last month, SCE resolved all insurance segregation claims in the pending 2018 will see fire litigation. The utility continues to make solid progress settling remaining individual plaintiff claims across the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. In total, SCE has resolved approximately 2/3 of the best estimate of total losses established last September. Maria will provide an update on the equity financing needs related to these events later on the call. 
Turning to regulatory actions. We welcome the reappointment of CPUC President Batcher for a 6-year term, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Person Batcher leadership has energized the commission's implementation of the state's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. Yesterday, the CPUC hosted an on bank to share ideas about affordability across many stakeholders. Given the economic impacts of COVID-19, this is a timely discussion, and it follows on many years of SCE leadership to manage system average rate growth well below the other California utilities, which we were proud to see acknowledged by the commission staff report and others. The discussion reinforced many of the issues we have raised in our Pathway 2045 analysis, including that the grid investments needed to decarbonize the economy and improve local air quality through clean energy and electrification may increase electric costs, but will actually result in greater affordability and equity, with the average customer spending 30% less across all forms of energy in 2045 than they do today, thanks to the greater efficiency of electric technologies. 
Looking ahead, SCE is planning for their critical role it plays in sustainability, particularly from the unique vantage point of a wires focused business. This will include significant capital investment opportunities to support the electrification of transportation and buildings as outlined in SCE's Pathway 2045 and reimagining the grid white papers. The governor's budget proposal also underscores this, with its proposed $1.5 billion comprehensive strategy to achieve zero-emission vehicle goals by 2035 and 2045. 
This includes infrastructure investments for and improved access to new and used zero emission vehicles. SCE has received CPUC approval for over $800 million to support electric vehicles including investing in electric charging infrastructure for light, medium and heavy duty vehicles. The utility launched its Charge Ready 2 program, the largest light-duty EV charging program by an investor-owned utility in the United States, which will support approximately 38,000 light duty charging ports. Charge Ready transport, SCE's program to build charging infrastructure for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, will grow through 2024, eventually building charging infrastructure to power 8,500 electric medium and heavy duty vehicles. 
SCE has also committed to a long-term goal to electrify its own vehicle fleet, including 100% of all light-duty vehicles by 2030. In the area of building electrification, SCE launched new programs in 2020 to incentivize heat pump installations and expect to continue to expand these offerings going forward. 
Before I conclude, I would like to say that I am just very, very proud of what our employees accomplished over the last year in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has reshaped the way that all of us do business, and how we interact with our customers and communities. And we adapted to continue delivering an essential service. We cared for each other, whether working in the field or teleworking. We care for our customers, providing relief for those facing economic challenges, and we cared for our communities and their safety. 
Looking forward, I am excited about our near and long-term business opportunities. SCE is well positioned as an electric-only utility, with investments highly aligned with the states and now the federal government's long-term decarbonization goals. We will continue to accelerate our wildfire mitigation efforts, while building toward an equitable, clean energy future. With that, Maria will provide her financial report."

My comments today will cover fourth quarter 2020 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts and an update on our financing plans for 2021. Edison International reported core earnings of $1.19 pe",935,"Thanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover fourth quarter 2020 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts and an update on our financing plans for 2021. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter 2020, an increase of $0.20 per share from the same period last year. Full year 2020 core EPS was $4.52, which exceeded the midpoint of our initial guidance range, and is within the narrowed range we updated on our last earnings call. 
Core EPS of $4.52 was lower than $4.70 a year ago, and the decline was due to $0.44 of equity share dilution. 
On an operational basis, excluding dilution, core EPS was $0.26 higher, driven by strong performance at SCE. On Page 3, you can see SCE's key fourth quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I would like to highlight 4 items that accounted for much of the variance. 
First, EPS increased by $0.16 related to higher revenue. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.22 of this increase due to the escalation mechanism from the 2018 GRC decision. There was also a negative variance of $0.11, primarily related to benefits captured in our tax balancing account. This is offset in the income tax line with no effect on earnings. 
FERC and other operating revenue had a positive variance of $0.05, largely due to higher rate base. Second, O&M had a positive variance of $0.11, primarily due to higher regulatory deferrals related to wildfire mitigation activities and customer uncollectibles, and from approval of the GRC Trak 2 settlement. Third, depreciation had a negative variance of $0.07 due to higher rate base. 
Lastly, SCE's EPS in the quarter was lower by $0.07 because of dilution from the increase in shares outstanding, primarily associated with the equity offering in May 2020. 
I would now like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast, which are shown on Page 4. We continue to see opportunities to significantly grow SCE's rate base, driven by investments in electric infrastructure. The capital program reflects expenditures of $15 billion to $16 billion between 2021 and 2023. This represents compound annual rate base growth of 7.6%, over 2 rate case periods at the request level. Our total CapEx forecast during this period is unchanged as we are awaiting a proposed decision in SCE's 2021 GRC Track 1. 
In 2020, we SCE's capital spending was $5.5 billion, approximately $400 million higher than forecast, primarily as a result of higher fire restoration costs. For 2021, SCE has developed, and will execute against a robust capital plan that targets key programs, while maintaining flexibility in later years to adapt to levels authorized in the final GRC decision. 
Please turn to Page 5. While the commission schedule calls for a proposed decision this quarter on Track 1 of SCE's 2021 GRC, based on the level of inquiry to date from the CPUC compared to our past experience, we believe it is unlikely that SCE will receive a PD by the end of the first quarter. We remain hopeful that SCE will receive a PD in the second quarter. As a reminder, the CPUC can vote out a final decision no sooner than 30 days after it issues a proposed decision. Consistent with our prior practice, we will issue earnings guidance after we receive a final decision on the GRC. 
Page 6 shows a summary of the substantial progress on receiving approvals for recovery of incremental wildfire mitigation costs. SCE expects to receive over $1 billion of cash flow through September 2022 as the utility implements CPUC approval. This is in addition to ongoing securitization of AB 1054 capital. You may recall that last quarter, the CPUC issued a financing order, authorizing SCE to securitize the first tranche of AB 1054 capital expenditures approved in the grid safety and resiliency plan settlement. Yesterday, SCE successfully closed that securitization, issuing $338 million of AAA-rated recovery bonds. The proceeds will be used to repay short-term borrowings issued for AB 1054 capital expenditures. 
In January, the CPUC approved SCE's GRC Truck 2 settlement, which allows SCE to request another financing order to securitize the approved AB 1054 capital expenditures and recover the O&M expense. Additionally, SCE filed a LIMA application for wildfire insurance premium for the second half of 2020. If approved, SCE will recover $215 million beginning January 2022. 
I would now like to provide an update on the approximately $1 billion equity issuance that we had discussed previously. As Pedro noted, SCE has been making significant progress resolving pending wildfire-related litigation, and thus far, has settled claims that represent approximately 2/3 of the best estimate that we established. We continue to ground our financing plan in a framework that supports investment-grade ratings by targeting consolidated FFO to debt in the 15% to 17% range. 
To support this outcome, EIX will issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content in 2021, consistent with the previously identified need. 
We will consider a range of options to achieve this equity content, including preferred equity, internal programs, and, if needed, our existing ATM program. We will be flexible regarding the specific timing and monitor market conditions to efficiently finance the need. 
Beyond this year, we expect to have minimal equity needs associated with our ongoing capital program, and will quantify these after receiving a final decision in the 2021 GRC. 
Overall, the company is well positioned to achieve the growth associated with the safety and resiliency investments being made in the grid, and the longer-term opportunity associated with our clean energy objectives. That concludes my remarks."

As we've mentioned before, we think that the equity plan that we have in place, or the financing plan that we have had in place and announced last year is very supportive of the FFO to debt range that we're targeting and supportive of investment-grade ratings. I'm sure you've read all the recent reports that the agencies have put out. The metrics on a look back basis are skinny, but that's why the plan to issue equity and to move forward with that so that we can support the balance sheet appropriately."

Kevin Payne is also on the line, so he can add as he sees fit. So just a process you saw the letter that President Atrient, you monitored the hearing that the PUC had for Kevin and Steve Powell and other members of the team participated. That provided a lot of, frankly, good helpful input from commissioners and communities and other state agencies. Based on that, SCE developed the action plan that has a series of steps and commitments. You saw there are some things in there around or, frankly, continuing work on trying to minimize just the impact and scope of PSPS. I would put that in the category of work that's been going on and continuous, right? Areas like continuously POC sectionalization and tend to work on continuous improvement of weather modeling and the like to -- just really to help to narrow the gap between the approach we have, which is, frankly, the right approach for SCE to have of notifying customers based on forecast consditions, but then the energizing on real-time conditions. But the more that we can narrow the gap between the number of customers that get notified versus those to get the energized by having better and better forecasting and modeling, that helps. 
So you saw some actions around those lines, but, say, a lot of the focus was really on, how do we help the SCE team better improve the communications process, communications with the emergency agencies, with government, with community leaders, with end use customers. And so you saw a number of actions around that. 
In terms of process, there's going to be a series of meetings every couple of weeks for the next while with commission staff just to continue to keep them updated. SCE has taken the step of now dedicating a Vice President to PSPS, who's, frankly, pretty strong leader, Rita, and he's moving from the T&D business to over the next few months, spend all of this time, along with the dedicated team, on the PSPS improvement approach. So that's -- I'd say it's somewhat informal process. And then there's the action plan more formality to rate and formal discussions with the commission on how it's going along and check-ins with them. But frankly, wanting to make sure that the SCE team can move on all the elements and meet its commitments. Kevin, anything you would add there?"

So we did see the transaction and it's interesting. So the team has been learning about it. There might be somewhat different circumstances for SCE in that we do have obviously, transmission towers with attachments on them already today, like [indiscernible] did. In our case, they're part of a bit more comprehensive telecom business. Peterson Care Solutions, which is essentially a competitive telco inside the utility, that not only does sell antenna attachments, but also has managed fiber services, dark fiber as well as lit fiber, providing bandwidth to carriers. And so in SCE's case, there's that broader telecom business it also operates under a little different framework. I noticed that simple, there's some revenue sharing that the [indiscernible] deal contemplates. The SCE business operates under a different revenue sharing mechanism. So there's just a number of different bolts and whistles that are made for just different maturity of the business and different scope and scale today. So my -- the PG&E transaction might not be fully transferable or applicable."

Look, I think the headline is that we continue to view California as one of the most constructive states in the country when it comes to utility regulation, right? And it's both because of the backward-looking and current mechanisms like the fact that we have our forward-looking rate cases, we have the balancing accounts for elements like procurement purchases, energy procurement, I should say. We have decoupling, right? So you have a number of elements that have been here for quite a while that make for a constructive environment. 
You also have, frankly, looking more towards the future, a state that's been fairly aggressive in terms of wanting to push the edge of technology and have as wanted utilities to play a significant role in advancing the ball for the sector, right? For the benefit of California customers. That's meant that utilities has to take on some added operational risks in managing more distributed resources than our peers in other states or -- and having deeper penetration renewables or being earlier in the curve around storage and the like. And that has lent itself to providing an opportunity for ROEs that have reflected a premium based on those risks that we are being asked to manage. 
And then finally, looking solidly well out in the future, it's a state that is really committed to decarbonizing the economy. And so you've seen through our papers like a Pathway 2045 and remanaging the grid papers that we see that, that decarbonization getting to net zero for the state will require a significant ramp-up in renewable and other carbon-free resources along with storage. This will lead to a dramatic increase in load across the state, 16% or so increase in order to then electrify a lot of the economy, and that all requires a really robust grid with significant more investment than what we have in place today to make that all happen. So that all adds up to a good opportunity for utilities. 
Now -- by the way, it's also a good opportunity for the customer because, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see all of that been leading ultimately to a 30% decline in the total energy cost the average customer has in 2045. It may put some pressure on utility bills, but it will help bring down overall cost for the customer and make the states more affordable. 
Now that's said, there are always bumps in the road. There are things that can give false pause. The wildfire experience has been a challenging one or less several years. We've had a lot of encouragement in getting items like AB 1054 to help create a a restored framework. We're still going through implementation of that. I know that there's some discount that the utilities are carrying today relative to our peers in other states. And hopefully, over time, as investors see that the framework is working, that the physical risks are being mitigated and that the structure is there to help mitigate the financials either risk, too, that will help to get investors fully comfortable with that and better align the value of California opportunities for the long-term opportunity that we have. 
One final item is there's a lot going on, and it's all going on in the middle of COVID. So I feel for the CPUC staff, the 800-or-so of them have a lot on their plates. I think person and Batchelor, as I've mentioned in the comments, has done a great leadership and focusing the commission on that clean energy future. I think, generally, she's also help the commission to, in general, be timely in [indiscernible], and you saw that in elements like the Track 2 success we had recently, but there's a lot on their plate. So while I'm a little disappointed that we may not end up seeing a GRC Track 1 PD this quarter, I know that they're on the case, and they recognize the importance of overall timely decisions. And then when it comes to like PSPS has some tough feedback we got. So a lot of it, frankly, was merited. And it's a good learning opportunity, and I commend Kevin Payne and the team at sea for having sat there for 4.5 hours and listened and take a note and reflected good feedback in the PSPS action plan that SCE filed. So there will be bumps in the road in any relationship. But I think, overall, if you look at maybe a couple of trees to get in the way now and then. But if you look at the forest, it's a really interesting forest for the long term."

I think our Pathway 2045 paper at the time was forecasting something like a need for 7 million electric vehicles in California by 2030. At the time -- or shortly after, I think the state was talking about a $5 million mark. Since then, you've seen the state really look at doubling down on the electric vehicles and progress like Governor [indiscernible] executive order for zero-emission vehicles -- 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035. That says something right there about the growing commitment by the state and, frankly, driven by growing realization that is a key tool and one of the most affordable tools to get to decarbonization at the end of the day. The other angle, I'd share on this is then there's the market, right? And so when we start talking about this, there was the vote. Remember when I got my first bolt in 2011 and that new model year, my colleagues were driving some of the first Telas a whole lot of EDS out. Now you're looking at a rollout is reading one of the latest articles where, I think, over the next year, there's going to be, what, something like 20 or 30 new model offerings across auto OEMs and it's an area where U.S. auto makers are realizing that if they don't run fast, they could lose leadership to Chinese automakers or European automakers. 
So seeing things like Ford's commitment of $20-some billion investment towards EVs over the next several years, seeing GM's aspiration to not have internal combustion engines anymore in a decade or so, that is a very different landscape from where we started 4, 5 years ago. And it tells you that this is happening, it's real, and I suspect, like other technology innovations like the deployment of cell phones, folks may be surprised by how quickly that escrow takes off."

But so that delta in the capital spending between last quarter and this quarter was largely driven by wildfire restoration costs. So you will recall that late last year, there were a number of large fires in our service territory, particularly up in the northern part of our service territory around Big Creek. And so a lot of the spend that's been going on since then has been to really get all of those facilities back into service and to repair them, et cetera. 
So that's really the driver there, Michael. We have to go through an analysis and see sort of what in there was otherwise going to have been replaced or upgraded, et cetera, what's incremental, but that's largely the capital change from last quarter. 
In terms of transmission and and we still in the cycle, I think, obviously, the state is planning for the future, the future that Pedro just described in his earlier remarks. And we have to look to the CISO to do that planning. There's obviously a lot of work going on around the need as well, both in the integrated resource plan -- integrated resource plans as well as the CIO, but I'll let Pedro share his thoughts as well."

But that analysis estimated that California would need to add 80 gigawatts of bulk power kind of wholesale level renewables and 30 gigawatts of wholesale bulk power level storage by 2045, that's in addition to 30 gigawatts of distributed generation and 10 gigawatts of distributed behind-the-meter storage. But all that would require something like $175 billion investment for the resource side for the renewables and storage side. And the counterpart to that is that you need something like $70 billion in why your site investment, with most of that being for transmission, whether it's new lines or enhancing of current lines. 
Now that's state wide, right? So that's not all SCE, but that just gives you a sense of how big the investment need will be in order to accommodate that electrified future to decarbonized economy. And then as a reminder that, under the current first quarter 1,000 structure, if the [indiscernible] determines that an existing line needs to be upgraded, and the utility has right of first refusal to do that upgrade on its line, line has been already owns and operates. If it's a brand-new line, that's not an extension of an existing line, then that is bid out competitively. And I would expect the utility to seek to compete with third parties for that new build. 
So hard to quantify what the specific SCE opportunity will be from all of that, but it's clearly a very large pie that will need to be met across the state. And I expect that SCE will certainly play a significant role within its territory for that."

My guess is that -- or my sense is, not guess, my sense from the analysis is that a lot of that spend may be post 2030 spend because that's when you really see the load pick up, too. In our analysis, load, which has been fairly flat statewide to slightly declining for the last decade, through 2030, interestingly, continues to be fairly flattish, right, because you have a lot of electrification between now and 2030 being counterbalanced by continued distributed generation deployment as well as continued energy efficiency. But we see a big elbow -- turn in the curve upswing post 2030, and that's where the state really picks up the bulk of that 60% load increase that I talked about before. It really happens mostly between 2030 and 2045. So that may suggest that a good chunk of that build maybe post that. But in the meantime, you've seen our capital spend so far, as Maria described, we had a bump up from just that creek fire restoration last year. So I hope we don't have to do fire restorational for any future fires. But we continue to say that we see an ongoing opportunity for significant capital spend just for the core capital investment in the utility. And so I -- to think about the long-haul transmission that becomes an adder that certainly supports the long-term growth for the company."

Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $4.52 for 2020. This exceeded the midpoint of our initial guidance range and is within the narrowed range we updated on our last earnings call.
Core EPS of $4.52 was lower than $4.70 a year ago, and the decline was due to $0.44 of equity share dilution. On an operational basis, excluding dilution, core EPS was $0.26 higher, driven by strong performance at SCE. Maria will discuss our financial performance in detail in her remarks.
In 2020, SCE made substantial progress on its comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy. This continues to advance one of SCE's top priorities, increasing grid resiliency to adapt to the change in climate and to protect public safety. SCE accomplished the vast majority of its 2020 program targets and, in many cases, exceeded those goals despite the challenges we all faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have highlighted several measures of SCE's progress and execution on Page 2 of the slide deck that we issued with our earnings release.
Since the end of 2018, SCE's execution of its wildfire mitigation strategy has reduced the risk of wildfires associated with utility infrastructure despite a record-setting California wildfire season last year. For the second consecutive year, we do not believe damages from any wildfire alleged to be caused by SCE equipment will exceed insurance.
SCE is further accelerating its wildfire mitigation efforts. Earlier this month, the utility filed its 2021 wildfire mitigation plan update, which describes how it has matured its wildfire mitigation capabilities and outlines the long-term plan to further advance risk informed decision-making, data management, grid hardening and community engagement. A prime example is the covered conductor program, which will increase the percentage of distribution overhead circuit miles covered within SCE's high fire risk areas from approximately 15% today to over 60% by the end of 2023, subject to CPUC approval.
The utility continues to innovate and implement technology-based solutions at options such as early fault detection for reducing ignition risks. As described in its 2021 WMP, SCE estimates a 25% reduction in ignitions in high fire risk areas by 2022 as compared to 2020, assuming the same conditions as experienced in 2020.
SCE continues to improve its public safety power shutoff, or PSPS operations, with public safety being the paramount consideration. SCE uses PSPS only when conditions warrant. Let me underscore the need for PSPS despite the hardships it creates. By noting that in 2019 and 2020, post PSPS patrols found at least 60 incidents of wind-related damage that could have potentially caused ignitions. In 2020, the installation of more weather stations and sectionalization devices, paired with the automation of existing devices, all enabled SCE to limit PSPS footprints wherever possible based on risk assessments, achieving a 22% reduction in customer minutes of interruption. All that said, SCE recognizes there are opportunities to further improve the execution of PSPS and better support its customers. That was loud and clear in the January '19 letter from President Batjer and in the CPUC and community input that SCE leaders received during the 4.5-hour PSPS hearing on January 26. All this especially underscored the need to improve SCE's communications with customers. And the PSPS action plan filed on February 12 includes important near-term commitments to use this essential tool of last resort in a way that shows better care for our customers.
Beyond SCE, the state has been building on significant investments in its firefighting capabilities. In his 2021-'22 budget, the governor proposed an additional $1 billion to support a coordinated forest health and fire prevention strategy, that maximizes technology and science-based approaches to protect state lands. This includes prioritizing firebreaks around high-risk communities and grants for individual homeowners to harden their properties. Recognizing the needs to move quickly, the governor also proposed that $323 million out of that $1 billion would be for early action to start these prevention projects before the next fire season. For fire suppression, the budget adds funding to support 30 additional statewide fire crews and 7 large air tankers.
The state will continue phasing in Black Hawk helicopters, with 7 expected to be in operation this fire season and another 5 in 2022. These new suppression resources will help the state move more quickly to combat wildfires before they become catastrophic.
The governor and the California Insurance Commission also announced a plan to establish statewide standards for home and community hardening that will reduce wildfire risk and help make insurance available and affordable to residents and businesses.
Shifting to past wildfires. SCE has made significant progress toward resolving pending litigation. Last month, SCE resolved all insurance subrogation claims in the pending 2018 Woolsey Fire litigation. The utility continues to make solid progress settling remaining individual plaintiff claims across the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. In total, SCE has resolved approximately 2/3 of the best estimate of total losses established last September. Maria will provide an update on the equity financing needs related to these events later on the call.
Turning to regulatory actions. We welcome the reappointment of CPUC President Batjer for a 6-year term, subject to confirmation by the Senate. President Batjer's leadership has energized the commission's implementation of the state's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. Yesterday, the CPUC hosted an en banc to share ideas about affordability across many stakeholders. Given the economic impacts of COVID-19, this is a timely discussion, and it follows on many years of SCE leadership to manage system average rate growth well below the other California utilities, which we were proud to see acknowledged by the commission staff report and others. The discussion reinforced many of the issues we have raised in our Pathway 2045 analysis, including that the grid investments needed to decarbonize the economy and improve local air quality through clean energy and electrification may increase electric costs, but will actually result in greater affordability and equity, with the average customer spending 30% less across all forms of energy in 2045 than they do today, thanks to the greater efficiency of electric technologies.
Looking ahead, SCE is planning for their critical role it plays in sustainability, particularly from the unique vantage point of a wires focused business. This will include significant capital investment opportunities to support the electrification of transportation and buildings as outlined in SCE's Pathway 2045 and reimagining the grid white papers. The governor's budget proposal also underscores this, with its proposed $1.5 billion comprehensive strategy to achieve zero-emission vehicle goals by 2035 and 2045.
This includes infrastructure investments for and improved access to new and used zero-emission vehicles. SCE has received CPUC approval for over $800 million to support electric vehicles including investing in electric charging infrastructure for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The utility launched its Charge Ready 2 program, the largest light-duty EV charging program by an investor-owned utility in the United States, which will support approximately 38,000 light-duty charging ports. Charge Ready Transport, SCE's program to build charging infrastructure for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, will grow through 2024, eventually building charging infrastructure to power 8,500 electric medium and heavy-duty vehicles.
SCE has also committed to a long-term goal to electrify its own vehicle fleet, including 100% of all light-duty vehicles by 2030. In the area of building electrification, SCE launched new programs in 2020 to incentivize heat pump installations and expect to continue to expand these offerings going forward.
Before I conclude, I would like to say that I am just very, very proud of what our employees accomplished over the last year in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has reshaped the way that all of us do business, and how we interact with our customers and communities. And we adapted to continue delivering an essential service. We cared for each other, whether working in the field or teleworking. We care for our customers, providing relief for those facing economic challenges, and we cared for our communities and their safety.
Looking forward, I am excited about our near and long-term business opportunities. SCE is well positioned as an electric-only utility, with investments highly aligned with the states and now the federal government's long-term decarbonization goals. We will continue to accelerate our wildfire mitigation efforts, while building toward an equitable, clean energy future. With that, Maria will provide her financial report."

My comments today will cover fourth quarter 2020 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts and an update on our financing plans for 2021.Edison International reported core earnings of $1.19 per",932,"Thanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover fourth quarter 2020 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts and an update on our financing plans for 2021.
Edison International reported core earnings of $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter 2020, an increase of $0.20 per share from the same period last year. Full year 2020 core EPS was $4.52, which exceeded the midpoint of our initial guidance range, and is within the narrowed range we updated on our last earnings call.
Core EPS of $4.52 was lower than $4.70 a year ago, and the decline was due to $0.44 of equity share dilution.
On an operational basis, excluding dilution, core EPS was $0.26 higher, driven by strong performance at SCE. On Page 3, you can see SCE's key fourth quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I would like to highlight 4 items that accounted for much of the variance.
First, EPS increased by $0.16 related to higher revenue. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.22 of this increase due to the escalation mechanism from the 2018 GRC decision. There was also a negative variance of $0.11, primarily related to benefits captured in our tax balancing account. This is offset in the income tax line with no effect on earnings.
FERC and other operating revenue had a positive variance of $0.05, largely due to higher rate base. Second, O&M had a positive variance of $0.11, primarily due to higher regulatory deferrals related to wildfire mitigation activities and customer uncollectibles, and from approval of the GRC track 2 settlement. Third, depreciation had a negative variance of $0.07 due to higher rate base.
Lastly, SCE's EPS in the quarter was lower by $0.07 because of dilution from the increase in shares outstanding, primarily associated with the equity offering in May 2020.
I would now like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast, which are shown on Page 4. We continue to see opportunities to significantly grow SCE's rate base, driven by investments in electric infrastructure. The capital program reflects expenditures of $15 billion to $16 billion between 2021 and 2023. This represents compound annual rate base growth of 7.6%, over 2 rate case periods at the request level. Our total CapEx forecast during this period is unchanged as we are awaiting a proposed decision in SCE's 2021 GRC track 1.
In 2020, SCE's capital spending was $5.5 billion, approximately $400 million higher than forecast, primarily as a result of higher fire restoration costs. For 2021, SCE has developed, and will execute against a robust capital plan that targets key programs, while maintaining flexibility in later years to adapt to levels authorized in the final GRC decision.
Please turn to Page 5. While the commission schedule calls for a proposed decision this quarter on track 1 of SCE's 2021 GRC, based on the level of inquiry to date from the CPUC compared to our past experience, we believe it is unlikely that SCE will receive a PD by the end of the first quarter. We remain hopeful that SCE will receive a PD in the second quarter. As a reminder, the CPUC can vote out a final decision no sooner than 30 days after it issues a proposed decision. Consistent with our prior practice, we will issue earnings guidance after we receive a final decision on the GRC.
Page 6 shows a summary of the substantial progress on receiving approvals for recovery of incremental wildfire mitigation costs. SCE expects to receive over $1 billion of cash flow through September 2022 as the utility implements CPUC approval. This is in addition to ongoing securitization of AB 1054 capital. You may recall that last quarter, the CPUC issued a financing order, authorizing SCE to securitize the first tranche of AB 1054 capital expenditures approved in the grid safety and resiliency plan settlement. Yesterday, SCE successfully closed that securitization, issuing $338 million of AAA-rated recovery bonds. The proceeds will be used to repay short-term borrowings issued for AB 1054 capital expenditures.
In January, the CPUC approved SCE's GRC track 2 settlement, which allows SCE to request another financing order to securitize the approved AB 1054 capital expenditures and recover the O&M expense. Additionally, SCE filed a WEMA application for wildfire insurance premium for the second half of 2020. If approved, SCE will recover $215 million beginning January 2022.
I would now like to provide an update on the approximately $1 billion equity issuance that we had discussed previously. As Pedro noted, SCE has been making significant progress resolving pending wildfire-related litigation, and thus far, has settled claims that represent approximately 2/3 of the best estimate that we established. We continue to ground our financing plan in a framework that supports investment-grade ratings by targeting consolidated FFO-to-debt in the 15% to 17% range.
To support this outcome, EIX will issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content in 2021, consistent with the previously identified need.
We will consider a range of options to achieve this equity content, including preferred equity, internal programs, and, if needed, our existing ATM program. We will be flexible regarding the specific timing and monitor market conditions to efficiently finance the need.
Beyond this year, we expect to have minimal equity needs associated with our ongoing capital program, and will quantify these after receiving a final decision in the 2021 GRC.
Overall, the company is well positioned to achieve the growth associated with the safety and resiliency investments being made in the grid, and the longer-term opportunity associated with our clean energy objectives. That concludes my remarks."

As we've mentioned before, we think that the equity plan that we have in place or the financing plan that we have in -- have had in place and announced last year is very supportive of the FFO-to-debt range that we're targeting and supportive of investment-grade ratings.

Kevin Payne is also on the line, so he can add as he sees fit. So just a process, you saw the letter that President Batjer sent, you monitored the hearing that the PUC had for Kevin, and Steve Powell and other members of the team participated. That provided a lot of, frankly, good helpful input from commissioners and communities and other state agencies. Based on that, SCE developed the action plan that has a series of steps and commitments. You saw there are some things in there around or, frankly, continuing work on trying to minimize just the impact and scope of PSPS. I would put that in the category of work that's been going on and continuous, right? Areas like [indiscernible] sectionalization and to work on continuous improvement of weather modeling and the like to -- just really to help to narrow the gap between the approach we have, which is, frankly, the right approach for SCE to have of notifying customers based on forecast conditions, but then de-energizing on real-time conditions. But the more that we can narrow the gap between the number of customers that get notified versus those get de-energized by having better and better forecasting and modeling, that helps.
So you saw some actions around those lines, but, say, a lot of the focus was really on, how do we help the SCE team better improve the communications process, communications with the emergency agencies, with government, with community leaders, with end use customers. And so you saw a number of actions around that.
In terms of process, there's going to be a series of meetings every couple of weeks for the next while with commission staff just to continue to keep them updated. SCE has taken the step of now dedicating a Vice President to PSPS, who's, frankly, a pretty strong leader back to SCE, and he's moving from the T&D business to over the next few months, spend all of his time, along with the dedicated team, on the PSPS improvement approach. So that's -- I'd say it's somewhat informal process. And then there's the action plan, more formality to it and formal discussions with the commission on how it's coming along and check-ins with them. But frankly, wanting to make sure that the SCE team can move on all the elements and meet its commitments. Kevin, anything you would add there?"

Edison Carrier Solutions, which is essentially a competitive telco inside the utility, that not only does sell antenna attachments, but also has managed fiber services, dark fiber as well as lit fiber, providing bandwidth to carriers. And so in SCE's case, there's that broader telecom business it also operates under a little different framework. I noticed that [indiscernible] there's some revenue sharing that the PG&E deal contemplates. But the SCE business operates under a different revenue sharing mechanism. So there's just a number of different bells and whistles that are made for just different maturity of the business and different scope and scale today. So my -- the PG&E transaction might not be fully transferable or applicable."

Look, I think the headline is that -- we continue to view California as one of the most constructive states in the country when it comes to utility regulation, right? And it's both because of the backward-looking and current mechanisms, like the fact that we have our forward-looking rate cases, we have the balancing accounts for elements like procurement purchases, energy procurement, I should say. We have decoupling, right? So you have a number of elements that have been here for quite a while that make for a constructive environment.
You also have, frankly, looking more towards the future, a state that's been fairly aggressive in terms of wanting to push the edge of technology and have -- has wanted utilities to play a significant role in advancing the ball for the sector, right, for the benefit of California customers. That's meant that utilities has to take on some added operational risks in managing more distributed resources than our peers in other states or -- and having deeper penetration renewables or being earlier in the curve around storage and the like. And that has lent itself to providing an opportunity for ROEs that have reflected a premium based on those risks that we are being asked to manage.
And then finally, looking solidly well out in the future, it's a state that is really committed to decarbonizing the economy. And so you've seen through our papers like Pathway 2045 and [indiscernible] the grid papers that we see that, that decarbonization getting to net zero for the state will require a significant ramp-up in renewable and other carbon-free resources along with storage. This will lead to a dramatic increase in load across the state, 60% or so increase in order to then electrify a lot of the economy, and that all requires a really robust grid with significant more investment than what we have in place today to make that all happen. So that all adds up to a good opportunity for utilities.
Now -- by the way, it's also a good opportunity for the customer because, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see all of that been leading ultimately to a 30% decline in the total energy cost that the average customer has had in 2045. It may put some pressure on utility bills, but it will help bring down overall cost for the customer and make the states more affordable.
Now that said, there are always bumps in the road. There are things that can give [indiscernible] pause. The wildfire experience has been a challenging one over the last several years. We've had a lot of encouragement in getting items like AB 1054 to help create a restored framework. We're still going through implementation of that. I know that there's some discount that the utilities are carrying today relative to our peers in other states. And hopefully, over time, as investors see that the framework is working, that the physical risks are being mitigated and that the structure is there to help mitigate the financial side of the risk, too, that will help to get investors fully comfortable with that and better align the value of California opportunities for the long-term opportunity that we have.
One final item is there's a lot going on, and it's all going on in the middle of COVID. So I feel for the CPUC staff, the 800-or-so of them have a lot on their plates. I think President Batjer, as I've mentioned in the comments, has done a great leadership and focusing the commission on that clean energy future. I think, generally, she's also helped the commission to, in general, be timely in decisions, and you saw that in elements like the track 2 success we had recently, but there's a lot on their plate. So while I'm a little disappointed that we may not end up seeing a GRC track 1 PD this quarter, I know that they're on the case, and they recognize the importance of overall timely decisions. And then when it comes to the PSPS, there has been some tough feedback we got. So a lot of it, frankly, was merited. And it's a good learning opportunity, and I commend Kevin Payne and the team at SCE for having sat there for 4.5 hours and listened and take a note and reflected good feedback in the PSPS action plan that SCE filed. So there will be bumps in the road in any relationship. But I think, overall, if you look at -- maybe a couple of trees to get in the way now and then. But if you look at the forest, it's a really interesting forest for the long term."

I think our Pathway 2045 paper at the time was forecasting something like a need for 7 million electric vehicles in California by 2030. At the time -- or shortly after, I think the state was talking about a $5 million mark. Since then, you've seen the state really look at doubling down on the electric vehicles and progress like Governor Newsom's executive order for zero-emission vehicles -- 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035. That says something right there about the growing commitment by the state and, frankly, driven by growing realization that -- that is a key tool and one of the most affordable tools to get to decarbonization at the end of the day.
The other angle, I'd share on this is then there's the market, right? And so when we start talking about this, there was Bolt. I remember when I got my first Bolt in 2011, the new model year, my colleagues were driving some of the first Telsas, there were a whole lot of EVs out. Now you're looking at a rollout, is reading one of the latest articles where, I think, over the next year, there's going to be, what, something like 20 or 30 new model offerings across auto OEMs and it's an area where U.S. automakers are realizing that if they don't run fast, they could lose leadership to Chinese automakers or European automakers.
So seeing things like Ford's commitment of $20-some billion investment towards EVs over the next several years, seeing GM's aspiration to not have internal combustion engines anymore in a decade or so, that is a very different landscape from where we started 4, 5 years ago. And it tells you that this is happening, it's real, and I suspect, like other technology innovations, like the deployment of cellphones, folks may be surprised by how quickly that escrow takes off."

So that delta in the capital spending between last quarter and this quarter was largely driven by wildfire restoration costs. So you will recall that late last year, there were a number of large fires in our service territory, particularly up in the northern part of our service territory around Big Creek. And so a lot of the spend that's been going on since then has been to really get all of those facilities back into service and to repair them, et cetera.
So that's really the driver there, Michael. We have to go through an analysis and see sort of what in there was otherwise going to have been replaced or upgraded, et cetera, what's incremental, but that's largely the capital change from last quarter.
In terms of transmission, we're still in the cycle. I think, obviously, the state is planning for the future, the future that Pedro just described in his earlier remarks. And we have to look to the CAISO to do that planning. There's obviously a lot of work going on around the need as well, both in Integrated Resources Plan -- Integrated Resources Plan as well as the CAISO, but I'll let Pedro share his thoughts as well."

But that analysis estimated that California would need to add 80 gigawatts of bulk power kind of wholesale level renewables and 30 gigawatts of wholesale bulk power level storage by 2045, that's in addition to 30 gigawatts of distributed generation and 10 gigawatts of distributed behind-the-meter storage. But all that would require something like $175 billion investment for the resource side for the renewables and storage side. And the counterpart to that is that you need something like $70 billion in why your site investment, with most of that being for transmission, whether it's new lines or enhancing of current lines.
Now that's statewide, right? So that's not all SCE, but that just gives you a sense of how big the investment need will be in order to accommodate that electrified future to decarbonize the economy. And then as a reminder that, under the current per quarter 1,000 structure, if the Cal ISO determines that an existing line needs to be upgraded, then the utility has right of first refusal to do that upgrade on its line, lines that it already owns and operates. If it's a brand-new line, that's not an extension of an existing line, then that is bid out competitively. And I would expect the utility to seek to compete with third parties for that new build.
So hard to quantify what the specific SCE opportunity will be from all of that, but it's clearly a very large pie that will need to be met across the state. And I expect that SCE will certainly play a significant role within its territory for that."

My guess is that -- or my sense is, not guess, my sense from the analysis is that a lot of that spend may be post 2030 spend, because that's when you really see the load pickup, too. In our analysis, load, which has been fairly flat statewide to slightly declining for the last decade. To 2030, interestingly, continues to be fairly flattish, right, because you have a lot of electrification between now and 2030 being counterbalanced by continued distributed generation deployment as well as continued energy efficiency.
But we see a big elbow -- turn in the curve upswing post 2030, and that's where the state really picks up the bulk of that 60% load increase that I talked about before. It really happens mostly between 2030 and 2045. So that may suggest that a good chunk of that build maybe post that. But in the meantime, you've seen our capital spend so far, as Maria described, we had a bump up from just that Creek fire restoration last year. So I hope we don't have to do fire restoration like that for any future fires. But we continue to say that we see an ongoing opportunity for significant capital spend just for the core capital investment in the utility. And so I -- to think about the long-haul transmission that becomes an adder, that certainly supports the long-term growth for the company."

Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.79 compared to $0.63 a year ago. However, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2021 General Rate Case. SCE recognized revenue from CPUC activities for both the first quarter 2020 and 2021 largely based on 2020 authorized base revenue requirements. Maria will discuss our financial performance in her remarks. 
Investors have been asking us about how we view Edison's risk profile given all the news reports that California is headed into another peak wildfire season with above-average risk. As I have shared before, 2019 and 2020 were also above-average risk years, with 2020 setting records for acres burn. However, and this is a really important however, the state has successfully avoided the scale of catastrophic damage seen in 2017 and 2018. 
I would like to highlight 3 key factors that have significantly improved our risk profile: state investments to improve firefighting, CPUC progress on AB 1054 implementation and SCE's own wildfire mitigation work. 
So first, the state has increased investments in firefighting capabilities over the last several years. Incorporating the governor's 2021 to 2022 proposed budget, which continues this trend, this would represent a 45% increase in CAL FIRE's budget since 2016, a 30% increase in firefighters at the peak of the season since 2019 and significant increases in equipment and modeling to enhance the state's wildfire-suppression capabilities. 
For example, the state is expected to have 7 large air tankers operating this fire season and another 5 in 2022. These enhanced suppression resources will help the state move more quickly to combat wildfires before they become catastrophic. The proposed budget also adds a focus on wildfire prevention, and the governor and the legislature have already taken early action. Earlier this month, they approved $536 million to accelerate land and forest management projects laid out in the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan and an additional $80 million for roughly 1,400 new CAL FIRE firefighters for the 2021 fire season. We have also seen significant staff and resource additions in our local fire departments to aid response times and firefighting capacity. 
The second risk improvement factor is that the CPUC has made steady and timely progress over the past nearly 2 years enacting AB 1054 provisions has designed. For instance, shortly after the legislature passed AB 1054, the CPUC opened the proceeding on an emergency basis to establish the nonbypassable charge that funds about half of the wildfire insurance fund. Another indicator is that the commission has approved each of SCE's annual safety certifications in a timely manner. This certification is a key step in implementing the pudency standard that AB 1054 codified, where utilities conduct is deemed reasonable if it has a valid safety certification unless serious data is created. Importantly, this standard will go on beyond the life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund. The commission established its Wildfire Safety division, providing additional wildfire safety oversight and direction. 
Lastly, the CPUC has completed numerous wildfire-related decisions on a timely pace despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The commission has also been proactive in engaging with the IOUs on Public Safety Power Shutoff or PSPS execution, at the same time, acknowledging that it is within the utility's discretion to use this crucial tool to protect the public safety. Taken together, these are all signs that AB 1054's intent is being implemented steadily as designed. 
The third risk improvement factor is SCE's own work to reduce wildfire risk. Fire mitigation has been an integral part of SCE's operational practices for years, and the utility has had several programs in place to manage and reduce wildfire risk. As climate change intensified wildfire risk, the utility stepped up its comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy and has made substantial progress, particularly through its WMP. 
In 2021, SCE continues to invest in its infrastructure and new technologies to mitigate the risk of fires from electric infrastructure, increase accuracy and fire weather forecasting, enhance its operational practices and improve its PSPS program. SCE has assembled a dedicated PSPS readiness team to address the feedback from customers, public safety partners, elected officials and regulatory agencies. The utility is accelerating the pace of coverage conductor deployment and expects to install at least 1,000 additional circuit miles by year-end. At this pace, SCE will have hardened over 2,500 miles or over 25% of all its overhead distribution infrastructure and high-fire-risk areas, substantially reducing the risk of wildfires associated with the utility equipment. 
So this combination of investment and actions by the state of California, the CPUC and SCE gives us increasing confidence in Edison International's improved risk profile with respect to wildfires. Slides 2 and 3 in our deck provide additional information on SCE's year-to-date wildfire-mitigation activities and on the state's actions over the last few years. This work is also a building block for longer-term reliability and resiliency, which will be essential as electrification increases dramatically across the entire economy for decarbonization. 
Now speaking of decarbonization. We agree with the goals of President Biden's $2.25 trillion infrastructure proposal to address climate change; create well-paying jobs; improve air quality, particularly in our most vulnerable communities; and increase our global competitiveness. That future requires substantial deployment of TVs, electrification of buildings and new investments in electric infrastructure to ensure clean, reliable and resilient electric service for this greater demand. We look forward to working with the administration and leaders in Congress to develop and implement the complementary policies that will effectively meet the nationally determined contribution or NDC target of 50% to 52% greenhouse gas reductions across the economy relative to 2005. 
This is in close alignment with what SCE outlined in its Pathway 2045 white paper. And Edison has already stated its support for this economy-wide target prior to the NBC's release. As highlighted in Pathway 2045, the least expensive way to achieve economy-wide decarbonization is through an equitable clean energy future with increasing amounts of carbon-free generation powering the further electrification of the economy. The average customer will also benefit from a decline in total energy costs of 1/3, thanks to the greater efficiency of electric technologies. Slides 4, 5 and 6 in our earnings deck provide you with additional information on our views in these areas. 
SCE has a long track record in maintaining affordability. But in the near term, customers will see increases in their bills as SCE invests in grid hardening and mix the investments needed to support clean energy goals and the long-term affordability that they will yield. For over a decade, SCE has proactively pursued cost-reduction efforts as well as improvements in areas like reliability through its operational excellence efforts. 
We expect to do more. And embedding more digital tools deep in our operations, areas like inspections and vegetation management, will enable efficiencies in how we work and better harness data to improve asset management and performance and reduce risk. Building a more robust capability and lean process management will help us drive these efficiencies and create a stronger basis to use automation and other technology to streamline our operations. Fundamentally, delivering value to our customers starts with being an excellent and safe operator through the safe delivery of reliable and affordable electricity. 
Well, let me close my comments by acknowledging yesterday's news that our colleague and good friend, Carla Peterman, SCE's SVP of Strategy and Regulatory Affairs, will be leading us on May 7 for a new role as PG&E's Executive VP of Corporate Affairs. We are very sad to lose Carla after a great -- really great 1.5 years together. But we wish her well as she takes on the important and very challenging task of helping Patti Poppe and her new leadership team turn around PG&E's operations and their relationships with their stakeholders and communities. California needs all of its utilities to be healthy and strong. So I am really glad our states will continue to benefit from Carla's talent.

My comments today will cover first quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast, key regulatory filings and updates on other financial topics. Edison International reported core earnin",878,"Thanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover first quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast, key regulatory filings and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $0.79 per share for the first quarter 2021, an increase of $0.16 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2021 General Rate Case. 
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key first quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I would like to highlight a handful of items that accounted for much of the variance. To begin, revenue was higher by $0.05 per share. FERC-related revenue contributed $0.03 to this variance primarily due to higher rate base. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.02 to this variance. However, this was offset by balancing account expenses with no effect on earnings. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.20 largely due to lower wildfire mitigation-related O&M and lower employee benefits expenses. Wildfire mitigation expenses were lower in the first quarter primarily because fewer remediations were identified through the inspection process. There was also a negative variance of $0.08 from an increase in depreciation due to a higher asset base. 
Lower net financing costs had a positive variance of $0.08 due to several items, including lower interest rates on balancing accounts and lower preferred dividends due to the redemption of preferred stock at SCE last year. Finally, SCE's EPS in the quarter was $0.04 lower because of dilution from the increase in shares outstanding primarily associated with the equity offering in May 2020. 
I would now like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast, which are shown on Page 8. Our capital and rate base forecasts are unchanged from the last quarter, pending a final decision in SCE's 2021 GRC Track 1. SCE is executing against a capital plan that targets key programs while maintaining flexibility in later years to adapt to what is ultimately authorized in the GRC decision. 
The rate base forecast does not include certain projects and programs that are not yet approved. This includes the Customer Service Replatform Project or CSRP, which went operational earlier this month. SCE expects to file an application for cost recovery for CSRP later this year. And if approved, this could add approximately $500 million to rate base by 2023. 
It also does not reflect capital spending on fire restoration related to wildfires affecting SCE's facilities and equipment in late 2020. SCE is evaluating the cost to determine how much may be incremental to the current rate base forecast. 
Please turn to Page 9. On the regulatory front, we remain hopeful that SCE will receive a proposed decision on Track 1 of its 2021 GRC this quarter. As a reminder, the CPUC can vote out a final decision no sooner than 30 days after it issues a proposed decision. Consistent with our prior practice, we will issue earnings guidance after we receive a final decision on the GRC. 
Additionally, SCE filed its testimony in Track 3 of the '21 -- 2021 GRC in the first quarter. In Track 3, SCE is requesting recovery of $497 million in revenue requirement and that the CPUC find reasonable $679 million of incremental wildfire-mitigation capital expenditures. This filing is another step towards recovery of wildfire-mitigation costs we have already incurred. 
Page 10 provides a summary of the approved and pending cost recovery applications for incremental wildfire-related costs, including Track 3, which I just mentioned. 
As you can see on Page 11, in the coming months, SCE will request a financing order that would allow it to securitize the cost authorized in GRC Track 2, residential uncollectibles for 2020 and additional AB 1054 capital authorized in GRC Track 1. We expect SCE's total request to be approximately $1 billion, composed of $500 million of AB 1054-related capital, $400 million of wildfire mitigation-related O&M and $100 million of incremental residential uncollectible expenses associated with the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Related to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events, SCE continues to make solid progress settling the remaining individual plaintiff claims. As shown on Page 12, during the first quarter, SCE resolved approximately $200 million of individual plaintiff claims. It resolved claims to approximately $4.2 billion, representing more than 2/3 of the best estimate of total losses, which remains unchanged. 
I would now like to provide an update on the EIX financing plan and the issuance of securities with up to $1 billion of equity content that we discussed on our last earnings call. To reiterate our previous statements, this equity content supports maintaining investment-grade ratings at EIX and the utility. During the first quarter, Edison International issued $1.25 billion of preferred stock with equity content of approximately $625 million. We will continue to monitor market conditions and consider additional preferred equity, internal programs, and if needed, the existing at-the-market program to satisfy the balance of the equity content need this year. 
Beyond 2021, we continue to expect to have minimal equity needs associated with SCE's ongoing capital program, and we will quantify these after receiving a final decision in the 2021 GRC. 
That concludes my remarks."

And as you don't see the administration provides last week the start to their plan through the NDC, but lots of details to be filled in, not only by the administration,",713,"Yes. To give you a few high-level thoughts, Jeremy, and as you said, it's early here. And as you don't see the administration provides last week the start to their plan through the NDC, but lots of details to be filled in, not only by the administration, but then also ultimately by Congress, right? And so with divided Congress, I expect that Anything happens in Washington, at least on the conventional side, will have to be bipartisan, and therefore, something that Porcari can work with. 
I think at the highest level, we -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we absolutely support the overall economy-wide direction and the 50% to 52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2000 -- by 2030. 
As you've seen the initial elements of the Biden plan, clean energy, electrification and transmission are all big parts of the plan. And they line up really nicely with what we've been saying is the most feasible and cheapest way for California to get there through our Pathway 2025 work. So that's really good aligners of strategy, and I think it just provides long-term support what we've been talking about for the last several years of -- from an SCE perspective, making the investments needed to prepare the grid to be able to manage that transition to support customers, see electrifying building, space and water heating, electrifying transportation. 
And then I think in terms of the core utility investment, what that means is, I think, most importantly, support for the core program that we've outlined. I know they don't provide guidance beyond the right cycle to date. But we have said that we expect to see this very robust spending need -- investment need for the next several years, certainly well pass the rate case. 
And really, as you look at on a California-wide basis, we have estimated in Pathway 2045 that the investment need will be something like $250 billion or so across the need for clean energy resources, renewables, storage and transmission investment. The transmission part of that around transmission and distribution part is around $75 billion. And I think one of the charts in the deck provided a little detail on that. 
So I think it's Page 6 show the $75 billion breakout for the state. So a long way of saying, we think that that's all supportive of the core investment opportunity as well as some upside opportunities, to the extent of the utility and so needing to play a role in California be on core rate investments or, for example, for added storage or for programs like our Charge Ready 2 and Charge Ready transports that we have underway right now. 
One final thing I'll say is that there was more press this morning. And Ping trail person and Biden have talked about getting the power sector itself on a solo basis to 0 GHG by 2035, and there's now discussion about potentially setting a target of 80% reductions from 2005 levels for the power sector by 2030. 
Speaking here both from an Edison perspective and from a broader industry perspective, we're all lined up to do as much as we can as fast as we can at a national level. 80% may really be stretching, I think, the feasibility for the nationwide transition just given the fact that it's 9 years until ban. There's still R&D and technology that's needed to help fill the gaps and significant technology deployment that would be needed, particularly on the transmission side. It's not just the capital investment but the permitting process that can take quite a while. 
So our Pathway 2045 analysis actually concluded that California would see something like a 72% decrease in greenhouse calcination from 2005 levels by 2030. I've seen some national analysis from EPRI and others that suggest that the national number on an aggressive pathway might still be below 70%, maybe mid-60s or so. So I think there will be a lot of discussions among the industry, the administration and Congress will be on what defines what -- as much as we can do we can do. What defines the art of that? And how do we make sure that the transition is reliable, affordable and equitable for all customers across the country."

And AB 1054 did not resolve inverse condemnation, but it created a fair framework. And so I think that they went a long ways and in our view, significantly reduced the risk exposure for utilities across the state. 
In terms of changing the state's current approach on inverse itself, I think it's unlikely you'd see legislative action anytime soon because, quite frankly, there's been a lot of work billet, which on wildfire issues already for AB 1054. They have a full agenda in helping the economy recover from the pandemic. So I wouldn't expect that there'd be a whole lot of bandwidth for taking that up in the near term. 
There is always a possibility that there could be court cases where inverse could be tested again and challenged again. Probably premature to go into details of specific court cases, but I'm aware that not only might there be some that pop up for us as we go through our case load, but other utilities also may have opportunities to challenge inverse. So that's always a possibility out there through the court system."

And that's why I dedicated the first part of my comments to framing that. I guess I would recap one part and maybe add a little bit. The recap part is that we do see and I think all the external forecasts that we see are calling for a likely above-average fire risk peak period here. 
I think in terms of the mitigation, I went through them in a fair amount of detail. Maybe what I would add is that to remind you that the approach we have taken over the last several years has been a risk-informed approach. So when we went to replace the first mile of bare wire with cover conductor, it was the mile that was in one of the highest-risk areas possible, right? So we've been going down the stack, if you will, by trying to address the highest-risk areas first where the mitigations would have the highest impact on risk reduction. So every piece of work we do is reducing the risk, and we've gone after the big bites early on. 
That, I think, is really helpful and constructive in terms of framing that risk profile. That risk profile continues to narrow. And that's the stuff we've been doing. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've also seen the states dedicate just outstanding effort to improving firefighting modeling and just firefighting capabilities, fire-suppression capabilities. 
And so that ability now that the state has that, frankly, it didn't have in 2017 or 2018 to fight multiple large fire simultaneously. You might recall, I mentioned some really interesting L.A. Times articles around 2018, and the challenge that the state had in fighting the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire and the Hill Fire all simultaneously, well, the other states added a lot of qualified bodies with a lot more planes and trucks and equipment to be able to deploy across multiple fronts simultaneously. And that is a significant piece of risk reduction for all of us. 
So I'm not sure I can give you a disclosure-quality quantified answer this is. So therefore, it's [ 6.5% ] lower. But I think it's a significant percent difference in terms of the overall risk profile that the state faces and that therefore we face right now."

One is the actual -- the physical execution of it and the planning for it, the engineering behind it and then the execution. The second would be the broad communications element. 
I think that SCE has done, frankly, pretty well in terms of the core execution for the last several years, right? We -- utility had significant prior investment in sectionalizing the grid. I remember reporting to you all in earnings call, probably going 1 year, 1.5 years back about how, at that point, something like -- if you look at our circuits in high-fire-risk areas, on average, it could be cordoned off into 4 separate sections, right, which allowed us to better target a PSPS event. Well, we continue to add segmentation, sectionalization devices to circuits in high-fire-risk areas. So that continues to hone down the scope of PSPS events. 
Through that and through better planning from '19 to '20, now to '21, we've seen significant improvements in terms of the number of customers who have been impacted in given events. Now I have to add, though, that this is all very much weather-driven. And so a lot of what happened in 2020 was that we had some tough weather events to necessitate using this tool of last resort as a last resort, right? And so that goes from the numbers. 
But even if you look now at the various filings that the utilities have made through the WMP process, if you take a look at the numbers, I think Edison has actually had -- on a percentage of total customers basis has the lowest percent of customers who are impacted by PSPS in the 2020 season. 
Importantly, the continued work from '20 to '21 has -- we believe will allow Edison to significantly reduce the impact further for customers who were impacted last year if we have the same weather as we did last year. Of course, we won't have the very same weather. But from an assumption basis, we would see, I think, pretty significant reduction in the impact. I think the number is over 20% or close to 30% reduction in impact to customers who were impacted last year. So lots of good things in terms of the modern capabilities, being able to triage it down and restrict the impact of any one event. 
On the communication side, I think, is where we had more opportunity, and frankly, got some pretty pointed feedback deservedly from customers and communities and local governments. And so if you look at the action plan that SCE filed in February, there's a lot there on continuing to do better at the things that we were doing okay at and also doing much better than things that we didn't do so okay at.
And so that's where you see a lot of focus on how do we have more timely communications with customers, with communities, with local governments, with emergency operation centers, improving the quality of those communications and the vehicles for them. And so that's an area where I hope our customer -- expect our customers will say a good improvement going into this next peak season. 
Maria, what have I missed in there?"

So I think our cadence is about every 2 weeks now. So it really does provide an opportunity for us to have an ongoing dialogue around what it is that SCE is doing.

But the PUC has been moving expeditiously through a whole lot of stuff. And you throw in a pandemic into the mix, and frankly, I think they performed pretty admirably given the amount of -- the number of balls they juggle under blue skies. And then you make the skies a lot tougher with COVID-19 and the impacts on their own operations of that as well as the extra volume of work that COVID created, right? So frankly, I think they've been doing all right. We all have. 
The GRC is a complex case. And obviously, we had hoped that we would have had a PD by now. But we're still hopeful that we'll have a PD by the end of this quarter, as Maria mentioned in her comments. And I'm not -- I don't think we're seeing anything systemic there that says there's a problem. The process is broken, on the contrary. We provided a number of examples in the prepared remarks around things like safety certifications for Edison, the disposition of a number of the cost recovery accounts. 
So I just think they have a lot going on under difficult times. And obviously, we'd like to see a PD for the GRC soon, and we'll do our part for that. But we're not sensing that there's something grinding the gears down more systemically. 
Maria, anything you say differently then?"

That's inspections that we do, we found fewer areas that we had to remediate. But I think more broadly, there are still costs associated with mitigating this risk. 
We've talked before, and in fact, the commission convened an on bond not too long ago to talk about affordability. And so as we do that, we continue to focus people on the necessity for the wildfire-mitigation expenditures that we and other IOUs are doing that, that goes squarely to maintaining the safety of our communities. 
And then over the longer term, looking at what it really means to our electric grades as we further electrify the economy, what that means for rates but then also what it means for the energy bill itself. And so I think as we think about affordability, we and the commission and other stakeholders are looking at it from different perspectives, total share of wallet that energy represents, so not just the electric bill. 
Affordability has been defined a few different ways by the commission, things like how many hours do you have to work at minimum wage in order to pay your electric bill. I think it's going to be an ongoing discussion. But we do know that wildfire mitigation is very important to the safety of our communities, and we know that a broader electrification is important for the greenhouse gas and environmental objectives that the state has. And that's important because as we do that and we think about affordability, it's also about being equitable and having all of our community also participate in that improvement in the environment. 
So I think it's going to be an ongoing discussion. The commission's rightfully focused on it, and we have been focused on it as well, as Pedro mentioned, over a many year cycle, trying to manage our costs. And then as we further electrify the economy, allowing that to help increase affordability as well."

I want to make sure I'm not double counting here because if I think about it, you've still got a good chunk of cash coming in the door, as outlined on the items in Slide 10 and then almost $2 billion -- a little over $2 billion of securitization on Slide 11. Should I think about those 2 sources as more-than-ample-enough cash to fund the cash outflow that you're going to require when you finalized settlements or when the litigation gets finalized from the 2017 and '18 wildfires?"

So some of the things that we talk about on Page 10 end up being securitized on Page 11. So it's probably easier if we kind of maybe can separately go through, and I'll take and tie the numbers for you. 
The more general response to your question is we do have cash that we have already spent on wildfire mitigation. This will -- these securitizations and/or recoveries through rates as we continue to file the application will allow us to sort of get that cash back in the door. So some of the pressure that you've seen often expressed through the issuance of short-term debt in the past or funded through short-term debt in the past will be alleviated. 
I think from a claims perspective, what we've said before is that EIX has issued equity or preferred equity in the past in order to sustain the credit metrics and the investment-grade ratings both at the utility and the holding company. And that equity issuance allows SCE to continue to debt finance the claims payments as they come due now that we're -- shortly, we'll be past the insurance recovery. And so they'll be able to do that. And subject to the waiver that they have, they can keep that debt outside of the capital structure. 
Over time -- cash is all fungible as we're putting dollars down there. That may impact the exact timing of when they do their debt financings. But over time, there'll be funding their business in accordance with their authorized capital structure. 
So I think that's the general framework. I think the numbers on Slides 10 and 11, there's a little bit, as I said, of overlap between applications. And then we translate that into securitizations on Page 11. And we can go over that in more detail, if you like, later on."

And you've already seen over the last few years, things that were near term that materialized, right? So we're going to have our Charge Ready programs and forecast for quite a while until we got approval of those applications. But now we have over $800 million of program, and of that, it's probably what 3 plus 2 some -- certainly over $0.5 billion worth of CapEx coming from those Make Ready programs for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. So that's an example of one where we were talking about it for a few years, went through the process, developed and designed a program and got PUC support for this. 
I think as you look at the near term -- near midterm, in next decade or half a decade, storage is an opportunity that could present some potential upside because for storage, I think a lot of that will be done by third parties and -- whether it's large-scale or the BPAs or whether it's customers down the customer premise. But there may be opportunities for utility-level grid-side storage. You've seen us do already some of that. The rate case included some assumptions about a modest level. 
But particularly as we see the acceleration of things like vehicle electrification, that might lend itself to places where it might make sense to reinforce a substation with more storage as we did with Neuroma, where we put in 20 megawatts of batteries a few years ago. So that's kind of a near term or, call it, midterm one. 
I think longer term, the upside is in transmission. And of course, we have [ for quarter 1000 ] with competition for transmission. We want to make sure that the utility is able to compete. However, I'll remind you that for projects that are upgrades of existing utility on projects, the utility has the right of first refusal. And just given the scale of wires investment that we think is needed, that's -- I would hypothesize handily that there will be probably some projects that are upgrades of existing lines where maybe we haven't conceived that yet. We really are going to be dependent on the California independent system operator to run through its transmission planning process and determine the transmission that's needed for renewables by 2030 and later on by 2045. So I think transmission presents another offset opportunity. 
Finally, very -- coming way back down to the Bermudan there near term. I know Maria mentioned this, but just to remind you that we have our Customer Service Replatform Project, and that could be $500 million of rate base additions, if approved by the commission. We just went live with that in early April. And then there could also be some additional rate base additions from the wildfire restoration work that we did in 2020 out of the Creek Fire. We haven't quantified that yet externally, but we're finalizing that analysis now. So those are much more kind of blocking-and-tackling near-term opportunities."

We probably won't be able to help you very much there, unfortunately, because those are confidential negotiations. I think we did share that there's good news in that we now have a process both for the Thomas, Koenigstein mudslide plaintiffs as well as for the Wolfspeed plaintiffs -- individual plaintiffs. So there's an established process approved by the court that allows us to have smoother approach to working our way through several thousand cases that remain. 
I would also say -- you mentioned there are smaller ones remaining. When you think -- they're smaller relative to say the subrogation settlements that we did earlier. But I want to make sure you're not generalizing too much by looking at, say, the dollar amount of settlements we've done with individual plaintiffs so far relative to the number of individual plaintiff cases that we settle and making any assumptions or extrapolating from that about the remaining cases. All of these are solved case-by-case, very individualized. So it's really hard to extrapolate and say, because we did X dollars for these Y plaintiffs, you can use that ratio for the remaining ones. 
It's really case-by-case. I think the one thing we can anchor you on is that we review the reserves, the best estimate every quarter. We did that once again, and you saw that we did not make any changes to that estimate.

Probably the most honest answer I can give you is that it's really early, right? And you're going to see significant discussions between the administration and Congress over the next weeks and -- maybe even months. I think that there's -- in terms of streaming the timing a bit, I would expect that the administration will want to have a plan firmly in place and time for the Glasgow conference of the parties -- the United Nations conference of the parties in November. And so -- and if not, hopefully sooner. 
But the pace, the scale -- I mean you even see it in the discussions we're now on the infrastructure package that's been proposed by the President. And you're hearing $2-plus billion numbers coming from his proposal. You're hearing Republican members talking about packages that are more on the $600 million mark. So that will influence us. The relative degree of emphasis on different levers in the packages and so in the case of transmission, I think it's generally accepted by both sides that transmission will be a key element of the equation. But how that translates into are the federal incentives -- frankly, from our perspective, the things that we would really like to see the federal government do more than just money is focus on the permitting process and helping on the federal side to streamline access to federal lands where we might need to have access for right-of-way for new transmission lines. That alone is probably one of the biggest levers they have to accelerate this because that -- it's that piece, the permitting process, that adds years and years of transmission projects. It can take you a decade to build a transmission project. 
So -- but in any case, Ryan, I'll go back to my first point that it's early in the game, lots of discussions ahead. And those discussions will then guide the level of interest, frankly, muting transmission, but how deeply to go in the power sector by what time frame? How does that compare with how you going deeper in other sectors? To what extent are you using market mechanisms to do that versus more sector-by-sector allocations? All of that is to be determined."

Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.79 compared to $0.63 a year ago.

Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.79 compared to $0.63 a year ago. However, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2021 General Rate Case. SCE recognized revenue from CPUC activities for both the first quarter 2020 and 2021, largely based on 2020 authorized base revenue requirements. Maria will discuss our financial performance in her remarks.
Investors have been asking us about how we view Edison's risk profile given all the news reports that California is headed into another peak wildfire season with above-average risk. As I have shared before, 2019 and 2020 were also above-average risk years, with 2020 setting records for acres burned. However, and this is a really important however, the state has successfully avoided the scale of catastrophic damage seen in 2017 and 2018. I would like to highlight 3 key factors that have significantly improved our risk profile: state investments to improve firefighting, CPUC progress on AB 1054 implementation and SCE's own wildfire mitigation work.
So first, the state has increased investments in firefighting capabilities over the last several years. Incorporating the governor's 2021 to 2022 proposed budget, which continues this trend, this would represent a 45% increase in CAL FIRE's budget since 2016, a 30% increase in firefighters at the peak of the season since 2019 and significant increases in equipment and modeling to enhance the state's wildfire suppression capabilities.
For example, the state is expected to have 7 large air tankers operating this fire season and another 5 in 2022. These enhanced suppression resources will help the state move more quickly to combat wildfires before they become catastrophic. The proposed budget also adds a focus on wildfire prevention, and the governor and the legislature have already taken early action.
Earlier this month, they approved $536 million to accelerate land and forest management projects laid out in the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan and an additional $80 million for roughly 1,400 new CAL FIRE firefighters for the 2021 fire season. We have also seen significant staff and resource additions in our local fire departments to aid response times and firefighting capacity.
The second risk improvement factor is that the CPUC has made steady and timely progress over the past nearly 2 years enacting AB 1054's provisions as designed. For instance, shortly after the legislature passed AB 1054, the CPUC opened the proceeding on an emergency basis to establish the nonbypassable charge that funds about half of the Wildfire Insurance Fund.
Another indicator is that the commission has approved each of SCE's annual safety certifications in a timely manner. This certification is a key step in implementing the pudency standard that AB 1054 codified, where a utility's conduct is deemed reasonable if it has a valid safety certification unless serious doubt is created. Importantly, this standard will go on beyond the life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund. The commission established its Wildfire Safety division, providing additional wildfire safety oversight and direction.
Lastly, the CPUC has completed numerous wildfire-related decisions on a timely pace despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The commission has also been proactive in engaging with the IOUs on Public Safety Power Shutoff, or PSPS, execution, at the same time, acknowledging that it is within the utility's discretion to use this crucial tool to protect the public's safety. Taken together, these are all signs that AB 1054's intent is being implemented steadily as designed.
The third risk improvement factor is SCE's own work to reduce wildfire risk. Fire mitigation has been an integral part of SCE's operational practices for years and the utility has had several programs in place to manage and reduce wildfire risk. As climate change intensified wildfire risk, the utility stepped up its comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy and has made substantial progress, particularly through its WMP.
In 2021, SCE continues to invest in its infrastructure and new technologies to mitigate the risk of fires from electric infrastructure, increase accuracy and fire weather forecasting, enhance its operational practices and improve its PSPS program. SCE has assembled a dedicated PSPS readiness team to address the feedback from customers, public safety partners, elected officials and regulatory agencies. The utility is accelerating the pace of covered conductor deployment and expects to install at least 1,000 additional circuit miles by year-end. At this pace, SCE will have hardened over 2,500 miles or over 25% of all its overhead distribution infrastructure in high-fire-risk areas, substantially reducing the risk of wildfires associated with the utility equipment.
So this combination of investment and actions by the state of California, the CPUC and SCE gives us increasing confidence in Edison International's improved risk profile with respect to wildfires. Slides 2 and 3 in our deck provide additional information on SCE's year-to-date wildfire-mitigation activities and on the state's actions over the last few years. This work is also a building block for longer-term reliability and resiliency, which will be essential as electrification increases dramatically across the entire economy for decarbonization.
Now speaking of decarbonization. We agree with the goals of President Biden's $2.25 trillion infrastructure proposal to address climate change; create well-paying jobs; improve air quality, particularly in our most vulnerable communities; and increase our global competitiveness. That future requires substantial deployment of EVs, electrification of buildings and new investments in electric infrastructure to ensure clean, reliable and resilient electric service for this greater demand.
We look forward to working with the administration and leaders in Congress to develop and implement the complementary policies that will effectively meet the Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, target of 50% to 52% greenhouse gas reductions across the economy relative to 2005.
This is in close alignment with what SCE outlined in its Pathway 2045 white paper. And Edison has already stated its support for this economy-wide target prior to the NBC's release. As highlighted in Pathway 2045, the least expensive way to achieve economy-wide decarbonization is through an equitable clean energy future with increasing amounts of carbon-free generation powering the further electrification of the economy. The average customer will also benefit from a decline in total energy costs of 1/3, thanks to the greater efficiency of electric technologies. Slides 4, 5 and 6 in our earnings deck provide you with additional information on our views in these areas.
SCE has a long track record in maintaining affordability. But in the near term, customers will see increases in their bills as SCE invests in grid hardening and makes the investments needed to support clean energy goals and the long-term affordability that they will yield. For over a decade, SCE has proactively pursued cost-reduction efforts as well as improvements in areas like reliability through its operational excellence efforts.
We expect to do more and embedding more digital tools deep in our operations, areas like inspections and vegetation management, will enable efficiencies in how we work and better harness data to improve asset management and performance and reduce risk. Building a more robust capability and lean process management will help us drive these efficiencies and create a stronger basis to use automation and other technology to streamline our operations. Fundamentally, delivering value to our customers starts with being an excellent and safe operator through the safe delivery of reliable and affordable electricity.
Well, let me close my comments by acknowledging yesterday's news that our colleague and good friend, Carla Peterman, SCE's SVP of Strategy and Regulatory Affairs, will be leading us on May 7 for a new role as PG&E's Executive VP of Corporate Affairs. We are very sad to lose Carla after a great -- really great 1.5 years together. But we wish her well as she takes on the important and very challenging task of helping Patti Poppe and her new leadership team turn around PG&E's operations and their relationships with their stakeholders and communities. California needs all of its utilities to be healthy and strong. So I am really glad our state will continue to benefit from Carla's talent.
With that, Maria will provide her financial report."

My comments today will cover first quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast, key regulatory filings and updates on other financial topics.Edison International reported core earning",881,"Thanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover first quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast, key regulatory filings and updates on other financial topics.
Edison International reported core earnings of $0.79 per share for the first quarter 2021, an increase of $0.16 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2021 General Rate Case.
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key first quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I would like to highlight a handful of items that accounted for much of the variance. To begin, revenue was higher by $0.05 per share. FERC-related revenue contributed $0.03 to this variance primarily due to higher rate base. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.02 to this variance. However, this was offset by balancing account expenses with no effect on earnings.
O&M had a positive variance of $0.20 largely due to lower wildfire mitigation-related O&M and lower employee benefits expenses. Wildfire mitigation expenses were lower in the first quarter primarily because fewer remediations were identified through the inspection process. There was also a negative variance of $0.08 from an increase in depreciation due to a higher asset base.
Lower net financing costs had a positive variance of $0.08 due to several items, including lower interest rates on balancing accounts and lower preferred dividends due to the redemption of preferred stock at SCE last year. Finally, SCE's EPS in the quarter was $0.04 lower because of dilution from the increase in shares outstanding primarily associated with the equity offering in May 2020.
I would now like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast, which are shown on Page 8. Our capital and rate base forecasts are unchanged from the last quarter, pending a final decision in SCE's 2021 GRC Track 1. SCE is executing against a capital plan that targets key programs while maintaining flexibility in later years to adapt to what is ultimately authorized in the GRC decision.
The rate base forecast does not include certain projects and programs that are not yet approved. This includes the Customer Service Replatform Project, or CSRP, which went operational earlier this month. SCE expects to file an application for cost recovery for CSRP later this year. And if approved, this could add approximately $500 million to rate base by 2023.
It also does not reflect capital spending on fire restoration related to wildfires affecting SCE's facilities and equipment in late 2020. SCE is evaluating the cost to determine how much may be incremental to the current rate base forecast.
Please turn to Page 9. On the regulatory front, we remain hopeful that SCE will receive a proposed decision on Track 1 of its 2021 GRC this quarter. As a reminder, the CPUC can vote out a final decision no sooner than 30 days after it issues a proposed decision. Consistent with our prior practice, we will issue earnings guidance after we receive a final decision on the GRC.
Additionally, SCE filed its testimony in Track 3 of the '21 -- 2021 GRC in the first quarter. In Track 3, SCE is requesting recovery of $497 million in revenue requirement and that the CPUC find reasonable $679 million of incremental wildfire-mitigation capital expenditures. This filing is another step towards recovery of wildfire-mitigation costs we have already incurred.
Page 10 provides a summary of the approved and pending cost recovery applications for incremental wildfire-related costs, including Track 3, which I just mentioned. 
As you can see on Page 11, in the coming months, SCE will request a financing order that would allow it to securitize the cost authorized in GRC Track 2, residential uncollectibles for 2020 and additional AB 1054 capital authorized in GRC Track 1. We expect SCE's total request to be approximately $1 billion, composed of $500 million of AB 1054-related capital, $400 million of wildfire mitigation-related O&M and $100 million of incremental residential uncollectible expenses associated with the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Related to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events, SCE continues to make solid progress settling the remaining individual plaintiff claims. As shown on Page 12, during the first quarter, SCE resolved approximately $200 million of individual plaintiff claims. In total, that brings resolved claims to approximately $4.2 billion, representing more than 2/3 of the best estimate of total losses, which remains unchanged.
I would now like to provide an update on the EIX financing plan and the issuance of securities with up to $1 billion of equity content that we discussed on our last earnings call. To reiterate our previous statements, this equity content supports maintaining investment-grade ratings at EIX and the utility. During the first quarter, Edison International issued $1.25 billion of preferred stock with equity content of approximately $625 million. We will continue to monitor market conditions and consider additional preferred equity, internal programs, and if needed, the existing at-the-market program to satisfy the balance of the equity content need this year.
Beyond 2021, we continue to expect to have minimal equity needs associated with SCE's ongoing capital program, and we will quantify these after receiving a final decision in the 2021 GRC.
That concludes my remarks."

And as you we've seen the administration provides last week the start to their plan through the NDC, but lots of details to be filled in, not only by the administration,",728,"Yes. To give you a few high-level thoughts, Jeremy, and as you said, it's early here. And as you we've seen the administration provides last week the start to their plan through the NDC, but lots of details to be filled in, not only by the administration, but then also ultimately by Congress, right? And so with a divided Congress, I expect that anything happens in Washington, at least on the conventional side, will have to be bipartisan and, therefore, something that both parties can work with.
I think at the highest level, we -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we absolutely support the overall economy-wide direction and the 50% to 52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2000 -- by 2030.
As you've seen the initial elements of the Biden plan, clean energy, electrification and transmission are all big parts of the plan. And they line up really nicely with what we've been saying is the most feasible and cheapest way for California to get there through our Pathway 2025 work. So that's really good alignment in terms of strategy, and I think it just provides long-term support for what we've been talking about for the last several years of -- from an SCE perspective, making the investments needed to prepare the grid to be able to manage that transition, to support customers, see electrifying building, space and water heating, electrifying transportation.
And then I think in terms of the core utility investment, what that means is, I think, most importantly, support for the core program that we've outlined. I know that we don't provide guidance beyond the rate case cycle to date. But we have said that we expect to see this very robust spending need -- investment need for the next several years, certainly well past the rate case.
And really, as you look on a California-wide basis, we have estimated in Pathway 2045 that the investment need will be something like $250 billion or so across the need for clean energy resources, renewables, storage and transmission investment. The transmission part of that alone -- transmission and distribution part is around $75 billion. And I think one of the charts in the deck provided a little detail on that.
So I think it's Page 6 that show the $75 billion breakout for the state. So a long way of saying, we think that, that's all supportive of the core investment opportunity as well as some upside opportunities to the extent of the utility and so needing to play a role in California to be on core grid investments or, for example, for added storage or for programs like our Charge Ready 2 and Charge Ready transports that we have underway right now.
One final thing I'll say is that there was more press this morning on the campaign trail President Biden has talked about getting the power sector itself on a stand-alone basis to 0 GHG by 2035, and there's now discussion about potentially setting a target of 80% reductions from 2005 levels for the power sector by 2030.
Speaking here both from an Edison perspective and from a broader industry perspective, we're all lined up to do as much as we can as fast as we can at a national level. 80% may really be stretching, I think, the feasibility for the nationwide transition just given the fact that it's 9 years until ban. There's still R&D and technology that's needed to help fill the gaps and significant technology deployment that would be needed, particularly on the transmission side. It's not just the capital investment, but the permitting process that can take quite a while.
So our Pathway 2045 analysis actually concluded that California would see something like a 72% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. I've seen some national analysis from EPRI and others that suggest that the national number on an aggressive pathway might still be below 70%, maybe mid-60s or so.
So I think there will be a number of discussions among the industry, the administration and Congress will be on what defines what -- as much as we can do we can do, especially if we can do. What defines the art of that? And how do we make sure that the transition is reliable, affordable and equitable for all customers across the country."

And so I think that they went a long ways and, in our view, significantly reduced the risk exposure for utilities across the state.
In terms of changing the state's current approach on inverse itself, I think it's unlikely you'd see legislative action anytime soon because, quite frankly, there's been a lot of workabilities and literature on wildfire issues already for AB 1054. They have a full agenda in helping the economy recover from the pandemic. So I wouldn't expect that there'd be a whole lot of bandwidth for taking that up in the near term.
There is always a possibility that there could be court cases where inverse could be tested again and challenged again. Probably premature to go into details of specific court cases, but I'm aware that not only might there be some that pop up for us as we go through our case load, but other utilities also may have opportunities to challenge inverse. So that's always a possibility out there through the court system."

And that's why I dedicated the first part of my comments to framing that. I guess I would recap one part and maybe add a little bit. The recap part is that we do see and I think all the external forecasts that we see are calling for a likely above-average fire risk peak period here.
I think in terms of the mitigation, I went through them in a fair amount of detail. Maybe what I would add is that to remind you that the approach we have taken over the last several years has been a risk-informed approach. So when we went out to replace the first mile of bare wire with cover conductor, it was the mile that was in one of the highest-risk areas possible, right? So we've been going down the stack, if you will, by trying to address the highest-risk areas first where the mitigations would have the highest impact on risk reduction. So every piece of work we do is reducing the risk, and we've gone after the big bites early on.
That, I think, is really helpful and constructive in terms of framing that risk profile. That risk profile continues to narrow. And that's the stuff we've been doing. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've also seen the states dedicate just outstanding effort to improving firefighting modeling and just firefighting capabilities, fire-suppression capabilities.
And so that ability now that the state has that, frankly, it didn't have in 2017 or 2018 to fight multiple large fire simultaneously. You might recall, I mentioned there are some really interesting L.A. Times articles around 2018, and the challenge that the state had in fighting the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire and the Hill Fire all simultaneously. Well, the other states added a lot of qualified bodies with a lot more planes and trucks and equipment to be able to deploy across multiple fronts simultaneously. And that is a significant piece of risk reduction for all of us.
So I'm not sure I can give you a disclosure-quality quantified answer. This is -- So therefore, it's x.y% lower. But I think it's a significant percent difference in terms of the overall risk profile that the state faces and that, therefore, we face right now."

One is the actual -- the physical execution of it, the planning for it, the engineering behind it and then the execution. The second would be the broad communications element.
I think that SCE has done, frankly, pretty well in terms of the core execution for the last several years, right? We -- utility had significant prior investment in sectionalizing the grid. I remember reporting to you all in earnings call, probably going 1 year, 1.5 years back about how, at that point, something like -- if you look at our circuits in high-fire-risk areas, on average, it could be cordoned off into 4 separate sections, right, which allowed us to better target a PSPS event. Well, we continue to add segmentation, sectionalization devices to circuits in high-fire-risk areas. So that continues to hone down the scope of PSPS events.
Through that and through better planning from '19 to '20, now to '21, we've seen significant improvements in terms of the number of customers who have been impacted in given events. Now I have to add, though, that this is all very much weather-driven. And so a lot of what happened in 2020 was that we had some tough weather events to necessitate it using this tool of last resort, SOS resort, right? And so that grows some of the numbers.
But even if you look now at the various filings that the utilities have made through the WMP process, if you take a look at the numbers, I think Edison has actually had -- on a percentage of total customers basis has the lowest percent of customers who are impacted by PSPS in the 2020 season.
Importantly, the continued work from '20 to '21 has -- we believe will allow Edison to significantly reduce the impact further for customers who were impacted last year if we have the same weather as we did last year. Of course, we won't have the very same weather. But from an assumption basis, we would see, I think, pretty significant reduction in the impact. I think the number is over 28% or close to 30% reduction in impact to customers who were impacted last year. So lots of good things in terms of the modern capabilities, being able to triage it down and restrict the impact of any one event.
On the communication side, I think, is where we had more opportunity and, frankly, got some pretty pointed feedback deservedly from customers and communities and local governments. And so if you look at the action plan that SCE filed in February, there's a lot there on continuing to do better at the things that we were doing okay at and also doing much better than things that we didn't do so okay at.
And so that's where you see a lot of focus on how do we have more timely communications with customers, with communities, with local governments, with emergency operation centers, improving the quality of those communications and the vehicles for them. And so that's an area where I hope our customer -- expect our customers will say a good improvement going into this next peak season.
Maria, what have I missed in there?"

So I think our cadence is about every 2 weeks now. So it really does provide an opportunity for us to have an ongoing dialogue around what it is that SCE is doing.

And then you make the skies a lot tougher with COVID-19 and the impacts on their own operations of that as well as the extra volume of work that COVID created, right? So frankly, I think they've been doing all right that we all have.
The GRC is a complex case. And obviously, we had hoped that we would have had a PD by now. But we're still hopeful that we'll have a PD by the end of this quarter, as Maria mentioned in her comments. And I'm not -- I don't think we're seeing anything systemic there that says there's a problem, the process is broken, on the contrary. We provided a number of examples in the prepared remarks around things like safety certifications for Edison, the disposition of a number of the cost recovery accounts.
So I just think they have a lot going on under difficult times. And obviously, we'd like to see a PD for the GRC soon, and we'll do our part for that. But we're not sensing that there's something grinding the gears down more systemically.

That's inspections that we do. We found fewer areas that we had to remediate. But I think more broadly, there are still costs associated with mitigating this risk.
We've talked before, and in fact, the commission convened an on bond not too long ago to talk about affordability. And so as we do that, we continue to focus people on the necessity for the wildfire-mitigation expenditures that we and other IOUs are doing that, that goes squarely to maintaining the safety of our communities.
And then over the longer term, looking at what it really means to our electric grades as we further electrify the economy, what that means for rates but then also what it means for the energy bill itself. And so I think as we think about affordability, we and the commission and other stakeholders are looking at it from different perspectives, total share of wallet that energy represents, so not just the electric bill.
Affordability has been defined a few different ways by the commission, things like how many hours do you have to work at minimum wage in order to pay your electric bill. I think it's going to be an ongoing discussion. But we do know that wildfire mitigation is very important to the safety of our communities, and we know that a broader electrification is important for the greenhouse gas and environmental objectives that the state has. And that's important because as we do that and we think about affordability, it's also about being equitable and having all of our communities also participate in that improvement in the environment.
So I think it's going to be an ongoing discussion. The commission's rightfully focused on it, and we have been focused on it as well, as Pedro mentioned, over a many year cycle, trying to manage our costs. And then as we further electrify the economy, allowing that to help increase affordability as well."

I want to make sure I'm not double counting here because if I think about it, you've still got a good chunk of cash coming in the door, as outlined on the items in Slide 10 and then almost $2 billion -- a little over $2 billion of securitization on Slide 11. Should I think about those 2 sources as more-than-ample-enough cash to fund the cash outflow that you're going to require when you finalize settlements or when the litigation gets finalized from the 2017 and '18 wildfires?"

So some of the things that we talk about on Page 10 end up being securitized on Page 11. So it's probably easier if we kind of maybe can separately go through, and I'll take and tie the numbers for you.
The more general response to your question is we do have cash that we have already spent on wildfire mitigation. This will -- these securitizations and/or recoveries through rates as we continue to file the application will allow us to sort of get that cash back in the door. So some of the pressure that you've seen often expressed through the issuance of short-term debt in the past or funded through short-term debt in the past will be alleviated.
I think from a claims perspective, what we've said before is that EIX has issued equity or preferred equity in the past in order to sustain the credit metrics and the investment-grade ratings both at the utility and the holding company. And that equity issuance allows SCE to continue to debt finance the claims payments as they come due now that we're -- shortly, we'll be past the insurance recovery. And so they'll be able to do that. And subject to the waiver that they have, they can keep that debt outside of the capital structure.
Over time -- cash is all fungible as we're putting dollars down there. That may impact the exact timing of when they do their debt financings. But over time, they'll be funding their business in accordance with their authorized capital structure.
So I think that's the general framework. I think the numbers on Slides 10 and 11, there's a little bit, as I said, of overlap between applications. And then we translate that into securitizations on Page 11. And we can go over that in more detail, if you like, later on."

And you've already seen over the last few years, things that were near term that materialized, right? So we're going to have our Charge Ready programs and forecast for quite a while until we got approval of those applications. But now we have over $800 million of program and of that, it's probably what 3 plus 2 some -- certainly over $0.5 billion worth of CapEx coming from those Make Ready programs for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. So that's an example of one where we were talking about it for a few years, went through the process, developed and designed a program and got PUC support for this.
I think as you look at the near term -- near midterm, in next decade or half a decade, storage is an opportunity that could present some potential upside because for storage, I think a lot of that will be done by third parties and -- whether it's large-scale or the BPAs or whether it's customers down the customer premise. But there may be opportunities for utility-level grid-side storage. You've seen us do already some of that. The rate case included some assumptions about a modest level.
But particularly as we see the acceleration of things like vehicle electrification, that might lend itself to places where it might make sense to reinforce a substation with more storage as we did with Mira Loma, where we put in 20 megawatts of batteries a few years ago. So that's kind of a near term or, call it, midterm one.
I think longer term, the upside is in transmission. And of course, we have per quarter 1,000 with competition for transmission. We want to make sure that the utility is able to compete. However, I'll remind you that for projects that are upgrades of existing utility on projects, the utility has the right of first refusal.
And just given the scale of wires investment that we think is needed, that's -- I would hypothesize handily that there will be probably some projects that are upgrades of existing lines where maybe we haven't conceived that yet. We really are going to be dependent on the California independent system operator to run through its transmission planning process and determine the transmission that's needed for renewables by 2030 and later on by 2045. So I think transmission presents another offset opportunity.
Finally, very -- coming way back down to the Bermudan, very near term, I know Maria mentioned this, but just to remind you that we have our Customer Service Replatform Project and that could be $500 million of rate base additions, if approved by the commission. We just went live with that in early April. And then there could also be some additional rate base additions from the wildfire restoration work that we did in 2020 out of the Creek Fire. We haven't quantified that yet externally, but we're finalizing that analysis now. So those are much more kind of blocking-and-tackling near-term opportunities."

We probably won't be able to help you very much there, unfortunately, because those are confidential negotiations. I think we did share that there's good news in that we now have a process both for the Thomas, Koenigstein mudslide plaintiffs as well as for the Woolsey plaintiffs -- individual plaintiffs. So there's an established process approved by the court that allows us to have smoother approach to working our way through several thousand cases that remain.
I would also say -- you mentioned there are smaller ones remaining. When you think -- they're smaller relative to say the subrogation settlements that we did earlier. But I want to make sure you're not generalizing too much by looking at, say, the dollar amount of settlements we've done with individual plaintiffs so far relative to the number of individual plaintiff cases that we settle and making any assumptions or extrapolating from that about the remaining cases. All of these are, so case-by-case, very individualized. So it's really hard to extrapolate and say, because we did X dollars for these Y plaintiffs, you can use that ratio for the remaining ones.
It's really case-by-case. I think the one thing we can anchor you on is that we review the reserves, the best estimate every quarter. We did that once again, and you saw that we did not make any changes to that estimate.

Probably the most honest answer I can give you is that it's really early, right? And you're going to see significant discussions between the administration and Congress over the next weeks and -- maybe even months. I think that there's -- in terms of streaming the timing a bit, I would expect that the administration will want to have a plan firmly in place and time for the Glasgow Conference of the parties -- the United Nations conference of the parties in November. And so -- and if not, hopefully sooner.
But the pace, the scale -- I mean, you even see it in the discussions right now on the infrastructure package that's been proposed by the President. And you're hearing $2-plus billion numbers coming from his proposal. You're hearing Republican members talking about packages that are more on the $600 million mark. So that will influence us.
The relative degree of emphasis on different levers in the packages and so in the case of transmission, I think it's generally accepted by both sides that transmission will be a key element of the equation. But how that translates into? Are the federal incentives? Frankly, from our perspective, the things that we would really like to see the federal government do more than just money is focus on the permitting process and helping on the federal side to streamline access to federal lands where we might need to have access for rights of way for new transmission lines. That alone is probably one of the biggest levers they have to accelerate this because that -- it's that piece, the permitting process, that adds years and years of transmission projects. It can take you a decade to build a transmission project.
So -- but in any case, Ryan, I'll go back to my first point that it's early in the game, lots of discussions ahead. And those discussions will then guide the level of emphasis, frankly, not in transmission, but how deeply to go in the power sector by what time frame? How does that compare with -- how you're going deeper in other sectors? To what extent are you using market mechanisms to do that versus more sector-by-sector allocations? All of that is to be determined."

However, this comparison is not meaningful because SCE did not receive a final decision in Track 1 of its 2021 general rate case during the quarter. As many of you are aware, our proposed decision was issued on July 9. The utility will file its opening comments later today and reply comments on August 3. 
While Maria covers the PD in more detail, our financial performance for the quarter and other financial topics, let me first give you a few observations, which are summarized on Page 2. 
The PD's base rate revenue requirement of $6.9 billion is approximately 90% of SCE's request. The primary drivers of the reduction are lower funding for wildfire insurance premiums, vegetation management and depreciation. 
The main reduction to SCE's 2021 capital forecast was for the wildfire covered conductor program. Excluding wildfire mitigation-related capital, the PD would approve 98% of SCE's 2021 capital request, much of which was uncongested. 
The PD acknowledged the often competing objectives of balancing safety and reliability risks with the costs associated with ensuring SCE can make necessary investments to provide safe, reliable and clean energy. The PD also notes that wildfire mitigation is a high priority for the state and the commission. 
The PD supports critical safety and reliability investments and promotes the foundation for capital spending and rate base to 2023. We believe it is generally well recent, but it has some major policy implications that are fundamentally and consistent with where the state is headed. 
SCE's CEO, Kevin Payne, addressed these implications well during oral arguments earlier this week, and the utility will elaborate on them in his opening comments, which are outlined on Page 3. 
The largest area of concern is the significant proposed cuts to use wildfire coverage conductor program. This is SCE's paramount wildfire mitigation program and the utilities comments will focus on ensuring the program scope is consistent with the appropriate risk analysis, state policy and achieving the desired level of risk mitigation. 
The proposed reductions would deprive customers of a key risk reduction school. So SCE is advocating strongly for a balanced final decision. We believe additional CPUC authorized funding for SCE's covered conductor deployment is warranted to protect customers and communities vital interests and achieve the same objective for minimizing wildfire risk. 
As noted in prior discussions, SCE has prioritized covered conductor and other wildfire mitigation activities to urgently reduce wildfire risk. A scorecard of SCE's one-part mitigation plan progress is on Page 4 of the deck. 
We believe that through the execution of the WMP and other efforts, SCE has made meaningful progress in reducing the risk that utility equipment will spark a catastrophic wildfire. This slide provides a few proof points of how SCE believes it has reduced wildfire risk for its customers. 
First, circuits with covered conductor have experienced fewer faults than those without, which demonstrates the efficacy of the tool. In fact, on segments where we have covered the [indiscernible] wire, there has not been a single CPUC reportable ignition from contact with objects or wire-to-wire contact. 
Second, where SCE has expanded the dupationt clearance distances and remove trees that could fall into its lines, there have been 50% fewer tree or vegetation cost falls than the historic average. 
Lastly, since SCE began its high-fire risk inspection program in 2019, it has found 66% fewer conditions requiring remediation on the same structures year-over-year. These serve as observable data points of the substantial risk reduction from SCE's wildfire mitigation activities. 
The utility will use the tools at its disposal to mitigate wildfire risk. This includes deploying coverage conductor at a level informed by the final decision augmented by using public safety power shutoffs or PSPS, to achieve the risk reduction originally contemplated for the benefit of customers. 
The PD also included comments on the topic of affordability. We agree that affordability is always important and must be weighed against the long-term investments in public safety. I will highlight that SCE's rates have generally tracked local inflation over the last 30 years and have risen the least since 2009 relative to the other major California IOUs. 
Currently, SCE's system average rate is about 17% lower than PG&Es and 34% lower than SDG&E's, reflecting the emphasis SCE has placed on operational excellence over the years. While we recognize that the increases in the next few years tied to the investments in safety for the communities SCE serves are higher than this historical average, SCE has demonstrated its ability to manage rate increases to the benefit of customers. 
Under funding prudent mitigations like covered conductor would be penny wise and pound force as it may ultimately lead to even greater economic pain and even loss of life for communities impacted by wildfires that could have been prevented. 
An active wildfire season is underway right now, and I would like to emphasize SCE's substantial progress in executing its WMP. Through the first half of the year, SCE completed over 190,000 high-fire risk-informed inspections of its transmission and distribution equipment, achieving over 100% of its full year target. 
The utility also continues to deploy covered conductor in the highest risk areas. Year-to-date, SCE installed over 540 circuit miles of covered conductor in high fire risk areas. For the full year, SCE expects to cover at least another 460 miles for a total of 1,000 miles deployed in 2021, consistent with its turf goal. 
Additionally, SCE is executing its PSPS action plan to further reduce the risk of utility equipment igniting wildfires and to minimize the effects of customers. SCE is on target to complete its expedited grid hardening efforts on frequently impacted circuits and expects to reduce customer minutes of interruption by 78%, while not increasing risks, assuming the same weather conditions as last year. 
To support the most vulnerable customers living in high fire risk areas when a PSPS is called, the utility has distributed over 4,000 batteries for backup power through its Critical Care Backup Battery program. 
We believe California is also better prepared to combat this wildfire season. The legislature has continued to allocate substantial funding to support wildfire prevention and additional firefighting resources. 
Just last week, the state announced that CAL FIRE has secured 12 additional firefighting aircraft for exclusive use in its state-wide response efforts, augmenting the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world. 
SCE is also supporting the readiness and response efforts of local fire agencies. In June, SCE contributed $18 million to lease 3 fire suppression helicopters. This includes 2 CH-47 helitankers, the world's largest fire suppressant helicopters, and a [indiscernible] helitanker. 
All 3 aircraft have unique water and fire retardant dropping capabilities and can fly day and night. In addition, a [indiscernible] command and control helicopter along with ground-based equipment to support rapid re targets, refills and drops will be available to assist with wildfires. 
The helitankers and command and control helicopter will be strategically stationed across SCE's service area and made available to various jurisdictions through existing partnerships and coordination agreements between the agencies through the end of the year. We also appreciate the strong efforts by President Biden, Energy Secretary, Grant Hall, and the broader administration. 
I was pleased to join the President, Vice President, Cabinet members, and Western governors, including Governor Newsom, for a virtual working session on Western wildfire repairs last month. The group highlighted key areas for continued partnership among the federal government, states and utilities including land and vegetation management, deploying technologies from DOE's national labs and other federal entities and enabling response and recovery. 
Let me conclude my comments on SCE's wildfire preparations for this year by pointing out a resource we made available for investors. We recently posted a video to our Investor Relations website featuring SCE subject matter experts, discussing the utility's operational and infrastructure mitigation efforts and an overview of state actions to meet California's 2021 drought and wildfire risk. 
So please go check it out. Investing to make the grid resilient climate change-driven wildfires is a critical component of our strategy, and it's just one element of our ESG performance. Our recently published sustainability report details of progress and long-term goals related to the clean energy transition and electrification. 
In 2020, approximately 43% of the electricity SCE delivered to customers came from carbon-free resources. And the company remains well positioned to achieve its goal to deliver 100% carbon-free power by 2045. 
SCE doubled its energy storage capacity during this year and continues to maintain one of the largest storage portfolios in the nation. We have been engaged in federal discussions on potential clean energy provisions and continue to support policies aligned with SCE's Pathway 2045 target, up 80% carbon-free electricity by 2030. 
However, the electric affordability and reliability have to be top of mind as we push to the carbonized economy through electrification. The dollars needed to eliminate the last molecule of CO2 from power generation will have a much bigger impact when spent instead on an electric vehicle or a heat up. 
For example, the utility is spending over $800 million to accelerate vehicle electrification across its service area. And that's a key component to achieve an economy-wide net zero go, most affordable. Recently, SCE opened its Charge Ready 2 program for customer enrollment. This program is going to support 38,000 new electric car charges over the next 5 years, with an emphasis on locations with limited access to at-home charging options and disadvantaged communities. 
We are really proud that Edison's leadership in transportation and electrification was recently recognized by our peers with EEI's Edison Award. That's our industry's highest honor. SCE has been able to execute on these objectives while maintaining the lowest system average rate among California's industry utilities and monthly residential customer bills that are below the national average. 
As we grow our business for the clean energy future, we are also adapting our infrastructure in our operations to a new climate reality. We're striving for best-in-class operations. And importantly, we are aiming to deliver superior value to our customers and to our investors. With that, let me turn it over to Maria for her financial report."

My comments today will cover second quarter 2021 results comments on the proposed decision in SCE's general rate case, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics.",1063,"Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover second quarter 2021 results comments on the proposed decision in SCE's general rate case, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $0.94 per share for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $0.06 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not meaningful because SCE has not received a final decision in its 2021 general rate case and continues to recognize revenue from CPUC activities based on 2020 authorized levels. 
We will account for the 2021 GRC Track 1 final decision in the quarter at SCE receives it. On Page 7, you can see SCE's key second quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I'll highlight the primary contributors to the variance. 
To begin, revenue was higher by $0.10 per share. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.06 to this variance. However, this was offset by balancing account expenses. 
FERC-related revenue contributed $0.04 to the variance driven by higher rate base and a true-up associated with filings SCE's annual formula rate update. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.11 and 2 items account for the bulk of this variance. First, cost recovery activities, which have no effect on earnings, were $0.05. This variance is largely due to costs recognized last year following the approval of cost tracked in the memo accounts. 
Second, lower wildfire mitigation-related O&M drove a $0.02 positive variance, primarily because fewer remediations were identified through the inspection process. This continues the trend we observed in the first quarter. Over the past few years, SCE has accelerated and enhanced its approach to risk-informed inspection of Adapta. 
Inspections continue to be one of the important measures for reducing the probability of ignitions. For the first half of the year, while we have maintained the pace of inspections and met our annual target, we have observed fewer findings of equipment requiring remediation. 
Lastly, depreciation and property taxes had a combined negative variance of $0.10. driven by higher asset base resulting from SCE's continued execution of its capital plan. As Pedro mentioned earlier, SCE received a proposed decision on Track 1 of its 2021 general rate case on July 9. 
If adopted, the PD would result in base rate revenue requirements of $6.9 billion in 2021, $7.2 billion in 2022 and $7.6 billion in 2023. This is lower than SCE's request primarily related to lower authorized expenses for wildfire insurance premium, vegetation management, employee benefits and depreciation. 
For wildfire insurance, the PD would allow SCE to track premiums above authorized and memo accounts for future recovery applications. The PD would also approve the vegetation management balancing account for costs above authorized. In its opening comments, SCE will address the PDs procedural error that resulted in the exclusion of increased vegetation management labor costs, driven by updated wage rates. 
Vegetation management costs that exceeded defined cap, including these higher labor costs, would be deferred to the vegetation management balancing account. The earliest the commission can vote on the proposed decision is at its August 19 voting meeting. 
Consistent with our past practice, we will provide 2021 EPS guidance a few weeks after receiving a final decision. I would also like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. As shown on Page 8, over the Track 1 period of 2021 through 2023, rate base growth would be approximately 7% based on SCE's request and approximately 6% based on the proposed decision. In the absence of the 2021 GRC final decision, SCE continues to execute a capital plan for 2021 that would result in spending in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. 
SCE will adjust spending for what is ultimately authorized in the 2021 GRC final decision while minimizing the risk of disallowed spending. We have updated our 2021 through 2023 rate base forecast to include the customer service replatform project. 
SCE filed a cost recovery application for the project last week. I will note that this rate base forecast does not include capital spending for fire restoration related to wildfires affecting SCE's facilities and equipment in late 2020. 
This could add approximately $350 million to rate base by 2023. Page 9 provides a summary of the approved and pending cost recovery applications for incremental wildfire-related costs. SCE recently received a proposed decision in the [indiscernible] proceeding for drought and 2017 fire-related costs. 
The PD would authorize recovery of $81 million of the requested revenue. As you can see on Page 10, during the quarter, SCE requested a financing order that would allow us to issue up to $1 billion of recovery bonds to securitize the costs authorized in GRC Track 2, 2020 residential uncollectibles and additional AB 1054 capital authorized in GRC Track 1. 
SCE expects a final decision on the financing order in the fourth quarter. Turning to Page 11, SCE continues to make solid progress settling the remaining individual plaintiff claims arising from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. 
During the second quarter, SCE resolved approximately $560 million of individual plaintiff of claims. That leaves about $1.4 billion of claims to be resolved or less than 23% of the best estimate of total losses. 
Turning to Page 12. Let me conclude by building on Pedro's earlier comments on sustainability. I will emphasize the strong alignment between the strategy and drivers of the EIX's business and the clean energy transition that is underway. In June, we published our sustainable financing framework outlining our intention to continue aligning capital raising activities with sustainability principles. 
We have identified several eligible project categories, both green and social, which capture a sizable portion of our capital plan, including T&D infrastructure for the interconnection and delivery of renewable generation using our grid, our EV charging infrastructure programs, group modernization and grid resiliency investments. 
Shortly after publishing the framework, SCE issued $900 million of sustainability bonds that will be allocated to eligible projects and reported on next year. Our commitment to sustainability is core to the company's values and a key element of our stakeholder engagement efforts. 
Importantly, our approach to sustainability drives the large capital investment plan that needs to be implemented to address the impacts of climate change and to serve our customers safely, reliably and affordably. That concludes my remarks."

So I think as you've seen us say in the past, we are looking at all the tools in the toolbox. Given our terrain and the fact that is really predominant, that one of the predominant forms of ignition in the past has been from contacts with foreign objects. 
We find that covered conductor has really provided the optimal tool for reducing risk while maintaining affordability for customers. And so we see that covered conductor has something like 70% of the risk reduction that undergrounding has. The cost difference in the numbers we've seen to date, obviously, the team continues to keep track of what's going on and talking with our peers and talking with experts about potential improvements. 
But I think the latest numbers we've seen are that covered conductor cost us something like $456,000 a mile whereas underground being, on average, in our territory, it will cost you about $3.4 million a mile. 
We have seen some spot applications, and in fact, there's about 17 miles that we targeted to underground between this year and next year. And we'll continue to look at the toolbox, but at least with our territory, with our incidence of historical ignitions, we believe that covered conductor provides really an optimal tool in terms of both risk reduction and affordability."

Look, there'll be 2 thoughts that come right away to mind. First is are GRCs are litigated proceedings, right? 
And so we always have at least 2 sites, actually multiple sites with multiple intervenors. You have some intervenors that are more focused on purely the affordability side of things. I think as the utility, we're really working hard to provide well-supported testimony and analysis that is looking at finding the right balance, right? 
We're balancing -- first of all, having a reliable system -- actually above all, having a safe system that needs to be in violet. But you really see trade-offs between reliability and affordability, right? You could always spend more to get an extra percentage point in reliability, but at some point, it becomes unaffordable for the customer. 
So it's how do you find the right balance. I think as you heard me say in the prepared remarks already, really the largest issue leaders, not the only, but the largest issue has been the position that [indiscernible] in terms of the risk reduction provided by covered conductor and how many miles are enough. And we just have a fundamental difference in view in terms of the policy argument that they're making we are facing a significant wildfire risk gross estate. 
We've seen it in our area. We strongly believe that the wildfire mitigation plans that we prepared really help address at risk. And you saw the data that we shared in the deck and that I mentioned in my remarks around some of these early returns that we're experiencing with significant decreases and some of the risks that we had just 3 years ago, right? 
So study the figures on reduction in faults, and frankly, no CPUC reportable ignitions yet on miles that we've covered, where we used to have [indiscernible] wire. So the fundamental policy debate here is the churn has what we think is some flood map about stopping at 2,700 miles, and we believe that the plan we've laid out that will go to over 6,000 miles, covering was 50% of the 10,000 miles in high-fire risk areas provides that kind of risk protection that our customers need, it's consistent with the emphasis that has on fire mitigation, fire suppression. 
So affordability is always really important. But one final point I'll give you is one that Kevin Payne made really well during the oral argument. Affordability is not just about the bill that you get tomorrow. Affordability is about the entire economic equation. And if we allow a mitigated wildfire risk to persist and a fire takes place that could have been prevented, that's a much bigger affordability shop for that community in the long run, in addition to the health and safety impact that I can have. 
So we think we've cut it right in terms of the policy trade-offs, and we hope that the 5 commissioners will agree with that in the final decision. Maria, if you have anything to add there? Or did I cover it?"

Right now, if you look at sort of the amount of time remaining until the measurement period is over, yields would have to average just over 4% to kind of make the whole year average within the dead band. 
So what happens, the end of the measurement period is the end of September. We all know that the PTC has taken positions on prior requests to either extend and defer changes on the cost of capital for others. And we also know from our experience back in 2017 that they really prefer to see litigated cases, and we're preparing testimony that's going to focus on the differentiated role and the risks that California IOUs have and that notwithstanding these lower interest rates, that's really driven by these extraordinary events over the past 18 months in all of the government programs that have been implemented to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. 
But that should not really imply that a change in the ROE is necessary. And I think that the changes in the volatility certainly underscore that. And I think regardless of what happens, we have to file next Spring for another cost of capital proceeding. So those are the sorts of things that we are thinking about. 
I think since that basic issue, we really need to demonstrate that notwithstanding the interest rate environment, the cost of equity is, in fact, lower. Yes, we'll continue to look at everything that's going on, options on how to best get that point across to the commission to the interveners and also to really underscore the point that financially stable IRUs and California IOUs that are attractive to investors ultimately support customer affordability in the long run, too. So I think we're just going to continue to monitor the situation we're preparing testimony already, and we'll go from there."

Last year, we said we would issue approximately $1 billion of equity to support the ratings and then that would allow SCE to continue to issue debt to fund the wildfire claims payment. And since then, we've been evaluating our needs and we focused on different financing options. And back in March, we issued the $1.25 billion of craft and that had the 50% equity content.

So Constantine, you know that our policy year is July 1 through June 30, so we just started a new policy year. In terms of the PD, the original request in the PD when file the application rates were increasing by big percentages year-over-year, and our request had something like a $600 million wildfire insurance premium embedded in it. 
What came out in the PD is that, one, very importantly, they reiterated that while our insurance premiums are a cost of service, so customers will pay for that as part of their rate. 
They approved a number or an authorized revenue of about $460 million, which is actually, as it turns out sufficient or at least if we were to look at the balance of this year and then the beginning part of the year, which was the last policy year, that is comparable or at least a little bit more than what the premiums are. 
We expect the expense for this year to be about $425 million for about -- for [ $1 billion ] gross of insurance, but net once you deduct out the self-insured retention and a little bit of coinsurance is about $875 million of wildfire insurance, which is consistent once you get right through to it with what's required in AB 1054. 
So from that perspective, good policy points on cost of service aligned with at least for this year, what premiums would be. The third piece of it is that they also reiterated that to the extent premiums go up in the future, we can use that metal account feature that we have used in the past and successfully recovered premiums under in the future as well. So that's all good. 
The one piece of conversation that we will continue to have with them is whether or not it is better to actually collect a little bit more from customers, not just the amount of the wildfire insurance premium but also collect a little bit for customer-funded health insurance, which may over time be more economical for customers since to the extent you don't have a loss, you keep it and roll it over to the next year, which is different on what you do with the premium."

It's all very high tech now, all virtual. But joking aside, and Maria, you can cmoe in with details. I'll get the high-level answer to your high-level question, similar to what you heard from us before, right? 
What you see in the rate case, obviously, is very concrete and we'll see where the final decision comes out. But as we look forward and we think about the clean energy transition, right? There's a number of things as part of the transition that will either support our view that we'll continue to have robust investment needs for a long time or potentially create upside to that. 
Areas like -- I talked a little bit in my remarks about Charge Ready. Open question right now as to whether there will be a further role needed for utilities to continue to support the charging infrastructure market or whether private entries will be able to step in and do that fully. 
Interestingly, I think of -- Maria is a commissioner [indiscernible], who had a recent commission meeting was -- I just think thinking out loud about now there may well be the need to have utilities sip in and do more, just given the scale of the transition. And in particular, as I look at it, it's not just about getting charging infrastructure to the average customer of making sure that the transition is equitable. 
So therefore, making sure there's enough penetration in disadvantaged communities, low-income communities, where private players might not be as economically enticed to do that and where there might be a case to socialize more of that to the build. So transportation is certainly one area. Storage is another. 
We know that the GRC request included in there, I think an assumption of what's it, 60 megawatts or so of new storage over the dependency of the breakage period. But as we see the amounts of storage that will continue to be needed moving forward and the -- certainly the potential for some of that to be part and parcel of utility operations might make a lot of sense for some portion of that to be in rate base, right? 
And so that also creates either support for an overall investment trajectory or potentially even further upside. Building electrification is another area where we've seen, frankly, relatively little progress to date compared to what we think will be needed as we head out as we the state heads out to 2030 and 2045. 
And so right now, the utility team is thinking about are there places where the utility will be able to help and where it will be economic for our customers to support that rate because you need both of those, right? And so there's some good thinking underway right now around are there potential programs where we might be able to be helpful to the state's transition. So does that give you a few examples. Maria, you may have more specific things."

But in terms of things that have been filed already, where the numbers are more explicit, we did recently include in our rate base forecast, so already in the numbers, but we did recently include our customer service platform project. 
So that's that reflects about $500 million or so of rate base by the time you get out to 2023. So that's now embedded application was filed last week. Also, we, as you know, experienced wildfires in our service territory late last year up in the Big Creek area, a lot of restoration had to go on there. We haven't yet applied for recovery of that, but that would be, say, about another $350 million of free base. If approved, I'll say, in the year 2023, it's probably a reasonable time frame. So those are more specific things, Michael, in addition to what I would view as a clean energy transition opportunities that Pedro mentioned."

First, it's what we've been doing for the last 5, 6, 7, 8 years, right? And you've seen us create a lot of rate headroom in order to do the work that we needed to do I commented in my prepared remarks on the way that we've maintained O&M cost increases and frankly, total system rate at an average rate increases at around the level of inflation for the last 3 decades. 
And I know we've talked with you and with other investors and analysts significantly about that in the past. We've continued to track record. Obviously, this GRC is a major departure from that driven in large part by the wildfire-related needs. 
But we will continue to look at opportunities to do better cost management, to do more use of technology that can help make our work more effective, more efficient. That's definitely an ongoing tool. And I don't think on that one you're ever done, right? Because the reality is the bar keeps going up, the digital tools, the data analytics, all of these continue to improve and open up new opportunities that I don't think any of us imagined 5 or 10 years ago. 
So I'd say that's part 1 of the answer. Part 2, kind of goes back to some of the discussion in -- for some of the earlier questions. There is a there's a balance there, right? And it's important that the commission be thinking about affordability broadly, not only in terms of the near-term rate increase, but the impacts of that over time, the risk that it either mitigates or doesn't mitigate the risk it might leave behind on the table that might then increase the risk of wildfire in the future that would have a much more devastating economic impact on the community or the risk that by not spending enough on covered conductor, we might have to continue using PSPS for a longer period of time in a particular community, which has one set of impacts, right? And I order the commission has appropriately been very sensitive to those. So there is absolutely a balancing act there. It's a tough job to the regulator has a tough job that we have. 
But I think we've put together a well-thought-out approach for balancing those risks. So just a few reactions. Maria, you may have others."

I guess, Julien, the one thing I would also add to that -- maybe 2 things. If you go all the way back to when we filed our application for this we actually tee that up for the commission and said, we know we have to balance a lot of different things between what we need to invest for safety and also in water risk mitigation and then affordability for our customers. So we actually told them that some of our investments in infrastructure replacement, we would hold on to and not propose for this GRC cycle and instead take that up again when more of the wildfire mitigation CapEx had been spent. 
So I think that balance is one that we always try to strike. And I think it's the conversation with the commission and the commission raised it during their own affordability on bond because they recognize that over the longer term, more electrification is actually going to drive lower cost for customers. 
You've seen it in our pathway paper. The commission themselves recognize that electrification will reduce energy as a customer -- as the share of customer wallet. So we have to focus on the near term with a view, not just on affordability, what's on the bill, as Kevin said in his oral argument, it's the overall economic proposition that we have to think about with our customers. 
And so let's get this done. I think one of the numbers he quoted in his oral arguments was that if we increase covered conductor to the level that we had in the request that's really about $2 a month on the customer bill. I'm not trying to minimize that. I know people are in different situations economically. 
But when you think about the alternative, that's really, I think, the most economical choice. And then that resiliency tees up the system and the customers for the long term when electrification really does minimize costs."

And Maria, let me just pick up one more thing triggered by your comments. Julien, a lot of the focus right now, certainly in this rate case is on the affordability trade-off relative to wildfire mitigation. I think as we move forward over the next decade or two, to Maria's point, align with our Pathway 2045 analysis, I think we'll see more of the discussion shifts to the affordability trade-offs relative to meeting clean energy targets and decarbonizing the economy. Because it's so important that, frankly, the analytical work we've done that demonstrates that using clean electricity to electrify a lot of the economy is the cheapest way for the economy to get to net zero, right? This will put pressure on the electric bill I don't think it will be the sort of rate increases year-on-year that we see in this rate case, right? 
But we might see excursions to a little bit of local inflation in order to build that the infrastructure needed to electrify much more of the economy and therefore, we carve it out, right? And so frankly, part of our job and the job of future teams at Edison over the next 2 decades will be to constantly be putting good educational materials out there, good analysis around the world.

First -- look, at the end of the day, the customer sees 1 bill, right? And so we want to make sure we're pulling on all the levers to provide them an affordable experience that's also safe and reliable and clean. And also to make sure that we have an appropriate opportunity for our investors to get a return on and off their capital, right? 
So kind of stating the blatantly obvious, that's important. Get a reaction though is that we do have separate proceedings in California. We think spend a lot of value in having a separate rate case proceeding from a different cost of capital proceeding. And particularly as we get to a cost of capital filing, well, clearly, during the commission's mines, in our mind, we'll all be thinking about the impact on customers of various increments. 
Cost of capital in California is really constructed around ensuring that there's a fair opportunity for investors, for shareholders to get the return often on capital in order to make the California investment and attractive one relative to investments elsewhere in the country and in other marketplaces, right? 
And so particularly as we head into a period over the next decade or where the country as a whole will see a dramatic need for investment across all sectors of the economy to be carbonized. It's really important that the regulatory framework in California remain one that is viewed as fair, as stable, as compensatory to shareholders and to all stakeholders, and one where the cost of service principles are respected, right? 
And so you're seeing a lot of our efficacy focused on making sure that we are constantly coming back to the Sintrom line in terms of what's a fair cost of service and how do we get recovery in that versus what things in what areas to the shareholder of their risk of recovery. 
And so that's why I like the idea about fairly pure cost of capital proceeding that just looking at the math and the principles of the policy around what a fair return given the unique risks that utilities are asked to bear in California, given that we are at the leading edge of the clean energy transition. So anyway, I just see a few ambling thoughts there, Julien. Maria, anything you want to clean up or change there?"

Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.94 compared to $1 a year ago. 
However, this comparison is not meaningful because SCE did not receive a final decision in Track 1 of its 2021 general rate case during the quarter. As many of you are aware, our proposed decision was issued on July 9. The utility will file its opening comments later today and reply comments on August 3. 
While Maria covers the PD in more detail, our financial performance for the quarter and other financial topics, let me first give you a few observations, which are summarized on Page 2. 
The PD's base rate revenue requirement of $6.9 billion is approximately 90% of SCE's request. The primary drivers of the reduction are lower funding for wildfire insurance premiums, vegetation management and depreciation. 
The main reduction to SCE's 2021 capital forecast was for the Wildfire Covered Conductor Program. Excluding wildfire mitigation-related capital, the PD would approve 98% of SCE's 2021 capital request, much of which was uncontested. 
The PD acknowledged the often-competing objectives of balancing safety and reliability risks with the costs associated with ensuring SCE can make necessary investments to provide safe, reliable and clean energy. The PD also notes that wildfire mitigation is a high priority for the state and the commission. 
The PD supports critical safety and reliability investments and promotes the foundation for capital spending and rate base to 2023. We believe it is generally well-reasoned, but it has some major policy implications that are fundamentally inconsistent with where the state is headed. 
SCE's CEO, Kevin Payne, addressed these implications well during oral arguments earlier this week, and the utility will elaborate on them in his opening comments, which are outlined on Page 3. 
The largest area of concern is the significant proposed cuts to SCE's Wildfire Coverage Conductor Program. This is SCE's paramount wildfire mitigation program and the utilities' comments will focus on ensuring the program scope is consistent with the appropriate risk analysis, state policy and achieving the desired level of risk mitigation. 
The proposed reductions would deprive customers of a key risk reduction school. So SCE is advocating strongly for a balanced final decision. We believe additional CPUC authorized funding for SCE's covered conductor deployment is warranted to protect customers' and communities' vital interests and achieve the same objective for minimizing wildfire risk. 
As noted in prior discussions, SCE has prioritized covered conductor and other wildfire mitigation activities to urgently reduce wildfire risk. A scorecard of SCE's wildfire mitigation plan progress is on Page 4 of the deck. 
We believe that through the execution of the WMP and other efforts, SCE has made meaningful progress in reducing the risk that utility equipment will spark a catastrophic wildfire. This slide provides a few proof points of how SCE believes it has reduced wildfire risk for its customers. 
First, circuits with covered conductor have experienced 69% fewer faults than those without, which demonstrates the efficacy of the tool. In fact, on segments where we have covered the bare wire, there has not been a single CPUC reportable ignition from contact with objects or wire-to-wire contact. 
Second, where SCE has expanded vegetation clearance distances and removed trees that could fall into its lines, there have been 50% fewer tree or vegetation cost faults than the historic average. 
Lastly, since SCE began its high-fire risk inspection program in 2019, it has found 66% fewer conditions requiring remediation on the same structures year-over-year. These serve as observable data points of the substantial risk reduction from SCE's wildfire mitigation activities. 
The utility will use the tools at its disposal to mitigate wildfire risk. This includes deploying covered conductor at a level informed by the final decision augmented by using public safety power shutoffs or PSPS, to achieve the risk reduction originally contemplated for the benefit of customers. 
The PD also included comments on the topic of affordability. We agree that affordability is always important and must be weighed against the long-term investments in public safety. I will highlight that SCE's rates have generally tracked local inflation over the last 30 years and have risen the least since 2009 relative to the other major California IOUs. 
Currently, SCE's system average rate is about 17% lower than PG&E's and 34% lower than SDG&E's, reflecting the emphasis SCE has placed on operational excellence over the years. While we recognize that the increases in the next few years tied to the investments in safety for the communities SCE serves are higher than this historical average, SCE has demonstrated its ability to manage rate increases to the benefit of customers. 
Under-funding prudent mitigations like covered conductor would be penny-wise and pound-foolish as it may ultimately lead to even greater economic pain and even loss of life for communities impacted by wildfires that could have been prevented. 
An active wildfire season is underway right now, and I would like to emphasize SCE's substantial progress in executing its WMP. Through the first half of the year, SCE completed over 190,000 high-fire risk-informed inspections of its transmission and distribution equipment, achieving over 100% of its full year target. 
The utility also continues to deploy covered conductor in the highest risk areas. Year-to-date, SCE installed over 540 circuit miles of covered conductor in high fire risk areas. For the full year, SCE expects to cover at least another 460 miles for a total of 1,000 miles deployed in 2021, consistent with its WMP goal. 
Additionally, SCE is executing its PSPS action plan to further reduce the risk of utility equipment igniting wildfires and to minimize the effects of customers. SCE is on target to complete its expedited grid hardening efforts on frequently impacted circuits and expects to reduce customer minutes of interruption by 78%, while not increasing risks, assuming the same weather conditions as last year. 
To support the most vulnerable customers living in high fire risk areas when a PSPS is called, the utility has distributed over 4,000 batteries for backup power through its Critical Care Backup Battery program. 
We believe California is also better prepared to combat this wildfire season. The legislature has continued to allocate substantial funding to support wildfire prevention and additional firefighting resources. 
Just last week, the state announced that CAL FIRE has secured 12 additional firefighting aircraft for exclusive use in its state-wide response efforts, augmenting the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world. 
SCE is also supporting the readiness and response efforts of local fire agencies. In June, SCE contributed $18 million to lease 3 fire suppression helicopters. This includes 2 CH-47 helitankers, the world's largest fire suppressant helicopters, and a Sikorsky 51 helitanker. 
All 3 aircraft have unique water and fire retardant dropping capabilities and can fly day and night. In addition, a Sikorsky 76 command and control helicopter along with ground-based equipment to support rapid retardants, refills and drops will be available to assist with wildfires. 
The helitankers and command and control helicopter will be strategically stationed across SCE's service area and made available to various jurisdictions through existing partnerships and coordination agreements between the agencies through the end of the year. We also appreciate the strong efforts by President Biden, Energy Secretary Granholm, and the broader administration. 
I was pleased to join the President, Vice President, Cabinet members, and Western governors, including Governor Newsom, for a virtual working session on Western wildfire preparedness last month. The group highlighted key areas for continued partnership among the federal government, states and utilities including land and vegetation management, deploying technologies from DOE's national labs and other federal entities and enabling response and recovery. 
Let me conclude my comments on SCE's wildfire preparations for this year by pointing out a resource we made available for investors. We recently posted a video to our Investor Relations website featuring SCE subject matter experts, discussing the utility's operational and infrastructure mitigation efforts and an overview of state actions to meet California's 2021 drought and wildfire risk. So please go check it out. 
Investing to make the grid resilient climate change-driven wildfires is a critical component of our strategy, and it's just one element of our ESG performance. Our recently published sustainability report details the progress and long-term goals related to the clean energy transition and electrification. 
In 2020, approximately 43% of the electricity SCE delivered to customers came from carbon-free resources. And the company remains well positioned to achieve its goal to deliver 100% carbon-free power by 2045. 
SCE doubled its energy storage capacity during this year and continues to maintain one of the largest storage portfolios in the nation. We have been engaged in federal discussions on potential clean energy provisions and continue to support policies aligned with SCE's Pathway 2045 target, up 80% carbon-free electricity by 2030. 
However, the electric affordability and reliability have to be top of mind as we push to the carbonized economy through electrification. The dollars needed to eliminate the last molecule of CO2 from power generation will have a much bigger impact when spent instead on an electric vehicle or a heat pump. 
For example, the utility is spending over $800 million to accelerate vehicle electrification across its service area. And that's a key component to achieve an economy-wide net zero go, most affordable. Recently, SCE opened its Charge Ready 2 program for customer enrollment. This program is going to support 38,000 new electric car chargers over the next 5 years, with an emphasis on locations with limited access to at-home charging options and disadvantaged communities. 
We are really proud that Edison's leadership in transportation and electrification was recently recognized by our peers with EEI's Edison Award. That's our industry's highest honor. SCE has been able to execute on these objectives while maintaining the lowest system average rate among California's industry utilities and monthly residential customer bills that are below the national average. 
As we grow our business for the clean energy future, we are also adapting our infrastructure in our operations to a new climate reality. We're striving for best-in-class operations. And importantly, we are aiming to deliver superior value to our customers and to our investors. With that, let me turn it over to Maria for her financial report."

My comments today will cover second quarter 2021 results comments on the proposed decision in SCE's general rate case, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics.",1066,"Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover second quarter 2021 results comments on the proposed decision in SCE's general rate case, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $0.94 per share for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $0.06 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not meaningful because SCE has not received a final decision in its 2021 general rate case and continues to recognize revenue from CPUC activities based on 2020 authorized levels. 
We will account for the 2021 GRC Track 1 final decision in the quarter at SCE receives it. On Page 7, you can see SCE's key second quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I'll highlight the primary contributors to the variance. 
To begin, revenue was higher by $0.10 per share. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.06 to this variance. However, this was offset by balancing account expenses. 
FERC-related revenue contributed $0.04 to the variance driven by higher rate base and a true-up associated with filings SCE's annual formula rate update. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.11 and 2 items account for the bulk of this variance. First, cost recovery activities, which have no effect on earnings, were $0.05. This variance is largely due to costs recognized last year following the approval of cost tracked in the memo accounts. 
Second, lower wildfire mitigation-related O&M drove a $0.02 positive variance, primarily because fewer remediations were identified through the inspection process. This continues the trend we observed in the first quarter. Over the past [ few ] years, SCE has accelerated and enhanced its approach to risk-informed inspections of [ Adapta ]. 
Inspections continue to be one of the important measures for reducing the probability of ignitions. For the first half of the year, while we have maintained the pace of inspections and met our annual target, we have observed fewer findings of equipment requiring remediation. 
Lastly, depreciation and property taxes had a combined negative variance of $0.10. driven by higher asset base resulting from SCE's continued execution of its capital plan. As Pedro mentioned earlier, SCE received a proposed decision on Track 1 of its 2021 general rate case on July 9. 
If adopted, the PD would result in base rate revenue requirements of $6.9 billion in 2021, $7.2 billion in 2022 and $7.6 billion in 2023. This is lower than SCE's request primarily related to lower authorized expenses for wildfire insurance premium, vegetation management, employee benefits and depreciation. 
For wildfire insurance, the PD would allow SCE to track premiums above authorized and memo accounts for future recovery applications. The PD would also approve the vegetation management balancing account for costs above authorized. In its opening comments, SCE will address the PD's procedural error that resulted in the exclusion of increased vegetation management labor costs, driven by updated wage rates. 
Vegetation management costs that exceeded defined cap, including these higher labor costs, would be deferred to the vegetation management balancing account. The earliest the commission can vote on the proposed decision is at its August 19 voting meeting. 
Consistent with our past practice, we will provide 2021 EPS guidance a few weeks after receiving a final decision. I would also like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. As shown on Page 8, over the Track 1 period of 2021 through 2023, rate base growth would be approximately 7% based on SCE's request and approximately 6% based on the proposed decision. In the absence of the 2021 GRC final decision, SCE continues to execute a capital plan for 2021 that would result in spending in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. 
SCE will adjust spending for what is ultimately authorized in the 2021 GRC final decision while minimizing the risk of disallowed spending. We have updated our 2021 through 2023 rate base forecast to include the customer service replatform project. 
SCE filed a cost recovery application for the project last week. I will note that this rate base forecast does not include capital spending for fire restoration related to wildfires affecting SCE's facilities and equipment in late 2020. This could add approximately $350 million to rate base by 2023. 
Page 9 provides a summary of the approved and pending cost recovery applications for incremental wildfire-related costs. SCE recently received a proposed decision in the CEMA proceeding for drought and 2017 fire-related costs. 
The PD would authorize recovery of $81 million of the requested revenue. As you can see on Page 10, during the quarter, SCE requested a financing order that would allow us to issue up to $1 billion of recovery bonds to securitize the costs authorized in GRC Track 2, 2020 residential uncollectibles and additional AB 1054 capital authorized in GRC Track 1. SCE expects a final decision on the financing order in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Page 11, SCE continues to make solid progress settling the remaining individual plaintiff claims arising from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. 
During the second quarter, SCE resolved approximately $560 million of individual plaintiff claims. That leaves about $1.4 billion of claims to be resolved or less than 23% of the best estimate of total losses. 
Turning to Page 12. Let me conclude by building on Pedro's earlier comments on sustainability. I will emphasize the strong alignment between the strategy and drivers of the EIX business and the clean energy transition that is underway. In June, we published our sustainable financing framework outlining our intention to continue aligning capital raising activities with sustainability principles. 
We have identified several eligible project categories, both green and social, which capture a sizable portion of our capital plan, including T&D infrastructure for the interconnection and delivery of renewable generation using our grid, our EV charging infrastructure programs, grid modernization and grid resiliency investments. 
Shortly after publishing the framework, SCE issued $900 million of sustainability bonds that will be allocated to eligible projects and reported on next year. 
Our commitment to sustainability is core to the company's values and a key element of our stakeholder engagement efforts. Importantly, our approach to sustainability drives the large capital investment plan that needs to be implemented to address the impacts of climate change and to serve our customers safely, reliably and affordably. That concludes my remarks."

So I think as you've seen us say in the past, we are looking at all the tools in the toolbox. Given our terrain and the fact that is really predominant, that one of the predominant forms of ignition in the past has been from contacts with foreign objects. 
We find that covered conductor has really provided the optimal tool for reducing risk while maintaining affordability for customers. And so we see that covered conductor has something like 70% of the risk reduction that undergrounding has. The cost difference in the numbers we've seen to date, obviously, the team continues to keep track of what's going on and talking with our peers and talking with experts about potential improvements. 
But I think the latest numbers we've seen are that covered conductor cost us something like $456,000 a mile whereas underground being, on average, in our territory, it will cost you about $3.4 million a mile. 
We have seen some spot applications, and in fact, there's about 17 miles that we targeted to underground between this year and next year. And we'll continue to look at the toolbox, but at least with our territory, with our incidence of historical ignitions, we believe that covered conductor provides really an optimal tool in terms of both risk reduction and affordability."

Look, there'll be 2 thoughts that come right away to mind. First is are GRCs are litigated proceedings, right? 
And so we always have at least 2 sites, actually multiple sites with multiple intervenors. You have some intervenors that are more focused on purely the affordability side of things. I think as the utility, we're really working hard to provide well-supported testimony and analysis that is looking at finding the right balance, right? 
We're balancing -- first of all, having a reliable system -- actually above all, having a safe system that needs to be inviolate. But you really see trade-offs between reliability and affordability, right? You could always spend more to get an extra percentage point in reliability, but at some point, it becomes unaffordable for the customer. 
So it's how do you find the right balance. I think as you heard me say in the prepared remarks already, really the largest issue leaders, not the only, but the largest issue has been the position the trend took in terms of the risk reduction provided by covered conductor and how many miles are enough. And we just have a fundamental difference in view in terms of the policy argument that they're making we are facing a significant wildfire risk across the state. 
We've seen it in our area. We strongly believe that the wildfire mitigation plans that we prepared really help address at risk. And you saw the data that we shared in the deck and that I mentioned in my remarks around some of these early returns that we're experiencing with significant decreases and some of the risks that we had just 3 years ago, right? 
So study the figures on reduction in faults, and frankly, no CPUC reportable ignitions yet on miles that we've covered, where we used to have bare wire. So the fundamental policy debate here is the try and have what we think is some flawed math about stopping at 2,700 miles, and we believe that the plan we've laid out that will go to over 6,000 miles, covering, what, 50% of the 10,000 miles in high-fire risk areas provides that kind of risk protection that our customers need, that's consistent with the emphasis the state has on fire mitigation, fire suppression. 
So affordability is always really important. But one final point I'll give you is one that Kevin Payne made really well during the oral argument. Affordability is not just about the bill that you get tomorrow. Affordability is about the entire economic equation. And if we allow a mitigated wildfire risk to persist and a fire takes place that could have been prevented, that's a much bigger affordability shock for that community in the long run, in addition to the health and safety impact that I can have. 
So we think we've got it right in terms of the policy trade-offs, and we hope that the 5 commissioners will agree with that in the final decision. Maria, if you have anything to add there? Or did I cover it?"

Right now, if you look at sort of the amount of time remaining until the measurement period is over, yields would have to average just over 4% to kind of make the whole year average within the dead band. 
So what happens, the end of the measurement period is the end of September. 
We all know that the PTC has taken positions on prior requests to either extend and defer changes on the cost of capital for others. And we also know from our experience back in 2017 that they really prefer to see litigated cases, and we're preparing testimony that's going to focus on the differentiated role and the risks that California IOUs have and that notwithstanding these lower interest rates, that's really driven by these extraordinary events over the past 18 months in all of the government programs that have been implemented to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. 
But that should not really imply that a change in the ROE is necessary. And I think that the changes in the volatility certainly underscore that. And I think regardless of what happens, we have to file next Spring for another cost of capital proceeding. So those are the sorts of things that we are thinking about. 
I think since that basic issue, we really need to demonstrate that notwithstanding the interest rate environment, the cost of equity is, in fact, lower. Yes, we'll continue to look at everything that's going on, options on how to best get that point across to the commission to the interveners and also to really underscore the point that financially stable IOUs and California IOUs that are attractive to investors ultimately support customer affordability in the long run, too. So I think we're just going to continue to monitor the situation. We're preparing testimony already, and we'll go from there."

So I'll just kind of go back to sort of where I always like to start with this. Our financing plan is really built from the perspective of maintaining investment-grade ratings, and back when we moved to a best estimate for the wildfire liability last year, we said we would issue approximately $1 billion of equity to support the ratings and then that would allow SCE to continue to issue debt to fund the wildfire claims payment. And since then, we've been evaluating our needs and we focused on different financing options. And back in March, we issued the $1.25 billion of [ craft ] and that had the 50% equity content. 
We've also said in the past that we do think we have flexibility regarding the timing. And so we're continuing to have that belief that we can be flexible in terms of timing. And we're continuing to monitor market conditions, and that's going to inform our next steps. We're going to continue to consider and I think we've talked about this a little bit before, the tools that we would use. 
So tools needed to consider preferred equity, internal programs, and then if needed, the ATM. Now that's that piece associated with sort of the ongoing discussion around the wildfire claims and the liabilities in '17 and '18. 
Separately, we've also talked about the need on an ongoing basis what we think is a minimal equity requirement. That piece of it, that ongoing minimal equity need associated with the core business is one that we will provide more specificity around once we get the final decision. So that piece does kind of tie back to the final decision."

But of course, the market's the market, so we'll see how that progresses on a down. Maria, let me turn it over to you for the first part."

So Constantine, you know that our policy year is July 1 through June 30, so we just started a new policy year. In terms of the PD, the original request in the PD when file the application rates were increasing by big percentages year-over-year, and our request had something like a $600 million wildfire insurance premium embedded in it. 
What came out in the PD is that, one, very importantly, they reiterated that while our insurance premiums are a cost of service, so customers will pay for that as part of their rate. 
They approved a number or an authorized revenue of about $460 million, which is actually, as it turns out sufficient or at least if we were to look at the balance of this year and then the beginning part of the year, which was the last policy year, that is comparable or at least a little bit more than what the premiums are. 
We expect the expense for this year to be about $425 million for about -- for $1 billion gross of insurance, but net once you deduct out the self-insured retention and a little bit of coinsurance is about $875 million of wildfire insurance, which is consistent once you get right through to it with what's required in AB 1054. 
So from that perspective, good policy points on cost of service aligned with at least for this year, what premiums would be. The third piece of it is that they also reiterated that to the extent premiums go up in the future, we can use that memo account feature that we have used in the past and successfully recovered premiums under in the future as well. So that's all good. 
The one piece of conversation that we will continue to have with them is whether or not it is better to actually collect a little bit more from customers, not just the amount of the wildfire insurance premium but also collect a little bit for customer-funded health insurance, which may over time be more economical for customers since to the extent you don't have a loss, you keep it and roll it over to the next year, which is different from what you do with the premium."

It's all very high tech now, all virtual. But joking aside, and Maria, you can come in with details. I'll get the high-level answer to your high-level question, similar to what you heard from us before, right? 
What you see in the rate case, obviously, is very concrete and we'll see where the final decision comes out. But as we look forward and we think about the clean energy transition, right? There's a number of things as part of the transition that will either support our view that we'll continue to have robust investment needs for a long time or potentially create upside to that. 
Areas like -- I talked a little bit in my remarks about Charge Ready. Open question right now as to whether there will be a further role needed for utilities to continue to support the charging infrastructure market or whether private entries will be able to step in and do that fully. 
Interestingly, I think of -- Maria said Commissioner Rechtschaffen, who had a recent commission meeting was -- I just think thinking out loud about now there may well be the need to have utilities step in and do more, just given the scale of the transition. And in particular, as I look at it, it's not just about getting charging infrastructure to the average customer or making sure that the transition is equitable. 
So therefore, making sure there's enough penetration in disadvantaged communities, low-income communities, where private players might not be as economically enticed to do that and where there might be a case to socialize more of that to the build. So transportation is certainly one area. Storage is another. 
We know that our GRC request included in there, I think an assumption of what's it, 60 megawatts or so of new storage over the [ dependency ] of the rate case variant. But as we see the amounts of storage that will continue to be needed moving forward and the -- certainly the potential for some of that to be part and parcel of utility operations might make a lot of sense for some portion of that to be in rate case, right? 
And so that also creates either support for an overall investment trajectory or potentially even further upside. Building electrification is another area where we've seen, frankly, relatively little progress to date compared to what we think will be needed as we head out as we the state heads out to 2030 and 2045. 
And so right now, the utility team is thinking about are there places where the utility will be able to help and where it will be economic for our customers to support that rate because you need both of those, right? And so there's some good thinking underway right now around are there potential programs where we might be able to be helpful to the state's transition. So does that give you a few examples. Maria, you may have more specific things."

But in terms of things that have been filed already, where the numbers are more explicit, we did recently include in our rate base forecast, so already in the numbers, but we did recently include our customer service platform project. 
So that's that reflects about $500 million or so of rate base by the time you get out to 2023. So that's now embedded application was filed last week. Also, we, as you know, experienced wildfires in our service territory late last year up in the Big Creek area, a lot of restoration had to go on there. We haven't yet applied for recovery of that, but that would be, say, about another $350 million of [ free ] base if approved, I'll say, in the year 2023, it's probably a reasonable time frame.

First, it's what we've been doing for the last 5, 6, 7, 8 years, right? And you've seen us create a lot of rate headroom in order to do the work that we needed to do. I commented in my prepared remarks on the way that we've maintained O&M cost increases and frankly, total system rate at an average rate increases at around the level of inflation for the last 3 decades. 
And I know we've talked with you and with other investors and analysts significantly about that in the past. We've continued that track record. Obviously, this GRC is a major departure from that driven in large part by the wildfire-related needs. 
But we will continue to look at opportunities to do better cost management, to do more use of technology that can help make our work more effective, more efficient. That's definitely an ongoing tool. And I don't think on that one you're ever done, right? Because the reality is the bar keeps going up, the digital tools, the data analytics, all of these continue to improve and open up new opportunities that I don't think any of us imagined 5 or 10 years ago. So I'd say that's part 1 of the answer. 
Part 2, kind of goes back to some of the discussion in -- for some of the earlier questions. There is a there's a balance there, right? And it's important that the commission be thinking about affordability broadly, not only in terms of the near-term rate increase, but the impacts of that over time, the risk that it either mitigates or doesn't mitigate the risk it might leave behind on the table that might then increase the risk of wildfire in the future that would have a much more devastating economic impact on the community or the risk that by not spending enough on covered conductor, we might have to continue using PSPS for a longer period of time in a particular community, which has its own set of impacts, right? I know that the commission has appropriately been very sensitive to those. 
So there is absolutely a balancing act there. It's a tough job to the regulator has a tough job that we have. But I think we've put together a well-thought-out approach for balancing those risks. So just a few reactions. Maria, you may have others."

I guess, Julien, the one thing I would also add to that -- maybe 2 things. If you go all the way back to when we filed our application for this GRC, we actually teed that up for the commission and said, we know we have to balance a lot of different things between what we need to invest for safety and also in water risk mitigation and then affordability for our customers. So we actually told them that some of our investments in infrastructure replacement, we would hold on to and not propose for this GRC cycle and instead take that up again when more of the wildfire mitigation CapEx had been spent. 
So I think that balance is one that we always try to strike. And I think it's the conversation with the commission and the commission raised it during their own affordability [ on bond ] because they recognize that over the longer term, more electrification is actually going to drive lower cost for customers. 
You've seen it in our pathway paper. The commission themselves recognize that electrification will reduce energy as a customer -- as the share of customer wallet. So we have to focus on the near term with a view, not just on affordability, what's on the bill, as Kevin said in his oral argument, it's the overall economic proposition that we have to think about with our customers. 
And so let's get this done. I think one of the numbers he quoted in his oral arguments was that if we increase covered conductor to the level that we had in the request that's really about $2 a month on the customer bill. I'm not trying to minimize that. I know people are in different situations economically. 
But when you think about the alternative, that's really, I think, the most economical choice. And then that resiliency tees up the system and the customers for the long term when electrification really does minimize costs."

And Maria, let me just pick up one more thing triggered by your comments. Julien, a lot of the focus right now, certainly in this rate case is on the affordability trade-off relative to wildfire mitigation. I think as we move forward over the next decade or 2, to Maria's point, align with our Pathway 2045 analysis, I think we'll see more of the discussion shift to the affordability trade-offs relative to meeting clean energy targets and decarbonizing the economy. Because it's so important that, frankly, the analytical work we've done that demonstrates that using clean electricity to electrify a lot of the economy is the cheapest way for the economy to get to net zero, right? 
This will put pressure on the electric bill I don't think it will be the sort of rate increases year-on-year that we see in this rate case, right? But we might see excursions to a little bit of local inflation in order to build that the infrastructure needed to electrify much more of the economy and therefore, decarbonize right? 
And so frankly, part of our job and the job of future teams at Edison over the next 2 decades will be to constantly be putting good educational materials out there, good analysis around the world. Not just the cents per kilowatt hour world, but the world in a dollars per ton of GHG removed perspective because that's just as important a metric as the cents per kilowatt hour."

First -- look, at the end of the day, the customer sees 1 bill, right? And so we want to make sure we're pulling on all the levers to provide them an affordable experience that's also safe and reliable and clean. And also to make sure that we have an appropriate opportunity for our investors to get a return on and off their capital, right? 
So kind of stating the blatantly obvious, that's important. The other reaction though is that we do have separate proceedings in California. We think we've seen a lot of value in having a separate rate case proceeding from a different cost of capital proceeding. And particularly as we get to a cost of capital filing, while clearly, I'm sure in the commission's minds and in our mind, we'll all be thinking about the impact on customers of various increments. 
Cost of capital in California is really constructed around ensuring that there's a fair opportunity for investors, for shareholders to get the return often on capital in order to make the California investment an attractive one relative to investments elsewhere in the country and in other marketplaces, right? 
And so particularly as we head into a period over the next decade or where the country as a whole will see a dramatic need for investment across all sectors of the economy to decarbonize, it's really important that the regulatory framework in California remain one that is viewed as fair, as stable, as compensatory to shareholders and to all stakeholders, and one where frankly, cost of service principles are respected, right? 
And so you're seeing a lot of our efficacy focused on making sure that we are constantly coming back to the central line in terms of what's a fair cost of service and how do we get recovery in that versus what things -- in what areas to the shareholder of their risk of recovery. 
And so that's why I like the idea about fairly pure cost of capital proceeding that's just looking at the math and the principles of the policy around what a fair return given the unique risks that utilities are asked to bear in California, given that we are at the leading edge of the clean energy transition. 
So anyway, I just see a few rambling thoughts there, Julien. Maria, anything you want to clean up or change there?"

Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.94 compared to $1 a year ago. However, this comparison is not meaningful because SCE did not receive a final decision in track 1 of its 2021 General Rate Case during the quarter. As many of you are aware, our proposed decision was issued on July 9. The utility will file its opening comments later today and reply comments on August 3. While Maria will cover the PD in more detail, our financial performance for the quarter and other financial topics, let me first give you a few observations, which are summarized on Page 2. 
The PD's base rate revenue requirement of $6.9 billion is approximately 90% of SCE's request. The primary drivers of the reduction are lower funding for wildfire insurance premiums, vegetation management and depreciation. The main reduction to SCE's 2021 capital forecast was for the Wildfire Covered Conductor Program. Excluding wildfire mitigation-related capital, the PD would approve 98% of SCE's 2021 capital request, much of which was uncontested. 
The PD acknowledged the often-competing objectives of balancing safety and reliability risks with the costs associated with ensuring SCE can make necessary investments to provide safe, reliable and clean energy. The PD also notes that wildfire mitigation is a high priority for the state and the commission. The PD supports critical safety and reliability investments and provides the foundation for capital spending and rate base through 2023. We believe it is generally well reasoned, but it has some major policy implications that are fundamentally inconsistent with where the state is headed. SCE's CEO, Kevin Payne, addressed these implications well during oral arguments earlier this week, and the utility will elaborate on them in his opening comments, which are outlined on Page 3. 
The largest area of concern is the significant proposed cuts to SCE's Wildfire Covered Conductor Program. This is SCE's paramount wildfire mitigation program, and the utility's comments will focus on ensuring the program scope is consistent with the appropriate risk analyses, state policy and achieving the desired level of risk mitigation. The proposed reductions would deprive customers of a key risk-reduction tool, so SCE is advocating strongly for a balanced final decision. We believe additional CPUC-authorized funding for SCE's covered conductor deployment is warranted to protect customers' and communities' vital interests and achieve the same objective for minimizing wildfire risk. 
As noted in prior discussions, SCE has prioritized covered conductor and other wildfire mitigation activities to urgently reduce wildfire risk. A scorecard of SCE's wildfire mitigation plan progress is on Page 4 of the deck. We believe that through the execution of the WMP and other efforts, SCE has made meaningful progress in reducing the risk that utility equipment will spark a catastrophic wildfire. Page 5 provides a few proof points of how SCE believes it has reduced wildfire risk for its customers. 
First, circuits with covered conductor have experienced 69% fewer faults than those without, which demonstrates the efficacy of this tool. In fact, on segments where we have covered the bare wire, there has not been a single CPUC-reportable ignition from contact with objects or wire-to-wire contact. 
Second, where SCE has expanded vegetation clearance distances and removed trees that could fall into its lines, there have been 50% fewer tree or vegetation-caused faults than the historic average. 
Lastly, since SCE began its high fire risk inspection program in 2019, it has found 66% fewer conditions requiring remediation on the same structures year-over-year. These serve as observable data points of the substantial risk reduction from SCE's wildfire mitigation activities. 
The utility will use the tools at its disposal to mitigate wildfire risk. This includes deploying covered conductor at a level informed by the final decision augmented by using Public Safety Power Shutoffs, or PSPS, to achieve the risk reduction originally contemplated for the benefit of customers. 
The PD also included comments on the topic of affordability. We agree that affordability is always important and must be weighed against the long-term investments in public safety. I will highlight that SCE's rates have generally tracked local inflation over the last 30 years and have risen the least since 2009 relative to the other major California IOUs. Currently, SCE's system average rate is about 17% lower than PG&E's and 34% lower than SDG&E's, reflecting the emphasis SCE has placed on operational excellence over the years. While we recognize that the increases in the next few years tied to the investments in safety for the communities SCE serves are higher than this historical average, SCE has demonstrated its ability to manage rate increases to the benefit of customers. Underfunding prudent mitigations like covered conductor would be penny wise and pound foolish, as it may ultimately lead to even greater economic pain and even loss of life for communities impacted by wildfires that could have been prevented. 
An active wildfire season is under way right now, and I would like to emphasize SCE's substantial progress in executing its WMP. Through the first half of the year, SCE completed over 190,000 high fire risk-informed inspections of its transmission and distribution equipment, achieving over 100% of its full year target. The utility also continues to deploy covered conductor in the highest risk areas. Year-to-date, SCE installed over 540 circuit miles of covered conductor in high fire risk areas. For the full year, SCE expects to cover at least another 460 miles for a total of 1,000 miles deployed in 2021, consistent with its WMP goal. 
Additionally, SCE is executing its PSPS action plan to further reduce the risk of utility equipment igniting wildfires and to minimize the effects on customers. SCE is on target to complete its expedited grid hardening efforts on frequently impacted circuits and expects to reduce customer minutes of interruption by 78%, while not increasing risks, assuming the same weather conditions as last year. To support the most vulnerable customers living in high fire risk areas when a PSPS is called, the utility has distributed over 4,000 batteries for backup power through its Critical Care Backup Battery program. 
We believe California is also better prepared to combat this wildfire season. The legislature has continued to allocate substantial funding to support wildfire prevention and additional firefighting resources. 
Just last week, the state announced that CAL FIRE has secured 12 additional firefighting aircraft for exclusive use in its state-wide response efforts, augmenting the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world. SCE is also supporting the readiness and response efforts of local fire agencies. In June, SCE contributed $18 million to lease 3 fire-suppression helicopters. This includes 2 CH-47 helitankers, the world's largest fire-suppression helicopters; and a Sikorsky-61 helitanker. All 3 aircraft have unique water and fire-retardant-dropping capabilities and can fly day and night. In addition, a Sikorsky-76 command-and-control helicopter, along with ground-based equipment to support rapid retardant refills and drops, will be available to assist with wildfires. The helitankers and command-and-control helicopter will be strategically stationed across SCE's service area and made available to various jurisdictions through existing partnerships and coordination agreements between the agencies through the end of the year. 
We also appreciate the strong efforts by President Biden, Energy Secretary Granholm and the broader administration. I was pleased to join the President, Vice President, cabinet members and Western Governors, including Governor Newsom, for a virtual working session on Western wildfire preparedness last month. The group highlighted key areas for continued partnership among the federal government, states and utilities including land and vegetation management, deploying technologies from DOE's national labs and other federal entities and enabling response and recovery. 
Let me conclude my comments on SCE's wildfire preparations for this year by pointing out a resource we made available for investors. We recently posted a video to our Investor Relations website featuring SCE subject matter experts discussing the utility's operational and infrastructure mitigation efforts and an overview of state actions to meet California's 2021 drought and wildfire risk. So please go check it out. 
Investing to make the grid resilient to climate change-driven wildfires is a critical component of our strategy, and it's just one element of our ESG performance. Our recently published sustainability report details the progress and long-term goals related to the clean energy transition and electrification. In 2020, approximately 43% of the electricity SCE delivered to customers came from carbon-free resources, and the company remains well positioned to achieve its goal to deliver 100% carbon-free power by 2045. 
SCE doubled its energy storage capacity during this year and continues to maintain one of the largest storage portfolios in the nation. We have been engaged in federal discussions on potential clean energy provisions and continue to support policies aligned with SCE's Pathway 2045 target of 80% carbon-free electricity by 2030. However, the electric affordability and reliability have to be top of mind as we push to decarbonize the economy through electrification. The dollars needed to eliminate the last molecule of CO2 from power generation will have a much bigger impact when spent instead on an electric vehicle or a heat pump. For example, the utility is spending over $800 million to accelerate vehicle electrification across its service area, and that's a key component to achieve an economy-wide net 0 goal most affordably. Recently, SCE opened its Charge Ready 2 program for customer enrollment. This program is going to support 38,000 new electric car chargers over the next 5 years, with an emphasis on locations with limited access to at-home charging options and disadvantaged communities. 
We are really proud that Edison's leadership in transportation and electrification was recently recognized by our peers with EEI's Edison Award. That's our industry's highest honor. SCE has been able to execute on these objectives while maintaining the lowest system average rate among California's investor-owned utilities and monthly residential customer bills that are below the national average. 
As we grow our business for the clean energy future, we are also adapting our infrastructure in our operations to a new climate reality. We're striving for best-in-class operations, and importantly, we are aiming to deliver superior value to our customers and to our investors. 
With that, let me turn it over to Maria for her financial report."
301891,1671863572,2390194,"Edison International, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone.

My comments today will cover second quarter 2021 results, comments on the proposed decision in SCE's General Rate Case, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $0.94 per share for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $0.06 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not meaningful because SCE has not received a final decision in its 2021 General Rate Case and continues to recognize revenue from CPUC activities based on 2020 authorized levels. We will account for the 2021 GRC track 1 final decision in the quarter SCE receives it. 
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key second quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I'll highlight the primary contributors to the variance. 
To begin, revenue was higher by $0.10 per share. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.06 to this variance. However, this was offset by balancing account expenses. FERC-related revenue contributed $0.04 to the variance, driven by higher rate base and a true-up associated with filings SCE's annual formula rate update. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.11, and 2 items account for the bulk of this variance. First, cost recovery activities, which have no effect on earnings, were $0.05. This variance is largely due to costs recognized last year following the approval of cost tracked in a memo account. Second, lower wildfire mitigation-related O&M drove a $0.02 positive variance, primarily because fewer remediations were identified through the inspection process. This continues the trend we observed in the first quarter. Over the past few years, SCE has accelerated and enhanced its approach to risk-informed inspections of its assets. Inspections continue to be one of the important measures for reducing the probability of ignitions. For the first half of the year, while we have maintained the pace of inspections and met our annual target, we have observed fewer findings of equipment requiring remediation. Lastly, depreciation and property taxes had a combined negative variance of $0.10, driven by higher asset base resulting from SCE's continued execution of its capital plan. 
As Pedro mentioned earlier, SCE received a proposed decision on track 1 of its 2021 General Rate Case on July 9. If adopted, the PD would result in base rate revenue requirements of $6.9 billion in 2021, $7.2 billion in 2022 and $7.6 billion in 2023. This is lower than SCE's request primarily related to lower authorized expenses for wildfire insurance premiums, vegetation management, employee benefits and depreciation. 
For wildfire insurance, the PD would allow SCE to track premiums above authorized in a memo account for future recovery applications. The PD would also approve the vegetation management balancing account for costs above authorized. In its opening comments, SCE will address the PD's procedural error that resulted in the exclusion of increased vegetation management labor costs, driven by updated wage rates. Vegetation management costs that exceeded defined cap, including these higher labor costs, would be deferred to the vegetation management balancing account. The earliest the commission can vote on the proposed decision is at its August 19 voting meeting. Consistent with our past practice, we will provide 2021 EPS guidance a few weeks after receiving a final decision. 
I would also like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. As shown on Page 8, over the Track 1 period of 2021 through 2023, rate base growth would be approximately 7% based on SCE's request and approximately 6% based on the proposed decision. In the absence of the 2021 GRC final decision, SCE continues to execute a capital plan for 2021 that would result in spending in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. SCE will adjust spending for what is ultimately authorized in the 2021 GRC final decision while minimizing the risk of disallowed spending. We have updated our 2021 through 2023 rate base forecast to include the Customer Service Replatform Project. SCE filed a cost recovery application for the project last week. I will note that this rate base forecast does not include capital spending for fire restoration related to wildfires affecting SCE's facilities and equipment in late 2020. This could add approximately $350 million to rate base by 2023. 
Page 9 provides a summary of the approved and pending cost recovery applications for incremental wildfire-related costs. SCE recently received a proposed decision in the CEMA proceeding for drought and 2017 fire-related costs. The PD would authorize recovery of $81 million of the requested revenue. As you can see on Page 10, during the quarter, SCE requested a financing order that would allow us to issue up to $1 billion of recovery bonds to securitize the costs authorized in GRC track 2, 2020 residential uncollectibles and additional AB 1054 capital authorized in GRC track 1. SCE expects a final decision on the financing order in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Page 11. SCE continues to make solid progress settling the remaining individual plaintiff claims arising from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. During the second quarter, SCE resolved approximately $560 million of individual plaintiff claims. That leaves about $1.4 billion of claims to be resolved or less than 23% of the best estimate of total losses. 
Turning to Page 12. Let me conclude by building on Pedro's earlier comments on sustainability. I will emphasize the strong alignment between the strategy and drivers of EIX' business and the clean energy transition that is under way. In June, we published our sustainable financing framework outlining our intention to continue aligning capital raising activities with sustainability principles. We have identified several eligible project categories, both green and social, which capture a sizable portion of our capital plan, including T&D infrastructure for the interconnection and delivery of renewable generation using our grid, our EV charging infrastructure programs, grid modernization and grid resiliency investments. Shortly after publishing the framework, SCE issued $900 million of sustainability bonds that will be allocated to eligible projects and reported on next year. 
Our commitment to sustainability is core to the company's values and a key element of our stakeholder engagement efforts. Importantly, our approach to sustainability drives the large capital investment plan that needs to be implemented to address the impacts of climate change and to serve our customers safely, reliably and affordably. 
That concludes my remarks."

So I think as you've seen us say in the past, we are looking at all the tools in the toolbox. Given our terrain and the fact that the really predominant -- one of the predominant forms of ignition in the past has been from contacts with foreign objects. We find that covered conductor has really provided the optimal tool for reducing risk while maintaining affordability for customers. And so we see that covered conductor has something like 70% of the risk reduction that undergrounding has. The cost difference in the numbers we've seen to date, obviously, the team continues to keep track of what's going on and talking with our peers and talking with experts about potential improvements. But I think the latest numbers we've seen are that covered conductor cost us something like $456,000 a mile whereas underground, on average, in our territory, it will cost you about $3.4 million a mile. 
We have seen some spot applications, and in fact, there's about 17 miles that we targeted to underground between this year and next year. And we'll continue to look at the tool in the toolbox, but at least with our territory, with our incidence of historical ignitions, we believe that covered conductor provides a -- really an optimal tool in terms of both risk reduction and affordability."

We're balancing -- first of all, having a reliable system -- actually above all, having a safe system that needs to be inviolate.

And we just have a fundamental difference in view in terms of the policy argument that they're making. 
We are facing a significant wildfire risk across the state. We've seen it in our area. We strongly believe that the wildfire mitigation plans that we prepared really help address that risk. And you saw the data that we shared in the deck and that I mentioned in my remarks around some of these early returns that we're experiencing with significant decreases in some of the risks that we had just 3 years ago, right? 
So I cited the figures on reduction in faults, and frankly, no CPUC-reportable ignitions yet on miles that we've covered, where we used to have bare wire. So the fundamental policy debate here is the -- TURN has what we think of some flawed math about stopping at 2,700 miles. And we believe that the plan we've laid out that will go to over 6,000 miles, covering about 60% of the 10,000 miles in high fire risk areas, provides that kind of risk protection that our customers need. That's consistent with the emphasis the state has on fire mitigation, fire suppression. 
So affordability is always really important. But one final point I'll give you is one that Kevin Payne made really well during the oral argument. Affordability is not just about the bill that you get tomorrow. Affordability is about the entire economic equation. And if we allow unmitigated wildfire risk to persist and a fire takes place that could have been prevented, that's a much bigger affordability shock for that community in the long run, in addition to the health and safety impact that it can have. 
So we think we've got it right in terms of the policy trade-offs, and we hope that the 5 commissioners will agree with that in the final decision. 
Maria, if you have anything to add there? Or did I cover it?"

Right now, if you look at sort of the amount of time remaining until the measurement period is over, yields would have to average just over 4% to kind of make the whole year average within the dead band.  So what happens, the end of the measurement period is the end of September. 
We all know that the PTC has taken positions on prior requests to either extend and defer changes on the cost of capital for others. And we also know from our experience back in 2017 that they really prefer to see litigated cases, and we're preparing testimony that's going to focus on the differentiated role and the risks that California IOUs have and that notwithstanding these lower interest rates, that's really driven by these extraordinary events over the past 18 months in all of the government programs that have been implemented to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. But that should not really imply that a change in the ROE is necessary. And I think that the changes in the volatility certainly underscore that. And I think regardless of what happens, we have to file next spring for another cost of capital proceeding. So those are the sorts of things that we are thinking about. 
I think since that basic issue, we really need to demonstrate that notwithstanding the interest rate environment, the cost of equity is, in fact, lower. We'll continue to look at everything that's going on, options on how to best get that point across to the commission, to the intervenors and also to really underscore the point that financially stable IOUs and California IOUs that are attractive to investors ultimately support customer affordability in the long run, too. So I think we're just going to continue to monitor the situation. We're preparing testimony already, and we'll go from there."

So I'll just kind of go back to sort of where I always like to start with this. Our financing plan is really built from the perspective of maintaining investment-grade ratings, and back when we moved to a best estimate for the wildfire liability last year, we said we would issue approximately $1 billion of equity to support the ratings and then that would allow SCE to continue to issue debt to fund the wildfire claims payment. And since then, we've been evaluating our needs, and we focused on different financing options. And back in March, we issued the $1.25 billion of pref and that had the 50% equity content. 
We've also said in the past that we do think we have flexibility regarding the timing. And so we're continuing to have that belief that we can be flexible in terms of timing. And we're continuing to monitor market conditions, and that's going to inform our next steps. We're going to continue to consider, and I think we've talked about this a little bit before, the tools that we would use. So continue to consider preferred equity, internal programs and then, if needed, the ATM. Now that's that piece associated with sort of the ongoing discussion around the wildfire claims and the liabilities in '17 and '18. 
Separately, we've also talked about the need on an ongoing basis what we think is a minimal equity requirement. That piece of it, that ongoing minimal equity need associated with the core business, is one that we will provide more specificity around once we get the final decision.

So Constantine, you know that our policy year is July 1 through June 30, so we just started a new policy year. In terms of the PD, the original request in the PD when we file the application rates were increasing by big percentages year-over-year, and our request had something like a $600 million wildfire insurance premium embedded in it. 
What came out in the PD is that, one, very importantly, they reiterated that wildfire insurance premiums are a cost of service, so customers will pay for that as part of their rate. They approved a number or an authorized revenue of about $460 million, which is actually, as it turns out, sufficient or at least if we were to look at the balance of this year and then the beginning part of the year, which was the last policy year, that is comparable or at least a little bit more than what the premiums are. 
We expect the expense for this year to be about $425 million for about -- for $1 billion gross of insurance, but net, once you deduct out the self-insured retention and a little bit of coinsurance, is about $875 million of wildfire insurance, which is consistent once you get right through to it with what's required under AB 1054. So from that perspective, good policy points on cost of service aligned with, at least for this year, what premiums would be. 
The third piece of it is that they also reiterated that to the extent premiums go up in the future, we can use that memo account feature that we have used in the past and successfully recovered premiums under in the future as well. So that's all good. 
The one piece of conversation that we will continue to have with them is whether or not it is better to actually collect a little bit more from customers, not just the amount of the wildfire insurance premium but also collect a little bit for customer-funded health insurance, which may over time be more economical for customers since, to the extent you don't have a loss, you keep it and roll it over to the next year, which is different than what you do with the premium."

But joking aside, and Maria, maybe you can come in here with details. I'll give you a high-level answer to your high-level question. It's similar to what you heard from us before, right?  What you see in the rate case, obviously, is very concrete, and we'll see where the final decision comes out. But as we look forward and we think about the clean energy transition, right, there's a number of things as part of the transition that will either support our view that we'll continue to have robust investment needs for a long time or potentially create upside to that. 
Areas like -- we -- I talked a little bit in my remarks about Charge Ready. Open question right now as to whether there will be a further role needed for utilities to continue to support the charging infrastructure market or whether private entities will be able to step in and do that fully. 
Interestingly, I think -- Maria said Commissioner Rechtschaffen, who had a recent commission meeting, was, I just think, thinking out loud about now there may well be the need to have utilities step in and do more, just given the scale of the transition. And in particular, as I look at it, it's not just about getting charging infrastructure to the average customer and making sure that the transition is equitable.  So therefore, making sure there's enough penetration in disadvantaged communities, low-income communities, where private players might not be as economically enticed to do that and where there might be a case to socialize more of that to the build. So transportation is certainly one area. Storage is another. 
We know that the -- our GRC request included in there, I think, an assumption of, what's it, 60 megawatts or so of new storage over the pendency of the rate case period. But as we see the amounts of storage that will continue to be needed moving forward and the -- certainly the potential for some of that to be part and parcel of utility operations might make a lot of sense for some portion of that to be in rate case, right? And so that also creates either support for an overall investment trajectory or potentially even further upside. 
Building electrification is another area where we've seen, frankly, relatively little progress to date compared to what we think will be needed as we head out -- as we, the state, heads out to 2030 and 2045. 
And so right now, the utility team is thinking about are there places where the utility will be able to help and where it will be economic for our customers to support that rate. Because you need both of those, right? And so there's some good thinking under way right now around are there potential programs where we might be able to be helpful to the state's transition. 
So that gives you a few examples. Maria, you may have more specific things."

More detail to come as the team, as you say, with the pencil to paper or virtually the pencil to paper works more on the specifics. But in terms of things that have been filed already, where the numbers are more explicit, we did recently include in our rate base forecast, so already in the numbers, but we did recently include our Customer Service Replatform project. So that's -- that reflects about $500 million or so of rate base by the time you get out to 2023. So that's now embedded. Application was filed last week. 
Also, we did, as you know, experience wildfires in our service territory late last year up in the Big Creek area. A lot of restoration had to go on there. We haven't yet applied for recovery of that, but that would be, say, about another $350 million of rate base if approved. I'll say in the year 2023, it's probably a reasonable time frame.

To the extent that the guidance it provide us would limit spending, we will use some of the other tools that we have in the toolbox, including PSPS, much more adequately, right, or as needed in order to make sure that we maintain an appropriate risk level for our customers."

How do you think about creating bill headroom, whether through OpEx or effectively shifting out other projects from a CapEx perspective?

A few reactions right away, and Maria may have more. First, it's what we've been doing for the last 5, 6, 7, 8 years, right?

First, it's what we've been doing for the last 5, 6, 7, 8 years, right? And you've seen us create a lot of rate headroom in order to do the work that we needed to do. I commented in my prepared remarks on the way that we've maintained O&M cost increases and frankly, total system rate -- system average rate increases at around the level of inflation for the last 3 decades.  And I know we've talked with you and with other investors and analysts significantly about that in the past. We've continued that track record. Obviously, this GRC is a major departure from that driven in large part by the wildfire-related needs. But we will continue to look at opportunities to do better cost management, to do more use of technology that can help make our work more effective, more efficient. That's definitely an ongoing tool. And I don't think on that one you're ever done, right? Because the reality is the bar keeps going up. The digital tools, the data analytics, all of these continue to improve and open up new opportunities that I don't think any of us imagined 5 or 10 years ago. So I'd say that's part 1 of the answer. 
Part 2 kind of goes back to some of the discussion in -- for some of the earlier questions. There is a there's a balance there, right? And it's important that the commission be thinking about affordability broadly not only in terms of the near-term rate increase but the impacts of that over time, the risk that it either mitigates or doesn't mitigate the risk it might leave behind on the table that might then increase the risk of wildfire in the future that would have a much more devastating economic impact on the community, or the risk that by not spending enough on covered conductor, we might have to continue using PSPS for a longer period of time in a particular community, which has its own set of impacts, right? I know that the commission has appropriately been very sensitive to those. 
So there is absolutely a balancing act there. It's a tough job the regulator has, a tough job that we have. But I think we've put together a well-thought-out approach for balancing those risks. So just a few reactions. Maria, you may have others."
301891,1671863572,2390194,"Edison International, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Yes. I guess, Julien, the one thing I would also add to that are maybe 2 things. If we go all the way back to when we filed our application for this GRC, we actually teed that up for the commission and said we know we have to balance a lot of different th",328,"Yes. I guess, Julien, the one thing I would also add to that are maybe 2 things. If we go all the way back to when we filed our application for this GRC, we actually teed that up for the commission and said we know we have to balance a lot of different things between what we need to invest for safety and also in wildfire risk mitigation and then affordability for our customers. So we actually told them that some of our investments in infrastructure replacement, we would hold on to and not propose for this GRC cycle and instead take that up again when more of the wildfire mitigation CapEx had been spent. 
So I think that balance is one that we always try to strike. And I think it's the conversation with the commission, and the commission raised it during their own affordability en banc because they recognize that over the longer term, more electrification is actually going to drive lower cost for customers. 
You've seen it in our pathway paper. The commission themselves recognize that electrification will reduce energy as a customer -- as the share of customer wallet. So we have to focus on the near term with a view not just on affordability, what's on the bill. As Kevin said in his oral argument, it's the overall economic proposition that we have to think about with our customers. 
And so let's get this done. I think one of the numbers he quoted in his oral arguments was that if we increase covered conductor to the level that we had in the request, that's really about $2 a month on the customer bill. I'm not trying to minimize that. I know people are in different situations economically. But when you think about the alternative, that's really, I think, the most economical choice. And then that resiliency tees up the system and the customers for the long term when electrification really does minimize costs."

And Maria, let me just pick up one more thing triggered by your comments. Julien, a lot of the focus right now, certainly in this rate case, is on the affordability trade-off relative to wildfire mitigation. I think as we move forward over the next decade or 2, to Maria's point, aligned with our Pathway 2045 analysis, I think we'll see more of the discussion shift to the affordability trade-offs relative to meeting clean energy targets and decarbonizing the economy. Because it's so important that, frankly, the analytical work we've done that demonstrates that using clean electricity to electrify a lot of the economy is the cheapest way for the economy to get to net 0, right? 
This will put pressure on the electric bill. I don't think it will be the sort of rate increases year-on-year that we see in this rate case, right? But we might see excursions to a little bit of local inflation in order to build out the infrastructure needed to electrify much more of the economy and, therefore, decarbonize, right? 
And so frankly, part of our job and the job of future teams at Edison over the next 2 decades will be to constantly be putting good educational materials out there, good analysis around the world, not just the cents per kilowatt-hour world but the world in a dollars per ton of GHG removed perspective because that's just as important a metric as the cents per kilowatt-hour."

How do you think about offsetting some of the cost of capital with O&M or refinancing opportunities, et cetera? Just trying to reconcile rate base back to earnings growth here, if you will."

Maria may have different ones. First -- look, at the end of the day, the customer sees one bill, right? And so we want to make sure we're pulling on all the levers to provide them an affordable experience that's also safe",407,"Yes. I'll give you one reaction. Maria may have different ones. First -- look, at the end of the day, the customer sees one bill, right? And so we want to make sure we're pulling on all the levers to provide them an affordable experience that's also safe and reliable and clean and also to make sure that we have an appropriate opportunity for our investors to get a return on and off their capital, right? 
So kind of stating the blindingly obvious that's important. The other reaction though is that we do have separate proceedings in California. We think we've seen a lot of value in having a separate rate case proceeding from a different cost of capital proceeding. And particularly, as we get to a cost of capital filing, while clearly, I'm sure in the commission's minds, in our minds, we'll all be thinking about the impacts on customers of various increments. 
Cost of capital in California is really constructed around ensuring that there's a fair opportunity for investors, for shareholders to -- can get that return often on capital in order to make the California investment an attractive one relative to investments elsewhere in the country and in other marketplaces, right? 
And so particularly as we head into a period over the next decade or 2 where the country as a whole will see a dramatic need for investment across all sectors of the economy to decarbonize, it's really important that the regulatory framework in California remain one that is viewed as fair, as stable, as compensatory to shareholders and to all stakeholders and one where, frankly, cost of service principles are respected, right? 
And so you're seeing a lot of our advocacy focused on making sure that we are constantly coming back to the central line in terms of what's a fair cost of service and how do we get recovery in that versus what things -- in what areas should the shareholder bear risk of recovery. 
And so that's why I like the idea about fairly pure cost of capital proceeding that's just looking at the math and the principles of the policy around what a fair return given the unique risks that utilities are asked to bear in California, given that we are at the leading edge of the clean energy transition. 
So anyway, just a few rambling thoughts there, Julien. Maria, anything you want to clean up or change there?"

Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.94 compared to $1 a year ago. However, this comparison is not meaningful because SCE did not receive a final decision in track 1 of its 2021 General Rate Case during the quarter. As many of you are aware, our proposed decision was issued on July 9. The utility will file its opening comments later today and reply comments on August 3. While Maria will cover the PD in more detail, our financial performance for the quarter and other financial topics, let me first give you a few observations, which are summarized on Page 2. 
The PD's base rate revenue requirement of $6.9 billion is approximately 90% of SCE's request. The primary drivers of the reduction are lower funding for wildfire insurance premiums, vegetation management and depreciation. The main reduction to SCE's 2021 capital forecast was for the Wildfire Covered Conductor Program. Excluding wildfire mitigation-related capital, the PD would approve 98% of SCE's 2021 capital request, much of which was uncontested. 
The PD acknowledged the often-competing objectives of balancing safety and reliability risks with the costs associated with ensuring SCE can make necessary investments to provide safe, reliable and clean energy. The PD also notes that wildfire mitigation is a high priority for the state and the commission. The PD supports critical safety and reliability investments and provides the foundation for capital spending and rate base through 2023. We believe it is generally well reasoned, but it has some major policy implications that are fundamentally inconsistent with where the state is headed. SCE's CEO, Kevin Payne, addressed these implications well during oral arguments earlier this week, and the utility will elaborate on them in his opening comments, which are outlined on Page 3. 
The largest area of concern is the significant proposed cuts to SCE's Wildfire Covered Conductor Program. This is SCE's paramount wildfire mitigation program, and the utility's comments will focus on ensuring the program scope is consistent with the appropriate risk analyses, state policy and achieving the desired level of risk mitigation. The proposed reductions would deprive customers of a key risk-reduction tool, so SCE is advocating strongly for a balanced final decision. We believe additional CPUC-authorized funding for SCE's covered conductor deployment is warranted to protect customers' and communities' vital interests and achieve the same objective for minimizing wildfire risk. 
As noted in prior discussions, SCE has prioritized covered conductor and other wildfire mitigation activities to urgently reduce wildfire risk. A scorecard of SCE's wildfire mitigation plan progress is on Page 4 of the deck. We believe that through the execution of the WMP and other efforts, SCE has made meaningful progress in reducing the risk that utility equipment will spark a catastrophic wildfire. Page 5 provides a few proof points of how SCE believes it has reduced wildfire risk for its customers. 
First, circuits with covered conductor have experienced 69% fewer faults than those without, which demonstrates the efficacy of this tool. In fact, on segments where we have covered the bare wire, there has not been a single CPUC-reportable ignition from contact with objects or wire-to-wire contact. 
Second, where SCE has expanded vegetation clearance distances and removed trees that could fall into its lines, there have been 50% fewer tree or vegetation-caused faults than the historic average. 
Lastly, since SCE began its high fire risk inspection program in 2019, it has found 66% fewer conditions requiring remediation on the same structures year-over-year. These serve as observable data points of the substantial risk reduction from SCE's wildfire mitigation activities. 
The utility will use the tools at its disposal to mitigate wildfire risk. This includes deploying covered conductor at a level informed by the final decision augmented by using Public Safety Power Shutoffs, or PSPS, to achieve the risk reduction originally contemplated for the benefit of customers. 
The PD also included comments on the topic of affordability. We agree that affordability is always important and must be weighed against the long-term investments in public safety. I will highlight that SCE's rates have generally tracked local inflation over the last 30 years and have risen the least since 2009 relative to the other major California IOUs. Currently, SCE's system average rate is about 17% lower than PG&E's and 34% lower than SDG&E's, reflecting the emphasis SCE has placed on operational excellence over the years. While we recognize that the increases in the next few years tied to the investments in safety for the communities SCE serves are higher than this historical average, SCE has demonstrated its ability to manage rate increases to the benefit of customers. Underfunding prudent mitigations like covered conductor would be penny wise and pound foolish, as it may ultimately lead to even greater economic pain and even loss of life for communities impacted by wildfires that could have been prevented. 
An active wildfire season is under way right now, and I would like to emphasize SCE's substantial progress in executing its WMP. Through the first half of the year, SCE completed over 190,000 high fire risk-informed inspections of its transmission and distribution equipment, achieving over 100% of its full year target. The utility also continues to deploy covered conductor in the highest risk areas. Year-to-date, SCE installed over 540 circuit miles of covered conductor in high fire risk areas. For the full year, SCE expects to cover at least another 460 miles for a total of 1,000 miles deployed in 2021, consistent with its WMP goal. 
Additionally, SCE is executing its PSPS action plan to further reduce the risk of utility equipment igniting wildfires and to minimize the effects on customers. SCE is on target to complete its expedited grid hardening efforts on frequently impacted circuits and expects to reduce customer minutes of interruption by 78%, while not increasing risks, assuming the same weather conditions as last year. To support the most vulnerable customers living in high fire risk areas when a PSPS is called, the utility has distributed over 4,000 batteries for backup power through its Critical Care Backup Battery program. 
We believe California is also better prepared to combat this wildfire season. The legislature has continued to allocate substantial funding to support wildfire prevention and additional firefighting resources. 
Just last week, the state announced that CAL FIRE has secured 12 additional firefighting aircraft for exclusive use in its state-wide response efforts, augmenting the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world. SCE is also supporting the readiness and response efforts of local fire agencies. In June, SCE contributed $18 million to lease 3 fire-suppression helicopters. This includes 2 CH-47 helitankers, the world's largest fire-suppression helicopters; and a Sikorsky-61 helitanker. All 3 aircraft have unique water and fire-retardant-dropping capabilities and can fly day and night. In addition, a Sikorsky-76 command-and-control helicopter, along with ground-based equipment to support rapid retardant refills and drops, will be available to assist with wildfires. The helitankers and command-and-control helicopter will be strategically stationed across SCE's service area and made available to various jurisdictions through existing partnerships and coordination agreements between the agencies through the end of the year. 
We also appreciate the strong efforts by President Biden, Energy Secretary Granholm and the broader administration. I was pleased to join the President, Vice President, cabinet members and Western Governors, including Governor Newsom, for a virtual working session on Western wildfire preparedness last month. The group highlighted key areas for continued partnership among the federal government, states and utilities including land and vegetation management, deploying technologies from DOE's national labs and other federal entities and enabling response and recovery. 
Let me conclude my comments on SCE's wildfire preparations for this year by pointing out a resource we made available for investors. We recently posted a video to our Investor Relations website featuring SCE subject matter experts discussing the utility's operational and infrastructure mitigation efforts and an overview of state actions to meet California's 2021 drought and wildfire risk. So please go check it out. 
Investing to make the grid resilient to climate change-driven wildfires is a critical component of our strategy, and it's just one element of our ESG performance. Our recently published sustainability report details the progress and long-term goals related to the clean energy transition and electrification. In 2020, approximately 43% of the electricity SCE delivered to customers came from carbon-free resources, and the company remains well positioned to achieve its goal to deliver 100% carbon-free power by 2045. 
SCE doubled its energy storage capacity during this year and continues to maintain one of the largest storage portfolios in the nation. We have been engaged in federal discussions on potential clean energy provisions and continue to support policies aligned with SCE's Pathway 2045 target of 80% carbon-free electricity by 2030. However, the electric affordability and reliability have to be top of mind as we push to decarbonize the economy through electrification. The dollars needed to eliminate the last molecule of CO2 from power generation will have a much bigger impact when spent instead on an electric vehicle or a heat pump. For example, the utility is spending over $800 million to accelerate vehicle electrification across its service area, and that's a key component to achieve an economy-wide net 0 goal most affordably. Recently, SCE opened its Charge Ready 2 program for customer enrollment. This program is going to support 38,000 new electric car chargers over the next 5 years, with an emphasis on locations with limited access to at-home charging options and disadvantaged communities. 
We are really proud that Edison's leadership in transportation and electrification was recently recognized by our peers with EEI's Edison Award. That's our industry's highest honor. SCE has been able to execute on these objectives while maintaining the lowest system average rate among California's investor-owned utilities and monthly residential customer bills that are below the national average. 
As we grow our business for the clean energy future, we are also adapting our infrastructure in our operations to a new climate reality. We're striving for best-in-class operations, and importantly, we are aiming to deliver superior value to our customers and to our investors. 
With that, let me turn it over to Maria for her financial report."
301891,1671863572,2390195,"Edison International, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover second quarter 2021 results, comments on the proposed decision in SCE's General Rate Case, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics.",1063,"Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover second quarter 2021 results, comments on the proposed decision in SCE's General Rate Case, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $0.94 per share for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $0.06 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not meaningful because SCE has not received a final decision in its 2021 General Rate Case and continues to recognize revenue from CPUC activities based on 2020 authorized levels. We will account for the 2021 GRC track 1 final decision in the quarter SCE receives it. 
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key second quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I'll highlight the primary contributors to the variance. 
To begin, revenue was higher by $0.10 per share. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.06 to this variance. However, this was offset by balancing account expenses. FERC-related revenue contributed $0.04 to the variance, driven by higher rate base and a true-up associated with filings SCE's annual formula rate update. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.11, and 2 items account for the bulk of this variance. First, cost recovery activities, which have no effect on earnings, were $0.05. This variance is largely due to costs recognized last year following the approval of cost tracked in a memo account. Second, lower wildfire mitigation-related O&M drove a $0.02 positive variance, primarily because fewer remediations were identified through the inspection process. This continues the trend we observed in the first quarter. Over the past few years, SCE has accelerated and enhanced its approach to risk-informed inspections of its assets. Inspections continue to be one of the important measures for reducing the probability of ignitions. For the first half of the year, while we have maintained the pace of inspections and met our annual target, we have observed fewer findings of equipment requiring remediation. Lastly, depreciation and property taxes had a combined negative variance of $0.10, driven by higher asset base resulting from SCE's continued execution of its capital plan. 
As Pedro mentioned earlier, SCE received a proposed decision on track 1 of its 2021 General Rate Case on July 9. If adopted, the PD would result in base rate revenue requirements of $6.9 billion in 2021, $7.2 billion in 2022 and $7.6 billion in 2023. This is lower than SCE's request primarily related to lower authorized expenses for wildfire insurance premiums, vegetation management, employee benefits and depreciation. 
For wildfire insurance, the PD would allow SCE to track premiums above authorized in a memo account for future recovery applications. The PD would also approve the vegetation management balancing account for costs above authorized. In its opening comments, SCE will address the PD's procedural error that resulted in the exclusion of increased vegetation management labor costs, driven by updated wage rates. Vegetation management costs that exceeded defined cap, including these higher labor costs, would be deferred to the vegetation management balancing account. The earliest the commission can vote on the proposed decision is at its August 19 voting meeting. Consistent with our past practice, we will provide 2021 EPS guidance a few weeks after receiving a final decision. 
I would also like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. As shown on Page 8, over the Track 1 period of 2021 through 2023, rate base growth would be approximately 7% based on SCE's request and approximately 6% based on the proposed decision. In the absence of the 2021 GRC final decision, SCE continues to execute a capital plan for 2021 that would result in spending in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. SCE will adjust spending for what is ultimately authorized in the 2021 GRC final decision while minimizing the risk of disallowed spending. We have updated our 2021 through 2023 rate base forecast to include the Customer Service Replatform Project. SCE filed a cost recovery application for the project last week. I will note that this rate base forecast does not include capital spending for fire restoration related to wildfires affecting SCE's facilities and equipment in late 2020. This could add approximately $350 million to rate base by 2023. 
Page 9 provides a summary of the approved and pending cost recovery applications for incremental wildfire-related costs. SCE recently received a proposed decision in the CEMA proceeding for drought and 2017 fire-related costs. The PD would authorize recovery of $81 million of the requested revenue. As you can see on Page 10, during the quarter, SCE requested a financing order that would allow us to issue up to $1 billion of recovery bonds to securitize the costs authorized in GRC track 2, 2020 residential uncollectibles and additional AB 1054 capital authorized in GRC track 1. SCE expects a final decision on the financing order in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Page 11. SCE continues to make solid progress settling the remaining individual plaintiff claims arising from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. During the second quarter, SCE resolved approximately $560 million of individual plaintiff claims. That leaves about $1.4 billion of claims to be resolved or less than 23% of the best estimate of total losses. 
Turning to Page 12. Let me conclude by building on Pedro's earlier comments on sustainability. I will emphasize the strong alignment between the strategy and drivers of EIX' business and the clean energy transition that is under way. In June, we published our sustainable financing framework outlining our intention to continue aligning capital raising activities with sustainability principles. We have identified several eligible project categories, both green and social, which capture a sizable portion of our capital plan, including T&D infrastructure for the interconnection and delivery of renewable generation using our grid, our EV charging infrastructure programs, grid modernization and grid resiliency investments. Shortly after publishing the framework, SCE issued $900 million of sustainability bonds that will be allocated to eligible projects and reported on next year. 
Our commitment to sustainability is core to the company's values and a key element of our stakeholder engagement efforts. Importantly, our approach to sustainability drives the large capital investment plan that needs to be implemented to address the impacts of climate change and to serve our customers safely, reliably and affordably. 
That concludes my remarks."

So I think as you've seen us say in the past, we are looking at all the tools in the toolbox. Given our terrain and the fact that the really predominant -- one of the predominant forms of ignition in the past has been from contacts with foreign objects. We find that covered conductor has really provided the optimal tool for reducing risk while maintaining affordability for customers. And so we see that covered conductor has something like 70% of the risk reduction that undergrounding has. The cost difference in the numbers we've seen to date, obviously, the team continues to keep track of what's going on and talking with our peers and talking with experts about potential improvements. But I think the latest numbers we've seen are that covered conductor cost us something like $456,000 a mile whereas underground, on average, in our territory, it will cost you about $3.4 million a mile. 
We have seen some spot applications, and in fact, there's about 17 miles that we targeted to underground between this year and next year. And we'll continue to look at the tool in the toolbox, but at least with our territory, with our incidence of historical ignitions, we believe that covered conductor provides a -- really an optimal tool in terms of both risk reduction and affordability."

Maria may have more, and Kevin Payne is here as well if we miss anything. Look, there'll be 2 thoughts that come right away to mind. First is  GRCs are litigated proceedings, right?  And so you always have at least 2 site",532,"Yes. I'll give you some thoughts. Maria may have more, and Kevin Payne is here as well if we miss anything. Look, there'll be 2 thoughts that come right away to mind. First is  GRCs are litigated proceedings, right?  And so you always have at least 2 sites -- actually multiple sites with multiple intervenors. You have some intervenors that are more focused on purely the affordability side of things. I think as the utility, we're really working hard to provide well-supported testimony and analysis that is looking at finding the right balance, right? 
We're balancing -- first of all, having a reliable system -- actually above all, having a safe system that needs to be inviolate. But you really see trade-offs between reliability and affordability, right? You could always spend more to get an extra percentage point in reliability, but at some point, it becomes unaffordable for the customer.  So it's how do you find the right balance. 
I think as you heard me say in the prepared remarks already, the -- really the largest issue here -- it's not the only but the largest issue has been the position that TURN took in terms of the risk reduction provided by covered conductor and how many miles are enough. And we just have a fundamental difference in view in terms of the policy argument that they're making. 
We are facing a significant wildfire risk across the state. We've seen it in our area. We strongly believe that the wildfire mitigation plans that we prepared really help address that risk. And you saw the data that we shared in the deck and that I mentioned in my remarks around some of these early returns that we're experiencing with significant decreases in some of the risks that we had just 3 years ago, right? 
So I cited the figures on reduction in faults, and frankly, no CPUC-reportable ignitions yet on miles that we've covered, where we used to have bare wire. So the fundamental policy debate here is the -- TURN has what we think of some flawed math about stopping at 2,700 miles. And we believe that the plan we've laid out that will go to over 6,000 miles, covering about 60% of the 10,000 miles in high fire risk areas, provides that kind of risk protection that our customers need. That's consistent with the emphasis the state has on fire mitigation, fire suppression. 
So affordability is always really important. But one final point I'll give you is one that Kevin Payne made really well during the oral argument. Affordability is not just about the bill that you get tomorrow. Affordability is about the entire economic equation. And if we allow unmitigated wildfire risk to persist and a fire takes place that could have been prevented, that's a much bigger affordability shock for that community in the long run, in addition to the health and safety impact that it can have. 
So we think we've got it right in terms of the policy trade-offs, and we hope that the 5 commissioners will agree with that in the final decision. 
Maria, if you have anything to add there? Or did I cover it?"

Right now, if you look at sort of the amount of time remaining until the measurement period is over, yields would have to average just over 4% to kind of make the whole year average within the dead band.  So what happens, the end of the measurement period is the end of September. 
We all know that the PTC has taken positions on prior requests to either extend and defer changes on the cost of capital for others. And we also know from our experience back in 2017 that they really prefer to see litigated cases, and we're preparing testimony that's going to focus on the differentiated role and the risks that California IOUs have and that notwithstanding these lower interest rates, that's really driven by these extraordinary events over the past 18 months in all of the government programs that have been implemented to alleviate the impact of the pandemic. But that should not really imply that a change in the ROE is necessary. And I think that the changes in the volatility certainly underscore that. And I think regardless of what happens, we have to file next spring for another cost of capital proceeding. So those are the sorts of things that we are thinking about. 
I think since that basic issue, we really need to demonstrate that notwithstanding the interest rate environment, the cost of equity is, in fact, lower. We'll continue to look at everything that's going on, options on how to best get that point across to the commission, to the intervenors and also to really underscore the point that financially stable IOUs and California IOUs that are attractive to investors ultimately support customer affordability in the long run, too. So I think we're just going to continue to monitor the situation. We're preparing testimony already, and we'll go from there."

So I'll just kind of go back to sort of where I always like to start with this. Our financing plan is really built from the perspective of maintaining investment-grade ratings, and back when we moved to a best estimate for the wildfire liability last year, we said we would issue approximately $1 billion of equity to support the ratings and then that would allow SCE to continue to issue debt to fund the wildfire claims payment. And since then, we've been evaluating our needs, and we focused on different financing options. And back in March, we issued the $1.25 billion of pref and that had the 50% equity content. 
We've also said in the past that we do think we have flexibility regarding the timing. And so we're continuing to have that belief that we can be flexible in terms of timing. And we're continuing to monitor market conditions, and that's going to inform our next steps. We're going to continue to consider, and I think we've talked about this a little bit before, the tools that we would use. So continue to consider preferred equity, internal programs and then, if needed, the ATM. Now that's that piece associated with sort of the ongoing discussion around the wildfire claims and the liabilities in '17 and '18. 
Separately, we've also talked about the need on an ongoing basis what we think is a minimal equity requirement. That piece of it, that ongoing minimal equity need associated with the core business, is one that we will provide more specificity around once we get the final decision.

So Constantine, you know that our policy year is July 1 through June 30, so we just started a new policy year. In terms of the PD, the original request in the PD when we file the application rates were increasing by big percentages year-over-year, and our request had something like a $600 million wildfire insurance premium embedded in it. 
What came out in the PD is that, one, very importantly, they reiterated that wildfire insurance premiums are a cost of service, so customers will pay for that as part of their rate. They approved a number or an authorized revenue of about $460 million, which is actually, as it turns out, sufficient or at least if we were to look at the balance of this year and then the beginning part of the year, which was the last policy year, that is comparable or at least a little bit more than what the premiums are. 
We expect the expense for this year to be about $425 million for about -- for $1 billion gross of insurance, but net, once you deduct out the self-insured retention and a little bit of coinsurance, is about $875 million of wildfire insurance, which is consistent once you get right through to it with what's required under AB 1054. So from that perspective, good policy points on cost of service aligned with, at least for this year, what premiums would be. 
The third piece of it is that they also reiterated that to the extent premiums go up in the future, we can use that memo account feature that we have used in the past and successfully recovered premiums under in the future as well. So that's all good. 
The one piece of conversation that we will continue to have with them is whether or not it is better to actually collect a little bit more from customers, not just the amount of the wildfire insurance premium but also collect a little bit for customer-funded health insurance, which may over time be more economical for customers since, to the extent you don't have a loss, you keep it and roll it over to the next year, which is different than what you do with the premium."

But joking aside, and Maria, maybe you can come in here with details. I'll give you a high-level answer to your high-level question. It's similar to what you heard from us before, right?  What you see in the rate case, obviously, is very concrete, and we'll see where the final decision comes out. But as we look forward and we think about the clean energy transition, right, there's a number of things as part of the transition that will either support our view that we'll continue to have robust investment needs for a long time or potentially create upside to that. 
Areas like -- we -- I talked a little bit in my remarks about Charge Ready. Open question right now as to whether there will be a further role needed for utilities to continue to support the charging infrastructure market or whether private entities will be able to step in and do that fully. 
Interestingly, I think -- Maria said Commissioner Rechtschaffen, who had a recent commission meeting, was, I just think, thinking out loud about now there may well be the need to have utilities step in and do more, just given the scale of the transition. And in particular, as I look at it, it's not just about getting charging infrastructure to the average customer and making sure that the transition is equitable.  So therefore, making sure there's enough penetration in disadvantaged communities, low-income communities, where private players might not be as economically enticed to do that and where there might be a case to socialize more of that to the build. So transportation is certainly one area. Storage is another. 
We know that the -- our GRC request included in there, I think, an assumption of, what's it, 60 megawatts or so of new storage over the pendency of the rate case period. But as we see the amounts of storage that will continue to be needed moving forward and the -- certainly the potential for some of that to be part and parcel of utility operations might make a lot of sense for some portion of that to be in rate case, right? And so that also creates either support for an overall investment trajectory or potentially even further upside. 
Building electrification is another area where we've seen, frankly, relatively little progress to date compared to what we think will be needed as we head out -- as we, the state, heads out to 2030 and 2045. 
And so right now, the utility team is thinking about are there places where the utility will be able to help and where it will be economic for our customers to support that rate. Because you need both of those, right? And so there's some good thinking under way right now around are there potential programs where we might be able to be helpful to the state's transition. 
So that gives you a few examples. Maria, you may have more specific things."

More detail to come as the team, as you say, with the pencil to paper or virtually the pencil to paper works more on the specifics. But in terms of things that have been filed already, where the numbers are more explicit, we did recently include in our rate base forecast, so already in the numbers, but we did recently include our Customer Service Replatform project. So that's -- that reflects about $500 million or so of rate base by the time you get out to 2023. So that's now embedded. Application was filed last week. 
Also, we did, as you know, experience wildfires in our service territory late last year up in the Big Creek area. A lot of restoration had to go on there. We haven't yet applied for recovery of that, but that would be, say, about another $350 million of rate base if approved. I'll say in the year 2023, it's probably a reasonable time frame.

Well, the Customer Service Replatform project replaces a very, very old system, so it was very much needed. Some of it was written in software languages that we couldn't even get people to -- who knew them anymore. So I think from that perspective, very much needed. I think over the course of the implementation, the team has had ongoing dialogue with energy division and the like to keep them apprised of what's been happening at the project. 
There have been, over time, some cost increases, obviously, because we had to wrap more into the project given the complexity of our system. But we think that all the work that we've done really is well justified, and the testimony that we filed supports that. We're now in stabilization mode. And so we keep keeping a close eye on just customer satisfaction, ability to answer customers' questions, all of the things that you would expect to happen when your -- when a new system goes live. But the team is very, very attuned to that, and we've added extra folks in the stabilization mode as well. So I think we've done all the things that we should be doing in order to ensure that we can make a good case with the commission."

First, it's what we've been doing for the last 5, 6, 7, 8 years, right? And you've seen us create a lot of rate headroom in order to do the work that we needed to do. I commented in my prepared remarks on the way that we've maintained O&M cost increases and frankly, total system rate -- system average rate increases at around the level of inflation for the last 3 decades.  And I know we've talked with you and with other investors and analysts significantly about that in the past. We've continued that track record. Obviously, this GRC is a major departure from that driven in large part by the wildfire-related needs. But we will continue to look at opportunities to do better cost management, to do more use of technology that can help make our work more effective, more efficient. That's definitely an ongoing tool. And I don't think on that one you're ever done, right? Because the reality is the bar keeps going up. The digital tools, the data analytics, all of these continue to improve and open up new opportunities that I don't think any of us imagined 5 or 10 years ago. So I'd say that's part 1 of the answer. 
Part 2 kind of goes back to some of the discussion in -- for some of the earlier questions. There is a there's a balance there, right? And it's important that the commission be thinking about affordability broadly not only in terms of the near-term rate increase but the impacts of that over time, the risk that it either mitigates or doesn't mitigate the risk it might leave behind on the table that might then increase the risk of wildfire in the future that would have a much more devastating economic impact on the community, or the risk that by not spending enough on covered conductor, we might have to continue using PSPS for a longer period of time in a particular community, which has its own set of impacts, right? I know that the commission has appropriately been very sensitive to those. 
So there is absolutely a balancing act there. It's a tough job the regulator has, a tough job that we have. But I think we've put together a well-thought-out approach for balancing those risks. So just a few reactions. Maria, you may have others."

I guess, Julien, the one thing I would also add to that are maybe 2 things. If we go all the way back to when we filed our application for this GRC, we actually teed that up for the commission and said we know we have to balance a lot of different things between what we need to invest for safety and also in wildfire risk mitigation and then affordability for our customers. So we actually told them that some of our investments in infrastructure replacement, we would hold on to and not propose for this GRC cycle and instead take that up again when more of the wildfire mitigation CapEx had been spent. 
So I think that balance is one that we always try to strike. And I think it's the conversation with the commission, and the commission raised it during their own affordability en banc because they recognize that over the longer term, more electrification is actually going to drive lower cost for customers. 
You've seen it in our pathway paper. The commission themselves recognize that electrification will reduce energy as a customer -- as the share of customer wallet. So we have to focus on the near term with a view not just on affordability, what's on the bill. As Kevin said in his oral argument, it's the overall economic proposition that we have to think about with our customers. 
And so let's get this done. I think one of the numbers he quoted in his oral arguments was that if we increase covered conductor to the level that we had in the request, that's really about $2 a month on the customer bill. I'm not trying to minimize that. I know people are in different situations economically. But when you think about the alternative, that's really, I think, the most economical choice. And then that resiliency tees up the system and the customers for the long term when electrification really does minimize costs."

And Maria, let me just pick up one more thing triggered by your comments. Julien, a lot of the focus right now, certainly in this rate case, is on the affordability trade-off relative to wildfire mitigation. I think as we move forward over the next decade or 2, to Maria's point, aligned with our Pathway 2045 analysis, I think we'll see more of the discussion shift to the affordability trade-offs relative to meeting clean energy targets and decarbonizing the economy. Because it's so important that, frankly, the analytical work we've done that demonstrates that using clean electricity to electrify a lot of the economy is the cheapest way for the economy to get to net 0, right? 
This will put pressure on the electric bill. I don't think it will be the sort of rate increases year-on-year that we see in this rate case, right? But we might see excursions to a little bit of local inflation in order to build out the infrastructure needed to electrify much more of the economy and, therefore, decarbonize, right? 
And so frankly, part of our job and the job of future teams at Edison over the next 2 decades will be to constantly be putting good educational materials out there, good analysis around the world, not just the cents per kilowatt-hour world but the world in a dollars per ton of GHG removed perspective because that's just as important a metric as the cents per kilowatt-hour."

First -- look, at the end of the day, the customer sees one bill, right? And so we want to make sure we're pulling on all the levers to provide them an affordable experience that's also safe and reliable and clean and also to make sure that we have an appropriate opportunity for our investors to get a return on and off their capital, right? 
So kind of stating the blindingly obvious that's important. The other reaction though is that we do have separate proceedings in California. We think we've seen a lot of value in having a separate rate case proceeding from a different cost of capital proceeding. And particularly, as we get to a cost of capital filing, while clearly, I'm sure in the commission's minds, in our minds, we'll all be thinking about the impacts on customers of various increments. 
Cost of capital in California is really constructed around ensuring that there's a fair opportunity for investors, for shareholders to -- can get that return often on capital in order to make the California investment an attractive one relative to investments elsewhere in the country and in other marketplaces, right? 
And so particularly as we head into a period over the next decade or 2 where the country as a whole will see a dramatic need for investment across all sectors of the economy to decarbonize, it's really important that the regulatory framework in California remain one that is viewed as fair, as stable, as compensatory to shareholders and to all stakeholders and one where, frankly, cost of service principles are respected, right? 
And so you're seeing a lot of our advocacy focused on making sure that we are constantly coming back to the central line in terms of what's a fair cost of service and how do we get recovery in that versus what things -- in what areas should the shareholder bear risk of recovery. 
And so that's why I like the idea about fairly pure cost of capital proceeding that's just looking at the math and the principles of the policy around what a fair return given the unique risks that utilities are asked to bear in California, given that we are at the leading edge of the clean energy transition. 
So anyway, just a few rambling thoughts there, Julien. Maria, anything you want to clean up or change there?"

And before I start commenting on the quarter, I wanted to note the senior leadership changes that we announced last week, Kevin Payne, SCE's President and CEO, plans to retire on December 1, and this is after 35 years with the company. Kevin's had a profound impact of the utility, most particularly with its customer-centric focus, leading our wildfire risk mitigation efforts and advocating for and advancing the company's clean energy strategy.
While I am going to miss my good friend very much, I am delighted with our deep bench. Steve Powell will succeed Kevin as President and CEO; and Jill Anderson, currently Senior Vice President of Customer Service, will succeed Steve as EVP of Operations. 
Promoting Edison talent will ensure a seamless transition, and I believe that Steve and Jill both bring exceptional experience to their new roles. I know that a number of you have already met Steve and Jill and many of you will have an opportunity to meet them next week at EEI's financial conference as well.
Turning to the quarter. Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $1.67 a year ago. This comparison is not meaningful because during the quarter, SCE recorded a true-up for the final decision in Track 1 of its 2021 general rate case, which is retroactive to January 1. Reflecting the year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our 2021 EPS guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52. 
We are also reiterating our longer-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% through 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance in detail in her report. Now starting with past events. SCE today announced 2 updates related to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. 
Page 3 in the slide deck provides an overall summary. First, SCE revised the best estimate of potential losses to $7.5 billion from $6.2 billion. As we have mentioned in our continuing communications on this topic, we evaluate the best estimate quarterly. As part of the ongoing and very complex litigation process, we diligently consider new information that arises to provide all of you with our best estimate. Based on additional information across a broad set of claim types collected during the quarter, along with an agreement with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division, or SED, which I'll talk about in a minute, SCE revised its estimate of the total potential losses. 
While the total estimate increased this quarter, SCE continued to make meaningful progress, settling claims and completed approximately $485 million of settlements. SCE has now settled about 70% of the estimated exposure for the 2017 and 2018 events.
I want to emphasize that we do not need equity above our previously disclosed 2021 financing plan to fund the higher estimated losses. Maria will address this topic later on the call. Second, utility reached an agreement with the SED to resolve its investigations into the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and 3 other 2017 wildfires. As we have previously disclosed, the SED has conducted investigations to assess SCE's compliance with applicable rules and regulations in areas affected by the Thomas, Koenigstein, and Woolsey
Fires.
It was possible that CPUC would initiate formal enforcement proceedings to pursue fines and penalties for alleged violations though we were unable to estimate the magnitude or the timing as part of our best estimate. The recently executed agreement, which is subject to CPUC approval, would resolve that uncertainty. 
The agreement has a total value of $550 million, composed of about $110 million fine, $65 million of shareholder-funded safety measures and an agreement by SCE to waive its right to seek cost recovery for $375 million of uninsured claims payments out of the $5.2 billion total in the current best estimate. 
In the SED agreement, SCE did not admit imprudence, negligence or liability with respect to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and will seek rate recovery of prudently incurred actual losses in excess of available insurance other than for the $375 million waived under the SED agreement. While SCE disputes a number of the alleged violations reaching an agreement puts one additional uncertainty behind us. 
Let me now address the Southern California wildfire season. SCE continues to make solid progress on the execution of its wildfire mitigation plan or WMP and its PSPS action plan. SCE has installed over 1,000 miles of covered conductor year-to-date, bringing the total to 2,500 miles since program inception. 
Over the past 3 years, the utility has replaced about 25% of its overhead distribution power lines in high fire risk areas with covered conductor. SCE has also performed another annual cycle of inspections in high fire risk areas, supplemented with additional inspections targeting dry fuel areas.
This resulted in approximately 195,000 assets, undergoing 360-degree inspections in SCE's high-power risk area. SCE also continues to be on track to meet most of its goals outlined in our WMP by end of the year. And the scorecard is shown on Page 4 of the slide deck.
All these ongoing mitigation actions continue to strengthen our confidence in our utilities overall improved risk profile with respect to wildfires. 
Turning to Page 5. We highlight the metrics we showed you last quarter, which are proof points of how SCE believes it has reduced wildfire risk for its customers. We have added an additional metric. Looking back at past wildfire events and considering the utility's current PSPS protocols, we can't quantify the damage that would have been prevented. 
Using red flag warning days as a proxy for when the utility would use PSPS today, SCE would have prevented over 90% of the structures damaged or destroyed for fires larger than 1,000 acres associated with its infrastructure. However, we think it is much more important to assess how much total risk SCE has reduced on a forward-looking basis. 
And we have summarized on Page 6. In total, considering physical mitigation measures such as covered conductor, operational practices such as treat removals, inspections and vegetation management and the use of PSPS. SCE estimates that it has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 55% to 65% relative to pre-2018 levels.
This is based on a recent analysis using risk management solutions, industry-leading wildfire model and SCE's data related to actual mitigations deployed and mitigation effectiveness, which enabled us to quantify the risk reduction. While the risk can never be fully eliminated, the utility does expect to further reduce risk and to decrease the need for PSPS to achieve this risk reduction with continued grid-hardening investments.
As California continues to transition to a clean energy economy, maintaining and even improving system reliability becomes essential, particularly with greater reliance on electricity. SCE worked closely with the Governor's office, Cal-ISO, the CPUC, customers and many stakeholders to avoid rolling outages this past summer when the state and the entire West once again faced record temperatures.
Major California energy agencies, including the Kaisa, California Energy Commission and CPUC have indicated that additional capacity is needed to support summer 2020 -- summer 2022, pardon me, under extreme conditions like the heat, drought and wildfires we have seen repeatedly over the past several years. 
To accelerate construction of new capacity, the governor issued an emergency proclamation that requested the CPUC to work with load-serving entities to accelerate construction of energy storage for 2021 and 2022. 
To this end, in addition to securing over 230 megawatts of additional capacity from third parties, SCE plans to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage for this upcoming summer. 
This is a material increase in incremental capacity to mitigate the risk of statewide customer outages for summer 2022, caused by extreme weather events and continued drought conditions. While the governor signed the largest climate package in state history, which included 24 bills and over $15 billion in climate, clean energy and wildfire prepares funding, there is still an ongoing need for a lot more to be done. 
So I would like to highlight a paper that we recently released and it's entitled Mind the Gap, policies for California's countdown to 2030. This policy paper is Edison International's latest contribution to identify policies and actions needed to help California reduce emissions and decarbonize the economy. 
In the paper, we identified state and federal policy recommendations needed for California to meet its 2030 climate target, which is a foundational way point for the states to achieve its goal to the decarbonize its economy by 2045. While California has made progress in reducing GHG emissions, closing the gap between the current trajectory and its 2030 goal requires a significant acceleration of effort. 
It means quadrupling the average 1% annual reduction in GHG emissions achieved by the state since 2006, quadrupling that to 4.1% per year between 2021 and 2030. That's a tall order, but it's feasible. It will require market transforming policies and incentives to advance critical areas, such as decarbonizing the power supply, preparing the grid for shifts in usage and increasing demands and electrifying transportation and buildings. 
As the only all electric investor-owned utility in California, SCE is well positioned to lead this transition. We will continue to work in close partnership with policymakers and stakeholders to identify ways to improve funding, planning, standard setting and other approaches to successfully achieve the equitable and affordable transition to a clean energy economy.
To emphasize affordability, our analysis shows that an electric led transition is the most affordable pathway since the greater efficiency of electric motors and appliances will reduce customers' total costs across all energy commodities by 1/3 by 2045. 
Edison International is committed to achieving net 0 GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045. And this covers the power SCE delivers to customers as well as Edison International's enterprise-wide operations, including supply chain. This all continues our alignment with the broad policies needed to address climate change and ensure a resilient grid.

My comments today will cover third quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share",1251,"Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover third quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share for the third quarter 2021, an increase of $0.02 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE recorded a true-up for the final decision in its 2021 general rate case, and that's retroactive back to January 1. 
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key third quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I will highlight the primary contributors to the variance. To begin, SCE receives a final decision in the 2021 GRC during the third quarter because first and second quarter results were based on 2020 authorized revenue, a true-up was recorded during the quarter for the first 6 months of 2021. 
This truth is reflected in several line items on the income statement for a net increase in earnings of $0.35. The components are listed in footnote 3. Higher 2021 revenues contributed $0.55 and including $0.50 related to the 2021 GRC decision, $0.04 for CPUC revenues related to certain tracking accounts and $0.01 [indiscernible] FERC. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.28 and mainly due to the establishment of the vegetation management and risk management balancing accounts, partially offset by increased wildfire mitigation costs due to the timing of regulatory deferrals in the third quarter of 2020. 
Depreciation had a negative variance of $0.20, primarily driven by a higher asset base and a higher depreciation rate resulting from the 2021 GRC decision. Income taxes had a negative variance of $0.41. This includes $0.39 of lower tax benefits related to balancing accounts and the GRC true-up, which are offsetting revenue and have no earnings impact.
At EIX Parents and Other, the loss per share was $0.09 higher than in third quarter 2020. The primary driver was preferred dividends on the $1.25 billion of preferred equity issued at the parent in March of this year. Now let's move to SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. 
As shown on Page 8, we have updated our capital forecast primarily to reflect the recently announced utility-owned storage investment. As Pedro mentioned, SCE filed an advice letter for cost recovery of $1 billion of capital spending to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage. 
SCE is seeking expedited approval of the advice letter to maximize the likelihood of the projects meeting their expected online dates for the incremental capacity needed for summer 2022. These projects are a prime example of the essential role utilities can play in quickly ensuring California has a safe, reliable and clean electricity supply. 
We increased our 2022 capital expenditure forecast by approximately $900 million and lowered the forecast somewhat for 2023 through 2025 because these storage projects accelerate some, but not all of the capacity we previously forecasted in those years. 
The net increase in the high end of the capital forecast for 2021 through 2025 is approximately $500 million. As shown on Page 9, we have also updated our rate base forecast to reflect the storage investments I just mentioned. 
This is the primary driver of the increase to the 2022 through 2025 rate base forecasts. For 2021, we also fine-tuned the forecast to reflect adjustments related to wildfire mitigation tracking accounts following the implementation of the 2021 GRC decision and quarter end estimates of the spending related to these accounts.
The results of these updates is a reduction to the 2021 rate base of $300 million. Overall, these updates result in a projected rate base growth rate of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025. Page 10 provides an update on several major approved and pending applications for recovery of amounts and regulatory assets.
This will result in significant incremental cash flow to SCE over the next few years. SCE expects to collect over $1.4 billion in rates between now and 2024 related to already approved applications.
About half of that balance will be recovered in 2022. For the 3 pending applications shown in the middle of the slide, assuming timely regulatory decisions, SCE expects to collect another $844 million by the end of 2023. 
Lastly, we show the remaining expected securitizations of AB 1054 capital expenditures. The utility recently received a final decision in its second securitization application. This will allow SCE to securitize $518 million of wildfire mitigation capital expenditures. 
SCE expects to complete the securitization in Q4 of this year or Q1 2022. The securitizations, along with the rate recovery of the other regulatory assets will allow SCE to pay down short-term debt and strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics. 
Turning to Page 11. During the quarter, SCE filed an application to establish its CPUC cost of capital for 2022 through 2024 and reset the cost of capital mechanism. SCE is requesting an ROE of 10.53% with resets to its cost of debt and preferred financing, which would keep customer rates unchanged. The utility's alternative request to maintain its ROE at 10.3% and reset the cost of debt and preferred would reduce customer rates by about $50 million in 2022. 
When SCE filed the cost of capital request in August, it paused any other filings related to the trigger mechanism. Last week, SCE was directed by the CPUC to file the information that would have normally been provided in those other filings.
The next step from here is that the commission will issue a scoping memo to outline the issues and procedural schedule. 
Turning to guidance. Pages 12 and 13 show our 2021 guidance and the preliminary modeling considerations for 2022. As Pedro mentioned earlier, we are narrowing the 2021 EPS guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52. 
Turning to Page 14. We see an average need of up to $250 million of equity content annually through 2025. The specific annual amounts will depend on the level of spending within our capital plan for that year. The significant new investment of $1 billion of utility-owned storage considerably accelerates the timing of the capital investment program and increases the overall opportunity as noted earlier.
To fund this growth, which is well above the high end of the capital spending range previously disclosed for next year, we
Anticipate accelerating the issuance of equity content securities from the 2023 through 2025
Period into 2022. The 2022 equity need will be in the range of $300 million to $400 million, and we will provide more specifics on the financing plan when we provide 2022 EPS guidance on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call.
Additionally, let me reiterate Pedro's comment that the SED agreement and update to the best estimate of potential losses associated with the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events do not require equity above the levels previously announced in our 2021 financing plan. 
Consistent with our prior disclosure, we plan to issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content to support investment-grade rating. In closing, I want to underscore the important role that SCE plays in ensuring safety and resiliency. This can be seen in the ongoing investment in risk-reducing wildfire mitigation as well as utility-owned storage to enhance near-term reliability.
These investments are indicative of the longer-term opportunity associated with meeting customer needs and clean energy objectives and gives us confidence in reiterating our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% for 2021 through 2025. That concludes my remarks."

In terms of timing for cost over that continues to be uncertain because we really need to work our way through a substantial portion of the claims in each of the events. We could potentially get to Thomas and Koningstein on one track and separately on Woolsey, but I think we need to get through the bulk of the claims in each of the events before we would be able to go file with PC and as I've said in prior calls, it's just really difficult to handicap the timing. Now we've made good progress. And as I mentioned, we've worked our way to something like 70% of the claims but it's difficult to handicap when exactly will complete that process."

So you heard us reaffirm that view of when we translated into earnings or EPS growth 5% to 7% EPS growth coming from that. And so we would view the opportunity set us falling within that range. 
The storage project shows you that sometimes they can be needs that pop up sooner than we might think and the ability to step in and take a meaningful action that will help the state with its resiliency and reliability in case that next summer ends up being one with extreme weather, just like the last couple of summers have been. 
It's just one indication that sometimes you can be called on to take these steps more quickly or in a large quantum like you see with a storage project. But I would say that we would continue to see the opportunities falling within the range that we provided. Maria, anything you would say differently there?"

I refer again to my prepared remarks here. The SED has powers and responsibility to do investigations. There's always uncertainty when you go into those processes, there's uncertainty as well in terms of how the CPUC will ultimately view the facts. 
We -- as I mentioned, don't agree with a number of the claims, but we recognize that there's a process here. And we believe it was a thoughtful being a prudent thing for us to do to put one more uncertainty behind us. And we therefore feel that the settlement is a way to do that. And so that's really the why now an opportunity presented itself to work with SED. And you see the makeup of the pieces here. 
We don't see that interfering with our ability to go seek cost recovery for prudently incurred expenses other than for the $375 million that were set aside in the settlement. And so again, it's frankly all about understanding that there's a lot of uncertainty and sometimes it's rational and kind of the right thing to do to do something that maybe we might not have agreed with overall in the different circumstances. 
But in this case, by entering the settlement and working constructively with SED, we can put that uncertainty behind us Maria, do you take the equity piece?"

So Shar, we talked a bunch before about our 2021 financing plan and the need to issue up to $1 billion of equity content securities. And that was really to support the 15% to 17% FFO to debt framework that we have at the company. And so as we assess the change in the reserve level, we think that, that $1 billion equity content in 2021 still supports our overall financing framework objective. And we've been pretty measured in how we approach issuing that additional equity or equity content securities. At the same time, SCE does issue debt to make claims payments. So if you think about the EIX financing plan that's in support of the metrics and then SCE's cash flow is tied to sort of when they issue debt to pay the claim.
At that level, the SCE level, they are basically pacing their financing plan along the same lines as when they make claims payments. I think when you think about the equity requirement that we have for this year, we've already done $1.25 billion of that preferred financing to get a certain amount of the equity content, and we'll continue to evaluate market conditions as we undertake the balance of the program."

So as you move out in time, obviously, in the front end, we have authorized -- we have the 2021 GRC decision. Now harking back to the utility on storage. You can have things happen even in the near term that increase your capital expenditure opportunities. 
But as you move out to '24 and '25, I think there are a few things going on. One, 2024 is a year in this rate case cycle that we haven't yet gotten authorization for us. So while it might look a lot like the attrition mechanism that's embedded in 2021 and '22 and '23, we do know there are some budget based approaches that we can use for wildfire mitigation. So we'll be focused on that and that can expand the range. 
If you look out beyond that, 2025 is actually a new rate case cycle. And so things like ongoing law for mitigation, but as we start to get back potentially to more infrastructure replacement and the like, that could drive the wider range that you see in the back end. In addition, there are opportunities potentially to file applications outside of the general rate case proceedings.
And so all the things that I think Pedro mentioned earlier around are there things around greenhouse gas emissions reductions on the path to 2045 -- areas around transportational education or building electrification or more energy storage or transmission, those are all things that move the range up and down."

Simply put, the more claims we go through, the more settlements we do, the more we learn. And I would hope that, that uncertainty band continues to narrow. As I mentioned, we now process around 70% of the exposure. 
And so we have been testing quarterly to see whether there are new pieces of information, more detail in terms of specific claims that are waiting down the pipe, et cetera, that would call for a need to change of reserves. We did not need to do that the prior quarter as we got to this quarter, we had enough new information in hand that this was the right thing to do, the appropriate thing to do under GAAP was to make the reserve adjustment. 
I would -- as we say in our disclosures, right, we're providing you the best estimate. There is uncertainty around that best estimate. At the end, we might find the things yet higher again. You might find that things end up lower than this. But I would hope that as more time goes on, and again, as we get more of the volume behind us, that picture will continue to sharpen . That's probably about the best I can do here, Steve. 
And I realize that would be great if we could provide more chapter and verse on what drove it, but given the active litigation that we have going on, that's challenging to do.

Pretty consistent in saying all along that our plan expectation is to seek recovery for prudently incurred costs. For purposes of striking the settlement and removing this uncertainty, we agreed to set aside that $375 million. But importantly, as I said earlier, we're not admitting to imprudence, we're not admitting to negligence. We're preserving every right to go and seek cost recovery. 
I can't tell you today the precise figure for which we'll see recovery because we need to continue -- complete investigations. I think I said this in prior quarters. Believe it or not, it's still true that I believe we still don't have our hands on some pieces of equipment because they're still being held by fire agencies.
And so -- and that's just as part of the process. But our expectation is that there are certainly, a number of strong arguments where we bring -- be able to bring to the table, and we'd expect to seek recovery for everything that we believe we should seek recovery for. Now the reason that you're not seeing that level of, I'll say, confidence show up in adjusting the reserves to include the assumption of recovery, is that since these are 2017 and 2018 events, and the only CPUC precedent that exists prior to the time frame of AB 1054 is the President of the San Diego Gas in the electric case under GAAP, we're really not able to assume any CPC recovery. That's it, you see that we've continued to assume recovery from FERC for the same set of facts. And so that, I think, points to our sense that recovery would be appropriate based on the facts. 
We can't assume it from the CPUC based on the Sandiegos electric precedent, but we will plan to make our case. And we've said before also that we believe to the CPUC's determination in the San Diego case. We've seen consistent with what we understood the facts to be in that case. So while AB 1054 provides us a strengthening of the framework, we do believe that we have the ability to go along to even prior AB 1054 to make our case for just a reasonable cost recovery based on facts, and we believe we'll have those facts here."

So I'll give you my quick reaction to that, which is I don't think we need legislation for that. I actually say that in many ways, AB 1054 provided the framework true already, right, because it's set up the whole wildfire mitigation plan process. It has reviewed by OAIS, enhanced ratification by the CPUC in addition of the state budget this year included a line item for an outside consultant who is advising the governor's office. And it's actually working with the utilities -- frankly speaking become a good venue for conversation and comparing of notes in addition to the work that we do, interfacing directly with our peers or the other utilities. 
But ultimately, I view the wildfire mitigation plan framework as the place where utilities are bringing updated information and new ideas about what tools they should be using to prevent fires and then ultimately, that feeds into the ramp in GRC processes. 
The other reason that's my reaction, Michael, is that this is something that's important in the WMP framework. The reality is that each of the utilities have fairly different territories. I mean from the outside, it looks like it's all California, right? But PG&E has 70,000 square miles. We have 50,000, Santiago has a smaller territory. But even if you look at PG&E versus ourselves, and I have mentioned this in prior calls, the territory for PG&E, the high-fire risk are territory includes a lot more geography that's more heavily forested. 
And so for example, for them, they -- as we understand it, from our discussions with them, they see a lot higher probability of ignition from trees falling into lines, those could be trees well outside of the vegetation management zone, the solage streaming zone. 
In Edison's case, much of the high fire risk area is not forest, it's Chaparral, it's Grasslands. There's a much higher probability of ignition throughout the Edison area for emission from context from objects, stuff flowing into the lines. And so that helps give a little bit of an insight into why for PG&E as they run the math. And I think generally, we're all using the same math equation but the variable -- the values of the variables are different, right? 
And so as we look at the cost benefit analysis for undergrounding versus cover conductor or other tools, my understanding is that trees falling in drives a lot of the incremental benefit from undergrounding. In our case, we see that covered conductor provides significant risk reduction adding much lower all-in cost. In addition, in SCE's territory since we had already gone through a pole-loading program that led to pole replacements, that means that a lot of our covered conductor installations, we don't have to go out and replace the pole, right? 
And so that takes out another cost increment that a utility might have if they need to not only replace the wires, but also replace the post handout. That's a little long-winded. The bottom line on that is that we have fairly different territories different needs. We're comparing notes. I think we used to have seen fundamental concepts, but the values you stick in to the equation are leading to different results for each of us. 
But we're staying connected, right? And to the extent that compute needs to learn more and see different results underground and we could potentially see more miles coming to scope for undergrounding for Edison. So we certainly continue to learn there. Yes Maria?"

And I think, Julien, you know that we've been really measured and in the approach that we've taken to issuing additional equity and equity content securities and we've been watching the cash flows and the like. And in our 2021 financing plan, we did envision that up to $1 billion of equity content. 
And so as we thought about and assess the change in the reserve level, we were looking at what we had already announced as our 2021 plan, and we think that it's still consistent even with the reserve level changing with the objective of improving credit metrics over time with that focus on the 15% to 17%.
Now the equity that we've discussed for next year and that we'll discuss in more detail when we get to the Q4 call, that really relates to sort of how we were thinking about the equity needs over the next 4 years through 2025 related to the growth of the utility. And so let's think back a little bit on how that ties together. So previously, when we laid out that '21 through 2025 EPS CAGR, we talked about the EPS CAGR of 5% to 7%.
We still firmly believe that, that is the range that we're in. And in terms of total equity needs over the period, we talked about up to $250 million a year, to some extent, varying based on the capital that was needed in that year. As we look over that period, while we've got $900 million more CapEx in 2022, which obviously that's in response to customer needs and the state needs with some reliability and that's on top of an already robust capital plan, we want to basically take some of the equity that otherwise would have turned up in later years and rebalance back to 2022. 
And that's again in support of our metrics. So that's kind of the balance that we're always trying to strike. And so those are how I think about the pieces of the equity need and how we thought through them as we develop the plan for the balance of this year and then for next year."

And before I start commenting on the quarter, I wanted to note the senior leadership changes that we announced last week,   Kevin Payne, SCE's President and CEO, plans to retire on December 1, and this is after 35 years with the company. Kevin's had a profound impact at the utility, most particularly with its customer-centric focus, leading our wildfire risk mitigation efforts and advocating for and advancing the company's clean energy strategy. 
While I am going to miss my good friend very much, I am delighted with our deep bench: Steve Powell will succeed Kevin as President and CEO; and Jill Anderson, currently Senior Vice President of Customer Service,  will succeed Steve as EVP of Operations.  
Promoting Edison talent will ensure a seamless transition, and I believe that Steve and Jill both bring exceptional experience to their new roles.   I know that a number of you have already met Steve and Jill and many of you will have an opportunity to meet them next week at EEI's Financial Conference as well. 
Turning to the quarter. Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $1.67 a year ago.  This comparison is not meaningful because during the quarter, SCE recorded a true-up for the final decision in track 1 of its 2021 general rate case, which is retroactive to January 1. Reflecting the year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our 2021 EPS guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52.  
We are also reiterating our longer-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% through 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance in detail in her report.   Now starting with past events. SCE today announced 2 updates related to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events.  
Page 3 in the slide deck provides an overall summary. First, SCE revised the best estimate of potential losses to $7.5 billion from $6.2 billion. As we have mentioned in our continuing communications on this topic, we evaluate the best estimate quarterly. As part of the ongoing and very complex litigation process, we diligently consider new information that arises to provide all of you with our best estimate.   Based on additional information across a broad set of claim types collected during the quarter, along with an agreement with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division, or SED, which I'll talk about in a minute,  SCE revised its estimate of the total potential losses.  
While the total estimate increased this quarter,   SCE continued to make meaningful progress, settling claims and completed approximately $485 million of settlements.  SCE has now settled about 70% of the estimated exposure for the 2017 and 2018 events. 
I want to emphasize that we do not need equity above our previously disclosed 2021 financing plan to fund the higher estimated losses. Maria will address this topic later on the call.   Second, the utility reached an agreement with the SED to resolve its investigations into the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and 3 other 2017 wildfires.   As we have previously disclosed, the SCD has conducted investigations to assess SCE's compliance with applicable rules and regulations in areas affected by the Thomas, Koenigstein, and Woolsey Fires. 
It was possible that CPUC would initiate formal enforcement proceedings to pursue fines and penalties for alleged violations though we were unable to estimate the magnitude or the timing as part of our best estimate.   The recently executed agreement, which is subject to CPUC approval, would resolve that uncertainty.  
The agreement has a total value of $550 million, composed of about $110 million fine, $65 million of shareholder-funded safety measures and an agreement by SCE to waive its right to seek cost recovery for $375 million of uninsured claims payments  out of the $5.2 billion total in the current best estimate.  
In the SCD agreement, SCE did not admit imprudence, negligence or liability with respect to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and will seek rate recovery of prudently incurred actual losses in excess of available insurance other than for the $375 million waived under the SED agreement.   While SCE disputes a number of the alleged violations reaching an agreement puts one additional uncertainty behind us.  
Let me now address the Southern California wildfire season.   SCE continues to make solid progress on the execution of its Wildfire Mitigation Plan or WMP and its PSPS action plan. SCE has installed over 1,000 miles of covered conductor year-to-date,  bringing the total to 2,500 miles since program inception.  
Over the past 3 years, the utility has replaced about 25% of its overhead distribution power lines in high fire risk areas with covered conductor.   SCE has also performed another annual cycle of inspections in high fire risk areas, supplemented with additional inspections targeting dry fuel areas. 
This resulted in approximately 195,000 assets, undergoing 360-degree inspections in SCE's high-power risk area.   SCE also continues to be on track to meet most of its goals outlined in our WMP by end of the year. And the scorecard is shown on Page 4 of the slide deck. 
All these ongoing mitigation actions continue to strengthen our confidence in our utilities overall improved risk profile with respect to wildfires.  
Turning to Page 5.  We highlight the metrics we showed you last quarter, which are proof points of how SCE believes it has reduced wildfire risk for its customers. We have added an additional metric.   Looking back at past wildfire events and considering the utility's current PSPS protocols, we can't quantify the damage that would have been prevented.    
Using red flag warning days as a proxy for when the utility would use PSPS today, SCE would have prevented over 90% of the structures damaged or destroyed for fires larger than 1,000 acres   associated with its infrastructure. However, we think it is much more important to assess how much total risk SCE has reduced on a forward-looking basis.  
And we have summarized this on Page 6.   In total, considering physical mitigation measures such as covered conductor, operational practices such as tree removals, inspections and vegetation management and the use of PSPS. SCE estimates that it has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 55% to 65% relative to pre-2018 levels. 
This is based on a recent analysis using risk management solutions, industry-leading wildfire model and SCE's data related to actual mitigations deployed and mitigation effectiveness, which enabled us to quantify the risk reduction. While the risk can never be fully eliminated, the utility does expect to further reduce risk and to decrease the need for PSPS to achieve this risk reduction with continued grid-hardening investments. 
As California continues to transition to a clean energy economy, maintaining and even improving system reliability becomes essential, particularly with greater reliance on electricity.  SCE worked closely with the Governor's office, CAISO, the CPUC, customers and many stakeholders to avoid rolling outages this past summer when the state and the entire West once again faced record temperatures. 
Major California energy agencies, including the CAISO, California Energy Commission and CPUC have indicated that additional capacity is needed to support summer 2020 -- summer 2022, pardon me, under extreme conditions like the heat, drought and wildfires we have seen repeatedly over the past several years.  
To accelerate construction of new capacity, the governor issued an emergency proclamation that requested the CPUC to work with load-serving entities to accelerate construction of energy storage for 2021 and 2022.    
To this end, in addition to securing over 230 megawatts of additional capacity from third parties, SCE plans to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage for this upcoming summer.   
This is a material increase in incremental capacity to mitigate the risk of statewide customer outages for summer 2022, caused by extreme weather events and continued drought conditions.   While the governor signed the largest climate package in state history, which included 24 bills and over $15 billion in climate, clean energy and wildfire preparedness funding, there is still an ongoing need for a lot more to be done.  
So I would like to highlight a paper that we recently released and it's entitled ""Mind the Gap: Policies for California’s Countdown to 2030."" This policy paper is Edison International's latest contribution to identify policies and actions needed to help California reduce emissions and decarbonize the economy.  
In the paper, we identified state and federal policy recommendations needed for California to meet its 2030 climate target, which is a foundational way point for the state to achieve its goal to the decarbonize its economy by 2045.   While California has made progress in reducing GHG emissions, closing the gap between the current trajectory and its 2030 goal requires a significant acceleration of effort.  
It means quadrupling the average 1% annual reduction in GHG emissions achieved by the state since 2006, quadrupling that to 4.1% per year between 2021 and 2030.   That's a tall order, but it's feasible. It will require market transforming policies and incentives to advance critical areas, such as decarbonizing the power supply, preparing the grid for shifts in usage and increasing demands and electrifying transportation and buildings.  
As the only all electric investor-owned utility in California, SCE is well positioned to lead this transition.   We will continue to work in close partnership with policymakers and stakeholders to identify ways to improve funding, planning, standard setting and other approaches to successfully achieve the equitable and affordable transition to a clean energy economy. 
To emphasize affordability, our analysis shows that an electric led transition is the most affordable pathway. Since the greater efficiency of electric motors and appliances will reduce customers' total costs across all energy commodities by 1/3 by 2045.  
Edison International is committed to achieving net 0 GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045. And this covers the power SCE delivers to customers  as well as Edison International's enterprise-wide operations, including supply chain. This all continues our alignment with the broad policies needed to address climate change and ensure a resilient grid. 
We will also continue to engage with state, national and global leaders to advance the clean energy transition, which is why today, I am joining you by phone from COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where am representing both Edison and EEI. And with that, Maria will provide her financial report."

My comments today will cover third quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share",1250,"Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover third quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share for the third quarter 2021, an increase of $0.02 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE recorded a true-up for the final decision in its 2021 general rate case, and that's retroactive back to January 1. 
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key third quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I will highlight the primary contributors to the variance. To begin, SCE received a final decision in the 2021 GRC during the third quarter because first and second quarter results were based on 2020 authorized revenue, a true-up was recorded during the quarter for the first 6 months of 2021. 
This true-up is reflected in several line items on the income statement for a net increase in earnings of $0.35. The components are listed in footnote 3. Higher 2021 revenues contributed $0.55 and including $0.50 related to the 2021 GRC decision, $0.04 for CPUC revenues related to certain tracking accounts and $0.01 at FERC. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.28, mainly due to the establishment of the vegetation management and risk management balancing accounts, partially offset by increased wildfire mitigation costs due to the timing of regulatory deferrals in the third quarter of 2020. 
Depreciation had a negative variance of $0.20, primarily driven by a higher asset base and a higher depreciation rate resulting from the 2021 GRC decision. Income taxes had a negative variance of $0.41. This includes $0.39 of lower tax benefits related to balancing accounts and the GRC true-up, which are offsetting revenue and have no earnings impact.
At EIX Parents and Other, the loss per share was $0.09 higher than in third quarter 2020. The primary driver was preferred dividends on the $1.25 billion of preferred equity issued at the parent in March of this year. Now let's move to SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. 
As shown on Page 8, we have updated our capital forecast primarily to reflect the recently announced utility-owned storage investment. As Pedro mentioned, SCE filed an advice letter for cost recovery of $1 billion of capital spending to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage. 
SCE is seeking expedited approval of the advice letter to maximize the likelihood of the projects meeting their expected online dates for the incremental capacity needed for summer 2022. These projects are a prime example of the essential role utilities can play in quickly ensuring California has a safe, reliable and clean electricity supply. 
We increased our 2022 capital expenditure forecast by approximately $900 million and lowered the forecast somewhat for 2023 through 2025 because these storage projects accelerate some, but not all of the capacity we previously forecasted in those years. 
The net increase in the high end of the capital forecast for 2021 through 2025 is approximately $500 million. As shown on Page 9, we have also updated our rate base forecast to reflect the storage investments I just mentioned. 
This is the primary driver of the increase to the 2022 through 2025 rate base forecasts. For 2021, we also fine-tuned the forecast to reflect adjustments related to wildfire mitigation tracking accounts following the implementation of the 2021 GRC decision and quarter end estimates of the spending related to these accounts.
The results of these updates is a reduction to the 2021 rate base of $300 million. Overall, these updates result in a projected rate base growth rate of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025. Page 10 provides an update on several major approved and pending applications for recovery of amounts and regulatory assets.
This will result in significant incremental cash flow to SCE over the next few years. SCE expects to collect over $1.4 billion in rates between now and 2024 related to already approved applications.
About half of that balance will be recovered in 2022. For the 3 pending applications shown in the middle of the slide, assuming timely regulatory decisions, SCE expects to collect another $844 million by the end of 2023. 
Lastly, we show the remaining expected securitizations of AB 1054 capital expenditures. The utility recently received a final decision in its second securitization application. This will allow SCE to securitize $518 million of wildfire mitigation capital expenditures. 
SCE expects to complete the securitization in Q4 of this year or Q1 2022. The securitizations, along with the rate recovery of the other regulatory assets will allow SCE to pay down short-term debt and strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics. 
Turning to Page 11. During the quarter, SCE filed an application to establish its CPUC cost of capital for 2022 through 2024 and reset the cost of capital mechanism. SCE is requesting an ROE of 10.53% with resets to its cost of debt and preferred financing, which would keep customer rates unchanged. The utility's alternative request to maintain its ROE at 10.3% and reset the cost of debt and preferred would reduce customer rates by about $50 million in 2022. 
When SCE filed the cost of capital request in August, it paused any other filings related to the trigger mechanism. Last week, SCE was directed by the CPUC to file the information that would have normally been provided in those other filings.
The next step from here is that the commission will issue a scoping memo to outline the issues and procedural schedule. 
Turning to guidance. Pages 12 and 13 show our 2021 guidance and the preliminary modeling considerations for 2022. As Pedro mentioned earlier, we are narrowing the 2021 EPS guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52. 
Turning to Page 14. We see an average need of up to $250 million of equity content annually through 2025. The specific annual amounts will depend on the level of spending within our capital plan for that year. The significant new investment of $1 billion of utility-owned storage considerably accelerates the timing of the capital investment program and increases the overall opportunity as noted earlier.
To fund this growth, which is well above the high end of the capital spending range previously disclosed for next year, we anticipate accelerating the issuance of equity content securities from the 2023 through 2025 period into 2022. The 2022 equity need will be in the range of $300 million to $400 million, and we will provide more specifics on the financing plan when we provide 2022 EPS guidance on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call.
Additionally, let me reiterate Pedro's comment that the SED agreement and update to the best estimate of potential losses associated with the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events do not require equity above the levels previously announced in our 2021 financing plan. 
Consistent with our prior disclosure, we plan to issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content to support investment-grade rating. In closing, I want to underscore the important role that SCE plays in ensuring safety and resiliency. This can be seen in the ongoing investment in risk-reducing wildfire mitigation as well as utility-owned storage to enhance near-term reliability.
These investments are indicative of the longer-term opportunity associated with meeting customer needs and clean energy objectives and gives us confidence in reiterating our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% for 2021 through 2025. That concludes my remarks."

We don't really see any impacts that the SCD settlement will have -- the SCD agreement will have on settlement activity. And importantly, as you heard me say, we didn't admit any claims there of ourselves of imprudence or the like. 
In terms of timing for cost recovery that continues to be uncertain because we really need to work our way through a substantial portion of the claims in each of the events. We could potentially get to Thomas and Koenigstein on one track and separately on Woolsey, but I think we need to get through the bulk of the claims in each of the events before we would be able to go file with PUC and as I've said in prior calls, it's just really difficult to handicap the timing. Now we've made good progress. And as I mentioned, we've worked our way to something like 70% of the claims, but it's difficult to handicap when exactly will complete that process."

So you heard us reaffirm that view of when we translated into earnings or EPS growth 5% to 7% EPS growth coming from that. And so we would view the opportunity set us falling within that range. 
The storage project shows you that sometimes there can be needs that pop up sooner than we might think and the ability to step in and take a meaningful action that will help the state with its resiliency and reliability in case that next summer ends up being one with extreme weather, just like the last couple of summers have been. 
It's just one indication that sometimes you can be called on to take these steps more quickly or in a large quantum like you see with a storage project. But I would say that we would continue to see the opportunities falling within the range that we provided. Maria, anything you would say differently there?"

And kind of related, Pedro, why settle now if you feel strong enough about prudence ahead of seeking recovery?"

I refer again to my prepared remarks here. The SED has powers and responsibility to do investigations. There's always uncertainty when you go into those processes. There's uncertainty as well in terms of how the CPUC will ultimately view the facts. 
We -- as I mentioned, don't agree with a number of the claims, but we recognize that there's a process here. And we believe it was a thoughtful thing, a prudent thing for us to do to put one more uncertainty behind us. And we therefore feel that the settlement is a way to do that. And so that's really the why now. An opportunity presented itself to work with SED and you see the makeup of the pieces here. 
We don't see that interfering with our ability to go seek cost recovery for prudently incurred expenses other than for the $375 million that were set aside in the settlement. And so again, it's frankly all about understanding that there's a lot of uncertainty and sometimes it's rational and kind of the right thing to do to do something that maybe we might not have agreed with overall under different circumstances. 
But in this case, by entering the settlement and working constructively with SED, we can put that uncertainty behind us. Maria, do you want to take the equity piece?"

So Shar, we talked a bunch before about our 2021 financing plan and the need to issue up to $1 billion of equity content securities. And that was really to support the 15% to 17% FFO to debt framework that we have at the company. And so as we assessed the change in the reserve level, we think that, that $1 billion equity content in 2021 still supports our overall financing framework objective. And we've been pretty measured in how we approach issuing that additional equity or equity content securities. At the same time, SCE does issue debt to make claims payments. So if you think about the EIX financing plan that's in support of the metrics and then SCE's cash flow is tied to sort of when they issue debt to pay the claims.
At that level, the SCE level, they are basically pacing their financing plan along the same lines as when they make claims payments. I think when you think about the equity requirement that we have for this year, we've already done $1.25 billion of that preferred financing to get certain amount of the equity content, and we'll continue to evaluate market conditions as we undertake the balance of the program."

So as you move out in time, obviously, in the front end, we have authorized -- we have the 2021 GRC decision. Now harking back to the utility on storage. You can have things happen even in the near term that increase your capital expenditure opportunities. 
But as you move out to '24 and '25, I think, there are a few things going on. One, 2024 is a year in this rate case cycle that we haven't yet gotten authorization for. So while it might look a lot like the attrition mechanism that's embedded in 2021 and '22 and '23, we do know there are some budget based approaches that we can use for wildfire mitigation. So we'll be focused on that and that can expand the range. 
If you look out beyond that, 2025 is actually a new rate case cycle. And so things like ongoing law for mitigation, but as we start to get back potentially to more infrastructure replacement and the like, that could drive the wider range that you see in the back end. In addition, there are opportunities potentially to file applications outside of the general rate case proceedings.
And so all the things that I think Pedro mentioned earlier around are there things around greenhouse gas emissions reductions on the path to 2045 -- areas around transportational, education or building electrification or more energy storage or transmission, those are all things that move the range up and down."

And so we have been testing quarterly to see whether there are new pieces of information, more detail in terms of specific claims that are waiting down the pipe, et cetera, that would call for a need to change of reserves. We did not need to do that. The prior quarter as we got to this quarter, we had enough new information in hand that this was the right thing to do, the appropriate thing to do under GAAP was to make the reserve adjustment. 
I would -- as we say in our disclosures, right, we're providing you the best estimate. There is uncertainty around that best estimate. At the end, we might find the things go yet higher again. You might find that things end up lower than this. But I would hope that as more time goes on, and again, as we get more of the volume behind us, that picture will continue to sharpen.

Steve, We've been pretty consistent in saying all along that our planned expectation is to seek recovery for prudently incurred costs. For purposes of striking the settlement and removing this uncertainty, we agreed to set aside that $375 million. Bu",383,"Yes. Steve, We've been pretty consistent in saying all along that our planned expectation is to seek recovery for prudently incurred costs. For purposes of striking the settlement and removing this uncertainty, we agreed to set aside that $375 million. But importantly, as I said earlier, we're not admitting to imprudence, we're not admitting to negligence. We're preserving every right to go and seek cost recovery. 
I can't tell you today the precise figure for which we'll seek recovery because we need to continue -- complete investigations. I think I said this in prior quarters. Believe it or not, it's still true that I believe we still don't have our hands on some pieces of equipment because they're still being held by fire agencies.
And so -- and that's just as part of the process. But our expectation is that there are certainly, a number of strong arguments where we bring -- be able to bring to the table, and we'd expect to seek recovery for everything that we believe we should seek recovery for. Now the reason that you're not seeing that level of, I'll say, confidence show up in adjusting the reserves to include the assumption of recovery, is that since these are 2017 and 2018 events, and the only CPUC precedent that exists prior to the time frame of AB 1054 is the precedent in the San Diego Gas & Electric case. Under GAAP, we're really not able to assume any CPUC recovery. That's it, you see that we've continued to assume recovery from FERC for the same set of facts. And so that, I think, points to our sense that recovery would be appropriate based on the facts. 
We can't assume it from the CPUC based on the San Diego Gas & Electric precedent, but we will plan to make our case. And we've said before also that we believe that the CPUC's determination in the San Diego case was inconsistent with what we understood the facts to be in that case.

I actually say that in many ways, AB 1054 provided the framework for that already, right? Because it's set up the whole wildfire mitigation plan process. It has review by OEIS, enhanced ratification by the CPUC. In addition, the state budget this year included a line item for an outside consultant who is advising the governor's office. And it's actually working with the utilities -- frankly speaking, it has become a good venue for conversation and comparing of notes in addition to the work that we do, interfacing directly with our peers of the other utilities. 
But ultimately, I view the Wildfire Mitigation Plan framework as the place where utilities are bringing updated information and new ideas about what tools they should be using to prevent fires and then ultimately, that feeds into the ramp in GRC processes. 
The other reason -- that's my reaction, Michael, is that this is something that's important in the WMP framework. The reality is that each of the utilities have fairly different territories. I mean from the outside, it looks like it's all California, right? But PG&E has 70,000 square miles. We have 50,000, Santiago has a smaller territory. But even if you look at PG&E versus ourselves, and I have mentioned this in prior calls, the territory for PG&E, the high-fire risk area territory includes a lot more geography that's more heavily forested. 
And so for example, for them, they -- as we understand it, from our discussions with them, they see a lot higher probability of ignition from trees falling into lines, those could be trees well outside of the vegetation management zone, the foliage clearing zone. 
In Edison's case, much of the high fire risk area is not forest, it's chaparral, it's grasslands. There's a much higher probability of ignition throughout the Edison area for ignition from contact from objects, stuff blowing into the lines. And so that helps give a little bit of an insight into why for PG&E as they run the math. And I think generally, we're all using the same math equation but the variable -- the values of the variables are different, right? 
And so as we look at the cost benefit analysis for undergrounding versus covered conductor or other tools, my understanding is that trees falling in drives a lot of the incremental benefit from undergrounding. In our case, we see that covered conductor provides significant risk reduction adding much lower all-in cost. In addition, in SCE's territory since we had already gone through a pole-loading program that led to pole replacements, that means that a lot of our covered conductor installations, we don't have to go out and replace the pole, right? 
And so that takes out another cost increment that a utility might have if they need to not only replace the wires, but also replace the poles that they hang up. That's a little long-winded. The bottom line on that is that we have fairly different territories different needs. We're comparing notes. I think we used to have same fundamental concepts, but the values you stick into the equation are leading to different results for each of us. 
But we're staying connected, right? And to the extent that PG&E continues to learn more and see different results with undergrounding and we could potentially see more miles coming to scope for undergrounding for Edison. So we certainly continue to learn there. Yes Maria?"

And I think, Julien, you know that we've been really measured and in the approach that we've taken to issuing additional equity and equity content securities and we've been watching the cash flows and the like. And in our 2021 financing plan, we did envision that up to $1 billion of equity content. 
And so as we thought about and assessed the change in the reserve level, we were looking at what we had already announced as our 2021 plan, and we think that it's still consistent even with the reserve level changing with the objective of improving credit metrics over time with that focus on the 15% to 17%.
Now the equity that we've discussed for next year and that we'll discuss in more detail when we get to the Q4 call, that really relates to sort of how we were thinking about the equity needs over the next 4 years through 2025 related to the growth of the utility. And so let's think back a little bit on how that ties together. So previously, when we laid out that '21 through 2025 EPS CAGR, we talked about the EPS CAGR of 5% to 7%.
We still firmly believe that, that is the range that we're in. And in terms of total equity needs over the period, we talked about up to $250 million a year, to some extent, varying based on the capital that was needed in that year. As we look over that period, while we've got $900 million more CapEx in 2022, which obviously that's in response to customer needs and the state needs with some reliability and that's on top of an already robust capital plan, we want to basically take some of the equity that otherwise would have turned up in later years and rebalance back to 2022. 
And that's again in support of our metrics. So that's kind of the balance that we're always trying to strike. And so those are how I think about the pieces of the equity need and how we thought through them as we developed the plan for the balance of this year and then for next year."

And before I start commenting on the quarter, I wanted to note the senior leadership changes that we announced last week.   Kevin Payne, SCE's President and CEO, plans to retire on December 1, and this is after 35 years with the company. Kevin's had a profound impact at the utility, most particularly with its customer-centric focus, leading our wildfire risk mitigation efforts and advocating for and advancing the company's clean energy strategy. 
While I am going to miss my good friend very much, I am delighted with our deep bench: Steve Powell will succeed Kevin as President and CEO; and Jill Anderson, currently Senior Vice President of Customer Service,  will succeed Steve as EVP of Operations.  
Promoting Edison talent will ensure a seamless transition, and I believe that Steve and Jill both bring exceptional experience to their new roles.   I know that a number of you have already met Steve and Jill and many of you will have an opportunity to meet them next week at EEI's Financial Conference as well. 
Turning to the quarter. Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $1.67 a year ago.  This comparison is not meaningful because during the quarter, SCE recorded a true-up for the final decision in track 1 of its 2021 general rate case, which is retroactive to January 1. Reflecting the year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our 2021 EPS guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52.  
We are also reiterating our longer-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% through 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance in detail in her report.   Now starting with past events. SCE today announced 2 updates related to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events.  
Page 3 in the slide deck provides an overall summary. First, SCE revised the best estimate of potential losses to $7.5 billion from $6.2 billion. As we have mentioned in our continuing communications on this topic, we evaluate the best estimate quarterly. As part of the ongoing and very complex litigation process, we diligently consider new information that arises to provide all of you with our best estimate.   Based on additional information across a broad set of claim types collected during the quarter, along with an agreement with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division, or SED, which I'll talk about in a minute,  SCE revised its estimate of the total potential losses.  
While the total estimate increased this quarter,   SCE continued to make meaningful progress, settling claims and completed approximately $485 million of settlements.  SCE has now settled about 70% of the estimated exposure for the 2017 and 2018 events. 
I want to emphasize that we do not need equity above our previously disclosed 2021 financing plan to fund the higher estimated losses. Maria will address this topic later on the call.   Second, the utility reached an agreement with the SED to resolve its investigations into the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and 3 other 2017 wildfires.   As we have previously disclosed, the SED has conducted investigations to assess SCE's compliance with applicable rules and regulations in areas affected by the Thomas, Koenigstein, and Woolsey Fires. 
It was possible that CPUC would initiate formal enforcement proceedings to pursue fines and penalties for alleged violations though we were unable to estimate the magnitude or the timing as part of our best estimate.   The recently executed agreement, which is subject to CPUC approval, would resolve that uncertainty.  
The agreement has a total value of $550 million, composed of about $110 million fine, $65 million of shareholder-funded safety measures and an agreement by SCE to waive its right to seek cost recovery for $375 million of uninsured claims payments  out of the $5.2 billion total in the current best estimate.  
In the SED agreement, SCE did not admit imprudence, negligence or liability with respect to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and will seek rate recovery of prudently incurred actual losses in excess of available insurance other than for the $375 million waived under the SED agreement.   While SCE disputes a number of the alleged violations, reaching an agreement puts one additional uncertainty behind us.  
Let me now address the Southern California wildfire season.   SCE continues to make solid progress on the execution of its Wildfire Mitigation Plan or WMP and its PSPS action plan. SCE has installed over 1,000 miles of covered conductor year-to-date,  bringing the total to 2,500 miles since program inception.  
Over the past 3 years, the utility has replaced about 25% of its overhead distribution power lines in high fire risk areas with covered conductor.   SCE has also performed another annual cycle of inspections in high fire risk areas, supplemented with additional inspections targeting dry fuel areas. 
This resulted in approximately 195,000 assets, undergoing 360-degree inspections in SCE's high fire risk area.   SCE also continues to be on track to meet most of its goals outlined in our WMP by end of the year. And the scorecard is shown on Page 4 of the slide deck. 
All these ongoing mitigation actions continue to strengthen our confidence in our utilities overall improved risk profile with respect to wildfires.  
Turning to Page 5.  We highlight the metrics we showed you last quarter, which are proof points of how SCE believes it has reduced wildfire risk for its customers. We have added an additional metric.   Looking back at past wildfire events and considering the utility's current PSPS protocols, we can't quantify the damage that would have been prevented.    
Using red flag warning days as a proxy for when the utility would use PSPS today, SCE would have prevented over 90% of the structures damaged or destroyed for fires larger than 1,000 acres   associated with its infrastructure. However, we think it is much more important to assess how much total risk SCE has reduced on a forward-looking basis.  
And we have summarized this on Page 6.   In total, considering physical mitigation measures such as covered conductor, operational practices such as tree removals, inspections and vegetation management and the use of PSPS, SCE estimates that it has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 55% to 65% relative to pre-2018 levels. 
This is based on a recent analysis using risk management solutions, industry-leading wildfire model and SCE's data related to actual mitigations deployed and mitigation effectiveness, which enabled us to quantify the risk reduction. While the risk can never be fully eliminated, the utility does expect to further reduce risk and to decrease the need for PSPS to achieve this risk reduction with continued grid-hardening investments. 
As California continues to transition to a clean energy economy, maintaining and even improving system reliability becomes essential, particularly with greater reliance on electricity.  SCE worked closely with the Governor's office, CAISO, the CPUC, customers and many stakeholders to avoid rolling outages this past summer when the state and the entire West once again faced record temperatures. 
Major California energy agencies, including the CAISO, California Energy Commission and CPUC have indicated that additional capacity is needed to support summer 2020 -- summer 2022, pardon me, under extreme conditions like the heat, drought and wildfires we have seen repeatedly over the past several years.  
To accelerate construction of new capacity, the governor issued an emergency proclamation that requested the CPUC to work with load-serving entities to accelerate construction of energy storage for 2021 and 2022.    
To this end, in addition to securing over 230 megawatts of additional capacity from third parties, SCE plans to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage for this upcoming summer.   
This is a material increase in incremental capacity to mitigate the risk of statewide customer outages for summer 2022, caused by extreme weather events and continued drought conditions.   While the governor signed the largest climate package in state history, which included 24 bills and over $15 billion in climate, clean energy and wildfire preparedness funding, there is still an ongoing need for a lot more to be done.  
So I would like to highlight a paper that we recently released and it's entitled ""Mind the Gap: Policies for California’s Countdown to 2030."" This policy paper is Edison International's latest contribution to identify policies and actions needed to help California reduce emissions and decarbonize the economy.  
In the paper, we identified state and federal policy recommendations needed for California to meet its 2030 climate target, which is a foundational way point for the state to achieve its goal to the decarbonize its economy by 2045.   While California has made progress in reducing GHG emissions, closing the gap between the current trajectory and its 2030 goal requires a significant acceleration of effort.  
It means quadrupling the average 1% annual reduction in GHG emissions achieved by the state since 2006, quadrupling that to 4.1% per year between 2021 and 2030.   That's a tall order, but it's feasible. It will require market transforming policies and incentives to advance critical areas, such as decarbonizing the power supply, preparing the grid for shifts in usage and increasing demands and electrifying transportation and buildings.  
As the only all electric investor-owned utility in California, SCE is well positioned to lead this transition.   We will continue to work in close partnership with policymakers and stakeholders to identify ways to improve funding, planning, standard setting and other approaches to successfully achieve the equitable and affordable transition to a clean energy economy. 
To emphasize affordability, our analysis shows that an electric led transition is the most affordable pathway since the greater efficiency of electric motors and appliances will reduce customers' total costs across all energy commodities by 1/3 by 2045.  
Edison International is committed to achieving net 0 GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045. And this covers the power SCE delivers to customers  as well as Edison International's enterprise-wide operations, including supply chain. This all continues our alignment with the broad policies needed to address climate change and ensure a resilient grid. 
We will also continue to engage with state, national and global leaders to advance the clean energy transition, which is why today, I am joining you by phone from COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where I am representing both Edison and EEI. And with that, Maria will provide her financial report."
301891,1684382822,2455250,"Edison International, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover third quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share",1249,"Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover third quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share for the third quarter 2021, an increase of $0.02 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE recorded a true-up for the final decision in its 2021 general rate case, and that's retroactive back to January 1. 
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key third quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I will highlight the primary contributors to the variance. To begin, SCE received a final decision in the 2021 GRC during the third quarter. Because first and second quarter results were based on 2020 authorized revenue, a true-up was recorded during the quarter for the first 6 months of 2021. 
This true-up is reflected in several line items on the income statement for a net increase in earnings of $0.35. The components are listed in footnote 3. Higher 2021 revenues contributed $0.55, including $0.50 related to the 2021 GRC decision, $0.04 for CPUC revenues related to certain tracking accounts and $0.01 at FERC. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.28, mainly due to the establishment of the vegetation management and risk management balancing accounts, partially offset by increased wildfire mitigation costs due to the timing of regulatory deferrals in the third quarter of 2020. 
Depreciation had a negative variance of $0.20, primarily driven by a higher asset base and a higher depreciation rate resulting from the 2021 GRC decision. Income taxes had a negative variance of $0.41. This includes $0.39 of lower tax benefits related to balancing accounts and the GRC true-up, which are offsetting revenue and have no earnings impact.
At EIX Parent and Other, the loss per share was $0.09 higher than in third quarter 2020. The primary driver was preferred dividends on the $1.25 billion of preferred equity issued at the parent in March of this year. Now let's move to SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. 
As shown on Page 8, we have updated our capital forecast primarily to reflect the recently announced utility-owned storage investment. As Pedro mentioned, SCE filed an advice letter for cost recovery of $1 billion of capital spending to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage. 
SCE is seeking expedited approval of the advice letter to maximize the likelihood of the projects meeting their expected online dates for the incremental capacity needed for summer 2022. These projects are a prime example of the essential role utilities can play in quickly ensuring California has a safe, reliable and clean electricity supply. 
We increased our 2022 capital expenditure forecast by approximately $900 million and lowered the forecast somewhat for 2023 through 2025 because these storage projects accelerate some, but not all of the capacity we previously forecasted in those years. 
The net increase in the high end of the capital forecast for 2021 through 2025 is approximately $500 million. As shown on Page 9, we have also updated our rate base forecast to reflect the storage investments I just mentioned. 
This is the primary driver of the increase to the 2022 through 2025 rate base forecasts. For 2021, we also fine-tuned the forecast to reflect adjustments related to wildfire mitigation tracking account following the implementation of the 2021 GRC decision and quarter end estimates of the spending related to these accounts.
The results of these updates is a reduction to the 2021 rate base of $300 million. Overall, these updates result in a projected rate base growth rate of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025. Page 10 provides an update on several major approved and pending applications for recovery of amounts and regulatory assets.
This will result in significant incremental cash flow to SCE over the next few years. SCE expects to collect over $1.4 billion in rates between now and 2024 related to already approved applications.
About half of that balance will be recovered in 2022. For the 3 pending applications shown in the middle of the slide, assuming timely regulatory decisions, SCE expects to collect another $844 million by the end of 2023. 
Lastly, we show the remaining expected securitizations of AB 1054 capital expenditures. The utility recently received a final decision in its second securitization application. This will allow SCE to securitize $518 million of wildfire mitigation capital expenditures. 
SCE expects to complete the securitization in Q4 of this year or Q1 2022. The securitizations, along with the rate recovery of the other regulatory assets will allow SCE to pay down short-term debt and strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics. 
Turning to Page 11. During the quarter, SCE filed an application to establish its CPUC cost of capital for 2022 through 2024 and reset the cost of capital mechanism. SCE is requesting an ROE of 10.53% with resets to its cost of debt and preferred financing, which would keep customer rates unchanged. The utility's alternative request to maintain its ROE at 10.3% and reset the cost of debt and preferred would reduce customer rates by about $50 million in 2022. 
When SCE filed the cost of capital request in August, it paused any other filings related to the trigger mechanism. Last week, SCE was directed by the CPUC to file the information that would have normally been provided in those other filings.
The next step from here is that the commission will issue a scoping memo to outline the issues and procedural schedule. 
Turning to guidance. Pages 12 and 13 show our 2021 guidance and the preliminary modeling considerations for 2022. As Pedro mentioned earlier, we are narrowing the 2021 EPS guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52. 
Turning to Page 14. We see an average need of up to $250 million of equity content annually through 2025. The specific annual amounts will depend on the level of spending within our capital plan for that year. The significant new investment of $1 billion of utility-owned storage considerably accelerates the timing of the capital investment program and increases the overall opportunity as noted earlier.
To fund this growth, which is well above the high end of the capital spending range previously disclosed for next year, we anticipate accelerating the issuance of equity content securities from the 2023 through 2025 period into 2022. The 2022 equity need will be in the range of $300 million to $400 million, and we will provide more specifics on the financing plan when we provide 2022 EPS guidance on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call.
Additionally, let me reiterate Pedro's comment that the SED agreement and update to the best estimate of potential losses associated with the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events do not require equity above the levels previously announced in our 2021 financing plan. 
Consistent with our prior disclosure, we plan to issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content to support investment-grade rating. In closing, I want to underscore the important role that SCE plays in ensuring safety and resiliency. This can be seen in the ongoing investment in risk-reducing wildfire mitigation as well as utility-owned storage to enhance near-term reliability.
These investments are indicative of the longer-term opportunity associated with meeting customer needs and clean energy objectives and gives us confidence in reiterating our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% for 2021 through 2025. That concludes my remarks."

We don't really see any impacts that the SED settlement will have -- the SED agreement will have on settlement activity. And importantly, as you heard me say, we didn't admit any claims there of ourselves of imprudence or the like. 
In terms of timing for cost recovery that continues to be uncertain because we really need to work our way through a substantial portion of the claims in each of the events. We could potentially get to Thomas and Koenigstein on one track and separately on Woolsey, but I think we need to get through the bulk of the claims in each of the events before we would be able to go file the PUC and as I've said in prior calls, it's just really difficult to handicap the timing. Now we've made good progress. And as I mentioned, we've worked our way to something like 70% of the claims, but it's difficult to handicap when exactly we'll complete that process."

So you heard us reaffirm that view of when we translated into earnings or EPS growth, 5% to 7% EPS growth coming from that. And so we would view the opportunity set as falling within that range. 
The storage project shows you that sometimes there can be needs that pop up sooner than we might think and the ability to step in and take a meaningful action that will help the state with its resiliency and reliability in case that next summer ends up being one with extreme weather, just like the last couple of summers have been. 
It's just one indication that sometimes you can be called on to take these steps more quickly or in a large quantum like you see with a storage project. But I would say that we would continue to see the opportunities falling within the range that we provided. Maria, anything you would say differently there?"

I refer again to my prepared remarks here. The SED has powers and responsibility to do investigations. There's always uncertainty when you go into those processes. There's uncertainty as well in terms of how the CPUC will ultimately view the facts. 
We -- as I mentioned, don't agree with a number of the claims, but we recognize that there's a process here. And we believe it was a thoughtful thing, a prudent thing for us to do to put one more uncertainty behind us. And we therefore feel that the settlement is a way to do that. And so that's really the why now. An opportunity presented itself to work with the SED and you see the makeup of the pieces here. 
We don't see that interfering with our ability to go seek cost recovery for prudently incurred expenses other than for the $375 million that were set aside in the settlement. And so again, it's frankly all about understanding that there's a lot of uncertainty and sometimes it's rational and kind of the right thing to do to do something that maybe we might not have agreed with overall under different circumstances. 
But in this case, by entering the settlement and working constructively with SED, we can put that uncertainty behind us. Maria, do you want to take the equity piece?"

So Shar, we talked a bunch before about our 2021 financing plan and the need to issue up to $1 billion of equity content securities. And that was really to support the 15% to 17% FFO to debt framework that we have at the company. And so as we assessed the change in the reserve level, we think that, that $1 billion equity content in 2021 still supports our overall financing framework objective. And we've been pretty measured in how we approach issuing that additional equity or equity content securities. At the same time, SCE does issue debt to make claims payments. So if you think about the EIX financing plan that's in support of the metrics and then SCE's cash flow is tied to sort of when they issue debt to pay the claims.
At that level, at the SCE level, they are basically pacing their financing plan along the same lines as when they make claims payments. I think when you think about the equity requirement that we have for this year, we've already done $1.25 billion of that preferred financing to get certain amount of the equity content, and we'll continue to evaluate market conditions as we undertake the balance of the program."

You can have things happen even in the near term that increase your capital expenditure opportunities. 
But as you move out to '24 and '25, I think, there are a few things going on. One, 2024 is a year in this rate case cycle that we haven't yet gotten authorization for. So while it might look a lot like the attrition mechanism that's embedded in 2021 and '22 and '23, we do know there are some budget based approaches that we can use for wildfire mitigation. So we'll be focused on that and that can expand the range. 
If you look out beyond that, 2025 is actually a new rate case cycle. And so things like ongoing law for mitigation, but as we start to get back potentially to more infrastructure replacement and the like, that could drive the wider range that you see in the back end. In addition, there are opportunities potentially to file applications outside of the general rate case proceedings.
And so all the things that I think Pedro mentioned earlier around are there things around greenhouse gas emissions reductions on the path to 2045 -- areas around transportational, education or building electrification or more energy storage or transmission, those are all things that move the range up and down."

We did not need to do that.

So even though on the surface that seems like a negative, is it possible to read this as that you still have a claim and potential to seek recovery of these costs or some portion of them?"

Steve, We've been pretty consistent in saying all along that our planned expectation is to seek recovery for prudently incurred costs. For purposes of striking the settlement and removing this uncertainty, we agreed to set aside that $375 million. Bu",384,"Yes. Steve, We've been pretty consistent in saying all along that our planned expectation is to seek recovery for prudently incurred costs. For purposes of striking the settlement and removing this uncertainty, we agreed to set aside that $375 million. But importantly, as I said earlier, we're not admitting to imprudence, we're not admitting to negligence. We're preserving every right to go and seek cost recovery. 
I can't tell you today the precise figure for which we'll seek recovery because we'll need to continue -- complete investigations. I think I said this in prior quarters. Believe it or not, it's still true that I believe we still don't have our hands on some pieces of equipment because they're still being held by fire agencies.
And so -- and that's just as part of the process. But our expectation is that there are certainly, a number of strong arguments where we bring – we'd be able to bring to the table, and we'd expect to seek recovery for everything that we believe we should seek recovery for. Now the reason that you're not seeing that level of, I'll say, confidence show up in adjusting the reserves to include the assumption of recovery, is that since these are 2017 and 2018 events, and the only CPUC precedent that exists prior to the time frame of AB 1054 is the precedent in the San Diego Gas & Electric case. Under GAAP, we're really not able to assume any CPUC recovery. That's it, you see that we've continued to assume recovery from FERC for the same set of facts. And so that, I think, points to our sense that recovery would be appropriate based on the facts. 
We can't assume it from the CPUC based on the San Diego Gas & Electric precedent, but we will plan to make our case. And we've said before also that we believe that the CPUC's determination in the San Diego case was inconsistent with what we understood the facts to be in that case. So while AB 1054 provides us a strengthening of the framework, we do believe that we have the ability all along to even prior AB 1054 to make our case for just a reasonable cost recovery based on facts, and we believe we'll have those facts here."

Just curious, do you think there is a need for a piece of follow-on legislation where the state develops a formal multiyear maybe multi-decade, kind of similar to like what Illinois has with gas distribution or what Florida has with storm hardening to help kind of think through both the time line, the pace of investment, the cost recovery and kind of the broader state strategy in terms of doing things for wildfire mitigation and prevention."

I actually say that in many ways, AB 1054 provided the framework for that already, right? Because it's set up the whole wildfire mitigation plan process. It has review by OEIS, enhanced ratification by the CPUC. In addition, the state budget this year included a line item for an outside consultant who is advising the governor's office. And it's actually working with the utilities -- frankly speaking, it has become a good venue for conversation and comparing of notes in addition to the work that we do, interfacing directly with our peers of the other utilities. 
But ultimately, I view the Wildfire Mitigation Plan framework as the place where utilities are bringing updated information and new ideas about what tools they should be using to prevent fires and then ultimately, that feeds into the ramp in GRC processes. 
The other reason -- that's my reaction, Michael, is that – and this is something that's important in the WMP framework. The reality is that each of the utilities have fairly different territories. I mean from the outside, it looks like it's all California, right? But PG&E has 70,000 square miles. We have 50,000, Santiago has a smaller territory. But even if you look at PG&E versus ourselves, and I have mentioned this in prior calls, the territory for PG&E, the high-fire risk area territory includes a lot more geography that's more heavily forested. 
And so for example, for them, they -- as we understand it, from our discussions with them, they see a lot higher probability of ignition from trees falling into lines. Those could be trees well outside of the vegetation management zone, the foliage clearing zone. 
In Edison's case, much of the high fire risk area is not forest, it's chaparral, it's grasslands. There's a much higher probability of ignition throughout the Edison area for ignition from contact from objects, stuff blowing into the lines. And so that helps give a little bit of an insight into why for PG&E as they run the math. And I think generally, we're all using the same math equation but the variable -- the values of the variables are different, right? 
And so as we look at the cost benefit analysis for undergrounding versus covered conductor or other tools, my understanding is that trees falling in drives a lot of the incremental benefit from undergrounding. In our case, we see that covered conductor provides significant risk reduction adding much lower all-in cost. In addition, in SCE's territory since we had already gone through a pole-loading program that led to pole replacements, that means that a lot of our covered conductor installations, we don't have to go out and replace the pole, right? 
And so that takes out another cost increment that a utility might have if they need to not only replace the wires, but also replace the poles that they hang up. That's a little long-winded. The bottom line on that is that we have fairly different territories, different needs. We're comparing notes. I think we used to have same fundamental concepts, but the values you stick into the equation are leading to different results for each of us. 
But we're staying connected, right? And to the extent that PG&E continues to learn more and see different results with undergrounding, we could potentially see more miles coming to scope for undergrounding for Edison. So we certainly continue to learn there. Yes Maria?"

And I think, Julien, you know that we've been really measured and in the approach that we've taken to issuing additional equity and equity content securities and we've been watching the cash flows and the like. And in our 2021 financing plan, we did envision that up to $1 billion of equity content. 
And so as we thought about and assessed the change in the reserve level, we were looking at what we had already announced as our 2021 plan, and we think that it's still consistent even with the reserve level changing with the objective of improving credit metrics over time with that focus on the 15% to 17%.
Now the equity that we've discussed for next year and that we'll discuss in more detail when we get to the Q4 call, that really relates to sort of how we were thinking about the equity needs over the next 4 years through 2025 related to the growth of the utility. And so let's think back a little bit on how that ties together. So previously, when we laid out that '21 through 2025 EPS CAGR, we talked about the EPS CAGR of 5% to 7%.
We still firmly believe that, that is the range that we're in. And in terms of total equity needs over the period, we talked about up to $250 million a year, to some extent, varying based on the capital that was needed in that year. As we look over that period, while we've got $900 million more CapEx in 2022, which obviously that's in response to customer needs and the state needs with some reliability and that's on top of an already robust capital plan, we want to basically take some of the equity that otherwise would have turned up in later years and rebalance back to 2022. 
And that's again in support of our metrics. So that's kind of the balance that we're always trying to strike. And so those are how I think about the pieces of the equity need and how we thought through them as we developed the plan for the balance of this year and then for next year."

I know that a number of you have already met Steve and Jill and many of you will have an opportunity to meet them next week at EEI's Financial Conference as well. 
Turning to the quarter. Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $1.67 a year ago.  This comparison is not meaningful because during the quarter, SCE recorded a true-up for the final decision in track 1 of its 2021 general rate case, which is retroactive to January 1. Reflecting the year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our 2021 EPS guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52.  
We are also reiterating our longer-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% through 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance in detail in her report.   Now starting with past events. SCE today announced 2 updates related to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events.  
Page 3 in the slide deck provides an overall summary. First, SCE revised the best estimate of potential losses to $7.5 billion from $6.2 billion. As we have mentioned in our continuing communications on this topic, we evaluate the best estimate quarterly. As part of the ongoing and very complex litigation process, we diligently consider new information that arises to provide all of you with our best estimate.   Based on additional information across a broad set of claim types collected during the quarter, along with an agreement with the CPUC Safety and Enforcement Division, or SED, which I'll talk about in a minute,  SCE revised its estimate of the total potential losses.  
While the total estimate increased this quarter,   SCE continued to make meaningful progress, settling claims and completed approximately $485 million of settlements.  SCE has now settled about 70% of the estimated exposure for the 2017 and 2018 events. 
I want to emphasize that we do not need equity above our previously disclosed 2021 financing plan to fund the higher estimated losses. Maria will address this topic later on the call.   Second, the utility reached an agreement with the SED to resolve its investigations into the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and 3 other 2017 wildfires.   As we have previously disclosed, the SED has conducted investigations to assess SCE's compliance with applicable rules and regulations in areas affected by the Thomas, Koenigstein, and Woolsey Fires. 
It was possible that CPUC would initiate formal enforcement proceedings to pursue fines and penalties for alleged violations though we were unable to estimate the magnitude or the timing as part of our best estimate.   The recently executed agreement, which is subject to CPUC approval, would resolve that uncertainty.  
The agreement has a total value of $550 million, composed of about $110 million fine, $65 million of shareholder-funded safety measures and an agreement by SCE to waive its right to seek cost recovery for $375 million of uninsured claims payments  out of the $5.2 billion total in the current best estimate.  
In the SED agreement, SCE did not admit imprudence, negligence or liability with respect to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and will seek rate recovery of prudently incurred actual losses in excess of available insurance other than for the $375 million waived under the SED agreement.   While SCE disputes a number of the alleged violations, reaching an agreement puts one additional uncertainty behind us.  
Let me now address the Southern California wildfire season.   SCE continues to make solid progress on the execution of its Wildfire Mitigation Plan or WMP and its PSPS action plan. SCE has installed over 1,000 miles of covered conductor year-to-date,  bringing the total to 2,500 miles since program inception.  
Over the past 3 years, the utility has replaced about 25% of its overhead distribution power lines in high fire risk areas with covered conductor.   SCE has also performed another annual cycle of inspections in high fire risk areas, supplemented with additional inspections targeting dry fuel areas. 
This resulted in approximately 195,000 assets, undergoing 360-degree inspections in SCE's high fire risk area.   SCE also continues to be on track to meet most of its goals outlined in our WMP by end of the year. And the scorecard is shown on Page 4 of the slide deck. 
All these ongoing mitigation actions continue to strengthen our confidence in our utilities overall improved risk profile with respect to wildfires.  
Turning to Page 5.  We highlight the metrics we showed you last quarter, which are proof points of how SCE believes it has reduced wildfire risk for its customers. We have added an additional metric.   Looking back at past wildfire events and considering the utility's current PSPS protocols, we can't quantify the damage that would have been prevented.    
Using red flag warning days as a proxy for when the utility would use PSPS today, SCE would have prevented over 90% of the structures damaged or destroyed for fires larger than 1,000 acres   associated with its infrastructure. However, we think it is much more important to assess how much total risk SCE has reduced on a forward-looking basis.  
And we have summarized this on Page 6.   In total, considering physical mitigation measures such as covered conductor, operational practices such as tree removals, inspections and vegetation management and the use of PSPS, SCE estimates that it has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 55% to 65% relative to pre-2018 levels. 
This is based on a recent analysis using risk management solutions, industry-leading wildfire model and SCE's data related to actual mitigations deployed and mitigation effectiveness, which enabled us to quantify the risk reduction. While the risk can never be fully eliminated, the utility does expect to further reduce risk and to decrease the need for PSPS to achieve this risk reduction with continued grid-hardening investments. 
As California continues to transition to a clean energy economy, maintaining and even improving system reliability becomes essential, particularly with greater reliance on electricity.  SCE worked closely with the Governor's office, CAISO, the CPUC, customers and many stakeholders to avoid rolling outages this past summer when the state and the entire West once again faced record temperatures. 
Major California energy agencies, including the CAISO, California Energy Commission and CPUC have indicated that additional capacity is needed to support summer 2020 -- summer 2022, pardon me, under extreme conditions like the heat, drought and wildfires we have seen repeatedly over the past several years.  
To accelerate construction of new capacity, the governor issued an emergency proclamation that requested the CPUC to work with load-serving entities to accelerate construction of energy storage for 2021 and 2022.    
To this end, in addition to securing over 230 megawatts of additional capacity from third parties, SCE plans to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage for this upcoming summer.   
This is a material increase in incremental capacity to mitigate the risk of statewide customer outages for summer 2022, caused by extreme weather events and continued drought conditions.   While the governor signed the largest climate package in state history, which included 24 bills and over $15 billion in climate, clean energy and wildfire preparedness funding, there is still an ongoing need for a lot more to be done.  
So I would like to highlight a paper that we recently released and it's entitled ""Mind the Gap: Policies for California’s Countdown to 2030."" This policy paper is Edison International's latest contribution to identify policies and actions needed to help California reduce emissions and decarbonize the economy.  
In the paper, we identified state and federal policy recommendations needed for California to meet its 2030 climate target, which is a foundational way point for the state to achieve its goal to the decarbonize its economy by 2045.   While California has made progress in reducing GHG emissions, closing the gap between the current trajectory and its 2030 goal requires a significant acceleration of effort.  
It means quadrupling the average 1% annual reduction in GHG emissions achieved by the state since 2006, quadrupling that to 4.1% per year between 2021 and 2030.   That's a tall order, but it's feasible. It will require market transforming policies and incentives to advance critical areas, such as decarbonizing the power supply, preparing the grid for shifts in usage and increasing demands and electrifying transportation and buildings.  
As the only all electric investor-owned utility in California, SCE is well positioned to lead this transition.   We will continue to work in close partnership with policymakers and stakeholders to identify ways to improve funding, planning, standard setting and other approaches to successfully achieve the equitable and affordable transition to a clean energy economy. 
To emphasize affordability, our analysis shows that an electric led transition is the most affordable pathway since the greater efficiency of electric motors and appliances will reduce customers' total costs across all energy commodities by 1/3 by 2045.  
Edison International is committed to achieving net 0 GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2045. And this covers the power SCE delivers to customers  as well as Edison International's enterprise-wide operations, including supply chain. This all continues our alignment with the broad policies needed to address climate change and ensure a resilient grid. 
We will also continue to engage with state, national and global leaders to advance the clean energy transition, which is why today, I am joining you by phone from COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where I am representing both Edison and EEI. And with that, Maria will provide her financial report."
301891,1684382822,2455251,"Edison International, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Edison International","Executives","Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover third quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share",1249,"Thank you, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover third quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast and updates on other financial topics. 
Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share for the third quarter 2021, an increase of $0.02 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE recorded a true-up for the final decision in its 2021 general rate case, and that's retroactive back to January 1. 
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key third quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I will highlight the primary contributors to the variance. To begin, SCE received a final decision in the 2021 GRC during the third quarter. Because first and second quarter results were based on 2020 authorized revenue, a true-up was recorded during the quarter for the first 6 months of 2021. 
This true-up is reflected in several line items on the income statement for a net increase in earnings of $0.35. The components are listed in footnote 3. Higher 2021 revenues contributed $0.55, including $0.50 related to the 2021 GRC decision, $0.04 for CPUC revenues related to certain tracking accounts and $0.01 at FERC. 
O&M had a positive variance of $0.28, mainly due to the establishment of the vegetation management and risk management balancing accounts, partially offset by increased wildfire mitigation costs due to the timing of regulatory deferrals in the third quarter of 2020. 
Depreciation had a negative variance of $0.20, primarily driven by a higher asset base and a higher depreciation rate resulting from the 2021 GRC decision. Income taxes had a negative variance of $0.41. This includes $0.39 of lower tax benefits related to balancing accounts and the GRC true-up, which are offsetting revenue and have no earnings impact.
At EIX Parent and Other, the loss per share was $0.09 higher than in third quarter 2020. The primary driver was preferred dividends on the $1.25 billion of preferred equity issued at the parent in March of this year. Now let's move to SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. 
As shown on Page 8, we have updated our capital forecast primarily to reflect the recently announced utility-owned storage investment. As Pedro mentioned, SCE filed an advice letter for cost recovery of $1 billion of capital spending to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage. 
SCE is seeking expedited approval of the advice letter to maximize the likelihood of the projects meeting their expected online dates for the incremental capacity needed for summer 2022. These projects are a prime example of the essential role utilities can play in quickly ensuring California has a safe, reliable and clean electricity supply. 
We increased our 2022 capital expenditure forecast by approximately $900 million and lowered the forecast somewhat for 2023 through 2025 because these storage projects accelerate some, but not all of the capacity we previously forecasted in those years. 
The net increase in the high end of the capital forecast for 2021 through 2025 is approximately $500 million. As shown on Page 9, we have also updated our rate base forecast to reflect the storage investments I just mentioned. 
This is the primary driver of the increase to the 2022 through 2025 rate base forecasts. For 2021, we also fine-tuned the forecast to reflect adjustments related to wildfire mitigation tracking account following the implementation of the 2021 GRC decision and quarter end estimates of the spending related to these accounts.
The results of these updates is a reduction to the 2021 rate base of $300 million. Overall, these updates result in a projected rate base growth rate of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025. Page 10 provides an update on several major approved and pending applications for recovery of amounts and regulatory assets.
This will result in significant incremental cash flow to SCE over the next few years. SCE expects to collect over $1.4 billion in rates between now and 2024 related to already approved applications.
About half of that balance will be recovered in 2022. For the 3 pending applications shown in the middle of the slide, assuming timely regulatory decisions, SCE expects to collect another $844 million by the end of 2023. 
Lastly, we show the remaining expected securitizations of AB 1054 capital expenditures. The utility recently received a final decision in its second securitization application. This will allow SCE to securitize $518 million of wildfire mitigation capital expenditures. 
SCE expects to complete the securitization in Q4 of this year or Q1 2022. The securitizations, along with the rate recovery of the other regulatory assets will allow SCE to pay down short-term debt and strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics. 
Turning to Page 11. During the quarter, SCE filed an application to establish its CPUC cost of capital for 2022 through 2024 and reset the cost of capital mechanism. SCE is requesting an ROE of 10.53% with resets to its cost of debt and preferred financing, which would keep customer rates unchanged. The utility's alternative request to maintain its ROE at 10.3% and reset the cost of debt and preferred would reduce customer rates by about $50 million in 2022. 
When SCE filed the cost of capital request in August, it paused any other filings related to the trigger mechanism. Last week, SCE was directed by the CPUC to file the information that would have normally been provided in those other filings.
The next step from here is that the commission will issue a scoping memo to outline the issues and procedural schedule. 
Turning to guidance. Pages 12 and 13 show our 2021 guidance and the preliminary modeling considerations for 2022. As Pedro mentioned earlier, we are narrowing the 2021 EPS guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52. 
Turning to Page 14. We see an average need of up to $250 million of equity content annually through 2025. The specific annual amounts will depend on the level of spending within our capital plan for that year. The significant new investment of $1 billion of utility-owned storage considerably accelerates the timing of the capital investment program and increases the overall opportunity as noted earlier.
To fund this growth, which is well above the high end of the capital spending range previously disclosed for next year, we anticipate accelerating the issuance of equity content securities from the 2023 through 2025 period into 2022. The 2022 equity need will be in the range of $300 million to $400 million, and we will provide more specifics on the financing plan when we provide 2022 EPS guidance on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call.
Additionally, let me reiterate Pedro's comment that the SED agreement and update to the best estimate of potential losses associated with the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events do not require equity above the levels previously announced in our 2021 financing plan. 
Consistent with our prior disclosure, we plan to issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content to support investment-grade rating. In closing, I want to underscore the important role that SCE plays in ensuring safety and resiliency. This can be seen in the ongoing investment in risk-reducing wildfire mitigation as well as utility-owned storage to enhance near-term reliability.
These investments are indicative of the longer-term opportunity associated with meeting customer needs and clean energy objectives and gives us confidence in reiterating our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% for 2021 through 2025. That concludes my remarks."

We don't really see any impacts that the SED settlement will have -- the SED agreement will have on settlement activity. And importantly, as you heard me say, we didn't admit any claims there of ourselves of imprudence or the like. 
In terms of timing for cost recovery that continues to be uncertain because we really need to work our way through a substantial portion of the claims in each of the events. We could potentially get to Thomas and Koenigstein on one track and separately on Woolsey, but I think we need to get through the bulk of the claims in each of the events before we would be able to go file the PUC and as I've said in prior calls, it's just really difficult to handicap the timing. Now we've made good progress. And as I mentioned, we've worked our way to something like 70% of the claims, but it's difficult to handicap when exactly we'll complete that process."

So you heard us reaffirm that view of when we translated into earnings or EPS growth, 5% to 7% EPS growth coming from that. And so we would view the opportunity set as falling within that range. 
The storage project shows you that sometimes there can be needs that pop up sooner than we might think and the ability to step in and take a meaningful action that will help the state with its resiliency and reliability in case that next summer ends up being one with extreme weather, just like the last couple of summers have been. 
It's just one indication that sometimes you can be called on to take these steps more quickly or in a large quantum like you see with a storage project. But I would say that we would continue to see the opportunities falling within the range that we provided. Maria, anything you would say differently there?"

And kind of related, Pedro, why settle now if you feel strong enough about prudence ahead of seeking recovery?"

I refer again to my prepared remarks here. The SED has powers and responsibility to do investigations. There's always uncertainty when you go into those processes. There's uncertainty as well in terms of how the CPUC will ultimately view the facts. 
We -- as I mentioned, don't agree with a number of the claims, but we recognize that there's a process here. And we believe it was a thoughtful thing, a prudent thing for us to do to put one more uncertainty behind us. And we therefore feel that the settlement is a way to do that. And so that's really the why now. An opportunity presented itself to work with the SED and you see the makeup of the pieces here. 
We don't see that interfering with our ability to go seek cost recovery for prudently incurred expenses other than for the $375 million that were set aside in the settlement. And so again, it's frankly all about understanding that there's a lot of uncertainty and sometimes it's rational and kind of the right thing to do to do something that maybe we might not have agreed with overall under different circumstances. 
But in this case, by entering the settlement and working constructively with SED, we can put that uncertainty behind us. Maria, do you want to take the equity piece?"

So Shar, we talked a bunch before about our 2021 financing plan and the need to issue up to $1 billion of equity content securities. And that was really to support the 15% to 17% FFO to debt framework that we have at the company. And so as we assessed the change in the reserve level, we think that, that $1 billion equity content in 2021 still supports our overall financing framework objective. And we've been pretty measured in how we approach issuing that additional equity or equity content securities. At the same time, SCE does issue debt to make claims payments. So if you think about the EIX financing plan that's in support of the metrics and then SCE's cash flow is tied to sort of when they issue debt to pay the claims.
At that level, at the SCE level, they are basically pacing their financing plan along the same lines as when they make claims payments. I think when you think about the equity requirement that we have for this year, we've already done $1.25 billion of that preferred financing to get certain amount of the equity content, and we'll continue to evaluate market conditions as we undertake the balance of the program."

You can have things happen even in the near term that increase your capital expenditure opportunities. 
But as you move out to '24 and '25, I think, there are a few things going on. One, 2024 is a year in this rate case cycle that we haven't yet gotten authorization for. So while it might look a lot like the attrition mechanism that's embedded in 2021 and '22 and '23, we do know there are some budget based approaches that we can use for wildfire mitigation. So we'll be focused on that and that can expand the range. 
If you look out beyond that, 2025 is actually a new rate case cycle. And so things like ongoing law for mitigation, but as we start to get back potentially to more infrastructure replacement and the like, that could drive the wider range that you see in the back end. In addition, there are opportunities potentially to file applications outside of the general rate case proceedings.
And so all the things that I think Pedro mentioned earlier around are there things around greenhouse gas emissions reductions on the path to 2045 -- areas around transportational, education or building electrification or more energy storage or transmission, those are all things that move the range up and down."

Simply put, the more claims we go through, the more settlements we do, the more we learn. And I would hope that, that uncertainty band continues to narrow. As I mentioned, we now process around 70% of the exposure. 
And so we have been testing quarterly to see whether there are new pieces of information, more detail in terms of specific claims that are waiting down the pipe, et cetera, that would call for a need to change the reserves. We did not need to do that. The prior quarter as we got to this quarter, we had enough new information in hand that this was the right thing to do, the appropriate thing to do under GAAP was to make the reserve adjustment. 
I would -- as we say in our disclosures, right, we're providing you the best estimate. There is uncertainty around that best estimate. In the end, we might find the things go yet higher again. You might find that things end up lower than this. But I would hope that as more time goes on, and again, as we get more of the volume behind us, that picture will continue to sharpen. That's probably about the best I can do here, Steve. 
And I realize that it would be great if we could provide more chapter and verse on what drove it, but given the active litigation that we have going on, that's challenging to do. Maria, anything you say differently or Adam Umanoff, if you want to come on the line from a legal perspective, feel free. Okay."

So on the one hand, you agreed not to seek $375 million. On the other hand, that would imply that, theoretically, you might seek recovery of a lot of the other cost of this, which obviously is not assumed in your plan. 
So even though on the surface that seems like a negative, is it possible to read this as that you still have a claim and potential to seek recovery of these costs or some portion of them?"

Steve, We've been pretty consistent in saying all along that our planned expectation is to seek recovery for prudently incurred costs. For purposes of striking the settlement and removing this uncertainty, we agreed to set aside that $375 million. Bu",384,"Yes. Steve, We've been pretty consistent in saying all along that our planned expectation is to seek recovery for prudently incurred costs. For purposes of striking the settlement and removing this uncertainty, we agreed to set aside that $375 million. But importantly, as I said earlier, we're not admitting to imprudence, we're not admitting to negligence. We're preserving every right to go and seek cost recovery. 
I can't tell you today the precise figure for which we'll seek recovery because we'll need to continue -- complete investigations. I think I said this in prior quarters. Believe it or not, it's still true that I believe we still don't have our hands on some pieces of equipment because they're still being held by fire agencies.
And so -- and that's just as part of the process. But our expectation is that there are certainly, a number of strong arguments where we bring – we'd be able to bring to the table, and we'd expect to seek recovery for everything that we believe we should seek recovery for. Now the reason that you're not seeing that level of, I'll say, confidence show up in adjusting the reserves to include the assumption of recovery, is that since these are 2017 and 2018 events, and the only CPUC precedent that exists prior to the time frame of AB 1054 is the precedent in the San Diego Gas & Electric case. Under GAAP, we're really not able to assume any CPUC recovery. That's it, you see that we've continued to assume recovery from FERC for the same set of facts. And so that, I think, points to our sense that recovery would be appropriate based on the facts. 
We can't assume it from the CPUC based on the San Diego Gas & Electric precedent, but we will plan to make our case. And we've said before also that we believe that the CPUC's determination in the San Diego case was inconsistent with what we understood the facts to be in that case. So while AB 1054 provides us a strengthening of the framework, we do believe that we have the ability all along to even prior AB 1054 to make our case for just a reasonable cost recovery based on facts, and we believe we'll have those facts here."

I actually say that in many ways, AB 1054 provided the framework for that already, right? Because it's set up the whole wildfire mitigation plan process. It has review by OEIS, enhanced ratification by the CPUC. In addition, the state budget this year included a line item for an outside consultant who is advising the governor's office. And it's actually working with the utilities -- frankly speaking, it has become a good venue for conversation and comparing of notes in addition to the work that we do, interfacing directly with our peers of the other utilities. 
But ultimately, I view the Wildfire Mitigation Plan framework as the place where utilities are bringing updated information and new ideas about what tools they should be using to prevent fires and then ultimately, that feeds into the ramp in GRC processes. 
The other reason -- that's my reaction, Michael, is that -– and this is something that's important in the WMP framework. The reality is that each of the utilities have fairly different territories. I mean from the outside, it looks like it's all California, right? But PG&E has 70,000 square miles. We have 50,000, Santiago has a smaller territory. But even if you look at PG&E versus ourselves, and I have mentioned this in prior calls, the territory for PG&E, the high-fire risk area territory includes a lot more geography that's more heavily forested. 
And so for example, for them, they -- as we understand it, from our discussions with them, they see a lot higher probability of ignition from trees falling into lines. Those could be trees well outside of the vegetation management zone, the foliage clearing zone. 
In Edison's case, much of the high fire risk area is not forest, it's chaparral, it's grasslands. There's a much higher probability of ignition throughout the Edison area for ignition from contact from objects, stuff blowing into the lines. And so that helps give a little bit of an insight into why for PG&E as they run the math. And I think generally, we're all using the same math equation but the variable -- the values of the variables are different, right? 
And so as we look at the cost benefit analysis for undergrounding versus covered conductor or other tools, my understanding is that trees falling in drives a lot of the incremental benefit from undergrounding. In our case, we see that covered conductor provides significant risk reduction adding much lower all-in cost. In addition, in SCE's territory since we had already gone through a pole-loading program that led to pole replacements, that means that a lot of our covered conductor installations, we don't have to go out and replace the pole, right? 
And so that takes out another cost increment that a utility might have if they need to not only replace the wires, but also replace the poles that they hang up. That's a little long-winded. The bottom line on that is that we have fairly different territories, different needs. We're comparing notes. I think we used to have same fundamental concepts, but the values you stick into the equation are leading to different results for each of us. 
But we're staying connected, right? And to the extent that PG&E continues to learn more and see different results with undergrounding, we could potentially see more miles coming to scope for undergrounding for Edison. So we certainly continue to learn there. Yes Maria?"

And I think, Julien, you know that we've been really measured and in the approach that we've taken to issuing additional equity and equity content securities and we've been watching the cash flows and the like. And in our 2021 financing plan, we did envision that up to $1 billion of equity content. 
And so as we thought about and assessed the change in the reserve level, we were looking at what we had already announced as our 2021 plan, and we think that it's still consistent even with the reserve level changing with the objective of improving credit metrics over time with that focus on the 15% to 17%.
Now the equity that we've discussed for next year and that we'll discuss in more detail when we get to the Q4 call, that really relates to sort of how we were thinking about the equity needs over the next 4 years through 2025 related to the growth of the utility. And so let's think back a little bit on how that ties together. So previously, when we laid out that '21 through 2025 EPS CAGR, we talked about the EPS CAGR of 5% to 7%.
We still firmly believe that, that is the range that we're in. And in terms of total equity needs over the period, we talked about up to $250 million a year, to some extent, varying based on the capital that was needed in that year. As we look over that period, while we've got $900 million more CapEx in 2022, which obviously that's in response to customer needs and the state needs with some reliability and that's on top of an already robust capital plan, we want to basically take some of the equity that otherwise would have turned up in later years and rebalance back to 2022. 
And that's again in support of our metrics. So that's kind of the balance that we're always trying to strike. And so those are how I think about the pieces of the equity need and how we thought through them as we developed the plan for the balance of this year and then for next year."

Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $0.79 compared to $0.63 a year ago. However, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2021 General Rate Case. SCE recognized revenue from CPUC activities for both the first quarter 2020 and 2021, largely based on 2020 authorized base revenue requirements. Maria will discuss our financial performance in her remarks.
Investors have been asking us about how we view Edison's risk profile given all the news reports that California is headed into another peak wildfire season with above-average risk. As I have shared before, 2019 and 2020 were also above-average risk years, with 2020 setting records for acres burned. However, and this is a really important however, the state has successfully avoided the scale of catastrophic damage seen in 2017 and 2018. I would like to highlight 3 key factors that have significantly improved our risk profile: state investments to improve firefighting, CPUC progress on AB 1054 implementation and SCE's own wildfire mitigation work.
So first, the state has increased investments in firefighting capabilities over the last several years. Incorporating the governor's 2021 to 2022 proposed budget, which continues this trend, this would represent a 45% increase in CAL FIRE's budget since 2016, a 30% increase in firefighters at the peak of the season since 2019 and significant increases in equipment and modeling to enhance the state's wildfire suppression capabilities.
For example, the state is expected to have 7 large air tankers operating this fire season and another 5 in 2022. These enhanced suppression resources will help the state move more quickly to combat wildfires before they become catastrophic. The proposed budget also adds a focus on wildfire prevention, and the governor and the legislature have already taken early action.
Earlier this month, they approved $536 million to accelerate land and forest management projects laid out in the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan and an additional $80 million for roughly 1,400 new CAL FIRE firefighters for the 2021 fire season. We have also seen significant staff and resource additions in our local fire departments to aid response times and firefighting capacity.
The second risk improvement factor is that the CPUC has made steady and timely progress over the past nearly 2 years enacting AB 1054's provisions as designed. For instance, shortly after the legislature passed AB 1054, the CPUC opened the proceeding on an emergency basis to establish the nonbypassable charge that funds about half of the Wildfire Insurance Fund.
Another indicator is that the commission has approved each of SCE's annual safety certifications in a timely manner. This certification is a key step in implementing the pudency standard that AB 1054 codified, where a utility's conduct is deemed reasonable if it has a valid safety certification unless serious doubt is created. Importantly, this standard will go on beyond the life of the Wildfire Insurance Fund. The commission established its Wildfire Safety division, providing additional wildfire safety oversight and direction.
Lastly, the CPUC has completed numerous wildfire-related decisions on a timely pace despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The commission has also been proactive in engaging with the IOUs on Public Safety Power Shutoff, or PSPS, execution, at the same time, acknowledging that it is within the utility's discretion to use this crucial tool to protect the public's safety. Taken together, these are all signs that AB 1054's intent is being implemented steadily as designed.
The third risk improvement factor is SCE's own work to reduce wildfire risk. Fire mitigation has been an integral part of SCE's operational practices for years and the utility has had several programs in place to manage and reduce wildfire risk. As climate change intensified wildfire risk, the utility stepped up its comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy and has made substantial progress, particularly through its WMP.
In 2021, SCE continues to invest in its infrastructure and new technologies to mitigate the risk of fires from electric infrastructure, increase accuracy and fire weather forecasting, enhance its operational practices and improve its PSPS program. SCE has assembled a dedicated PSPS readiness team to address the feedback from customers, public safety partners, elected officials and regulatory agencies. The utility is accelerating the pace of covered conductor deployment and expects to install at least 1,000 additional circuit miles by year-end. At this pace, SCE will have hardened over 2,500 miles or over 25% of all its overhead distribution infrastructure in high-fire-risk areas, substantially reducing the risk of wildfires associated with the utility equipment.
So this combination of investment and actions by the state of California, the CPUC and SCE gives us increasing confidence in Edison International's improved risk profile with respect to wildfires. Slides 2 and 3 in our deck provide additional information on SCE's year-to-date wildfire-mitigation activities and on the state's actions over the last few years. This work is also a building block for longer-term reliability and resiliency, which will be essential as electrification increases dramatically across the entire economy for decarbonization.
Now speaking of decarbonization. We agree with the goals of President Biden's $2.25 trillion infrastructure proposal to address climate change; create well-paying jobs; improve air quality, particularly in our most vulnerable communities; and increase our global competitiveness. That future requires substantial deployment of EVs, electrification of buildings and new investments in electric infrastructure to ensure clean, reliable and resilient electric service for this greater demand.
We look forward to working with the administration and leaders in Congress to develop and implement the complementary policies that will effectively meet the Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, target of 50% to 52% greenhouse gas reductions across the economy relative to 2005.
This is in close alignment with what SCE outlined in its Pathway 2045 white paper. And Edison has already stated its support for this economy-wide target prior to the NBC's release. As highlighted in Pathway 2045, the least expensive way to achieve economy-wide decarbonization is through an equitable clean energy future with increasing amounts of carbon-free generation powering the further electrification of the economy. The average customer will also benefit from a decline in total energy costs of 1/3, thanks to the greater efficiency of electric technologies. Slides 4, 5 and 6 in our earnings deck provide you with additional information on our views in these areas.
SCE has a long track record in maintaining affordability. But in the near term, customers will see increases in their bills as SCE invests in grid hardening and makes the investments needed to support clean energy goals and the long-term affordability that they will yield. For over a decade, SCE has proactively pursued cost-reduction efforts as well as improvements in areas like reliability through its operational excellence efforts.
We expect to do more and embedding more digital tools deep in our operations, areas like inspections and vegetation management, will enable efficiencies in how we work and better harness data to improve asset management and performance and reduce risk. Building a more robust capability and lean process management will help us drive these efficiencies and create a stronger basis to use automation and other technology to streamline our operations. Fundamentally, delivering value to our customers starts with being an excellent and safe operator through the safe delivery of reliable and affordable electricity.
Well, let me close my comments by acknowledging yesterday's news that our colleague and good friend, Carla Peterman, SCE's SVP of Strategy and Regulatory Affairs, will be leading us on May 7 for a new role as PG&E's Executive VP of Corporate Affairs. We are very sad to lose Carla after a great -- really great 1.5 years together. But we wish her well as she takes on the important and very challenging task of helping Patti Poppe and her new leadership team turn around PG&E's operations and their relationships with their stakeholders and communities. California needs all of its utilities to be healthy and strong. So I am really glad our state will continue to benefit from Carla's talent.
With that, Maria will provide her financial report."

My comments today will cover first quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast, key regulatory filings and updates on other financial topics.Edison International reported core earning",881,"Thanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover first quarter 2021 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecast, key regulatory filings and updates on other financial topics.
Edison International reported core earnings of $0.79 per share for the first quarter 2021, an increase of $0.16 per share from the same period last year. As Pedro noted earlier, this year-over-year comparison is not particularly meaningful because SCE has not received a decision in its 2021 General Rate Case.
On Page 7, you can see SCE's key first quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I would like to highlight a handful of items that accounted for much of the variance. To begin, revenue was higher by $0.05 per share. FERC-related revenue contributed $0.03 to this variance primarily due to higher rate base. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.02 to this variance. However, this was offset by balancing account expenses with no effect on earnings.
O&M had a positive variance of $0.20 largely due to lower wildfire mitigation-related O&M and lower employee benefits expenses. Wildfire mitigation expenses were lower in the first quarter primarily because fewer remediations were identified through the inspection process. There was also a negative variance of $0.08 from an increase in depreciation due to a higher asset base.
Lower net financing costs had a positive variance of $0.08 due to several items, including lower interest rates on balancing accounts and lower preferred dividends due to the redemption of preferred stock at SCE last year. Finally, SCE's EPS in the quarter was $0.04 lower because of dilution from the increase in shares outstanding primarily associated with the equity offering in May 2020.
I would now like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast, which are shown on Page 8. Our capital and rate base forecasts are unchanged from the last quarter, pending a final decision in SCE's 2021 GRC Track 1. SCE is executing against a capital plan that targets key programs while maintaining flexibility in later years to adapt to what is ultimately authorized in the GRC decision.
The rate base forecast does not include certain projects and programs that are not yet approved. This includes the Customer Service Replatform Project, or CSRP, which went operational earlier this month. SCE expects to file an application for cost recovery for CSRP later this year. And if approved, this could add approximately $500 million to rate base by 2023.
It also does not reflect capital spending on fire restoration related to wildfires affecting SCE's facilities and equipment in late 2020. SCE is evaluating the cost to determine how much may be incremental to the current rate base forecast.
Please turn to Page 9. On the regulatory front, we remain hopeful that SCE will receive a proposed decision on Track 1 of its 2021 GRC this quarter. As a reminder, the CPUC can vote out a final decision no sooner than 30 days after it issues a proposed decision. Consistent with our prior practice, we will issue earnings guidance after we receive a final decision on the GRC.
Additionally, SCE filed its testimony in Track 3 of the '21 -- 2021 GRC in the first quarter. In Track 3, SCE is requesting recovery of $497 million in revenue requirement and that the CPUC find reasonable $679 million of incremental wildfire-mitigation capital expenditures. This filing is another step towards recovery of wildfire-mitigation costs we have already incurred.
Page 10 provides a summary of the approved and pending cost recovery applications for incremental wildfire-related costs, including Track 3, which I just mentioned. 
As you can see on Page 11, in the coming months, SCE will request a financing order that would allow it to securitize the cost authorized in GRC Track 2, residential uncollectibles for 2020 and additional AB 1054 capital authorized in GRC Track 1. We expect SCE's total request to be approximately $1 billion, composed of $500 million of AB 1054-related capital, $400 million of wildfire mitigation-related O&M and $100 million of incremental residential uncollectible expenses associated with the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Related to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events, SCE continues to make solid progress settling the remaining individual plaintiff claims. As shown on Page 12, during the first quarter, SCE resolved approximately $200 million of individual plaintiff claims. In total, that brings resolved claims to approximately $4.2 billion, representing more than 2/3 of the best estimate of total losses, which remains unchanged.
I would now like to provide an update on the EIX financing plan and the issuance of securities with up to $1 billion of equity content that we discussed on our last earnings call. To reiterate our previous statements, this equity content supports maintaining investment-grade ratings at EIX and the utility. During the first quarter, Edison International issued $1.25 billion of preferred stock with equity content of approximately $625 million. We will continue to monitor market conditions and consider additional preferred equity, internal programs, and if needed, the existing at-the-market program to satisfy the balance of the equity content need this year.
Beyond 2021, we continue to expect to have minimal equity needs associated with SCE's ongoing capital program, and we will quantify these after receiving a final decision in the 2021 GRC.
That concludes my remarks."

And as you we've seen the administration provides last week the start to their plan through the NDC, but lots of details to be filled in, not only by the administration,",728,"Yes. To give you a few high-level thoughts, Jeremy, and as you said, it's early here. And as you we've seen the administration provides last week the start to their plan through the NDC, but lots of details to be filled in, not only by the administration, but then also ultimately by Congress, right? And so with a divided Congress, I expect that anything happens in Washington, at least on the conventional side, will have to be bipartisan and, therefore, something that both parties can work with.
I think at the highest level, we -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we absolutely support the overall economy-wide direction and the 50% to 52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2000 -- by 2030.
As you've seen the initial elements of the Biden plan, clean energy, electrification and transmission are all big parts of the plan. And they line up really nicely with what we've been saying is the most feasible and cheapest way for California to get there through our Pathway 2025 work. So that's really good alignment in terms of strategy, and I think it just provides long-term support for what we've been talking about for the last several years of -- from an SCE perspective, making the investments needed to prepare the grid to be able to manage that transition, to support customers, see electrifying building, space and water heating, electrifying transportation.
And then I think in terms of the core utility investment, what that means is, I think, most importantly, support for the core program that we've outlined. I know that we don't provide guidance beyond the rate case cycle to date. But we have said that we expect to see this very robust spending need -- investment need for the next several years, certainly well past the rate case.
And really, as you look on a California-wide basis, we have estimated in Pathway 2045 that the investment need will be something like $250 billion or so across the need for clean energy resources, renewables, storage and transmission investment. The transmission part of that alone -- transmission and distribution part is around $75 billion. And I think one of the charts in the deck provided a little detail on that.
So I think it's Page 6 that show the $75 billion breakout for the state. So a long way of saying, we think that, that's all supportive of the core investment opportunity as well as some upside opportunities to the extent of the utility and so needing to play a role in California to be on core grid investments or, for example, for added storage or for programs like our Charge Ready 2 and Charge Ready transports that we have underway right now.
One final thing I'll say is that there was more press this morning on the campaign trail President Biden has talked about getting the power sector itself on a stand-alone basis to 0 GHG by 2035, and there's now discussion about potentially setting a target of 80% reductions from 2005 levels for the power sector by 2030.
Speaking here both from an Edison perspective and from a broader industry perspective, we're all lined up to do as much as we can as fast as we can at a national level. 80% may really be stretching, I think, the feasibility for the nationwide transition just given the fact that it's 9 years until ban. There's still R&D and technology that's needed to help fill the gaps and significant technology deployment that would be needed, particularly on the transmission side. It's not just the capital investment, but the permitting process that can take quite a while.
So our Pathway 2045 analysis actually concluded that California would see something like a 72% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. I've seen some national analysis from EPRI and others that suggest that the national number on an aggressive pathway might still be below 70%, maybe mid-60s or so.
So I think there will be a number of discussions among the industry, the administration and Congress will be on what defines what -- as much as we can do we can do, especially if we can do. What defines the art of that? And how do we make sure that the transition is reliable, affordable and equitable for all customers across the country."

And so I think that they went a long ways and, in our view, significantly reduced the risk exposure for utilities across the state.
In terms of changing the state's current approach on inverse itself, I think it's unlikely you'd see legislative action anytime soon because, quite frankly, there's been a lot of workabilities and literature on wildfire issues already for AB 1054. They have a full agenda in helping the economy recover from the pandemic. So I wouldn't expect that there'd be a whole lot of bandwidth for taking that up in the near term.
There is always a possibility that there could be court cases where inverse could be tested again and challenged again. Probably premature to go into details of specific court cases, but I'm aware that not only might there be some that pop up for us as we go through our case load, but other utilities also may have opportunities to challenge inverse. So that's always a possibility out there through the court system."

And that's why I dedicated the first part of my comments to framing that. I guess I would recap one part and maybe add a little bit. The recap part is that we do see and I think all the external forecasts that we see are calling for a likely above-average fire risk peak period here.
I think in terms of the mitigations, I went through them in a fair amount of detail. Maybe what I would add is that to remind you that the approach we have taken over the last several years has been a risk-informed approach. So when we went out to replace the first mile of bare wire with covered conductor, it was the mile that was in one of the highest-risk areas possible, right? So we've been going down the stack, if you will, by trying to address the highest-risk areas first where the mitigations would have the highest impact on risk reduction. So every piece of work we do is reducing the risk, and we've gone after the big bites early on.
That, I think, is really helpful and constructive in terms of framing that risk profile. That risk profile continues to narrow. And that's the stuff we've been doing. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've also seen the states dedicate just outstanding effort to improving firefighting modeling and just firefighting capabilities, fire-suppression capabilities.
And so that ability now that the state has that, frankly, it didn't have in 2017 or 2018 to fight multiple large fires simultaneously. You might recall, I mentioned there are some, actually, really interesting L.A. Times articles around 2018, and the challenge that the state had in fighting the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire and the Hill Fire all simultaneously. Well, the other states added a lot of qualified bodies with a lot more planes and trucks and equipment to be able to deploy across multiple fronts simultaneously. And that is a significant piece of risk reduction for all of us.
So I'm not sure I can give you a disclosure-quality quantified answer. This is -- So therefore, it's X-point-Y percent lower. But I think it's a significant percent difference in terms of the overall risk profile that the state faces and that, therefore, we face right now."

I think that SCE has done, frankly, pretty well in terms of the core execution for the last several years, right? We -- utility had significant prior investment in sectionalizing the grid. I remember reporting to you all in earnings call, probably going 1 year, 1.5 years back about how, at that point, something like -- if you look at our circuits in high-fire-risk areas, on average, it could be cordoned off into 4 separate sections, right, which allowed us to better target a PSPS event. Well, we continue to add segmentation, sectionalization devices to circuits in high-fire-risk areas. So that continues to hone down the scope of PSPS events.
Through that and through better planning from '19 to '20, now to '21, we've seen significant improvements in terms of the number of customers who have been impacted in given events. Now I have to add, though, that this is all very much weather-driven. And so a lot of what happened in 2020 was that we had some tough weather events to necessitate it using this tool of last resort, SOS resort, right? And so that grows some of the numbers.
But even if you look now at the various filings that the utilities have made through the WMP process, if you take a look at the numbers, I think Edison has actually had -- on a percentage of total customers basis has the lowest percent of customers who are impacted by PSPS in the 2020 season.
Importantly, the continued work from '20 to '21 has -- we believe will allow Edison to significantly reduce the impact further for customers who were impacted last year if we have the same weather as we did last year. Of course, we won't have the very same weather. But from an assumption basis, we would see, I think, pretty significant reduction in the impact. I think the number is over 28% or close to 30% reduction in impact to customers who were impacted last year. So lots of good things in terms of the modern capabilities, being able to triage it down and restrict the impact of any one event.
On the communication side, I think, is where we had more opportunity and, frankly, got some pretty pointed feedback deservedly from customers and communities and local governments. And so if you look at the action plan that SCE filed in February, there's a lot there on continuing to do better at the things that we were doing okay at and also doing much better than things that we didn't do so okay at.
And so that's where you see a lot of focus on how do we have more timely communications with customers, with communities, with local governments, with emergency operation centers, improving the quality of those communications and the vehicles for them. And so that's an area where I hope our customer -- expect our customers will say a good improvement going into this next peak season.
Maria, what have I missed in there?"

I think it's clear that this tool is necessary and important, what can we do to help customers when we do deenergize them.
And then I think the other aspect that I would just add is now that we filed our action plan, we do have the opportunity now to communicate with the commission. So I think our cadence is about every 2 weeks now. So it really does provide an opportunity for us to have an ongoing dialogue around what it is that SCE is doing. So I think those are all important aspects of PSPS for this year."

The GRC is a complex case. And obviously, we had hoped that we would have had a PD by now. But we're still hopeful that we'll have a PD by the end of this quarter, as Maria mentioned in her comments. And I'm not -- I don't think we're seeing anything systemic there that says there's a problem, the process is broken, on the contrary. We provided a number of examples in the prepared remarks around things like safety certifications for Edison, the disposition of a number of the cost recovery accounts.
So I just think they have a lot going on under difficult times. And obviously, we'd like to see a PD for the GRC soon, and we'll do our part for that. But we're not sensing that there's something grinding the gears down more systemically.

That's inspections that we do. We found fewer areas that we had to remediate. But I think more broadly, there are still costs associated with mitigating this risk.
We've talked before, and in fact, the commission convened an on bond not too long ago to talk about affordability. And so as we do that, we continue to focus people on the necessity for the wildfire-mitigation expenditures that we and other IOUs are doing that, that goes squarely to maintaining the safety of our communities.
And then over the longer term, looking at what it really means to our electric grades as we further electrify the economy, what that means for rates but then also what it means for the energy bill itself. And so I think as we think about affordability, we and the commission and other stakeholders are looking at it from different perspectives, total share of wallet that energy represents, so not just the electric bill.
Affordability has been defined a few different ways by the commission, things like how many hours do you have to work at minimum wage in order to pay your electric bill. I think it's going to be an ongoing discussion. But we do know that wildfire mitigation is very important to the safety of our communities, and we know that a broader electrification is important for the greenhouse gas and environmental objectives that the state has. And that's important because as we do that and we think about affordability, it's also about being equitable and having all of our communities also participate in that improvement in the environment.
So I think it's going to be an ongoing discussion. The commission's rightfully focused on it, and we have been focused on it as well, as Pedro mentioned, over a many year cycle, trying to manage our costs. And then as we further electrify the economy, allowing that to help increase affordability as well."

I want to make sure I'm not double counting here because if I think about it, you've still got a good chunk of cash coming in the door, as outlined on the items in Slide 10 and then almost $2 billion -- a little over $2 billion of securitization on Slide 11.

So some of the things that we talk about on Page 10 end up being securitized on Page 11. So it's probably easier if we kind of maybe can separately go through, and I'll take and tie the numbers for you.
The more general response to your question is we do have cash that we have already spent on wildfire mitigation. This will -- these securitizations and/or recoveries through rates as we continue to file the application will allow us to sort of get that cash back in the door. So some of the pressure that you've seen often expressed through the issuance of short-term debt in the past or funded through short-term debt in the past will be alleviated.
I think from a claims perspective, what we've said before is that EIX has issued equity or preferred equity in the past in order to sustain the credit metrics and the investment-grade ratings both at the utility and the holding company. And that equity issuance allows SCE to continue to debt finance the claims payments as they come due now that we're -- shortly, we'll be past the insurance recovery. And so they'll be able to do that. And subject to the waiver that they have, they can keep that debt outside of the capital structure.
Over time -- cash is all fungible as we're putting dollars down there. That may impact the exact timing of when they do their debt financings. But over time, they'll be funding their business in accordance with their authorized capital structure.
So I think that's the general framework. I think the numbers on Slides 10 and 11, there's a little bit, as I said, of overlap between applications. And then we translate that into securitizations on Page 11. And we can go over that in more detail, if you like, later on."

And you've already seen over the last few years, things that were near term that materialized, right? So we're going to have our Charge Ready programs and forecast for quite a while until we got approval of those applications. But now we have over $800 million of program and of that, it's probably what 3 plus 2 some -- certainly over $0.5 billion worth of CapEx coming from those Make Ready programs for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. So that's an example of one where we were talking about it for a few years, went through the process, developed and designed a program and got PUC support for this.
I think as you look at the near term -- near midterm, in next decade or half a decade, storage is an opportunity that could present some potential upside because for storage, I think a lot of that will be done by third parties and -- whether it's large-scale or the BPAs or whether it's customers down the customer premise. But there may be opportunities for utility-level grid-side storage. You've seen us do already some of that. The rate case included some assumptions about a modest level.
But particularly as we see the acceleration of things like vehicle electrification, that might lend itself to places where it might make sense to reinforce a substation with more storage as we did with Mira Loma, where we put in 20 megawatts of batteries a few years ago. So that's kind of a near term or, call it, midterm one.
I think longer term, the upside is in transmission. And of course, we have per quarter 1,000 with competition for transmission. We want to make sure that the utility is able to compete. However, I'll remind you that for projects that are upgrades of existing utility on projects, the utility has the right of first refusal.
And just given the scale of wires investment that we think is needed, that's -- I would hypothesize handily that there will be probably some projects that are upgrades of existing lines where maybe we haven't conceived that yet. We really are going to be dependent on the California independent system operator to run through its transmission planning process and determine the transmission that's needed for renewables by 2030 and later on by 2045. So I think transmission presents another offset opportunity.
Finally, very -- coming way back down to the Bermudan, very near term, I know Maria mentioned this, but just to remind you that we have our Customer Service Replatform Project and that could be $500 million of rate base additions, if approved by the commission. We just went live with that in early April. And then there could also be some additional rate base additions from the wildfire restoration work that we did in 2020 out of the Creek Fire. We haven't quantified that yet externally, but we're finalizing that analysis now. So those are much more kind of blocking-and-tackling near-term opportunities."

So there's an established process approved by the court that allows us to have smoother approach to working our way through several thousand cases that remain.
I would also say -- you mentioned there are smaller ones remaining. When you think -- they're smaller relative to say the subrogation settlements that we did earlier. But I want to make sure you're not generalizing too much by looking at, say, the dollar amount of settlements we've done with individual plaintiffs so far relative to the number of individual plaintiff cases that we settle and making any assumptions or extrapolating from that about the remaining cases. All of these are, so case-by-case, very individualized. So it's really hard to extrapolate and say, because we did X dollars for these Y plaintiffs, you can use that ratio for the remaining ones.

I think that there's -- in terms of streaming the timing a bit, I would expect that the administration will want to have a plan firmly in place and time for the Glasgow Conference of the parties -- the United Nations conference of the parties in November. And so -- and if not, hopefully sooner.
But the pace, the scale -- I mean, you even see it in the discussions right now on the infrastructure package that's been proposed by the President. And you're hearing $2-plus billion numbers coming from his proposal. You're hearing Republican members talking about packages that are more on the $600 million mark. So that will influence us.
The relative degree of emphasis on different levers in the packages and so in the case of transmission, I think it's generally accepted by both sides that transmission will be a key element of the equation. But how that translates into? Are the federal incentives? Frankly, from our perspective, the things that we would really like to see the federal government do more than just money is focus on the permitting process and helping on the federal side to streamline access to federal lands where we might need to have access for rights of way for new transmission lines. That alone is probably one of the biggest levers they have to accelerate this because that -- it's that piece, the permitting process, that adds years and years of transmission projects. It can take you a decade to build a transmission project.
So -- but in any case, Ryan, I'll go back to my first point that it's early in the game, lots of discussions ahead. And those discussions will then guide the level of emphasis, frankly, not in transmission, but how deeply to go in the power sector by what time frame? How does that compare with -- how you're going deeper in other sectors? To what extent are you using market mechanisms to do that versus more sector-by-sector allocations? All of that is to be determined."

Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $4.52 for 2020. This exceeded the midpoint of our initial guidance range and is within the narrowed range we updated on our last earnings call.
Core EPS of $4.52 was lower than $4.70 a year ago, and the decline was due to $0.44 of equity share dilution. On an operational basis, excluding dilution, core EPS was $0.26 higher, driven by strong performance at SCE. Maria will discuss our financial performance in detail in her remarks.
In 2020, SCE made substantial progress on its comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy. This continues to advance one of SCE's top priorities, increasing grid resiliency to adapt to the change in climate and to protect public safety. SCE accomplished the vast majority of its 2020 program targets and, in many cases, exceeded those goals despite the challenges we all faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have highlighted several measures of SCE's progress and execution on Page 2 of the slide deck that we issued with our earnings release.
Since the end of 2018, SCE's execution of its wildfire mitigation strategy has reduced the risk of wildfires associated with utility infrastructure despite a record-setting California wildfire season last year. For the second consecutive year, we do not believe damages from any wildfire alleged to be caused by SCE equipment will exceed insurance.
SCE is further accelerating its wildfire mitigation efforts. Earlier this month, the utility filed its 2021 wildfire mitigation plan update, which describes how it has matured its wildfire mitigation capabilities and outlines the long-term plan to further advance risk informed decision-making, data management, grid hardening and community engagement. A prime example is the covered conductor program, which will increase the percentage of distribution overhead circuit miles covered within SCE's high fire risk areas from approximately 15% today to over 60% by the end of 2023, subject to CPUC approval.
The utility continues to innovate and implement technology-based solutions at options such as early fault detection for reducing ignition risks. As described in its 2021 WMP, SCE estimates a 25% reduction in ignitions in high fire risk areas by 2022 as compared to 2020, assuming the same conditions as experienced in 2020.
SCE continues to improve its public safety power shutoff, or PSPS operations, with public safety being the paramount consideration. SCE uses PSPS only when conditions warrant. Let me underscore the need for PSPS despite the hardships it creates. By noting that in 2019 and 2020, post PSPS patrols found at least 60 incidents of wind-related damage that could have potentially caused ignitions. In 2020, the installation of more weather stations and sectionalization devices, paired with the automation of existing devices, all enabled SCE to limit PSPS footprints wherever possible based on risk assessments, achieving a 22% reduction in customer minutes of interruption. All that said, SCE recognizes there are opportunities to further improve the execution of PSPS and better support its customers. That was loud and clear in the January '19 letter from President Batjer and in the CPUC and community input that SCE leaders received during the 4.5-hour PSPS hearing on January 26. All this especially underscored the need to improve SCE's communications with customers. And the PSPS action plan filed on February 12 includes important near-term commitments to use this essential tool of last resort in a way that shows better care for our customers.
Beyond SCE, the state has been building on significant investments in its firefighting capabilities. In his 2021-'22 budget, the governor proposed an additional $1 billion to support a coordinated forest health and fire prevention strategy, that maximizes technology and science-based approaches to protect state lands. This includes prioritizing firebreaks around high-risk communities and grants for individual homeowners to harden their properties. Recognizing the needs to move quickly, the governor also proposed that $323 million out of that $1 billion would be for early action to start these prevention projects before the next fire season. For fire suppression, the budget adds funding to support 30 additional statewide fire crews and 7 large air tankers.
The state will continue phasing in Black Hawk helicopters, with 7 expected to be in operation this fire season and another 5 in 2022. These new suppression resources will help the state move more quickly to combat wildfires before they become catastrophic.
The governor and the California Insurance Commission also announced a plan to establish statewide standards for home and community hardening that will reduce wildfire risk and help make insurance available and affordable to residents and businesses.
Shifting to past wildfires. SCE has made significant progress toward resolving pending litigation. Last month, SCE resolved all insurance subrogation claims in the pending 2018 Woolsey Fire litigation. The utility continues to make solid progress settling remaining individual plaintiff claims across the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. In total, SCE has resolved approximately 2/3 of the best estimate of total losses established last September. Maria will provide an update on the equity financing needs related to these events later on the call.
Turning to regulatory actions. We welcome the reappointment of CPUC President Batjer for a 6-year term, subject to confirmation by the Senate. President Batjer's leadership has energized the commission's implementation of the state's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. Yesterday, the CPUC hosted an en banc to share ideas about affordability across many stakeholders. Given the economic impacts of COVID-19, this is a timely discussion, and it follows on many years of SCE leadership to manage system average rate growth well below the other California utilities, which we were proud to see acknowledged by the commission staff report and others. The discussion reinforced many of the issues we have raised in our Pathway 2045 analysis, including that the grid investments needed to decarbonize the economy and improve local air quality through clean energy and electrification may increase electric costs, but will actually result in greater affordability and equity, with the average customer spending 30% less across all forms of energy in 2045 than they do today, thanks to the greater efficiency of electric technologies.
Looking ahead, SCE is planning for their critical role it plays in sustainability, particularly from the unique vantage point of a wires focused business. This will include significant capital investment opportunities to support the electrification of transportation and buildings as outlined in SCE's Pathway 2045 and reimagining the grid white papers. The governor's budget proposal also underscores this, with its proposed $1.5 billion comprehensive strategy to achieve zero-emission vehicle goals by 2035 and 2045.
This includes infrastructure investments for and improved access to new and used zero-emission vehicles. SCE has received CPUC approval for over $800 million to support electric vehicles including investing in electric charging infrastructure for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The utility launched its Charge Ready 2 program, the largest light-duty EV charging program by an investor-owned utility in the United States, which will support approximately 38,000 light-duty charging ports. Charge Ready Transport, SCE's program to build charging infrastructure for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, will grow through 2024, eventually building charging infrastructure to power 8,500 electric medium and heavy-duty vehicles.
SCE has also committed to a long-term goal to electrify its own vehicle fleet, including 100% of all light-duty vehicles by 2030. In the area of building electrification, SCE launched new programs in 2020 to incentivize heat pump installations and expect to continue to expand these offerings going forward.
Before I conclude, I would like to say that I am just very, very proud of what our employees accomplished over the last year in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has reshaped the way that all of us do business, and how we interact with our customers and communities. And we adapted to continue delivering an essential service. We cared for each other, whether working in the field or teleworking. We care for our customers, providing relief for those facing economic challenges, and we cared for our communities and their safety.
Looking forward, I am excited about our near and long-term business opportunities. SCE is well positioned as an electric-only utility, with investments highly aligned with the states and now the federal government's long-term decarbonization goals. We will continue to accelerate our wildfire mitigation efforts, while building toward an equitable, clean energy future. With that, Maria will provide her financial report."

My comments today will cover fourth quarter 2020 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts and an update on our financing plans for 2021.Edison International reported core earnings of $1.19 per",932,"Thanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will cover fourth quarter 2020 results, our capital expenditure and rate base forecasts and an update on our financing plans for 2021.
Edison International reported core earnings of $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter 2020, an increase of $0.20 per share from the same period last year. Full year 2020 core EPS was $4.52, which exceeded the midpoint of our initial guidance range, and is within the narrowed range we updated on our last earnings call.
Core EPS of $4.52 was lower than $4.70 a year ago, and the decline was due to $0.44 of equity share dilution.
On an operational basis, excluding dilution, core EPS was $0.26 higher, driven by strong performance at SCE. On Page 3, you can see SCE's key fourth quarter EPS drivers on the right-hand side. I would like to highlight 4 items that accounted for much of the variance.
First, EPS increased by $0.16 related to higher revenue. CPUC-related revenue contributed $0.22 of this increase due to the escalation mechanism from the 2018 GRC decision. There was also a negative variance of $0.11, primarily related to benefits captured in our tax balancing account. This is offset in the income tax line with no effect on earnings.
FERC and other operating revenue had a positive variance of $0.05, largely due to higher rate base. Second, O&M had a positive variance of $0.11, primarily due to higher regulatory deferrals related to wildfire mitigation activities and customer uncollectibles, and from approval of the GRC track 2 settlement. Third, depreciation had a negative variance of $0.07 due to higher rate base.
Lastly, SCE's EPS in the quarter was lower by $0.07 because of dilution from the increase in shares outstanding, primarily associated with the equity offering in May 2020.
I would now like to comment on SCE's capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast, which are shown on Page 4. We continue to see opportunities to significantly grow SCE's rate base, driven by investments in electric infrastructure. The capital program reflects expenditures of $15 billion to $16 billion between 2021 and 2023. This represents compound annual rate base growth of 7.6%, over 2 rate case periods at the request level. Our total CapEx forecast during this period is unchanged as we are awaiting a proposed decision in SCE's 2021 GRC track 1.
In 2020, SCE's capital spending was $5.5 billion, approximately $400 million higher than forecast, primarily as a result of higher fire restoration costs. For 2021, SCE has developed, and will execute against a robust capital plan that targets key programs, while maintaining flexibility in later years to adapt to levels authorized in the final GRC decision.
Please turn to Page 5. While the commission schedule calls for a proposed decision this quarter on track 1 of SCE's 2021 GRC, based on the level of inquiry to date from the CPUC compared to our past experience, we believe it is unlikely that SCE will receive a PD by the end of the first quarter. We remain hopeful that SCE will receive a PD in the second quarter. As a reminder, the CPUC can vote out a final decision no sooner than 30 days after it issues a proposed decision. Consistent with our prior practice, we will issue earnings guidance after we receive a final decision on the GRC.
Page 6 shows a summary of the substantial progress on receiving approvals for recovery of incremental wildfire mitigation costs. SCE expects to receive over $1 billion of cash flow through September 2022 as the utility implements CPUC approval. This is in addition to ongoing securitization of AB 1054 capital. You may recall that last quarter, the CPUC issued a financing order, authorizing SCE to securitize the first tranche of AB 1054 capital expenditures approved in the grid safety and resiliency plan settlement. Yesterday, SCE successfully closed that securitization, issuing $338 million of AAA-rated recovery bonds. The proceeds will be used to repay short-term borrowings issued for AB 1054 capital expenditures.
In January, the CPUC approved SCE's GRC track 2 settlement, which allows SCE to request another financing order to securitize the approved AB 1054 capital expenditures and recover the O&M expense. Additionally, SCE filed a WEMA application for wildfire insurance premium for the second half of 2020. If approved, SCE will recover $215 million beginning January 2022.
I would now like to provide an update on the approximately $1 billion equity issuance that we had discussed previously. As Pedro noted, SCE has been making significant progress resolving pending wildfire-related litigation, and thus far, has settled claims that represent approximately 2/3 of the best estimate that we established. We continue to ground our financing plan in a framework that supports investment-grade ratings by targeting consolidated FFO-to-debt in the 15% to 17% range.
To support this outcome, EIX will issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content in 2021, consistent with the previously identified need.
We will consider a range of options to achieve this equity content, including preferred equity, internal programs, and, if needed, our existing ATM program. We will be flexible regarding the specific timing and monitor market conditions to efficiently finance the need.
Beyond this year, we expect to have minimal equity needs associated with our ongoing capital program, and will quantify these after receiving a final decision in the 2021 GRC.
Overall, the company is well positioned to achieve the growth associated with the safety and resiliency investments being made in the grid, and the longer-term opportunity associated with our clean energy objectives. That concludes my remarks."

So we've been having those sorts of conversations.
As we've mentioned before, we think that the equity plan that we have in place or the financing plan that we have in -- have had in place and announced last year is very supportive of the FFO-to-debt range that we're targeting and supportive of investment-grade ratings.

Kevin Payne is also on the line, so he can add as he sees fit. So just a process, you saw the letter that President Batjer sent, you monitored the hearing that the PUC had for Kevin, and Steve Powell and other members of the team participated. That provided a lot of, frankly, good helpful input from commissioners and communities and other state agencies. Based on that, SCE developed the action plan that has a series of steps and commitments. You saw there are some things in there around or, frankly, continuing work on trying to minimize just the impact and scope of PSPS. I would put that in the category of work that's been going on and continuous, right? Areas like [indiscernible] sectionalization and to work on continuous improvement of weather modeling and the like to -- just really to help to narrow the gap between the approach we have, which is, frankly, the right approach for SCE to have of notifying customers based on forecast conditions, but then de-energizing on real-time conditions. But the more that we can narrow the gap between the number of customers that get notified versus those get de-energized by having better and better forecasting and modeling, that helps.
So you saw some actions around those lines, but, say, a lot of the focus was really on, how do we help the SCE team better improve the communications process, communications with the emergency agencies, with government, with community leaders, with end use customers. And so you saw a number of actions around that.
In terms of process, there's going to be a series of meetings every couple of weeks for the next while with commission staff just to continue to keep them updated. SCE has taken the step of now dedicating a Vice President to PSPS, who's, frankly, a pretty strong leader back to SCE, and he's moving from the T&D business to over the next few months, spend all of his time, along with the dedicated team, on the PSPS improvement approach. So that's -- I'd say it's somewhat informal process. And then there's the action plan, more formality to it and formal discussions with the commission on how it's coming along and check-ins with them. But frankly, wanting to make sure that the SCE team can move on all the elements and meet its commitments. Kevin, anything you would add there?"

So we did see the transaction and it's interesting. So the team has been learning about it. There might be somewhat different circumstances for SCE in that we do have obviously, transmission towers with attachments on them already today, like PG&E did. In our case, they're part of a bit more comprehensive telecom business. Edison Carrier Solutions, which is essentially a competitive telco inside the utility, that not only does sell antenna attachments, but also has managed fiber services, dark fiber as well as lit fiber, providing bandwidth to carriers. And so in SCE's case, there's that broader telecom business it also operates under a little different framework. I noticed that [indiscernible] there's some revenue sharing that the PG&E deal contemplates. But the SCE business operates under a different revenue sharing mechanism. So there's just a number of different bells and whistles that are made for just different maturity of the business and different scope and scale today. So my -- the PG&E transaction might not be fully transferable or applicable."

Look, I think the headline is that -- we continue to view California as one of the most constructive states in the country when it comes to utility regulation, right? And it's both because of the backward-looking and current mechanisms, like the fact that we have our forward-looking rate cases, we have the balancing accounts for elements like procurement purchases, energy procurement, I should say. We have decoupling, right? So you have a number of elements that have been here for quite a while that make for a constructive environment.
You also have, frankly, looking more towards the future, a state that's been fairly aggressive in terms of wanting to push the edge of technology and have -- has wanted utilities to play a significant role in advancing the ball for the sector, right, for the benefit of California customers. That's meant that utilities has to take on some added operational risks in managing more distributed resources than our peers in other states or -- and having deeper penetration renewables or being earlier in the curve around storage and the like. And that has lent itself to providing an opportunity for ROEs that have reflected a premium based on those risks that we are being asked to manage.
And then finally, looking solidly well out in the future, it's a state that is really committed to decarbonizing the economy. And so you've seen through our papers like Pathway 2045 and [indiscernible] the grid papers that we see that, that decarbonization getting to net zero for the state will require a significant ramp-up in renewable and other carbon-free resources along with storage. This will lead to a dramatic increase in load across the state, 60% or so increase in order to then electrify a lot of the economy, and that all requires a really robust grid with significant more investment than what we have in place today to make that all happen. So that all adds up to a good opportunity for utilities.
Now -- by the way, it's also a good opportunity for the customer because, as I said in my prepared remarks, we see all of that been leading ultimately to a 30% decline in the total energy cost that the average customer has had in 2045. It may put some pressure on utility bills, but it will help bring down overall cost for the customer and make the states more affordable.
Now that said, there are always bumps in the road. There are things that can give [indiscernible] pause. The wildfire experience has been a challenging one over the last several years. We've had a lot of encouragement in getting items like AB 1054 to help create a restored framework. We're still going through implementation of that. I know that there's some discount that the utilities are carrying today relative to our peers in other states. And hopefully, over time, as investors see that the framework is working, that the physical risks are being mitigated and that the structure is there to help mitigate the financial side of the risk, too, that will help to get investors fully comfortable with that and better align the value of California opportunities for the long-term opportunity that we have.
One final item is there's a lot going on, and it's all going on in the middle of COVID. So I feel for the CPUC staff, the 800-or-so of them have a lot on their plates. I think President Batjer, as I've mentioned in the comments, has done a great leadership and focusing the commission on that clean energy future. I think, generally, she's also helped the commission to, in general, be timely in decisions, and you saw that in elements like the track 2 success we had recently, but there's a lot on their plate. So while I'm a little disappointed that we may not end up seeing a GRC track 1 PD this quarter, I know that they're on the case, and they recognize the importance of overall timely decisions. And then when it comes to the PSPS, there has been some tough feedback we got. So a lot of it, frankly, was merited. And it's a good learning opportunity, and I commend Kevin Payne and the team at SCE for having sat there for 4.5 hours and listened and take a note and reflected good feedback in the PSPS action plan that SCE filed. So there will be bumps in the road in any relationship. But I think, overall, if you look at -- maybe a couple of trees to get in the way now and then. But if you look at the forest, it's a really interesting forest for the long term."

I think our Pathway 2045 paper at the time was forecasting something like a need for 7 million electric vehicles in California by 2030. At the time -- or shortly after, I think the state was talking about a $5 million mark. Since then, you've seen the state really look at doubling down on the electric vehicles and progress like Governor Newsom's executive order for zero-emission vehicles -- 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035. That says something right there about the growing commitment by the state and, frankly, driven by growing realization that -- that is a key tool and one of the most affordable tools to get to decarbonization at the end of the day.
The other angle, I'd share on this is then there's the market, right? And so when we start talking about this, there was Bolt. I remember when I got my first Bolt in 2011, the new model year, my colleagues were driving some of the first Telsas, there were a whole lot of EVs out. Now you're looking at a rollout, is reading one of the latest articles where, I think, over the next year, there's going to be, what, something like 20 or 30 new model offerings across auto OEMs and it's an area where U.S. automakers are realizing that if they don't run fast, they could lose leadership to Chinese automakers or European automakers.
So seeing things like Ford's commitment of $20-some billion investment towards EVs over the next several years, seeing GM's aspiration to not have internal combustion engines anymore in a decade or so, that is a very different landscape from where we started 4, 5 years ago. And it tells you that this is happening, it's real, and I suspect, like other technology innovations, like the deployment of cellphones, folks may be surprised by how quickly that escrow takes off."

So that delta in the capital spending between last quarter and this quarter was largely driven by wildfire restoration costs. So you will recall that late last year, there were a number of large fires in our service territory, particularly up in the northern part of our service territory around Big Creek. And so a lot of the spend that's been going on since then has been to really get all of those facilities back into service and to repair them, et cetera.
So that's really the driver there, Michael. We have to go through an analysis and see sort of what in there was otherwise going to have been replaced or upgraded, et cetera, what's incremental, but that's largely the capital change from last quarter.
In terms of transmission, we're still in the cycle. I think, obviously, the state is planning for the future, the future that Pedro just described in his earlier remarks. And we have to look to the CAISO to do that planning. There's obviously a lot of work going on around the need as well, both in Integrated Resources Plan -- Integrated Resources Plan as well as the CAISO, but I'll let Pedro share his thoughts as well."

But that analysis estimated that California would need to add 80 gigawatts of bulk power kind of wholesale level renewables and 30 gigawatts of wholesale bulk power level storage by 2045, that's in addition to 30 gigawatts of distributed generation and 10 gigawatts of distributed behind-the-meter storage. But all that would require something like $175 billion investment for the resource side for the renewables and storage side. And the counterpart to that is that you need something like $70 billion in why your site investment, with most of that being for transmission, whether it's new lines or enhancing of current lines.
Now that's statewide, right? So that's not all SCE, but that just gives you a sense of how big the investment need will be in order to accommodate that electrified future to decarbonize the economy. And then as a reminder that, under the current per quarter 1,000 structure, if the Cal ISO determines that an existing line needs to be upgraded, then the utility has right of first refusal to do that upgrade on its line, lines that it already owns and operates. If it's a brand-new line, that's not an extension of an existing line, then that is bid out competitively. And I would expect the utility to seek to compete with third parties for that new build.
So hard to quantify what the specific SCE opportunity will be from all of that, but it's clearly a very large pie that will need to be met across the state. And I expect that SCE will certainly play a significant role within its territory for that."

I'm not sure I'm going to have a sharp answer for you right now, Michael partly because the Cal ISO, I don't think, has turned the crank yet on the underlying analysis for what lines and in what timing? My guess is that -- or my sense is, not guess, my sense from the analysis is that a lot of that spend may be post 2030 spend, because that's when you really see the load pickup, too. In our analysis, load, which has been fairly flat statewide to slightly declining for the last decade. To 2030, interestingly, continues to be fairly flattish, right, because you have a lot of electrification between now and 2030 being counterbalanced by continued distributed generation deployment as well as continued energy efficiency.
But we see a big elbow -- turn in the curve upswing post 2030, and that's where the state really picks up the bulk of that 60% load increase that I talked about before. It really happens mostly between 2030 and 2045. So that may suggest that a good chunk of that build maybe post that. But in the meantime, you've seen our capital spend so far, as Maria described, we had a bump up from just that Creek fire restoration last year. So I hope we don't have to do fire restoration like that for any future fires. But we continue to say that we see an ongoing opportunity for significant capital spend just for the core capital investment in the utility. And so I -- to think about the long-haul transmission that becomes an adder, that certainly supports the long-term growth for the company."
