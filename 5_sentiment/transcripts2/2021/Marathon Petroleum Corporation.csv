I want to start by welcoming a couple new members to our executive team. First, in January, we announced the appointment of Maryann Mannen as our new CFO. She joins us having spent nearly a decade as the CFO in the energy services and manufacturing sectors. Maryann brings the financial acumen and strategic leadership expertise critical for delivering our business transformation objectives including strict capital discipline and overall expense management to lower our cost structure. I'm excited for the perspective and business insights she will add to our executive team as we work together to continue strengthening our financial and competitive positions.
Yesterday, we announced Brian has joined the company in our newly-executive role of Chief Commercial Officer. Brian has spent over 3 decades in the industry, his extensive commercial experience, his recent deep background in renewables and alternative energy and a track record of developing and enhancing capabilities is highly complementary to our strategic focus on improving our commercial performance. We look forward to his leadership in developing and implementing a holistic and integrated strategy for MPC's commercial business.
These additions will be integral in supporting our strategic initiatives as we progress through 2021 and beyond.
Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief business update. The unprecedented challenges this year created by the COVID pandemic, accelerated the need for us to act swiftly and decisively to change how we conduct our business. The 3 initiatives highlighted on this slide, focus on the aspects of our business within our control, strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. During the year, we've been faced with many tough decisions, but our team continues to make tangible progress at all 3 initiatives in ways we believe will drive stronger through-cycle earnings and position the company for long-term success.
Slide #5 highlights some of our actions taken around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we continue progressing the sale of the Speedway business. During the quarter, we responded to the second request from the FTC, and continued to support 7-Eleven in its efforts to secure antitrust clearance. Our interactions with 7-Eleven and our interactions with the FTC have gone well. As everyone is aware, the timing of the close is dependent on the FTC process, and we continue to target closing by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Within the scope of what we can control, we're finalizing transition services agreements with 7-Eleven and expect to have them completed by the end of February.
Moving on to other actions to reposition our portfolio we continue to advance our investments in renewables. During the quarter, we worked through startup issues and are ramping production at our Dickinson, North Dakota Renewables fuel facility. This facility is now the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States.
Consistent with the time line we discussed last quarter, we have begun to load trains and ship renewable diesel out of the facility. We remain on track to reach full production by the end of the quarter.
Since the last time we reported to you, we've also made excellent progress on our plans to convert our Martinez refinery into a renewable fuel facility. We've continued to progress engineering and permitting activities. We expect commissioning in the second half of 2022 with approximately 17,000 barrels per day of capacity. Further, we expect the pretreatment systems to be online in 2023 and to reach full capacity of approximately 48,000 barrels per day by the end of 2023.
Finally, we continue to exercise strict discipline on how capital and expense dollars are spent. This year, we accomplished our goal of significantly reducing our capital spending levels by over $1.4 billion from the initial 2021 plans. We also reduced our 2021 -- 2020 forecasted operating expenses by more than our target of $950 million.
I started off my comments by saying that we're focused on the things we can control, no matter what lies ahead, we're setting the company on a path to drive stronger through-cycle earnings and position the company for longer-term success.
I'd like to take a moment on Slide 6 to reinforce comments made on our last earnings call around priorities the proceeds from the sale of our Speedway business. We continue to receive questions on our use of proceeds framework. So I wanted to reiterate that our plans have not changed. We remain committed to using the sale proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet, and return capital to MPC shareholders. An important priority and our commitment is to defend a solid investment-grade credit profile.
On a mid-cycle basis, we expect to target MPC's stand-alone debt to EBITDA leverage metric of around 1x to 1.5x. This metric contemplates MPC earnings and also includes distributions from MPLX. Given the significant and stable distributions from MPLX and we don't envision an MPC balance sheet with less than $5 billion of debt on a through-cycle basis.
As a reminder, we also expect to increase the cash component of our core liquidity position by an additional $1 billion to offset the loss of cash flows from Speedway upon completion of the sale.
With respect to debt reduction, we have approximately $2.5 billion of debt that can be addressed with minimal friction costs. We'll be thoughtful on how we reduce incremental debt amounts to minimize costs while not jeopardizing our credit rating. Within this framework, we continue to expect that the remaining proceeds will be targeted for shareholder return. We continue to evaluate the form and timing, and we'll share more details as we get closer to the transaction close.
Moving to Slide 7. We highlight some of the reductions we've made to our cost structure. In refining, we've reduced our operating cost by more than $1 billion from the 2019 spending levels. In the Midstream business, we reduced our cost by over $200 million. And at the corporate level, we've applied the same discipline, and these reductions are reflected in our fourth quarter results.
We're pleased with these results when you consider we have not compromised on our commitment to safely operating our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and support the communities in which we operate. In fact, the full year 2020 was the company's best performance ever in this area, with a nearly 30% improvement across both our process and personal safety rates and our best ever environmental performance.
Moving to another key focus area. Slide 8 highlights our focus on capital discipline. Today, we announced our 2021 capital outlook for MPC. We significantly reduced our capital program from 2019 levels. MPC's investment plan now stands approximately $1.4 billion, excluding MPLX. This reflects a nearly $1.7 billion reduction from 2019 and a $1.2 billion reduction from our initial plans for 2020 prior to the pandemic.
Our 2021 outlook reflects funding for growth projects already underway. However, our incremental growth capital will be primarily focused on renewables and projects that we expect will help us reduce future operating costs.
We expect our team's focus on lowering our cost structure and capital discipline to be something that will be a recurring theme for 2021 and beyond.
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the fourth quarter results."

Slide 9 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.94. This reflects pretax adjustments of $851 million, driven primarily by a $1.2 billion pretax lower of cost or m",996,"Thanks, Mike. Slide 9 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.94. This reflects pretax adjustments of $851 million, driven primarily by a $1.2 billion pretax lower of cost or market inventory benefit. These adjustments can be found in detail on Slide 29 in the appendix.
Adjusted EBITDA was $907 million for the quarter, this include the results from both the continuing and discontinued operations. Our dividend payment for the quarter were $377 million.
Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was down $100 million quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by lower earnings in Refining and Marketing and Speedway. As a result of the contemplated sale of Speedway, both the third and fourth quarter results reflect Speedway as a discontinued operation.
Moving to our segment results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was negative $702 million, a decrease of approximately $80 million, when compared to the third quarter of 2020. As a result of the contemplated sale of Speedway, adjusted EBITDA for the R&M segment now includes the direct dealer business.
Crack spreads and margins remain under considerable pressure. Results across our 3 regions were impacted by weaker crack spreads and narrow crude differentials. As a result of these challenging macro conditions, we moderated throughput levels, which resulted in capacity utilization of 82% for the fourth quarter.
In response to these challenging conditions, the team continues to focus on structurally lowering cost and driving efficiencies. When you compare our R&M expense to the prior year, 2020 expenses are over $1 billion lower than 2019, and we continue to pursue opportunities to lower cost.
Slide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2020. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability, increasing by $22 million from the last quarter. This performance is underpinned by stable fee based revenues, growth from organic projects and the continued execution on operating expense reductions.
It is worth highlighting that MPLX, which contributes a substantial portion of MPC's Midstream EBITDA, inflected to excess cash for 2020 for the first time in the partnership's history self-funding, both capital spending and distributions. With this inflection, MPLX began repurchasing units in the fourth quarter.
Slide 13 provides an overview of Speedway results as a discontinued operation. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is down $66 million from third quarter. Fuel and merchandise revenues were impacted by seasonality as well as COVID related lower fuel demand and lower resulting foot traffic in the stores. On a year-over-year basis, merchandise sales were up 1.8%.
Slide 14 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. It reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $144 million in the quarter. Changes in working capital was an $804 million source of cash in the quarter. As rising commodity prices and increasing utilization continue to offset working capital cash use impacts from the first quarter.
During the quarter, debt declined $344 million. We returned $377 million to shareholders through our dividend. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter for both continuing and discontinued operations was approximately $555 million.
Slide 15 provides our capital investment plan for 2021, which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.4 billion. The plan includes just over $1 billion for the refining and marketing segment, of which approximately $250 million or roughly 25%, is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance spending.
Our growth capital is approximately $800 million, split between renewables and ongoing projects such as the STAR project. Keeping these ongoing projects moving forward will enhance the capability of our refining assets, particularly in the Gulf Coast. Within renewable spending, we have capital allocated for potential projects like our Martinez conversion.
Until close, we will fund Speedway capital and anticipate this spending will be approximately $150 million. The plan also includes approximately $50 million for our Midstream segment for projects such as the Capline reversal. Also included is approximately $150 million of corporate spending to support activities we believe will enhance our ability to lower future costs.
This morning, MPLX also announced its 2021 capital plan investment plan, which includes approximately $800 million of organic growth capital and $165 million of maintenance capital.
On Slide 16, we provide our first quarter outlook, which includes estimated throughput at our facilities-based on projected regional demand. We expect total throughput volumes of just over 2.5 million barrels per day, a slight increase compared to the fourth quarter actual throughput. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be $150 million in the first quarter, which includes activity in our Galveston Bay Refinery. For the year, we expect turnaround spending to come in at below our 2020 levels, reflecting a lighter than average year.
Total operating costs, including major maintenance, and engineered projects are projected to be $5.35 per barrel for the quarter. This operating expense guidance represents a slight increase from fourth quarter actuals to account for higher costs associated with work we plan to do in conjunction with our turnarounds.
Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the first quarter. This slight increase relative to fourth quarter actuals is due to cost associated with moving product to the West Coast from our new Dickinson renewable diesel facility. As a reminder, our Dickinson renewable facility is accounted for in the guidance we provided for the R&M segment.
For Speedway, we expect fuel volumes of approximately 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion gallons, and merchandise sales in a range of $1.43 billion to $1.53 billion.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Mike for some closing remarks."

I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. Last quarter, we discussed the recent publication of our 2020 climate perspectives report, highlighting opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also discussed our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and freshwater withdrawal intensities. It's important that we set objectives for the organization that drive our continuous improvement on ESG.
Our principles for leading and sustainable energy position us to deliver strong results in this space. From lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources to increasing renewable fuels production and embracing innovation and deploying advanced technologies. We believe the goals we are setting in our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve them, place Marathon at the leading edge of our industry. We are seeing recent improvements in our ESG ratings, reflecting our hard work in the area.
Slide 20 in the appendix highlights just some of these accomplishments. Our approach to sustainability also reflects our commitment to create shared value with our stakeholders, the communities where we operate, our people, our business partners and many others. How we conduct our business enhances the performance we deliver. We look forward to even further expanding our robust engagement with stakeholders and continuing to serve as a valued partner.

Hopefully, vaccinations will go smooth, and hopefully, we'll come out of this pandemic in a robust way. So that's kind of the bull view.
And then the bear case is, we saw towards the end of last year, cases were going up, restrictions started to kick in a little bit more. And we saw what a lot of people anticipated, which was a tough December and into January. Now we're approaching February and we'll head into the spring. So for us, there's a bull case that says things are moving in the right direction. There's a bear case that says we're not through with this pandemic yet, and we got some more field to play through before we really see the end of it.

As Mike said, we really need to get the immunization protocol built and as a country, accelerate that process to get more and more people comfortable. And then ultimately get schools back in session, get people back in the office, get people back on the roads, improve discretionary travel, and we think that's going to happen, but that may take some time. And I think we're going to be sort of patient over the course of the year to see that really bear fruit. But definitely better times ahead. We just think it's going to take a little bit of time to really see that.
I mean, we're -- for first quarter, I think, based on the year-over-year, we're probably going to be 90% of last year's volumes at the retail gasoline level. And again, hope to see improvement over the continued -- of the rest of 2021."

So first off, yes, we do believe that there is a paradigm shift occurring. I like the word energy evolution. So we see that occurring. And I guess, the momentum towards a low-carbon future is obvious. We're focused on how we position ourselves, as you mentioned. I felt that we had to get some things in line relative to cost and looking at our portfolio. But a focus on cost is essential in addition to a lower carbon intensity company to remain competitive for the long-term as these scenarios start to play themselves out.
As you mentioned, we have made a commitment in sustainable energy. And partly, that comes from lowering the carbon intensity of our assets and increasing our exposure in renewable fuels production. And we can talk about that in a lot more detail today, but we have our Dickinson facility up and running and Ray is working through the start-up there. And then we're still very optimistic about what Martinez can bring to us in that area. And then we're hopeful as technologies advance that we're on top of that and commercially and responsibly putting ourselves in a position for the future.
So I do agree with your belief that it is a paradigm shift. I do believe there's going to be increasing momentum towards low carbon. Obviously, everybody sees that occurring through the administration's announcements as well as many other companies coming out. And our goal is to stay focused on that change and put marathon in the best position to be a long-term player in that energy evolution."

I stated that throughout 2020 that we needed to make a step change. And in refining, particularly, Ray and his team have taken that and put some really good actions in place, so I'll let him comment in a second.
But overall, I think what you're seeing from us is trying to reset our overall cost structure, whether it's in the corporate area or midstream or refining, to your point, we do expect, over time, as we get past the pandemic for variable costs to come up a little bit. At the same time, we believe that many of the cost reductions that we have in place are structural, they're fixed cost in nature. Obviously, we're hopeful that we have more variable costs than at the demand for our products comes back up. But I think you've seen, over the last couple of quarters, a pretty sustainable step change, and that's what we're hoping to show the market.
As far as capital, Neil, what we're doing there is pivoting to what Doug just referred to as a new paradigm. We have a bunch of projects that are already in progress in refining that we'll continue to finish those out. Examples of that would be like the STAR project we have going on down in the Gulf Coast. That's an important project for us. That's still going to take some time to get through. But at the end of the day, we're going to do those projects that we think are in progress and are still valued. We're going to look for projects in refining that lower our cost going forward or change the dynamic we have around this energy evolution. And then obviously, pivot more into the renewable space. We have a bunch of things planned for both Dickinson and Martinez as kind of the first step in this energy evolution. Renewables is the hot topic, and I think we're in a real good position to put ourselves in a good spot there.
So Ray, do you have anything you want to add or?"

And this should be fairly consistent with what we talked about during the last earnings call. But for OpEx reductions in refining, it wasn't just 1 thing. It was a multitude of things. But if I had a key on 2 items, I would say the first is scrutinizing the number of people in our facilities. This is both contractors and employees. And just looking at the number of people we have, the number of projects we were working on and so forth and not just cutting people, but also consolidating contractor companies and really taking an efficiency look at that.
The other thing that we really wanted to do, and our procurement supply chain group did a phenomenal job of working with us, is making sure that we really leverage the spend across our 2.9 million barrel a day refining system. So looking at all of our contracts, goods and services and making sure that we just had the best terms and best contracts out there.
Just want to jump on to what Mike said earlier, too, is our goal is to make sure that these reductions are structural as possible. Early on in the pandemic, we did some deferral activity with turnarounds. But largely, that was to get out of the initial period of March, April, May time frame. But since then, we've caught up on our turnaround work. And going into this year, we'll do more of the same. So that's just a little bit more color on OpEx."

And Mike, I've asked this question so many times over the last couple of months. But can you just kind of walk through the waterfall again of -- you got $16.5 billion of cash coming in, plus another $1.2 billion or so from the government? And based on where your debt level is, what the sort of the ballpark ability to return capital to shareholders is so that framework?
So 2 questions there. Deal gating factors? And then and then return of capital framework?"

We're contributing where we can and as needed, but that's really a process between 7-Eleven and the FTC.What we know as of today contin",808,"Yes, Neil, on the first one, the major gating factor is the FTC process with 7-Eleven. so we're watching the process. We're contributing where we can and as needed, but that's really a process between 7-Eleven and the FTC.
What we know as of today continues to go well. And like I say, I use the word we're targeting for the end of Q1, or we're hopeful that the end of Q1 is the right timing. But really, the gating item is essentially that process that is not really -- our process, it's more 7-Eleven in the FTC. So we're supporting it where we can.
As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've responded to questions. We're supporting it as much as we can.
The other activities that we have to get accomplished, which we're very confident will get done is the transition services. Obviously, it's a major transaction between us and 7-Eleven, and there's some services that Marathon is going to transition to 7-Eleven over time. So that's been a lot of the internal work that we've been doing recently.
But the bottom line, and I know everybody keeps asking about use of proceeds. We're as anxious as anybody to get to that spot. But at the end of the day, the major gating item is we don't have control of that timing. All we can do is continue to give you the best insight we have. And right now, we still say, we're hopeful it's end of first quarter. We're targeting that. We think that's achievable based on what we know. So that's our best guidance at this point.
On your second issue, as far as the use of proceeds, we've tried as best we can to frame what we believe is the 2 main pillars that we're going to be targeting, which is getting the balance sheet back to where we want it to be and then return capital to our shareholders as quickly and as efficiently as we can.
And on the first issue, we've tried to make the statement that our debt situation maturities is there's about $2.5 billion that comes with essentially minimal friction costs. And we'll jump on that one right away. Right today, we have a little over $11 billion of debt. We'll continue to try and evaluate, as everybody wants to know, where is mid-cycle going to be, et cetera, et cetera. We need to work with the agencies. So our financial team, Maryanne and Tom and the treasury team will work with the agencies as to the proper path to bring that debt down to a level that we think is the right spot.
In an effort to try and give as much color as we can. We've kind of said to people that, ""hey, we don't see it going below $5 billion."" And that's kind of like our low refining case, if you want to call it that. So if you say in that regard, we have about a little over $11 billion. We don't see it going below $5 billion. So a number that put on the piece of paper is around $6 billion, depending on how well the recovery is and how quick the recovery is and working with the agencies, et cetera.
Absent that, we said we're going to return capital. We've talked about what's the best way to do that. And the only reason we don't give additional color there is because at least in our mind, what we believe right now is end of March is the targeted time frame. So we have another 60 days to go. And we'll continue to evaluate the market and the opportunities. And we've been going through this internally with our Board, with our advisers, with ourselves, and we have a pretty good framework, but we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves in case it takes a little longer than we're expecting.
So we do want to return that capital to shareholders. I personally am a believer that we're finding, to a large extent, as a return of capital business. We've got to position ourselves where we're generating cash and then think about the best way to create value returning it to shareholders. And we've talked about all the various ways to do that. It's predominantly in a buyback type mode. That's what we're thinking about. And then there's pros and cons to the various ways that you can do that. And then kind of our commitment is, once we get close enough that we know we're there, then we'll come on and publicly and give a little bit more color as to how we think that will affect itself. But our goal is as efficiently and as quickly and effectively as we can, we want to try and provide that return of capital."

I'm going to bleak on about the same issue on my first question, and I've got a follow-up on the macro for Ray, please. And it's really -- I wanted to do some very quick math with you and make sure I'm thinking about this right. So your market cap is about $30 billion. Your share of MPLX, 2/3 is about $16 billion. So let's assume in a sum of the parts basis. That means that the value recognized for everything else is about $14 billion, and you're potentially going to have a $10 billion share buyback program, if I net out $6 billion of debt paydown. Those are pretty enormous numbers, obviously.
So first of all, am I thinking about that right? And secondly, how exactly would you expect to deploy such a scale of a buyback, which, I guess, is Neil's question? And I'm thinking along the lines of like a bought deal, a direct regular acquisition of shares in the market. What are you actually thinking about structure and timing?

And I know you've asked a few times about, do we plan to use any of the proceeds towards MPLX. As I stated before, we don't see that as in the best interest. But we do see, to your point, returning that capital. And I think you've made the point, it is -- it will be a large sum of money. It will take some time to effectively do it efficiently, et cetera. So that's part of what we're kicking around. And a lot of things come into play. Where is the equity going to be when we actually go to do this, what's the best method, pros and cons, relative to that. So part of the reason that we don't get more detailed at this point, I just use this as the example, is when we announced the deal, we were trading in the 30s. Now we're trading in the -- around the mid-40s or so. And we'll see where we are in 60 days or whatever the timing turns out to be. Obviously, to your point, if you're trying to convince this we're undervalued, we're 100% aligned with you. We think that there's a lot of opportunity in our equity. But part of the process and looking at the pros and cons is where is that equity going to be by the time we get there? And what's the best way to actually go about doing things.
The debt side of it, I mentioned a little bit, that will be ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. We do want to protect our investment-grade rating. So that's important to us. We want to see how the pandemic continues to play itself out. As you heard Tim mentioned earlier, you're feeling good and then all the restrictions and things give you a little bit of a pause, but we're feeling pretty good about that as well. So taking that all into consideration is what we're thinking about.
And then to your point, it will be a large return of capital. It will definitely take some time. And when we get there, we'll give as much color as we can as to what we think at that time. And then there'll be some ongoing dialogue. To your point, the numbers are good, and we're happy that we're in that position. So we think we'll be able to affect a balance sheet adjustment that's really good for us. We think we'll be able to affect return of capital that's really good for us. It will take some time. And the only thing that we're holding out is the method and the timing because we'll have to wait and see when that time comes.
Hopefully, that helps. I'm trying my best to give you guys as much color as I can. But at the same time, try not to get ahead of where we're going to be when we actually receive the proceeds."

That's very comforting on our side. Kidding comment for the day.
Yes, to kick back into some of the stuff that's been asked and maybe to dig a little deeper on a couple of things. First off, I think Doug Terreson mentioned on the crack spreads. But as we know, at least part of the move in the crack spreads here has been RINs related. And I know with the separation of speed, where you're retaining the RINs inside of the R&M segment. And I was just curious how you're looking at the impact of the increase in the RINs costs and then how we should think about that flowing through the company now that we're going to have -- or, I guess, essentially, already have the separation in terms of how it comes through?"

It's an element of our industry, but RIN costs are also very transparent day in and day out. So we really believe the full consideration is given really across the entire value chain. When you look at refiners, ethanol producers, blenders, marketers that sit in the value chain and establishing daily prices. So that's not to say that it's ""in the crack."" I think empirically, that's very difficult to point to, no different than hydrogen cost or catalyst cost being in the crack. But it's a very transparent element in the value chain that we believe is fully considered in the commercial tension across all the various players that we mentioned.
Specific to Speedway, yes, absolutely 0 impact. I mean we've always treated Speedway as a third-party customer and our contracts across our entire book really give full consideration for rent costs in value. But so really no impact, no shift in value when you think about between segments as a result of the separation.
The last point to make on this really is across our entire book, we have extensive terminal network and a pretty robust marketing platform, the least of which is the Speedway book of business. So historically -- or near historically, the last couple of years, 70% to 75% of our RFS obligation has been met really, through wet blending. With Dickinson, you can add roughly another 10% of that, and you can keep doing the math in the Martinez. So we're quickly approaching 100%. So we feel like historically, we've positioned well on this issue, we're positioned right today, and we're going to be positioned even better into the future."

So on the cost, we've made a significant move, as you noted. We're going to challenge ourselves in '21 and beyond to continue to look at each part of our portfolio and where we're spending money, whether it's in refining or on the corporate side, et cetera. So I don't want to ever say that we're done. At the same time, I do appreciate acknowledging that it was a pretty significant move. I mean, we decided -- when I put out the initiatives that costs would be a major part of what we were doing in 2020. So that's why it got a lot of attention but it continues on, right? It's not something that's over just because we've come to the end of the year or whatever. So I'll let Ray comment a little bit more on refining.
And then on your second question, relative to commercial and systems. I mean one of the things if you look at in our disclosure on capital is we are spending some money at the corporate level to try and improve ourselves from a digital standpoint. Doug mentioned, we're moving into a low-carbon future. The business has also become much more strategic from a digital standpoint. And our new Chief Digital Officer has a lot of good thoughts that will help our commercial teams advance the ball. So we're going to try and deploy capital in that regard and put ourselves in a much better position from an information standpoint so that we can act on it better commercially.
But I'll let Ray jump in. And Brian, if he wants to add something there."

What I'll tell you is with $1 billion of cost taken out of the system. We took a big bite out of the apple in 2020. But what I'll tell you is that the culture is there. It's as far as questioning everything we do, whether it's a person replacement, whether it's a project need to do or whatever. There's definitely the mentality in refining to question everything that we do from a cost standpoint.
The one thing that I want to emphasize, though, is the one thing that's not in play is anything that would impact the safety or environmental performance of our refineries. Mike, in his opening comments, talked about 2020 being the safe and best environmental performance that we had. So that always is a key thing. But our team really is questioning everything we do beyond that."

Just to answer your question on people and systems and commercial opportunity. The short answer is absolutely, yes. I mean we've gone through a massive transformation over the last several months realigning on the clean product side of the business, our marketing, supply and trading, our international book as well into 1 unified organization. So I think just org structure alone will help -- has helped unleashed opportunities. As Mike indicated, we're spending quite a bit of time building out for a massive system to integrate the back office, and that's in-flight and underway. And really long term, see great potential. And we're starting to see the benefits of that already. And when we think about commercial performance, it's not just revenue, it's looking at the expense and distribution costs, as you called out earlier, inventory positions as well. So it's really the full deployment of capital across the value chain, not just on the revenue side.
But I'm extraordinarily encouraged with where we're at, and we're really pivoting Paul, to be quite honest with you, from really a legacy of more of an operational focus with refinings over the last decade, running full capacity and utilizing physical infrastructure and arbs to maximize value to the system that we're in today, which is requiring a little different playbook and more commerciality. So we're excited to work with the team to bring that all to bear, and we're seeing benefits already. We'll continue to build on that here over the next year."

So some of those are going to go in '21 into '22. So that's ongoing. As far as investment in refining, asking Ray to look at ideas that reduce cost and put ourselves in a position for a low-carbon future. So energy intensity, as an example, is something that still matters a lot in the energy evolution. Looking at putting ourselves in a position where we check both of those boxes of cost and carbon emission reductions, et cetera, are going to be top of mind for us. At the same time, we're pivoting to investment into renewables in some of the other areas, which will give you some more color as time goes on. But I think that's the general philosophy of it.
As far as the absolute spend, we'll obviously give guidance as we progress. But I think just in general, I think that's the philosophy that you should be thinking about.
And it kind of started off with the way Doug asked the question. We do think there's a paradigm shift occurring, and our reaction to that is get our costs down, be very conscious of the new environment, trying to check off 2 birds with 1 stone, put ourselves portfolio wise in a position where our refining assets are in a good spot for many decades to come, that's obviously a goal for us, and position ourselves as the products we're making are what the demand in the market is. So that's kind of our overall philosophy, and we'll continue to challenge what we're doing in that area. And I -- we tried to give you a little bit more color with that breakdown of capital. So hopefully, that helps people get a sense of what we're thinking philosophy wise."

So one of the things, Benny, that I think everybody is obviously trying to understand is what does the supply-demand look like post pandemic. And we obviously are seeing in the short term, the demand reduction, supply rationalizations in progress. But how that all plays itself out at the end of the day is still an unknown. We tend to -- like I said earlier, we look at the banks of the river. We anticipated some challenges on the supply demand coming into the decade. That's part of the reason why we wanted to focus on cost reductions.
But the question of where does the supply demand end up after the pandemic, after the demand settles to a new normal, wherever that's going to be, after the rationalization settles out to where that's going to be, I think that's still the question that we're all trying to get our arms around.
For us, like I keep saying is we're trying to look at it from a bank to the river standpoint. And then we'll assess it as time goes on. I don't know if any -- if you guys have anything to add. They're shaking their heads. So I think that's the best we can give you at this point."

So I wanted to take a big picture view. Ultimately, how do you think about your ambitions here? And would you think about, at some point, maybe as we go forward, holding that out either as a separate earnings stream or a separate segment? I think some of the peers in the space are starting to allude to or are starting to do that, helping sort of analysts and investors to quantify that and sort of gauge where the progress is. So that's my first question. And within that to sort of a tag along is on the carbon capture. I know you talked about carbonation reduction and energy intensity earlier in this call.

As you know, we just started uptick and since, so we don't even have a full quarter yet. So once we get Dickinson up and running and are generating results, and then we have Martinez coming behind that, then we'll have more of a significant discussion point on actual results as opposed to where we are today, which is anticipating those results.
So I can see that at some point. I would say one of the things that we've worked with Christine and our team on is trying to be very consistent, so people can get a good insight into the things that we're doing today. But at some point in the future, I think you could see some changes from us, and we'll give you, obviously, a heads up when we're thinking of doing that.
Second question was -- yes, carbon capture, and I'll let Ray jump in on this as well. I mean, right now, in all of the areas of low-carbon future or climate areas, there's a lot of things on the plate. Obviously, renewable diesel, as you mentioned, is kind of at the top of the list because we're executing on that as we speak. But there's a lot of different items that we haven't talked a lot about. Technologies, different areas that we think we can drive our carbon footprint down. And there's different ways whether it's capture or many other areas that we have on the radar screen, and we're looking at it. We want to make sure that what we're thinking about is economical for us, going to create value for the shareholders. Like I said, if we can hit 2 birds with 1 stone, that's the best of all worlds. So I'll let Ray comment specifically on capture."

We look forward to his leadership in developing and implementing a holistic and integrated strategy for MPC's commercial business. These additions will be integral in supporting our strategic initiatives as we progress through 2021 and beyond.
Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief business update. The unprecedented challenges this year created by the COVID pandemic accelerated the need for us to act swiftly and decisively to change how we conduct our business. The 3 initiatives highlighted on this slide focus on the aspects of our business within our control, strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. During the year, we've been faced with many tough decisions, but our team continues to make tangible progress on all 3 initiatives in ways we believe will drive stronger through-cycle earnings and position the company for long-term success.
Slide #5 highlights some of our actions taken around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we continue progressing the sale of the Speedway business. During the quarter, we responded to the second request from the FTC and continued to support 7-Eleven in its efforts to secure antitrust clearance. Our interactions with 7-Eleven and our interactions with the FTC have gone well. As everyone is aware, the timing of the close is dependent on the FTC process, and we continue to target closing by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Within the scope of what we can control, we're finalizing transition services agreements with 7-Eleven and expect to have them completed by the end of February.
Moving on to other actions to reposition our portfolio, we continue to advance our investments in renewables. During the quarter, we worked through start-up issues and are ramping production at our Dickinson, North Dakota renewable fuels facility. This facility is now the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States. Consistent with the time line we discussed last quarter, we have begun to load trains and ship renewable diesel out of the facility. We remain on track to reach full production by the end of the quarter.
Since the last time we reported to you, we've also made excellent progress on our plans to convert our Martinez refinery into a renewable fuels facility. We've continued to progress engineering and permitting activities. We expect commissioning in the second half of 2022 with approximately 17,000 barrels per day of capacity. Further, we expect the pretreatment system to be online in 2023 and to reach full capacity of approximately 48,000 barrels per day by the end of 2023.
Finally, we continue to exercise strict discipline on how capital and expense dollars are spent. This year, we accomplished our goal of significantly reducing our capital spending levels by over $1.4 billion from the initial 2021 plans. We also reduced our 2020 forecasted operating expenses by more than our target of $950 million.
I started off my comments by saying that we're focused on the things we can control. No matter what lies ahead, we're setting the company on a path to drive stronger through-cycle earnings and position the company for longer-term success. I'd like to take a moment on Slide 6 to reinforce comments made on our last earnings call around priorities for the proceeds from the sale of our Speedway business. We continue to receive questions on our use of proceeds framework, so I wanted to reiterate that our plans have not changed. We remain committed to using the sale proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to MPC shareholders.
An important priority and our commitment is to defend a solid investment-grade credit profile. On a mid-cycle basis, we expect to target MPC's stand-alone debt to EBITDA leverage metric of around 1x to 1.5x. This metric contemplates MPC earnings and also includes distributions from MPLX. Given the significant and stable distributions from MPLX, we don't envision an MPC balance sheet with less than $5 billion of debt on a through-cycle basis. As a reminder, we also expect to increase the cash component of our core liquidity position by an additional $1 billion to offset the loss of cash flows from Speedway upon completion of the sale.
With respect to debt reduction, we have approximately $2.5 billion of debt that can be addressed with minimal friction costs. We'll be thoughtful on how we reduce incremental debt amounts to minimize costs while not jeopardizing our credit rating. Within this framework, we continue to expect that the remaining proceeds will be targeted for shareholder return. We continue to evaluate the form and timing, and we'll share more details as we get closer to the transaction close.
Moving to Slide 7, we highlight some of the reductions we've made to our cost structure. In Refining, we've reduced our operating cost by more than $1 billion from the 2019 spending levels. In the Midstream business, we reduced our cost by over $200 million. And at the corporate level, we've applied the same discipline, and these reductions are reflected in our fourth quarter results.
We're pleased with these results when you consider we have not compromised on our commitment to safely operating our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and support the communities in which we operate. In fact, the full year 2020 was the company's best performance ever in this area, with a nearly 30% improvement across both our process and personal safety rates and our best ever environmental performance.
Moving to another key focus area, Slide 8 highlights our focus on capital discipline. Today, we announced our 2021 capital outlook for MPC. We significantly reduced our capital program from 2019 levels. MPC's investment plan now stands approximately $1.4 billion, excluding MPLX. This reflects a nearly $1.7 billion reduction from 2019 and a $1.2 billion reduction from our initial plan for 2020 prior to the pandemic.
Our 2021 outlook reflects funding for growth projects already underway. However, our incremental growth capital will be primarily focused on renewables and projects that we expect will help us reduce future operating costs. We expect our team's focus on lowering our cost structure and capital discipline to be something that will be a recurring theme for 2021 and beyond.
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the fourth quarter results."

This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.94. This reflects pretax adjustments of $851 million, driven primarily by a $1.2 billion pretax lower of cost or",995,"Thanks, Mike.
Slide 9 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.94. This reflects pretax adjustments of $851 million, driven primarily by a $1.2 billion pretax lower of cost or market inventory benefit. These adjustments can be found in detail on Slide 29 in the appendix. Adjusted EBITDA was $907 million for the quarter. This include the results from both the continuing and discontinued operations. Our dividend payment for the quarter were $377 million.
Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was down $100 million quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by lower earnings in Refining and Marketing and Speedway. As a result of the contemplated sale of Speedway, both the third and fourth quarter results reflect Speedway as a discontinued operation.
Moving to our segment results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segment. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was negative $702 million, a decrease of approximately $80 million when compared to the third quarter of 2020. As a result of the contemplated sale of Speedway, adjusted EBITDA for the R&M segment now includes the direct dealer business.
Crack spreads and margins remain under considerable pressure. Results across our 3 regions were impacted by weaker crack spreads and narrow crude differentials. As a result of these challenging macro conditions, we moderated throughput levels, which resulted in capacity utilization of 82% for the fourth quarter. In response to these challenging conditions, the team continues to focus on structurally lowering cost and driving efficiencies. When you compare our R&M expense to the prior year, 2020 expenses are over $1 billion lower than 2019, and we continue to pursue opportunities to lower cost.
Slide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2020. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability, increasing by $22 million from the last quarter. This performance is underpinned by stable fee-based revenues, growth from organic projects and the continued execution on operating expense reductions. It is worth highlighting that MPLX, which contributes a substantial portion of MPC's Midstream EBITDA, inflected to excess cash for 2020 for the first time in the partnership's history, self-funding both capital spending and distributions. With this inflection, MPLX began repurchasing units in the fourth quarter.
Slide 13 provides an overview of Speedway results as a discontinued operation. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is down $66 million from third quarter. Fuel and merchandise revenues were impacted by seasonality as well as COVID-related lower fuel demand and lower resulting foot traffic in the stores. On a year-over-year basis, merchandise sales were up 1.8%.
Slide 14 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. It reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $144 million in the quarter. Changes in working capital was an $804 million source of cash in the quarter as rising commodity prices and increasing utilization continue to offset working capital cash use impacts from the first quarter. During the quarter, debt declined $344 million. We returned $377 million to shareholders through our dividend. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter for both continuing and discontinued operations was approximately $555 million.
Slide 15 provides our capital investment plan for 2021, which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.4 billion. The plan includes just over $1 billion for the Refining and Marketing segment, of which approximately $250 million or roughly 25% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance spending.
Our growth capital is approximately $800 million, split between renewables and ongoing projects such as the STAR project. Keeping these ongoing projects moving forward will enhance the capability of our refining assets, particularly in the Gulf Coast. Within renewables spending, we have capital allocated for potential projects like our Martinez conversion.
Until close, we will fund Speedway capital and anticipate this spending will be approximately $150 million. The plan also includes approximately $50 million for our Midstream segment for projects such as the Capline reversal. Also included is approximately $150 million of corporate spending to support activities we believe will enhance our ability to lower future costs. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2021 capital plan, investment plan, which includes approximately $800 million of organic growth capital and $165 million of maintenance capital.
On Slide 16, we provide our first quarter outlook, which includes estimated throughput at our facilities based on projected regional demand. We expect total throughput volumes of just over 2.5 million barrels per day, a slight increase compared to the fourth quarter actual throughput.
Planned turnaround costs are projected to be $150 million in the first quarter, which includes activity in our Galveston Bay refinery. For the year, we expect turnaround spending to come in at below our 2020 levels, reflecting a lighter than average year.
Total operating costs, including major maintenance and engineered projects, are projected to be $5.35 per barrel for the quarter. This operating expense guidance represents a slight increase from fourth quarter actuals to account for higher costs associated with work we plan to do in conjunction with our turnarounds.
Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the first quarter. This slight increase relative to fourth quarter actuals is due to cost associated with moving product to the West Coast from our new Dickinson renewable diesel facility. As a reminder, our Dickinson renewable facility is accounted for in the guidance we provided for the R&M segment.
For Speedway, we expect fuel volumes of approximately 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion gallons, and merchandise sales in a range of $1.43 billion to $1.53 billion.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Mike for some closing remarks."

I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership.
Last quarter, we discussed the recent publication of our 2020 climate perspectives report, highlighting opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also discussed our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and freshwater withdrawal intensities. It's important that we set objectives for the organization that drive our continuous improvement on ESG. Our principles for leading in sustainable energy position us to deliver strong results in this space, from lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency and conserving natural resources, to increasing renewable fuels production and embracing innovation and deploying advanced technologies. We believe the goals we are setting and our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve them place Marathon at the leading edge of our industry. We are seeing recent improvements in our ESG ratings, reflecting our hard work in the area. Slide 20 in the appendix highlights just some of these accomplishments.
Our approach to sustainability also reflects our commitment to create shared value with our stakeholders, the communities where we operate, our people, our business partners and many others. How we conduct our business enhances the performance we deliver. We look forward to even further expanding our robust engagement with stakeholders and continuing to serve as a valued partner.

And then the bear case is, we saw towards the end of last year, cases were going up, restrictions started to kick in a little bit more. And we saw what a lot of people anticipated, which was a tough December and into January. Now we're approaching February and we'll head into the spring.
So for us, there's a bull case that says things are moving in the right direction. There's a bear case that says we're not through with this pandemic yet, and we got some more field to play through before we really see the end of it.

And then ultimately get schools back in session, get people back in the office, get people back on the roads, improve discretionary travel, and we think that's going to happen, but that may take some time.

And I guess, the momentum towards a low-carbon future is obvious. We're focused on how we position ourselves, as you mentioned. I felt that we had to get some things in line relative to cost and looking at our portfolio. But a focus on cost is essential in addition to a lower carbon intensity company to remain competitive for the long term as these scenarios start to play themselves out.
As you mentioned, we have made a commitment in sustainable energy. And partly, that comes from lowering the carbon intensity of our assets and increasing our exposure in renewable fuels production. And we can talk about that in a lot more detail today, but we have our Dickinson facility up and running and Ray is working through the start-up there. And then we're still very optimistic about what Martinez can bring to us in that area. And then we're hopeful as technologies advance that we're on top of that and commercially and responsibly putting ourselves in a position for the future.
So I do agree with your belief that it is a paradigm shift. I do believe there's going to be increasing momentum towards low carbon.

I stated that throughout 2020 that we needed to make a step change. And in refining, particularly, Ray and his team have taken that and put some really good actions in place, so I'll let him comment in a second.
But overall, I think what you're seeing from us is trying to reset our overall cost structure, whether it's in the corporate area or midstream or refining. To your point, we do expect, over time, as we get past the pandemic for variable costs to come up a little bit. At the same time, we believe that many of the cost reductions that we have in place are structural. They're fixed cost in nature. Obviously, we're hopeful that we have more variable costs and that the demand for our products comes back up. But I think you've seen over the last couple of quarters a pretty sustainable step change, and that's what we were hoping to show the market.
As far as capital, Neil, what we're doing there is pivoting to what Doug just referred to as a new paradigm. We have a bunch of projects that are already in progress in refining that we'll continue to finish those out. Examples of that would be like the STAR project we have going on down in the Gulf Coast. That's an important project for us. That's still going to take some time to get through. But at the end of the day, we're going to do those projects that we think are in progress and are still valued. We're going to look for projects in refining that lower our cost going forward or change the dynamic we have around this energy evolution. And then obviously, pivot more into the renewable space. We have a bunch of things planned for both Dickinson and Martinez as kind of the first step in this energy evolution. Renewables is the hot topic, and I think we're in a real good position to put ourselves in a good spot there. So Ray, do you have anything you want to add or?"

And this should be fairly consistent with what we talked about during the last earnings call. But for OpEx reductions in refining, it wasn't just one thing. It was a multitude of things. But if I had to key on 2 items, I would say the first is scrutinizing the number of people in our facilities. This is both contractors and employees. And just looking at the number of people we have, the number of projects we were working on and so forth and not just cutting people, but also consolidating contractor companies and really taking an efficiency look at that.
The other thing that we really wanted to do, and our procurement, the supply chain group did a phenomenal job of working with us, is making sure that we really leverage the spend across our 2.9 million barrel a day refining system. So looking at all of our contracts, goods and services and making sure that we just had the best terms and best contracts out there.
Just want to jump on to what Mike said earlier, too, is our goal is to make sure that these reductions are structural as possible. Early on in the pandemic, we did some deferral activity with turnarounds. But largely, that was to get out of the initial period of March, April, May time frame. But since then, we've caught up on our turnaround work. And going into this year, we'll do more of the same. So that's just a little bit more color on OpEx."

The other activities that we have to get accomplished, which we're very confident will get done is the transition services.

But at the end of the day, the major gating item is we don't have control of that timing. All we can do is continue to give you the best insight we have. And right now, we still say, we're hopeful it's end of first quarter. We're targeting that. We think that's achievable based on what we know. So that's our best guidance at this point.
On your second issue, as far as the use of proceeds, we've tried as best we can to frame what we believe is the 2 main pillars that we're going to be targeting, which is getting the balance sheet back to where we want it to be and then return capital to our shareholders as quickly and as efficiently as we can. And on the first issue, we've tried to make the statement that our debt situation maturities is, there's about $2.5 billion that comes with essentially minimal friction costs. And we'll jump on that one right away. Right today, we have a little over $11 billion of debt. We'll continue to try and evaluate, as everybody wants to know, where is mid-cycle going to be, et cetera, et cetera. We need to work with the agencies. So our financial team, Maryann and Tom, and the treasury team will work with the agencies as to the proper path to bring that debt down to a level that we think is the right spot.
In an effort to try and give as much color as we can, we've kind of said to people that, hey, we don't see it going below $5 billion. And that's kind of like our low refining case, if you want to call it that. So if you say in that regard, we have about a little over $11 billion. We don't see it going below $5 billion. So a number to put on the piece of paper is around $6 billion, depending on how well the recovery is and how quick the recovery is and working with the agencies, et cetera.
Absent that, we said we're going to return capital. We've talked about what's the best way to do that. And the only reason we don't give additional color there is because at least in our mind, what we believe right now is end of March is the targeted time frame. So we have another 60 days to go. And we'll continue to evaluate the market and the opportunities. And we've been going through this internally with our Board, with our advisers, with ourselves, and we have a pretty good framework, but we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves in case it takes a little longer than we're expecting.
So we do want to return that capital to shareholders. I personally am a believer that refining, to a large extent, is a return of capital business. We've got to position ourselves where we're generating cash and then think about the best way to create value returning it to shareholders. And we've talked about all the various ways to do that. It's predominantly in a buyback type mode. That's what we're thinking about. And then there's pros and cons to the various ways that you can do that. And then kind of our commitment is, once we get close enough that we know we're there, then we'll come on publicly and give a little bit more color as to how we think that will effect itself. But our goal is, as efficiently and as quickly and effectively as we can, we want to try and provide that return of capital."

I'm going to bleak on about the same issue with my first question, and I've got a follow-up on the macro for Ray, please. And it's really, I wanted to do some very quick math with you and make sure I'm thinking about this right. So your market cap is about $30 billion. Your share of MPLX, 2/3 is about $16 billion. So let's assume in a sum of the parts basis, that means that the value recognized for everything else is about $14 billion, and you're potentially going to have a $10 billion share buyback program, if I net out $6 billion of debt paydown. Those are pretty enormous numbers, obviously.
So first of all, am I thinking about that right? And secondly, how exactly would you expect to deploy such a scale of a buyback, which, I guess, is Neil's question? And I'm thinking along the lines of like a bought deal, a direct regular acquisition of shares in the market. What are you actually thinking about structure and timing because those numbers are obviously pretty significant when you look at it that way."

Doug, first of all, I don't hate you for asking the question. It's a fair question. And I know you've asked a few times about, do we plan to use any of the proceeds towards MPLX.

And I know you've asked a few times about, do we plan to use any of the proceeds towards MPLX. As I stated before, we don't see that as in the best interest. But we do see, to your point, returning that capital. And I think you've made the point, it will be a large sum of money. It will take some time to effectively do it efficiently, et cetera. So that's part of what we're kicking around.
And a lot of things come into play. Where is the equity going to be when we actually go to do this, what's the best method, pros and cons, relative to that? So part of the reason that we don't get more detailed at this point, I just use this as the example is, when we announced the deal, we were trading in the $30s. Now we're trading around the mid-$40s or so. And we'll see where we are in 60 days or whatever the timing turns out to be. Obviously, to your point, if you're trying to convince us we're undervalued, we're 100% aligned with you. We think that there's a lot of opportunity in our equity. But part of the process in looking at the pros and cons is, where is that equity going to be by the time we get there and what's the best way to actually go about doing things?
The debt side of it, I mentioned a little bit, that will be ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. We do want to protect our investment-grade rating. So that's important to us. We want to see how the pandemic continues to play itself out. As you heard Tim mentioned earlier, you're feeling good and then all the restrictions and things give you a little bit of a pause, but we're feeling pretty good about that as well. So taking that all into consideration is what we're thinking about.
And then to your point, it will be a large return of capital. It will definitely take some time. And when we get there, we'll give as much color as we can as to what we think at that time. And then there'll be some ongoing dialogue. To your point, the numbers are good, and we're happy that we're in that position. So we think we'll be able to effect a balance sheet adjustment that's really good for us. We think we'll be able to effect return of capital that's really good for us. It will take some time. And the only thing that we're holding out is the method and the timing because we'll have to wait and see when that time comes.
Hopefully, that helps. I'm trying my best to give you guys as much color as I can. But at the same time, try not to get ahead of where we're going to be when we actually receive the proceeds."

It's an element of our industry, but RIN costs are also very transparent day in and day out. So we really believe the full consideration is given really across the entire value chain when you look at refiners, ethanol producers, blenders, marketers that sit in the value chain and establishing daily prices. So that's not to say that it's ""in the crack."" I think empirically, that's very difficult to point to, no different than hydrogen cost or catalyst cost being in the crack. But it's a very transparent element in the value chain that we believe is fully considered in the commercial tension across all the various players that we mentioned.
Specific to Speedway, yes, absolutely 0 impact. I mean we've always treated Speedway as a third-party customer and our contracts across our entire book really give full consideration for RIN costs in value. But so really no impact, no shift in value when you think about between segments as a result of the separation.
The last point to make on this really is across our entire book, we have extensive terminal network and a pretty robust marketing platform, the least of which is the Speedway book of business. So historically or near historically, the last couple of years, 70% to 75% of our RFS obligation has been met really through wet blending. With Dickinson, you can add roughly another 10% of that, and you can keep doing the math into Martinez. So we're quickly approaching 100%. So we feel like historically, we've positioned well on this issue, we're positioned great today, and we're going to be positioned even better into the future."

So that's the first question.
The second question is probably for Mike and Brian. Brian, I mean, if we look at your old firm, they are far more aggressive in their commercial trading and everything. So when we're looking at Marathon, do you have the right system in place and also the right personnel for your organization or that, that really is only the first step and you're going to take some time for you to build it out?

I mean, we decided, when I put out the 3 initiatives, that costs would be a major part of what we were doing in 2020. So that's why it got a lot of attention but it continues on, right? It's not something that's over just because we've come to the end of the year or whatever. So I'll let Ray comment a little bit more on refining.
And then on your second question, relative to commercial and systems. I mean one of the things if you look at in our disclosure on capital is we are spending some money at the corporate level to try and improve ourselves from a digital standpoint. Doug mentioned, we're moving into a low-carbon future. The business has also become much more strategic from a digital standpoint. And our new Chief Digital Officer has a lot of good thoughts that will help our commercial teams advance the ball.

What I'll tell you is, with $1 billion of cost taken out of the system, we took a big bite out of the apple in 2020. But what I'll tell you is that the culture is there as far as questioning everything we do, whether it's a person replacement, whether it's a project need to do or whatever. There's definitely the mentality in refining to question everything that we do from a cost standpoint.
The one thing that I want to emphasize, though, is the one thing that's not in play is anything that would impact the safety or environmental performance of our refineries. Mike, in his opening comments, talked about 2020 being the safest and best environmental performance that we had. So that always is a key thing, but our team really is questioning everything we do beyond that."

Just to answer your question on people and systems and commercial opportunity. The short answer is absolutely, yes. I mean, we've gone through a massive transformation over the last several months realigning on the clean product side of the business our marketing, supply and trading, our international book as well into one unified organization. So I think just org structure alone has helped unleash opportunities. As Mike indicated, we're spending quite a bit of time building out for a massive system to integrate the back office, and that's in-flight and underway and really long term see great potential. And we're starting to see the benefits of that already.
And when we think about commercial performance, it's not just revenue, it's looking at the expense and distribution costs, as you called out earlier, inventory positions as well. So it's really the full deployment of capital across the value chain, not just on the revenue side, but I'm extraordinarily encouraged with where we're at. And we're really pivoting Paul, to be quite honest with you, from really a legacy of more of an operational focus with refining over the last decade running full capacity and utilizing physically the infrastructure and arbs to maximize value, to the system that we're in today, which is requiring a little different playbook and more commerciality. So we're excited to work with the team to bring that all to bear, and we're seeing benefits already. We'll continue to build on that here over the next year."

On capital, we're not giving guidance beyond that, but I can give you my general philosophy is, like I mentioned earlier, we're going to obviously finish the projects that we have in progress. So some of those are going to go in '21, into '22. So that's ongoing.
As far as investment in refining, asking Ray to look at ideas that reduce cost and put ourselves in a position for a low-carbon future. So energy intensity, as an example, is something that still matters a lot in the energy evolution. Looking at putting ourselves in a position where we check both of those boxes of cost and carbon emission reductions, et cetera, are going to be top of mind for us. At the same time, we're pivoting to investment into renewables in some of the other areas, which we'll give you some more color as time goes on. But I think that's the general philosophy of it.
As far as the absolute spend, we'll obviously give guidance as we progress. But I think just in general, I think that's the philosophy that you should be thinking about. And it kind of started off with the way Doug asked the question. We do think there's a paradigm shift occurring. And our reaction to that is, get our costs down, be very conscious of the new environment, trying to check off 2 birds with 1 stone, put ourselves portfolio-wise in a position where our refining assets are in a good spot for many decades to come, that's obviously a goal for us, and position ourselves that the products we're making are what the demand in the market is.
So that's kind of our overall philosophy, and we'll continue to challenge what we're doing in that area. And we tried to give you a little bit more color with that breakdown of capital. So hopefully, that helps people get a sense of what we're thinking philosophy-wise."

And we obviously are seeing in the short term the demand reduction, supply rationalizations in progress. But how that all plays itself out at the end of the day is still an unknown. We tend to, like I said earlier, we look at the banks of the river. We anticipated some challenges on the supply/demand coming into the decade. That's part of the reason why we wanted to focus on cost reductions.
But the question of where does the supply/demand end up after the pandemic, after the demand settles to a new normal, wherever that's going to be, after the rationalization settles out to where that's going to be, I think that's still the question that we're all trying to get our arms around. For us, like I keep saying is, we try to look at it from a banks of the river standpoint. And then we'll assess it as time goes on. I don't know if you guys have anything to add.

So that's my first question. And within that too, sort of a tag along is on the carbon capture. I know you've talked about carbon emission reduction and energy intensity earlier in this call.

Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. 
During the first quarter, our industry continued to struggle with a reduction in global economic activity and demand for transportation fuels that resulted from the mobility restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic. As we started the second quarter with the rollout of vaccination, we still see industry-wide gasoline demand down around 5% from historical levels and jet demand down around 25% to 30%. To the extent that a pent-up desire to travel starts to brighten the macro outlook for our business, our team and our assets are poised to take advantage of these opportunities. But in the meantime, as the challenging backdrop holds, we'll continue to concentrate on the elements of our business that are within our control. 
Our near-term priorities remain the same. Each quarter, we're focused on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. Slide 4 highlights some of our actions around our strategic priorities this quarter. 
First, we're close to completion on the sale of our Speedway business. Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Our Board of Directors approved our plans to convert our Martinez asset to a 48,000 barrel per day renewable facility. We expect commissioning of Martinez to begin in the second half of 2022 with approximately 17,000 barrels per day of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 48,000 barrels a day by the end of '23. 
In line with our commitment to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, we're planning to install wind turbine generators at Dickinson facility. Sourcing electricity from wind will lower the carbon intensity of the renewable diesel product at that facility. We'll continue to seek out the right opportunities for investing and partnering on renewables' evolving technologies. Finally, we also continue to exercise strict discipline on how capital and expense dollars are spent. In this quarter, we were able to hold refining operating expenses roughly flat with the prior quarter. 
I'd like to take a moment on Slide 5 to reinforce our priorities for the proceeds from the sale of our Speedway business. As we approach the close of the transaction, we've appreciated the continued dialogue we've had with many of you. We remain committed to use the Speedway sale proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to MPC shareholders. 
An important priority is our commitment to maintain a solid investment-grade credit profile. As we said before, we intend to maintain an appropriate level of leverage for this business. And recently, Fitch affirmed our investment-grade credit rating at BBB and improved the outlook for our MPC from negative to stable. 
With respect to debt reduction, we previously indicated $2.5 billion of debt that could be retired with minimal friction costs. We've repaid approximately $2.1 billion, as is announced since October, by issuing commercial paper, which we intend to pay down immediately with the proceeds from the Speedway sale. We'll be thoughtful on how to reduce our debt to minimize costs while not jeopardizing our investment-grade credit rating. 
Within this framework of maintaining a solid balance sheet, we expect the remaining proceeds will be targeted for shareholder return, and we plan to announce more details around these plans in conjunction with the closing of the transaction. 
Slide 6 demonstrates our execution around lowering our cost structure. Our refining and corporate cost results this quarter illustrate the impact of the team's commitment to cost discipline. And while rising utilization will bring variable costs as volume increase, we believe that the structural cost reductions we have made are sustainable. 
While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, we have not compromised on our commitment to safely operating our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. As you may recall, 2020 was the company's best performance ever in the area, with nearly 30% improvement across both process and personal safety rates and our very best environmental performance. 
And recently, 4 of our refineries received safety awards from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers Trade Association. These awards recognize facilities that go above and beyond to keep their people, facilities and surrounding communities safe. Robinson, Detroit and Cordis and Dickinson all demonstrated outstanding safety performance and leadership that set them apart. 
Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our commitment to ESG. From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to meet the needs of today while investing in the energy-diverse future. This includes lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, expanding renewable fuels and technologies, conserving natural resources, engaging with stakeholders and investing in our communities. 
We have 3 company-wide targets, many of our investors know well: first, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030; second, a 50% reduction in our midstream methane intensity by 2025; and lastly, a 20% reduction in our freshwater withdrawal intensity by 2030. 
Our focus on sustainability is pervasive across everything we do. And to ensure this, our compensation now includes a sustainability metric in our bonus target weighted at 20%. We've also linked to diversity metrics compensation in the same way that last year we linked greenhouse gas intensity reductions to our compensation. 
Reflecting our current commitment on ESG, we are pleased for the second consecutive year to have earned U.S. EPA's ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award. MPC is the only company with fuels manufacturing as its primary business to earn this award, and we're very proud of the work our employees do in this area. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the first quarter results."

Slide 8 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.20. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.552 billion for the quarter. This includes results from both continuing and discontinued",773,"Thanks, Mike. Slide 8 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.20. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.552 billion for the quarter. This includes results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations excluding working capital was $613 million, which is a nearly $500 million increase since the prior quarter. This also marks the first time since the start of the pandemic that cash from continuing operations has been above our quarterly dividend payment, which was $379 million. 
Slide 9 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $650 million more quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by higher earnings in Refining & Marketing. As a reminder, both the fourth and first quarter results reflect Speedway as a discontinued operation. 
Moving to our segment results. Slide 10 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported positive EBITDA for the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic, with first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $23 million. This was an increase of $725 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, which were considerably improved across all regions in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. 
Total utilization for refining was 83%, which was roughly flat with the fourth quarter utilization of 82%. Operating expenses were in line with the previous quarter despite the slight increase in utilization. Distribution costs were lower by $69 million due to variations in quarter-to-quarter timing of costs. 
In March, severe winter storms impacted our industry. We estimate that the cost impact across our Refining & Marketing business was roughly $39 million this quarter, with an additional $12 million to be incurred in the second quarter. Although our Galveston Bay and El Paso refineries both had to shut down for a period of time, neither experienced any significant mechanical damage or safety incidents as the team was steadfast in safeguarding our operations and ensuring the safety of our employees and the surrounding communities. El Paso was able to quickly resume operations, and Galveston Bay was able to begin its planned turnaround during the period. The efforts of our people during this time demonstrate the values that are integral to the way we conduct our business. 
Slide 11 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress on reducing operating expenses, which helped to partially offset headwinds from lower gathered and processed volumes and reduced revenues. We estimate the cost impact from storms on our Midstream business was approximately $16 million. 
Slide 12 provides an overview of Speedway results as a discontinued operation. Speedway fuel and merchandise volumes were impacted by usual seasonality in the first quarter. Fuel margins decreased and merchandise revenues were lower due to rising crude and product costs in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see lower foot traffic and transaction counts than pre-COVID levels. Fuel margins were $0.26 per gallon. 
Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. It reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $613 million in the quarter. Changes in working capital was a $348 million use of cash in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the rebuilding of our inventory position in the first quarter and partially offset by a benefit for the increase in crude prices this quarter. 
During the quarter, net debt increased $865 million as we used our short-term debt facilities to manage capital needs during the quarter. In March, we retired $1 billion in senior notes utilizing short-term liquidity. We returned $379 million to shareholders through our dividend. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter for both continuing and discontinued operations was $758 million. 
Turning to guidance on Slide 14, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $100 million in the second quarter, which includes activity at our Galveston Bay refinery. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.20 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.25 billion for the second quarter. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

I'll start and I'll let Marion jump in. So throughout this process, we've been getting the question about what does appropriate leverage mean.

So throughout this process, we've been getting the question about what does appropriate leverage mean. When we pick a metric, we've been saying 1 to 1.5x mid-cycle. And then everybody says, ""Well, then what do you think about mid-cycle?"" And my standard answer is I don't think about the 50-yard line. I think about the banks in the river, and I try and do scenario planning around what we think could be good times and bad times. 
Obviously, everybody's excited about vaccine rollouts and getting recovery here. And certainly, the market is moving in that direction. 
At the same time, Doug, in our prepared remarks, we said, gasoline demand is still 5% lower year-on-year overall. The West Coast is still considerably down compared to the other areas. So we're going to have to evaluate it, and it will be dynamic. But in general, the best guidance we've been trying to give is these are the parameters we think about: 1 to 1.5 kind of leverage. We said we had $2.5 billion of debt that we could do right away. You heard in our prepared remarks that we've essentially got most of that done, and we'll finish that off once we close with Speedway. And then we're going to evaluate to try and minimize any friction costs but make sure that we leave enough dry powder that our balance sheet comes out to the place that we want to be. 
And then absent that, as that evolves, we're going to return capital. And we tried to be as transparent as we can throughout this process that we have core liquidity that we want to make sure the balance sheet's in good position. We have debt level that we want to make sure is in good position. And then we're going to return capital. That's been our goal from the start of this. 
And I go all the way back to -- at one point, we were going to spin Speedway out to the investors so they would get that return to capital via that way. We decided to go a different path. We're ending up with this partnership with 7-Eleven that we're looking forward to getting into the next phase, where they own the assets and we supply fuel. We think there's some real good opportunities for both parties after that. So we're going to continue to evaluate that as we go forward. But that's the best color I can give you on the balance sheet unless, Maryann, you want to jump in with anything there?"

The vaccine rollouts have gone very well. We'll get a little better sense of what a new normal looks like and kind of do a final check on what we think about the portfolio in general. But -- so in the near term, nothing to announce right now. We'll get through this new normal. We'll see what that looks like. But I will tell you, Doug, it's going to be an ongoing effort on our part to continue to ask ourselves all the time, where is our cost structure? How is it evolving? What are the assets that we have in the portfolio? Because we are a believer that over time, this energy evolution will continue to play itself out. And as it does, we're going to be adaptive to the market. 
And obviously, one of the high priorities that we put on ourselves was to get our cost structure down so that in our base business, we were in a much more competitive position. And I think we've done that to some extent, and that's not going to be an effort that we give up on. We're going to continue to do that.

Ray just mentioned, the second big hurdle is capital, operating expense, basically, what do you think of the hardware.

So it became obvious to us that the best use of this asset was to put it into service.

This is Ray. You're right. Martinez is largely out of the OpEx number. There still is some residual OpEx for tank cleaning and work that will carry on to this year. So there is a little bit of Martinez spend. 
I will say on the West Coast, Q1 -- quarter 1 was a challenging OpEx quarter primarily because the energy costs put a big demand on us in the last part of February and early March. I will say on the West Coast, we were partially able to mitigate the impact of those natural gas price spikes by reducing our natural gas purchase requirements to close the balance by producing more internal fuel from our operations. I think this was a real key for us as far as managing the winter storm, not just in Texas but across all of our operations. 
And I really got to give a shout-out to our commercial group. Close coordination with our commercial group and the refineries really allowed us to pivot quickly on the day when natural gas went up by hundredfold and adjust our operations, reduce our demand requirement for natural gas and have as minimal an impact on our OpEx as possible. So that was across all of our system. It really was impactful in the West Coast as well. 
Aside from that, I'll just go back to what I said earlier as far as every day we challenge ourselves, discretionary spending from got-to-do, stay-in-business type of spending. And that that's starting to show in the numbers."

But I will tell you, in the first quarter, we achieved 90% of our design capacity at Dickinson. And we also qualified and got a provisional score for our renewable feedstocks, which is soybean oil and corn oil. And that's a lower number than the temporary score that we start off with. But as you know, we're not seeking to get to 90%. We want to get to 100% of capacity and get lower carbon intensity scores. So work has continued in that regard. We work with our licensor for the process and catalyst on a new catalyst formulation. We just actually did that work and have come back up. So we're working towards getting better, getting toward 100% yield and exactly what we want from the project."

Roger, this is Brian Partee. I can address that question.

So consistent with the past, we self-generate about 70% to 75% of our RINs through either blending or generation, our biofuel refining assets. So Q1 was pretty similar to that historical average. 
As it relates to the separation of Speedway, no real impact there. The RIN is something that's pretty transparent in the marketplace. It's a real expense. We all have to deal with it. It's not something we can control. We think of it like a commodity. We deal with commodity prices that are volatile and move dramatically up and down. 
And the one thing I'd leave you with on the RIN and the RIN expense, I know there's a lot of hyperfocus on it appropriately right now in the environment that we're in, but there's also really good opportunities to optimize in that space. So depending on how you're modeling and what you're looking at, you have to think about RINs in terms of true obligated volume. Obviously, not all gallons are obligated. So if you think about stripping off exports, jet as well as some other boutique fuels -- and for us, Alaska also is not an obligated state from an RVO perspective. 
The other thing that I think played out interestingly in the market in the first quarter was the year-on-year carry-in. So you can meet obligations in the prompt year with up to 20% of carry-ins from prior year. And we think there's far less carry-in from 2020 to 2021 largely due to the uncertainty around the election last fall. 
So -- and then the last part about the commercialization in the RIN space is how you buy and when you buy. I would presume -- maybe from a modeling perspective assume kind of a ratable purchase for RINs. And that could be a strategy, and we try to be very commercial in this space and try to optimize. And obviously, the higher the RIN value gets, the more opportunity there is to outperform, and conversely, underperform in that space."

So that's certainly not good for production in Canada. So we'll continue to watch that specifically to Canada. 
In terms of differentials in Canada, I would point you towards -- I still think probably your general rule of thumb is the forward market there, which is plus or minus $12. And the incremental barrel in Canada is moving out via rail. The pipes are full, so we expect that to continue. 
When you look worldwide and more so on the Gulf Coast, a lot of -- there's a lot of conversation around OPEC and the barrels that they're releasing into the market. I'm a little more measured on OPEC and what we might expect on the Gulf Coast than others. Quite frankly, when you look at what OPEC has done the last several months, they've been very measured on how they're managing their production with demand. And currently, today, as you know, we've got a tug of war. There's a little bit of slight optimism coming out of the West. And then there is a lot of the fear of the unknown, which is well publicized in India. So we'll just have to see how that plays out."

And you're spot on, yes, California is prepared to reopen here mid-June.

To what extent, it's very difficult to estimate. COVID has been a very dynamic environment for us. California has been very aggressive.

But Florida, New Jersey, New York, some other big gasoline-consuming states are also in the process of reopening. 
The question becomes, where do we end up after that point? One of the things that I think we still need to see is, is there potential pent-up demand? Is that one of the things that we're going to see come out of this? Is there going to be a new normal with the way people operate as far as work and remote operations, et cetera, et cetera? 
So we're excited that it continues to get better, but we're also cautious as to what it's going to mean once we get to the other side of this. If anything, I would say, the way we try to think about it is, at the end of the day, vaccines are rolling out well. States are opening up. Things are heading in the right direction. To what absolute number, as Brian just mentioned, where that ends up is still to be played out. 
And to your point, June, like you said, it's going to occur in June. It's essentially the second quarter will be over. We'll be talking about results here where we still don't really have as much insight. So I think it's still going to play out a little bit more time, understand that pent-up demand, how much of it is robust to stay long term and how much of it is just short term for people trying to get out from under the lockdown conditions. 
So still a lot to learn. Like I said, we concentrate on what we control. We'll keep an eye on what we don't control and try and learn as much as we can as to what the new normal looks like."

As you spoke about the distribution cost, 1.25 is the expectation for the second quarter, again, up slightly. We are expecting some higher product demand, and therefore, obviously, some higher cost to transport product. But overall, fairly flattish as we look at the increase in the expectation for throughput. 
And then similarly, when you look at total operating costs really on a per-barrel basis, when you consider that they're about flattish Q1 to Q2. So hope that helps to address your questions there around the nature of the second quarter guidance.

We're going to have an opportunity as this transition or I like to call it evolution evolves. There's going to be some technologies that we can implement in our existing fossil fuel facilities that will be helpful. There's going to be some technologies that get implemented in truly renewable facilities. 
So I think in time, you're going to see us grow both. And at the end -- what's the end game is what you're asking, and I don't know how long you're thinking out in time. But the end game is for us to have a very competitive refining offering of fossil fuels and a very competitive offering on renewable fuels and continue to look for ways to grow our earnings. 
Dave mentioned it, we're looking at a lot of different things right at the moment. We're going to act on them once we believe that they will give a good return for us. Some things, I think, are a little ahead of their time right at the moment. The technology still needs to develop a little bit. 
At the same time, there are some things like Ray just mentioned. We're going to implement some wind support to our Dickinson facility as early as next year. So some things are on the immediate side. Some things are on the watch side and evaluate. We're going to have a very robust look at through all this. 
One of the things that everybody keeps asking me, and hopefully, you'll get to see it through results is what are we doing commercially since one of my goals is to improve our commercial performance. And it's not something that we're going to talk about in the forecasting of it, but hopefully, we'll point out things as we go along. And Ray mentioned a couple today that happened in the first quarter that helped us minimize our impact around the winter storm. 
So I think you're going to see -- the answer to your question is really both. There's going to be some opportunities on both sides of the business as we change the portfolio over time. And that was asked earlier today. You're going to see some more changes in the portfolio as time goes by. And as we get to evaluate that, we'll give disclosures as quickly as we can so everybody knows which way we're pulling the company."

But Mike, I was wondering in terms of cadence at $350 million this year -- and it sounds like you do the first diesel hydrotreater next year, and then the 3 other hydros and the pretreat come on in 2023. So is it right to think about it as sort of a stair-step that the CapEx for that, and therefore, the R&M growth CapEx kind of steps up in terms of renewables next year and in 2023? Or is it sort of more evenly spread out? 
And sort of related to that, just wanted to check that -- would that be funded purely from internally generated cash? Or would you be looking to -- what are your financing sort of options if you -- how you fund the project? And then I have a follow-up."

It is a phased approach to the activity out there, but it kind of dovetails to what Paul just asked. So when you step back and think about it, roughly 40-some percent or let me round to half of the growth capital that we have in this year is directed towards renewables. But then also half of it is directed towards our fossil fuel business. So we still think there's going to be continuing monies that we can spend in that business. 
So like what Paul was asking, I was trying to say we're going to do a little bit of both. But I think you're also seeing the way we're approaching this project, which is in a phased approach. So as Ray mentioned, we'll get it online early next year. Pretreatment comes on, full capacity comes on. So there will be some stair stepping in capital in that area. 
At the same time, we're still looking forward to the $450 million that we're investing in the base business. We still got some activity going on down on the Gulf Coast with our Star project that we want to get to the finish line as well. 
So kind of dovetails to your question the same as Paul's is that we're going to have activity occurring in both areas. We're committed to both sides of the business because it's going to be a long evolution. It's not something that's going to happen very quickly, but it's something that we're going to be very attentive to as to where we deploy capital. 
I'm hoping everybody's getting a feel for us that we're going to have strict capital discipline. That's a mantra that we're going to continue to push and challenge ourselves through all the scenario planning that we do as to what's the best use of that capital, whether it's in our existing facilities in fossil fuels or in renewable facilities or, as Paul mentioned, if we come up with something that we think is a little bit more of a step out. 
So we'll try and give everybody as much disclosure as we can as time goes by. We're looking forward to the opportunity as the evolution continues, and we think it will provide us some value opportunities to increase value for the shareholders."

Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business.  During the first quarter, our industry continued to struggle with a reduction in glo",987,"Thanks, Kristina, and thank you for joining our call this morning. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business.  
During the first quarter, our industry continued to struggle with a reduction in global economic activity and demand for transportation fuels that resulted from the mobility restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic. As we started the second quarter with the rollout of vaccinations, we still see industry-wide gasoline demand down around 5% from historical levels and jet demand down around 25% to 30%. To the extent that a pent-up desire to travel starts to brighten the macro outlook for our business, our team and our assets are poised to take advantage of these opportunities. But in the meantime, as the challenging backdrop holds, we'll continue to concentrate on the elements of our business that are within our control.  
Our near-term priorities remain the same. Each quarter, we're focused on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. 
Slide 4 highlights some of our actions around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we're close to completion on the sale of our Speedway business. Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Our Board of Directors approved our plans to convert our Martinez asset to a 48,000 barrel per day renewable facility. We expect commissioning of Martinez to begin in the second half of 2022 with approximately 17,000 barrels per day of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 48,000 barrels a day by the end of '23.  
In line with our commitment to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, we're planning to install wind turbine generators at Dickinson facility. Sourcing electricity from wind will lower the carbon intensity of the renewable diesel product at that facility. We'll continue to seek out the right opportunities for investing and partnering on renewables and evolving technologies.  
Finally, we also continue to exercise strict discipline on how capital and expense dollars are spent. In this quarter, we were able to hold refining operating expenses roughly flat with the prior quarter.  
I'd like to take a moment on Slide 5 to reinforce our priorities for the proceeds from the sale of our Speedway business. 
As we approach the close of the transaction, we've appreciated the continued dialogue we've had with many of you. We remain committed to use the Speedway sale proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to MPC shareholders.  
An important priority is our commitment to maintain a solid investment-grade credit profile. As we said before, we intend to maintain an appropriate level of leverage for this business. And recently, Fitch affirmed our investment-grade credit rating at BBB and improved the outlook for our MPC from negative to stable.  
With respect to debt reduction, we previously indicated $2.5 billion of debt that could be retired with minimal friction costs. We've repaid approximately $2.1 billion, as was announced, since October by issuing commercial paper, which we intend to pay down immediately with the proceeds from the Speedway sale. We'll be thoughtful on how to reduce our debt to minimize costs while not jeopardizing our investment-grade credit rating.  
Within this framework of maintaining a solid balance sheet, we expect the remaining proceeds will be targeted for shareholder return, and we plan to announce more details around these plans in conjunction with the closing of the transaction.  
Slide 6 demonstrates our execution around lowering our cost structure. 
Our refining and corporate cost results this quarter illustrate the impact of the team's commitment to cost discipline. And while rising utilization will bring variable costs as volume increase, we believe that the structural cost reductions we have made are sustainable.  
While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, we have not compromised on our commitment to safely operating our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. 
As you may recall, 2020 was the company's best performance ever in the area, with nearly 30% improvement across both process and personal safety rates and our very best environmental performance.  And recently, 4 of our refineries received safety awards from the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association. These awards recognize facilities that go above and beyond to keep their people, facilities and surrounding communities safe. Robinson, Detroit and Anacortes and Dickinson all demonstrated outstanding safety performance and leadership that set them apart.  
Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our commitment to ESG. 
From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to meet the needs of today while investing in the energy-diverse future. This includes lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, expanding renewable fuels and technologies, conserving natural resources, engaging with stakeholders and investing in our communities.  
We have 3 company-wide targets many of our investors know well: First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030; second, a 50% reduction in our midstream methane intensity by 2025; and lastly, a 20% reduction in our freshwater withdrawal intensity by 2030.  
Our focus on sustainability is pervasive across everything we do. And to ensure this, our compensation now includes a sustainability metric in our bonus target weighted at 20%. We've also linked the diversity metric to compensation in the same way that last year we linked greenhouse gas intensity reductions to our compensation.  
Reflecting our current commitment on ESG, we are pleased for the second consecutive year to have earned U.S. EPA's ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award. MPC is the only company with fuels manufacturing as its primary business to earn this award, and we're very proud of the work our employees do in this area.  
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the first quarter results."

This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.20. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.552 billion for the quarter. This includes results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital, was $613 million, which is a nearly $500 million increase since the prior quarter. This also marks the first time since the start of the pandemic that cash from continuing operations has been above our quarterly dividend payment, which was $379 million.  
Slide 9 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021. 
Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $650 million more quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by higher earnings in Refining & Marketing. As a reminder, both the fourth and first quarter results reflect Speedway as a discontinued operation.  
Moving to our segment results. Slide 10 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. 
The business reported positive EBITDA for the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic with first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $23 million. This was an increase of $725 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, which were considerably improved across all regions in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. 
Total utilization for refining was 83%, which was roughly flat with the fourth quarter utilization of 82%.  
Operating expenses were in line with the previous quarter despite the slight increase in utilization. 
Distribution costs were lower by $69 million due to variations in quarter-to-quarter timing of costs.  
In March, severe winter storms impacted our industry. We estimate that the cost impact across our Refining & Marketing business was roughly $39 million this quarter, with an additional $12 million to be incurred in the second quarter. Although our Galveston Bay and El Paso refineries both had to shut down for a period of time, neither experienced any significant mechanical damage or safety incidents as the team was steadfast in safeguarding our operations and ensuring the safety of our employees and the surrounding communities. El Paso was able to quickly resume operations, and Galveston Bay was able to begin its planned turnaround during the period. The efforts of our people during this time demonstrate the values that are integral to the way we conduct our business.  
Slide 11 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress on reducing operating expenses, which helped to partially offset headwinds from lower gathered and processed volumes and reduced revenues. We estimate the cost impact from storms on our Midstream business was approximately $16 million.  
Slide 12 provides an overview of Speedway results as a discontinued operation. 
Speedway fuel and merchandise volumes were impacted by usual seasonality in the first quarter. Fuel margins decreased and merchandise revenues were lower due to rising crude and product costs in the quarter. Overall, we continue to see lower foot traffic and transaction counts than pre-COVID levels. Fuel margins were $0.26 per gallon.  
Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. It reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations. 
Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $613 million in the quarter. Changes in working capital was a $348 million use of cash in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the rebuilding of our inventory position in the first quarter and partially offset by a benefit for the increase in crude prices this quarter.  
During the quarter, net debt increased $865 million as we used our short-term debt facilities to manage capital needs during the quarter. In March, we retired $1 billion in senior notes utilizing short-term liquidity. 
We returned $379 million to shareholders through our dividend. 
Our cash balance at the end of the quarter for both continuing and discontinued operations was $758 million.  
Turning to guidance on Slide 14, we provide our second quarter outlook. 
We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $100 million in the second quarter, which includes activity at our Galveston Bay refinery. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.20 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.25 billion for the second quarter.  
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

So throughout this process, we've been getting the question about what does appropriate leverage mean. When we pick a metric, we've been saying 1 to 1.5x mid-cycle, and then everybody says, well, then what do you think about mid-cycle? And my standard answer is, ""I don't think about the 50-yard line. I think about the banks of the river,"" and I try and do scenario planning around what we think could be good times and bad times.  
Obviously, everybody's excited about vaccine rollouts and getting recovery here. And certainly, the market is moving in that direction. At the same time, Doug, in our prepared remarks, we said gasoline demand is still 5% lower year-on-year overall. The West Coast is still considerably down compared to the other areas. 
So we're going to have to evaluate it, and it'll be dynamic. But in general, the best guidance we've been trying to give is these are the parameters we think about. 1 to 1.5 kind of leverage. We said we had $2.5 billion of debt that we could do right away. You heard in our prepared remarks that we've essentially got most of that done, and we'll finish that off once we close with Speedway. And then we're going to evaluate to try and minimize any friction costs but make sure that we leave enough dry powder that our balance sheet comes out to the place that we want to be.  
And then absent that, as that evolves, we're going to return capital. And we tried to be as transparent as we can throughout this process that we have core liquidity that we want to make sure the balance sheet's in good position, we have debt level that we want to make sure is in good position. And then we're going to return capital. That's been our goal from the start of this.  
And I go all the way back to, at one point, we were going to spin Speedway out to the investors so they would get that return of capital via that way. We decided to go a different path. We're ending up with this partnership with 7-Eleven that we're looking forward to getting into the next phase where they own the assets and we supply fuel. We think there are some real good opportunities for both parties after that. So we're going to continue to evaluate that as we go forward, but that's the best color I can give you on the balance sheet unless, Maryann, you want to jump in with anything there."

We'll get a little better sense of what a new normal looks like and kind of do a final check on what we think about the portfolio in general. 
But -- so in the near term, nothing to announce right now. We'll get through this new normal. We'll see what that looks like.

And as it does, we're going to be adaptive to the market.  
And obviously, one of the high priorities that we put on ourselves was to get our cost structure down so that in our base business, we were in a much more competitive position. And I think we've done that to some extent, and that's not going to be an effort that we give up on. We're going to continue to do that.

Ray just mentioned the second big hurdle is capital, operating expense. Basically, what do you think of the hardware? And Ray just described it. The full asset facility was relatively high cost, but the real gem, as he mentioned, was in the hydroprocessing area.

This is Ray. 
You're right. Martinez is largely out of the OpEx number. There still is some residual OpEx for tank cleaning and work that will carry on to this year. So there is a little bit of Martinez spend.  
I will say on the West Coast Q1 -- quarter 1 was a challenging OpEx quarter primarily because the energy costs put a big demand on us in the last part of February and early March. I will say on the West Coast we were partially able to mitigate the impact of those natural gas price spike by reducing our natural gas purchase requirements to close the balance by producing more internal fuel from our operations. I think this was a real key for us as far as managing the winter storm not just in Texas but across all of our operations.  
And I really got to give a shout-out to our commercial group. Close coordination with our commercial group and the refineries really allowed us to pivot quickly on the day when natural gas went up by a hundredfold and adjust our operations, reduce our demand requirement for natural gas and have as minimal of an impact on our OpEx as possible. So that was across all of our system. It really was impactful on the West Coast as well.  
Aside from that, I'll just go back to what I said earlier as far as every day we challenge ourselves, discretionary spending from got-to-do, stay-in-business type of spending. And that's starting to show in the numbers."

One of the things we learned -- we already knew is that start-ups are hard. You don't just push a button and everything works perfectly. But I will tell you, in the first quarter, we achieved 90% of our design capacity at Dickinson. And we also qualified and got a provisional score for our renewable feedstocks, which is soybean oil and corn oil. And that's a lower number than the temporary score that we start off with. 
But as you know, we're not seeking to get to 90%. We want to get to 100% of capacity and get lower carbon intensity scores. So work has continued in that regard. We work with our licensor for the process and catalyst on a new catalyst formulation. We just actually did that work and have come back up. So we're working towards getting better, getting toward 100% yield and exactly what we want from the project."

So consistent with the past, we self-generate about 70% to 75% of our RIN through either blending or generation in our biofuels refining assets. So Q1 was pretty similar to that historical average. As it relates to the separation of Speedway, yes, no real impact there. 
The RIN is something that's pretty transparent in the marketplace. It's a real expense. We all have to deal with it. It's not something we can control. We think of it like a commodity. We deal with commodity prices that are volatile and move dramatically up and down. 
And the one thing I'd leave you with on the RIN and the RIN expense, I know there's a lot of hyperfocus on it appropriately right now in the environment that we're in, but there's also really good opportunities to optimizing that space. So depending on how you're modeling and what you're looking at, you have to think about RINs in terms of true obligated volume. Obviously, not all gallons are obligated. So if you think about stripping off exports, jet as well as some other boutique fuels -- and for us, Alaska also is not an obligated state from an RVO perspective. 
The other thing that I think played out interestingly in the market in the first quarter was the year-on-year carry-in. So you can meet obligations in the prompt here with up to 20% of carry-ins from prior year. And we think there's far less carry-in from 2020 to 2021 largely due to the uncertainty around the election last fall. 
So -- and then the last part about the commercialization in the RIN space is how you buy and when you buy. I would presume -- maybe from a modeling perspective assume kind of a ratable purchase for RINs. And that could be a strategy, and we try to be very commercial in this space and try to optimize. And obviously, the higher the RIN value gets, the more opportunity there is to outperform and, conversely, underperform in that space."

So that's certainly not good for production in Canada, so we'll continue to watch that specifically to Canada. 
In terms of differentials in Canada, I would point you towards -- I still think probably your general rule of thumb is the forward market there, which is plus or minus $12. And the incremental barrel in Canada is moving out via rail. The pipes are full. So we expect that to continue. 
When you look worldwide and more so on the Gulf Coast, a lot of -- there's a lot of conversation around OPEC and the barrels that they're releasing into the market. I'm a little more measured on OPEC and what we might expect on the Gulf Coast than others. Quite frankly, when you look at what OPEC has done the last several months, they've been very measured on how they're managing their production with demand. And currently, today, as you know, we've got a tug of war. There's a little bit of slight optimism coming out of the West, and then there is a lot of the fear of the unknown which is well publicized in India. So we'll just have to see how that plays out."

And you're spot on, yes, California is prepared to reopen here mid-June.

To what extent, it's very difficult to estimate. COVID has been a very dynamic environment for us. California has been very aggressive.

But Florida, New Jersey, New York, some other big gasoline-consuming states are also in the process of reopening. 
The question becomes, where do we end up after that point? One of the things that I think we still need to see is, is there potential pent-up demand? Is that one of the things that we're going to see come out of this? Is there going to be a new normal with the way people operate as far as work and remote operations, et cetera, et cetera? So we're excited that it continues to get better, but we're also cautious as to what it's going to mean once we get to the other side of this. 
If anything, I would say the way we try to think about it is, at the end of the day, vaccines are rolling out well, states are opening up, things are heading in the right direction. To what absolute number, as Brian just mentioned, where that ends up is still to be played out. 
And to your point, June -- like you said, it's going to occur in June. Essentially, the second quarter will be over. We'll be talking about results here where we still don't really have as much insight. So I think it's still going to play out a little bit more time, understanding that pent-up demand, how much of it is robust to stay long term and how much of it is just short term for people trying to get out from under the lockdown conditions. 
So still a lot to learn. Like I said, we concentrate on what we control. We'll keep an eye on what we don't control and try and learn as much as we can as to what the new normal looks like."

As you spoke about the distribution cost, $1.25 billion is the expectation for the second quarter, again up slightly. We are expecting some higher product demand and therefore, obviously, some higher cost to transport product. But overall, fairly flattish as we look at the increase in the expectation for throughput, and then similarly when you look at total operating costs really on a per-barrel basis when you consider that they're about flattish Q1 to Q2. So hope that helps to address your questions there around the nature of the second quarter guidance.

At the same time, the energy evolution is going to tick into renewables and other technologies as they develop. So we found a nice opportunity. We're very pleased with the effort that's going on at Dickinson. 
And as Dave just mentioned, once we're in that boat, we're going to try and do everything we can to increase the profitability, whether it's lowering the carbon intensity of the operation, the product, the feedstocks, as Brian mentioned. 
And I'll let Brian comment, and like I said earlier, is, location is in a good spot for us, CapEx is in a good spot for us, OpEx is in a good spot for us. Ray is going through some learnings on the start-up of the one facility, which will help us on the next facility.

And at the end -- what's the end game is what you're asking, and I don't know how long you're thinking out in time, but the end game is for us to have a very competitive refining offering of fossil fuels and a very competitive offering on renewable fuels and continue to look for ways to grow our earnings. 
Dave mentioned it, we're looking at a lot of different things right at the moment. We're going to act on them once we believe that they will give a good return for us. Some things, I think, are a little ahead of their time right at the moment, and the technology still needs to develop a little bit. At the same time, there are some things like Ray just mentioned. We're going to implement some wind support to our Dickinson facility as early as next year. So some things are on the immediate side. Some things are on the watch side and evaluate. We're going to have a very robust look at through all this. 
One of the things that everybody keeps asking me, and hopefully, you'll get to see it through results is what are we doing commercially since one of my goals is to improve our commercial performance. And it's not something that we're going to talk about in the forecasting of it, but hopefully we'll point out things as we go along. And Ray mentioned a couple today that happened in the first quarter that helped us minimize our impact around the winter storm. 
So I think you're going to see the answer to your question is really both. There's going to be some opportunities on both sides of the business as we change the portfolio over time.

First, on Martinez. I know you can't disclose an overall cost. But Mike, I was wondering, in terms of cadence at $350 million this year, and it sounds like you'll do the first diesel hydrotreater next year, and then the 3 other hydros and the pretreat come on in 2023, so is it right to think about it as sort of a stair-step that the CapEx for that and, therefore, the R&M growth CapEx kind of steps up in terms of renewables next year and in 2023? Or is it sort of more evenly spread out? 
And sort of related to that, I just wanted to check that -- would that be funded purely from internally generated cash? Or would you be looking to -- what are your financing sort of options if you -- as to how you fund the project? And then I have a follow-up."

It is a phased approach to the activity out there. But it kind of dovetails to what Paul just asked. So when you step back and think about it, roughly 40-some percent or let me round to half of the growth capital that we have in this year is directed towards renewables. But then also, half of it is directed towards our fossil fuel business. So we still think there's going to be continuing monies that we can spend in that business. So like what Paul was asking, I was trying to say we're going to do a little bit of both. 
But I think you're also seeing the way we're approaching this project, which is in a phased approach. So as Ray mentioned, we'll get it online early next year. Pretreatment comes on, full capacity comes on. So there will be some stair stepping in capital in that area. 
At the same time, we're still looking forward to the $450 million that we're investing in the base business. We still got some activity going on down on the Gulf Coast with our STAR project that we want to get to the finish line as well. 
So kind of dovetails to your question the same as Paul's is that we're going to have activity occurring in both areas. We're committed to both sides of the business because it's going to be a long evolution. It's not something that's going to happen very quickly. But it's something that we're going to be very attentive to as to where we deploy capital. 
I'm hoping everybody's getting a feel from us that we're going to have strict capital discipline. That's a mantra that we're going to continue to push and challenge ourselves through all the scenario planning that we do as to what's the best use of that capital, whether it's in our existing facilities in fossil fuels or in renewable facilities or, as Paul mentioned, if we come up with something that we think is a little bit more of a step-out. 
So we'll try and give everybody as much disclosure as we can as time goes by. We're looking forward to the opportunity as the evolution continues, and we think it'll provide us some value opportunities to increase value for the shareholders."

Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvements in the demand for our products as the rollout of COVID vaccinations and the removal of mobility restrictions have led to more economic activity and increased demand for transportation fuels. That said, we're close to the end of the summer driving season, which is typically our strongest part of the year. Gasoline demand is currently 2% to 5% below 2019 levels, with the West Coast still lagging at about 10% down. Diesel demand continues to hold up well and is flat to 2019. Despite the growing levels of personal passenger traffic, we continue to see an absence of the longer-haul international flights and business travel. Overall, jet demand remains down nearly 30% below pre-pandemic levels. The full return of aviation fuel demand will likely still take some time, particularly with the recent increasing spread of the COVID-19 variance. 
As we head into the second half of the year, we remain hopeful but cautious in the recovery and so we'll remain focused on the elements of our business within our control. 
Slide 4 highlights progress on our strategic priorities for the quarter. First, on May 14, we closed the sale of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven. In conjunction with the close, we announced our plans to return $10 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. As part of our commitment to quickly return capital, we immediately launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in which we were able to repurchase nearly $1 billion worth of shares. As we shared in our release this morning, we are proceeding with the next steps in our plan to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital over the next 12 to 16 months. 
Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio, Dickinson reached full design capacity during the quarter. At approximately 180 million gallons per year, Dickinson is the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States. At Martinez, we're progressing detailed engineering and permitting to convert that oil refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Based on our progress and discussion with feedstock suppliers, we're confident in the time line we have set to begin producing renewable diesel in the second half of 2022, with approximately 260 million gallons per year of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of '23. 
Third, we continue to keep a diligent focus on cost and capital in a challenging commodity business such as ours, being a low-cost operator ensures we will remain competitive. We have continued to challenge ourselves to examine all aspects of spend, and as a result, have delivered incremental progress. In the first half of 2021, our operating results reflect our goal to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1 billion. 
Importantly, I want to note that in June, we published our 2 annual ESG-related reports. Our sustainability report provides an in-depth look at the company's sustainability approach and performance consistent with the reporting guidance from SASB and GRI. Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios follows guidance from TCFD and analyzes the company's resiliency relative to climate scenarios put forth by the IEA. 
On Slide 5, I'd like to take a moment to go over some of the ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to balance the needs of today while investing in a sustainable energy diverse future. That includes strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conservative natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies, and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders. 
We currently have 3 company-wide targets many of our investors know well. First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030. Second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025, and and lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance 2 significant renewable fuels projects. In late '20, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson North Dakota facility, second largest of its kind in the United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery to a renewable diesel facility. 
Finally, to demonstrate our focus on making sustainability pervasive in all we do for executives and employees, we link a portion of the annual bonus program to an ESG metric. We recently introduced a diversity, equity and inclusion component to these metrics as well, making us the first U.S. independent downstream company to link improving diversity to compensation in the same way we led the industry in linking GHG intensity reductions to our compensation last year. 
Safety in our operations is another key to sustainable operations. In 2020, our teams demonstrated strong safety and environmental performance, including a nearly 40% reduction in the most significant process safety events and a 40% reduction in designated environmental incidents over 2019. Our personal safety performance continues to be better than industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream sectors. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review second quarter results."
118315802,1671997355,2362576,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. Adjusted EBITDA was $2,194 billion for the quarter. This includes the results from both continuing and dis",1347,"Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. Adjusted EBITDA was $2,194 billion for the quarter. This includes the results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital, was $1.535 billion, which is approximately $1 billion increase from the prior quarter. And for the first time in nearly 18 months, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business, capital commitments as well as covered our dividend and distributions. 
Finally, we returned nearly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. The close of the Speedway sale marked a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. So we wanted to call out some of the key points on Slide 7. We received total proceeds for the sale of Speedway of $21 billion. Based on our tax basis, our cash taxes, current and deferred, will be approximately $4.2 billion, which is lower than our original $4.5 billion estimate. We have accrued for this on the balance sheet. 
In addition, we had closing adjustments of approximately $400 million. Therefore, the after-tax proceeds from the sale will be $17.2 billion. To be clear, this number is higher than our initial $16.5 billion estimate. 
On Slide 8, we present an overview of the use of the proceeds. Since the close of the transaction, we have reduced structural debt by $2.5 billion and purchased approximately $1 billion of stock. In the post-tender period, we did not repurchase any incremental shares in light of a couple of regulatory constraints. First, a post-tender cooling off period, and second, our routine quarterly restricted period in the lead up to the release of our earnings information. That said, not repurchasing during that limited window is not indicative of any deviation from our commitment to complete within 12 to 16 months. Consistent with that commitment, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are commencing the next steps to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital. 
Specifically, we are entering into an open-market repurchase program that will allow us to buy for a period of time, including when the company may have information that otherwise precludes us from trading, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls. 
Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made, lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have made a step change in our refining operating cost and decreased our overall cost profile by approximately $1 billion. While there is quarter-to-quarter variability, our refining operating cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021. We have applied the same cost discipline framework that we use for refining operating costs to our corporate costs as well. There may be variations in these corporate costs quarter-to-quarter. We believe we have lowered our overall cost structure by more than $100 million, and we are committed to challenging ourselves every day on ways to reduce expenses. 
As you know, natural gas is a variable cost in operating a refinery, these costs have recently increased nearly $1 per MMBtu, and we anticipate this being a headwind for the third quarter. While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities, and in no way, jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations. 
Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2021 to second quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was more than $600 million higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing. As we previously mentioned, this quarter's results include the impacts of closing the Speedway sale. 
Here, you can see the $11.7 billion pretax gain on the sale reflected in the adjustments column of $11.6 billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairment and transaction-related costs. The $3.7 billion financial tax -- excuse me, financial tax provision reflects the net impact of cash taxes and deferred tax impact. The resulting $8 billion gain on sale is reflected in our quarterly net income. Slide 18 in our appendix walk through the specific impacts of the Speedway sale across the 3 financial statements. 
Moving to our segment slide, results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segment. The business recorded the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA since the start of the COVID pandemic with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million. This was an increase of $728 million when compared to the first quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Mid-Con region as that region's cracks improved 57% from the first quarter. Also contributing to the improved results was higher utilization, which was 94% for the second quarter versus 83% in the first quarter. 
It's important to recall that we idled 2 high-cost refineries in 2020. If adjusted to include that capacity idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 78% in the first quarter of '21 and subsequently increased to 89% in the second quarter of '21. Operating expenses were relatively flat with the previous quarter despite the increase in utilization, reflecting the team's commitment to cost discipline despite rising variable cost. 
Slide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress executing on the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, lowering the cost structure and portfolio optimization. 
By the end of 2021, we estimate that MPLX will have decreased their structural cost by $300 million. 
Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. It reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations. We have also specifically called out items related to the Speedway close. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.5 billion in the quarter. Changes in working capital were flat this quarter. Increasing crude prices provided a source of more than $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory builds. 
During the quarter, MPC decreased debt by $3.3 billion. Additionally, MPLX reduced third-party debt by approximately $800 million during the quarter. With respect to capital return, MPC returned $380 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $981 million worth of shares using Speedway proceeds. At the end of the quarter, NPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposits. 
Turning to guidance. On Slide 14, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $195 million in the third quarter. The majority of the activity will be at our Robinson and Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region. 
As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back-half weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. And so you are seeing the impact in our guided cost trends for the third quarter. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.05 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately $100 billion -- $100 million, excuse me, in cost that have been removed on an annual basis. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

So obviously, with the administration change and with the agenda that they have out there, they're looking for ways to pay for the programs that they have in place. So we're aware of the potential there. Obviously, there's a couple of bills that are involved with that dynamic. I would tell you, right now, our thinking though, is that we would stay in the MLP structure because we don't think it's going to change. We don't know for sure. Obviously, if it did lose its tax status that we change our dynamic. 
But right now, Doug, if you're asking what's the probability, I think we are on the side of -- we don't think it is going to change, and we think the partnership will still maintain its tax status. So obviously, for the size of the MLP that we have, if all of a sudden, it was a tax entity you're looking at around $800 million to $1 billion of cash flow that would be lost. And I know others have asked this in the past. I mean, it's predominantly the #1 reason why we maintain the partnership structure as compared to converting to a C corp. 
There's 2 dynamics that come into play. One is an immediate tax impact to all unitholders, of which MPC is the largest, obviously. And then more importantly is to the ongoing cash flow change that would occur at MPLX. So we understand some of the pros and cons of the structure. At the same time, we think having that cash flow keeps us in the MLP mode. So obviously, if the rules change, if the administration does something different, we'll adapt accordingly. But in the short term, we still support the structure because it gives us that additional cash flow as opposed to a tax burden."

So throughout the time from the announcement to close, we reiterated to investors that we wanted to do it as quickly and efficiently as possible. To meet our commitment of quickly, we offer a Dutch tender the market spoke and said, $1 billion as opposed to what we had offered out as far as the total liquidity. Now we are, as Maryann said in the remarks, we're going to go more opportunistic and be in an open market environment. 
So some of the questions that we get from people is, are we still committed to that? And as Maryan said, we want to reiterate, we are committed to that.

We do have, again, natural gas potentially coming up. But overall, we're going to continue to challenge the portfolio, both on the refining side of the business, also in the midstream side of the business. For those who listened to the MPLX call, we had originally stated about $200 million of cost reductions at MPLX. We've now increased that to about $300 million, about another $100 million that we feel pretty comfortable that we can take out of that business as well. So it's going to continue to be an area of focus for us. That's never going to change. 
We'll look for opportunities for us to optimize our system where we can. And back to your original point, we did have a couple of closures.

It's going to be part of our DNA that we're going to look at every opportunity, every chance we get to continue to push that down. I am a believer that in this business, we need to be a low-cost operator. The team deserves a lot of credit to get after that, and we've made some meaningful change, but we're not done. 
I'll quote right from the last call, we're not in the first inning, and we're not in the ninth inning. So the game is still being played. It will continue to be played and we'll just obviously challenge ourselves all the time to see where we can run ourselves as a leaner opportunity as we can without sacrificing safety. That's another really important mantra. We're not going to put anybody at jeopardy. But we're going to run as lean as we can. And I just -- my guidance to you is keep watching our results and keep talking about it, and as we have additional disclosures to tell you what's happening, we'll bring those up quarter-to-quarter. 
Like I just mentioned earlier, midstream has just moved from a sustainable $200 million down to $300 million down. So we feel good about that. We're now telling people that we're comfortable with that number, still challenging it in the midstream space as well. So we're going to keep the eye on the ball as far as our costs, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to be as lean as we can be."

And then you pointed out a couple of things is jet fuel is still lagging, in our view, and that will continue to lag for some time. But eventually, it will come back. But for right now, it is still lagging. 
And the other one that we pointed out was the West Coast is still lagging. So we're going to have to see, Theresa, to be honest with you, we're going to have to see how the COVID plays itself out into the second half of the year and as we approach another winter season. if there continues to be increased infection, obviously, there's going to be some restraint on the demand as a result like we've seen before. Hopefully not, hopefully, people are seeing this variance spread and vaccination rates will increase from where they are today. I think there was a good response originally, but I think it needs to go to another level. So we're obviously hopeful that people will take caution and get vaccinated. But in general, I mean, we have the same outlook that I think you and others have is -- that's why we used the word hopeful that we're recovering coming out of this, but cautious that we still have some road to plow.

And following up on something that came up in the midstream call about housing some of the assets within MPLX, just in light of the midstream entity, throwing off good free cash flow with a healthy balance sheet currently and needing to insulate its own terminal value, when we think about some of the bigger ticket items that you have to spend on such as the pretreatment unit or even the conversion of some of the processing units, would it would you have the flexibility to decide between MPLX participating at cost or dropping down once fully cash flowing? Is there a preference at this point between the 2? If that is the path forward? 
And just on the latter, if you drop things down once fully cash flowing thinking, I think this is, I believe, your previous strategy with Capline and keeping that upstairs until it is fully reversed because when you boil it all down from Martinez, I imagine this would really delineate like a pretty meaningfully different amount of capital that MPLX could contribute to fund the project?"

I don't want to get -- like Mike said, I don't want to get into too much of the feedstock slate. What I would like to emphasize, though, is we have a lot of optionality around how we receive feedstocks between truck and rail and water and ability without having the pretreatment system still to optimize that optimize that mix. 
The other thing I'll talk about Martinez is, whether it's Phase I or Phase II, Phase III is, we did our -- when we looked at this project, we looked at it with different feedstock capabilities and the most conservative feedstock availability for Phase 1. And we still feel good about the project even if it was a very strong soybean oil-based slate.

We have a lot of opportunity there to provide value. And then the ultimate logistics is we're in California where we're sitting on the demand. So location also matters. 
So regardless of what happens in the marketplace, and it will ebb and flow just like every other commodity market. The reason we're so bullish on our Martinez asset is those factors that are in place day-in and day-out. The OpEx that we're going to run, the CapEx that it takes to get there, the logistics that we have, the location that we have, all of those play to our favor regardless of how the commodity markets move day to day.

So the first thing I would do is actually zoom out just a little bit and think about blended sales actually further down the value chain. So it's naturally going to be a higher-margin sale than, say, a bulk sale that doesn't have a RIN or a blend component to it. So we stated publicly that we're in that 70% to 75% from a blend perspective from an RVO. So we're just naturally further down the value chain. 
I think you hit on a couple of things, though. The volatility is important. So the RVO is a 12-month compliance window, and it's really how you execute your compliance strategy. And it's the volatility actually in the high RIN environment that we're in now provides opportunities for probably an outperform or an underperformed, depending on the execution of your compliance program and how you meet those obligations. So that is something that's probably not been as transparent to the marketplace as we historically were around $0.5-or-so on RINs. But now in this environment, it does provide an opportunity. It's high risk, high reward, but we feel confident with our ability to execute both from a blended perspective of what we blend, but also on the compliance program."

Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvements in the demand for our products as the rollout of COVID vaccinations and the removal of mobility restrictions have led to more economic activity and increased demand for transportation fuels. That said, we're close to the end of the summer driving season, which is typically our strongest part of the year. Gasoline demand is currently 2% to 5% below 2019 levels, with the West Coast still lagging at about 10% down. Diesel demand continues to hold up well and is flat to 2019. 
Despite the growing levels of personal passenger traffic, we continue to see an absence of the longer-haul international flights and business travel. Overall, jet demand remains down nearly 30% below pre-pandemic levels. The full return of aviation fuel demand will likely still take some time, particularly with the recent increasing spread of the COVID-19 variants. As we head into the second half of the year, we remain hopeful but cautious in the recovery and so we'll remain focused on the elements of our business within our control.
Slide 4 highlights progress on our strategic priorities for the quarter. First, on May 14, we closed the sale of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven. In conjunction with the close, we announced our plans to return $10 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. As part of our commitment to quickly return capital, we immediately launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in which we were able to repurchase nearly $1 billion worth of shares. As we shared in our release this morning, we are proceeding with the next steps in our plan to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital over the next 12 to 16 months. 
Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Dickinson reached full design capacity during the quarter. At approximately 180 million gallons per year, Dickinson is the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States. At Martinez, we're progressing detailed engineering and permitting to convert that oil refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Based on our progress and discussion with feedstock suppliers, we're confident in the time line we have set to begin producing renewable diesel in the second half of 2022, with approximately 260 million gallons per year of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of '23.
Third, we continue to keep a diligent focus on cost and capital in a challenging commodity business such as ours, being a low-cost operator ensures we will remain competitive. We have continued to challenge ourselves to examine all aspects of spend, and as a result, have delivered incremental progress. In the first half of 2021, our operating results reflect our goal to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1 billion. 
Importantly, I want to note that in June, we published our 2 annual ESG-related reports. Our sustainability report provides an in-depth look at the company's sustainability approach and performance consistent with the reporting guidance from SASB and GRI. Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios follows guidance from TCFD and analyzes the company's resiliency relative to climate scenarios put forth by the IEA. 
On Slide 5, I'd like to take a moment to go over some of the ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to balance the needs of today while investing in a sustainable energy diverse future. That includes strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conservative natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies, and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders.
We currently have 3 company-wide targets many of our investors know well. First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030. Second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025. And lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance 2 significant renewable fuels projects. In late '20, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson, North Dakota facility, second largest of its kind in the United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery to a renewable diesel facility.
Finally, to demonstrate our focus on making sustainability pervasive in all we do for executives and employees, we link a portion of the annual bonus program to an ESG metric. We recently introduced a diversity, equity and inclusion component to these metrics as well, making us the first U.S. independent downstream company to link improving diversity to compensation in the same way we led the industry in linking GHG intensity reductions to our compensation last year.
Safety in our operations is another key to sustainable operations. In 2020, our teams demonstrated strong safety and environmental performance, including a nearly 40% reduction in the most significant process safety events and a 40% reduction in designated environmental incidents over 2019. Our personal safety performance continues to be better than industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream sectors.
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review second quarter results."

This includes the results from both continuing and dis",1348,"Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion for the quarter. This includes the results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital, was $1.535 billion, which is approximately $1 billion increase from the prior quarter. And for the first time in nearly 18 months, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business, capital commitments as well as covered our dividend and distributions. Finally, we returned nearly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases.
The close of the Speedway sale marked a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. So we wanted to call out some of the key points on Slide 7. We received total proceeds for the sale of Speedway of $21 billion. Based on our tax basis, our cash taxes, current and deferred, will be approximately $4.2 billion, which is lower than our original $4.5 billion estimate. We have accrued for this on the balance sheet.
In addition, we had closing adjustments of approximately $400 million. Therefore, the after-tax proceeds from the sale will be $17.2 billion. To be clear, this number is higher than our initial $16.5 billion estimate.
On Slide 8, we present an overview of the use of the proceeds. Since the close of the transaction, we have reduced structural debt by $2.5 billion and purchased approximately $1 billion of stock. In the post-tender period, we did not repurchase any incremental shares in light of a couple of regulatory constraints: first, a post-tender cooling off period; and second, our routine quarterly restricted period in the lead up to the release of our earnings information. That said, not repurchasing during that limited window is not indicative of any deviation from our commitment to complete within 12 to 16 months. 
Consistent with that commitment, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are commencing the next steps to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital. Specifically, we are entering into an open-market repurchase program that will allow us to buy for a period of time, including when the company may have information that otherwise precludes us from trading, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls.
Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made, lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have made a step change in our refining operating cost and decreased our overall cost profile by approximately $1 billion. While there is quarter-to-quarter variability, our refining operating cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021. 
We have applied the same cost discipline framework that we use for refining operating costs to our corporate costs as well. There may be variations in these corporate costs quarter-to-quarter. We believe we have lowered our overall cost structure by more than $100 million, and we are committed to challenging ourselves every day on ways to reduce expenses. 
As you know, natural gas is a variable cost in operating a refinery. These costs have recently increased nearly $1 per MMBtu, and we anticipate this being a headwind for the third quarter. While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities, and in no way, jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations.
Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2021 to second quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was more than $600 million higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing. As we previously mentioned, this quarter's results include the impacts of closing the Speedway sale.
Here, you can see the $11.7 billion pretax gain on the sale reflected in the adjustments column of $11.6 billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairment and transaction-related costs. The $3.7 billion financial tax -- excuse me, financial tax provision reflects the net impact of cash taxes and deferred tax impact. The resulting $8 billion gain on sale is reflected in our quarterly net income. Slide 18 in our appendix walk through the specific impacts of the Speedway sale across the 3 financial statements.
Moving to our segment slide -- results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segment. The business recorded the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA since the start of the COVID pandemic with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million. This was an increase of $728 million when compared to the first quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Mid-Con region as that region's cracks improved 57% from the first quarter. Also contributing to the improved results was higher utilization, which was 94% for the second quarter versus 83% in the first quarter.
It's important to recall that we idled 2 high-cost refineries in 2020. If adjusted to include that capacity idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 78% in the first quarter of '21 and subsequently increased to 89% in the second quarter of '21. Operating expenses were relatively flat with the previous quarter despite the increase in utilization, reflecting the team's commitment to cost discipline despite rising variable cost.
Slide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress executing on the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, lowering the cost structure and portfolio optimization. By the end of 2021, we estimate that MPLX will have decreased their structural cost by $300 million.
Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. It reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations. We have also specifically called out items related to the Speedway close. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.5 billion in the quarter. Changes in working capital were flat this quarter. Increasing crude prices provided a source of more than $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory builds.
During the quarter, MPC decreased debt by $3.3 billion. Additionally, MPLX reduced third-party debt by approximately $800 million during the quarter. With respect to capital return, MPC returned $380 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $981 million worth of shares using Speedway proceeds. At the end of the quarter, NPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposits.
Turning to guidance. On Slide 14, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $195 million in the third quarter. The majority of the activity will be at our Robinson and Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region. 
As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back-half weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. And so you are seeing the impact in our guided cost trends for the third quarter. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.05 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately $100 billion -- $100 million, excuse me, in cost that have been removed on an annual basis.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

So obviously, with the administration change and with the agenda that they have out there, they're looking for ways to pay for the programs that they have in place. So we're aware of the potential there. Obviously, there's a couple bills that are involved with that dynamic. I would tell you, right now, our thinking though, is that we would stay in the MLP structure because we don't think it's going to change. We don't know for sure. Obviously, if it did lose its tax status, it would change our dynamic. 
But right now, Doug, if you're asking what's the probability, I think we are on the side of -- we don't think it is going to change, and we think the partnership will still maintain its tax status. So obviously, for the size of the MLP that we have, if all of a sudden, it was a taxed entity you're looking at around $800 million to $1 billion of cash flow that would be lost. And I know others have asked this in the past. 
I mean it's predominantly the #1 reason why we maintain the partnership structure as compared to converting to a C corp. There's 2 dynamics that come into play. One is an immediate tax impact to all unitholders, of which MPC is the largest, obviously. And then more importantly is to the ongoing cash flow change that would occur at MPLX. 
So we understand some of the pros and cons of the structure. At the same time, we think having that cash flow keeps us in the MLP mode. So obviously, if the rules change, if the administration does something different, we'll adapt accordingly. But in the short term, we still support the structure because it gives us that additional cash flow as opposed to a tax burden."

So throughout the time from the announcement to close, we reiterated to investors that we wanted to do it as quickly and efficiently as possible. To meet our commitment of quickly, we offered a Dutch tender. The market spoke and said $1 billion as opposed to what we had offered out as far as the total liquidity. Now we are, as Maryann said in the remarks, we're going to go more opportunistic and be in an open market environment.
So some of the questions that we get from people is are we still committed to that? And as Maryann said, we want to reiterate, we are committed to that. Nothing has changed in our thought process there. It is going to take time. To your point, it is a large number. We are limited by the amount of trading volume we have and the liquidity that we have in our shares. So that is part of the constraint that we have, but we are committed to returning it.

Even if refining only contributes like $100 million to $200 million to overall free cash flow, you can meet your dividend obligation. 
And once you do execute this buyback there's like $320 million or so dividend obligation reduction. So what I'm trying to get to is, not that refining will not make a positive free cash flow but you actually do not need a positive refining free cash flow to meet the dividend obligation. Am I thinking about these parameters correctly?"

In fact, if anything, Maryann just mentioned, as refining runs have come back up kind of with the recovery, variable costs have come up, but we've been able to maintain a pretty consistent level of OpEx there. So that's been a good story for us.
We do have, again, natural gas potentially going up. But overall, we're going to continue to challenge the portfolio, both on the refining side of the business, also in the midstream side of the business. For those who listened to the MPLX call, we had originally stated about $200 million of cost reductions at MPLX. We've now increased that to about $300 million, about another $100 million that we feel pretty comfortable that we can take out of that business as well. So it's going to continue to be an area of focus for us. That's never going to change. 
We'll look for opportunities for us to optimize our system where we can. And back to your original point, we did have a couple closures. They were our highest cost facilities, but we're going to continue to evaluate the portfolio. I've said a couple times to people that I want to get out of this pandemic environment to see what things look like afterwards, but we are still evaluating all assets of the portfolio.

So we're going to have to see, Theresa, to be honest with you, we're going to have to see how the COVID plays itself out into the second half of the year and as we approach another winter season.

Is there a preference at this point between the 2 if that is the path forward? 
And just on the latter, if you drop things down once fully cash flowing thinking, this is, I believe, your previous strategy with Capline and keeping that upstairs until it is fully reversed because when you boil it all down for Martinez, I imagine this would really delineate like a pretty meaningfully different amount of capital that MPLX could contribute to fund the project?"

The other thing I'll talk about Martinez is, whether it's phase 1 or phase 2, phase 3 is, we did our -- when we looked at this project, we looked at it with different feedstock capabilities and the most conservative feedstock availability for phase 1.

We have a lot of opportunity there to provide value. And then the ultimate logistics is we're in California where we're sitting on the demand. So location also matters.
So regardless of what happens in the marketplace, and it will ebb and flow just like every other commodity market. The reason we're so bullish on our Martinez asset is those factors that are in place day-in and day-out.

So it's naturally going to be a higher-margin sale than, say, a bulk sale that doesn't have a RIN or a blend component to it. So we stated publicly that we're in that 70% to 75% from a blend perspective from an RVO. So we're just naturally further down the value chain.
I think you hit on a couple of things, though. The volatility is important. So the RVO is a 12-month compliance window, and it's really how you execute your compliance strategy. And it's the volatility actually in the high RIN environment that we're in now provides opportunities for probably an outperform or an underperform depending on the execution of your compliance program and how you meet those obligations. 
So that is something that's probably not been as transparent to the marketplace as we historically were around $0.05-or-so on RINs. But now in this environment, it does provide an opportunity. It's high risk, high reward, but we feel confident with our ability to execute both from a blended perspective of what we blend, but also on the compliance program."

Before we get into results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. [indiscernible] by Hurricane Ida. The eye of the hurricane passed over our Garyville refinery with wind speeds topping 120 miles per hour. F",1132,"Thanks, Kristina. Before we get into results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. [indiscernible] by Hurricane Ida. The eye of the hurricane passed over our Garyville refinery with wind speeds topping 120 miles per hour. Fortunately, all of our employees in the region were safe, but many of them experienced severe damage to their homes and the communities around them. Our team was able to shut down our refinery in a controlled manner a day ahead of the storm and ensure operational integrity and safety of all of our employees. It took roughly a week to restore some power, the first crude unit to restart over the next several days. The remainder of the refinery restarted sequentially over the next as more power became available to the facility.
I'd like to recognize our refining team and our support groups for their dedication and efforts. Our commercial teams also did an excellent job in keeping our customers in the region supplied through coordinated efforts across the company. Maryann will cover the specific impacts when she reviews the refining results. In addition to the Louisiana hurricane, our Los Angeles refinery was impacted by an earthquake on September 18. Again, the major challenge was the loss of power. Once power was restored, the units were restarted, the refinery was back to normal operations in roughly 1 week. Our teams did an excellent job responding to these events and minimizing the negative impact of our financial results.
Looking more broadly, during the quarter, we saw gradual increases in the demand for our products as mobility continued to recover. Globally, product inventories are at their tightest level in many years, and this improvement has lifted margins.
In the U.S., gasoline and diesel inventories have steadily improved and are both at the low end of their 5-year averages. Jet fuel inventories have moved into the 5-year range, although demand is still well below pre-pandemic levels, and we expect that to be a headwind for some time. Our system is seeing gasoline demand currently 2% to 3% below 2019 levels with the West Coast still lagging at about 8% below.
Diesel demand is now slightly above 2019 levels. Jet demand has improved, but still remains down nearly 15% to 20% below pre-pandemic levels. Natural gas costs steadily rose during the quarter, with an average increase of over $1 from the second to the third quarter. There's still some uncertainty as we head into the fourth quarter, but lower inventory levels and strong holiday travel could be supportive. And looking at next year, if global product inventories remain tight and demand continues to recover, we would expect the refining sector to rebound in 2022.
At the same time, we're watching prices to see if there's a consumer demand pullback. On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we advanced several key initiatives. We progressed our renewables initiative with the addition of a new strategic partnership with ADM. This JV will own and operate ADM soybean processing complex in Spiritwood, North Dakota.
Upon completion, which is expected in 2023, this facility will source and process local soybeans, supplying approximately 600 million pounds of soybean oil exclusively for MPC, enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. While this JV provides a locally advantaged feedstock for our Dickinson project, we continue to evaluate feedstock options for our Martinez facility in California.
At Martinez, our renewable fuels facility conversion reached another project milestone when its environmental impact report was issued for public comment in mid-October. The process highlights our extensive effort working with the local regulators and other stakeholders.
Also in October, United Airlines, Marathon and others conducted a successful test late of a 737, which flew for 90 minutes using drop-in sustainable aviation fuel. The SAFUs during the test flight was 100% renewable, drop in made possible by proprietary technology from Virent, our wholly-owned subsidiary, which has a demonstration plant in Madison.
And as we continue to focus on ways to strengthen the competitive position of our assets, we announced that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for the Kenai refinery, which could include a potential sale. We often share our belief that our business is both a return on and a return of capital business. In this quarter, we made progress strengthening our portfolio, continuing our low-cost focus and progressing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.
Today, we've completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we're confident in our ability to return the remaining $7.5 billion by the end of 2022.
Finally, MPLX announced a third quarter distribution consisting of a 2.5% increase to its base distribution amount and a special distribution amount as well. As you can see, we'll receive a total of $829 million. This announcement reinforces the strategic importance of MPLX as part of MPC's portfolio and its ability to return substantial cash to MPC and all unitholders.
Slide 4 provides a framework around some of the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. Our facility spans the environmental, social and government and governance or ESG dimensions of our operations. Incumbent in resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conserving natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies, and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders.
We have 3 company-wide targets many of our investors and stakeholders know well. First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030. Second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025. And lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance 2 significant renewable fuels projects.
In late 2020, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson, North Dakota facility, the second largest of its kind in the United States and are progressing the Martinez California refinery to a renewable diesel facility.
I'd also like to highlight a few specifics from the quarter. We were recently awarded an ESG A rating by MSCI. We are the only U.S.-based refiner that holds this rating. We continue to focus on enhancing our disclosures in this quarter. We also submitted data on our Scope 3 emissions through CDP, and we are the first in our refining sector to do so. We invite you to go to the Sustainability section of our website and learn more about how we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy.
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the third quarter results."
118315802,1682566469,2421450,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Marathon Petroleum Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.09, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.73. Adjusted earnings exclude $48 million of pretax charges primarily related to",1715,"Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.09, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.73. Adjusted earnings exclude $48 million of pretax charges primarily related to Hurricane Ida, impairments and idling cost. [indiscernible] the adjustments include an incremental $272 million of tax expense which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate.
Our year-to-date effective rate is just under 2%. We, therefore, expect to retain the tax benefits realized in 2021, continue to make this tax rate adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $500 million higher from the prior quarter. Cash from operations, excluding working capital and a voluntary pension contribution was nearly $1.8 billion, which is an increase of $230 million from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we paid $575 million into our pension plan. We elected to contribute this additional amount as it was beneficial from a tax perspective. This amount covers nearly 3 years of estimated contributions, and we forecast the plan would be fully funded at year-end. This also increased the benefit to a total of $2.3 billion.
Similar to last quarter, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business and capital commitments as well as covered our dividend and distributions. Finally, we returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.
Slide 6 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have taken almost $1.5 billion out of the company's total costs. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion. Midstream reduced by $300 million and corporate cost by about $100 million. Regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion. We continue to emphasize our safe, reliable and low-cost focus the organization.
While we do not see further cost reductions of the same magnitude that we have already taken out, there are still opportunities for us to reduce cost. Natural gas prices were higher in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. For every $1 change in natural gas prices we anticipate there is an approximate $360 million impact to annual EBITDA to our R&M segment.
Based on current prices, we estimate that in the fourth quarter, higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our refining cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021 as we continue -- and we continue to believe these are structural reductions. While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline every day, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate.
As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities and in no way, jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations.
Slide 7 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter 2021 to third quarter 2021, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $500 higher quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by refining and marketing, but also benefiting from our strength in midstream. $48 million of pretax charges during the quarter reflected in the adjustment column.
Moving to our segment results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segment. business reported continuing improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion. This was an increase of $444 million when compared to the second quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Gulf Coast region as that region's cracks improved 34% from the second quarter 
As mentioned, our Garyville refinery was impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $19 million this quarter with an additional $11 million to be incurred in the fourth quarter. We estimate the lost opportunity from the hurricane to be approximately $80 million. The Garyville refinery was down for about 10 days and took another 10 days to ramp back up to full production.
The throughput impact was approximately 8.3 million barrels. We also believe there was an additional $10 million of lost opportunity impact associated with the earthquake at our Los Angeles refinery, which was back to the planned rate after roughly 1 week. Utilization was 93% for the quarter -- with the second quarter, we saw lower utilization in the Gulf Coast compared to the second quarter due to hurricane impacts. The Mid-Con region continued its strong utilization and West Coast strengthened as reopening in California continued to increase demand. If adjusted to include capacity, which was idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 88% in the third quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices.
Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2021, our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. This strong cash flow profile and lower capital spending supported the decision to return more cash to unitholders.
Today, MPLX announced a 2.5% increase in the partnerships, base quarterly distribution and a special distribution amount of approximately $600 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter, our midstream assets in the region were also impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $4 million this quarter, with an additional $7 million to be incurred in the fourth quarter.
Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $1.765 billion in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this excludes changes in working capital and an incremental payment of approximately $575 million into our pension plan. Also, this amount does changes to our care tax receivable in the quarter, which was a $500 million cash and is included in the income taxes bar of this chart. Working capital was really flat this quarter.
During the quarter, MPLX reduced its third-party debt by $1 billion, funded by borrowing an additional $877 million under the MPC or Marathon intercompany loan agreement. Our income tax balances represented a use of cash, primarily driven by a decrease in accrued taxes. We made a tax payment due for the Speedway gain of $2.9 billion, out of a total of $4.2 billion we have accrued. We were able to offset about $400 million of the amount using our CARES tax receivable. There were about $100 million of other charges in our tax balances.
During the quarter, we adjusted our CARES tax refund up to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion last quarter. We have identified a total of about $700 million that can be offset against our Speedway tax obligation, including the $400 million we used this quarter and $300 million that we expect to use in the fourth quarter of 2021 to offset remaining balances for taxes due from our Speedway acquisition. We received $1.55 billion of the CARES Act refund in October. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect to receive in the first half of 2022.
With respect to capital return, NPC returned $370 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $908 million worth of shares in the quarter using Speedway's proceeds. At the end of the quarter, MPC had $13.2 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit.
Last quarter, we promised to continue to provide status updates on our progress deploying Speedway proceeds. We have repurchased an incremental $1.5 billion in shares since the end of the second quarter. This is comprised of $928 million of repurchase in the third quarter plus additional shares purchased through the end of October. As Mike indicated, we are approximately 25% complete with our $10 billion share repurchase program. We are continuing to use a program that allows us to buy on an ongoing basis, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls.
To meet our $10 billion share repurchase commitment, we are progressing steps to be able to complete the remaining repurchases of approximately $7.5 billion by the end of 2022, the options we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete this objective. Today, we also announced that we intend to redeem an additional $2.1 billion of debt. This entails 2 tranches of notes that mature in 2023.
Given the current interest rate environment as well as our cash position, it makes economic sense to redeem these notes early, and we anticipate this will lead to roughly $20 million of savings. The short-term cash management provides immediate interest payment savings and we'll have the ability to reissue notes at the appropriate time. With this redemption, we have no maturities over the next 3 years.
Our third quarter debt-to-capital ratio for MPC, excluding NPL approximately 24%. The redemption of these notes will continue to lower this ratio. As we manage our balance sheet, we continue to ensure that we maintain our investment-grade credit portfolio.
Turning to guidance on [indiscernible] our fourth quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day, planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Mid-Con region. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.40 barrel for the quarter. Based on the current prices, we estimate that in the fourth quarter, higher natural have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million reflecting the approximately $100 million in costs that have been removed on an annual basis.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

I'll turn the question over to Mike on MPLX."

So I'm going to give you a little bit of a long-winded answer, but hopefully, I'll get to the meat of your question. So MPLX, one of the things that we decided to do was to move the business model such that we would have free cash after distributions and after growth capital that would put us in a financial flexibility situation and have options. We achieved that about the third quarter of 2020. And as a result of that, we now have a situation where we have capital for deployment at MPLX that can be growth capital, buybacks, additional distribution to the base as you saw us bump that up today. Additional distribution amounts in the form of a special, which we talked about a little bit here, and I'll address it further.
But the bottom line there is we're going to be dynamic and evaluating what's the best opportunity for us on that side of the house based on market conditions, business needs, et cetera, et cetera. An important note from the MPC side of it is we often get asked the question, how does MPLX provide value to MPC shareholders. Well, we tried to enumerate many different ways, but this is one other example where this is additional cash that's coming from MPLX to MPC. So at the base distribution amount, MPC gets about $1.8 billion, and that's been pretty ratable since 2020.
With this special distribution amount, it will now be $2.2 billion because it's about $400 million MPCs take of the special that went to all unitholders. So instead of, let's say, EBITDA from MPC, you're at $2.2 million, and we'll continue to evaluate that going forward. It's clearly our intent to grow earnings at MPLX. And as a result of that, there's going to be more cash available to come to MPC over time, whether it's through distributions, to the base or special while we also continue to look at buybacks at MPC as well. So hopefully, everybody sees this as a nice strategic importance of MPLX and to MPC shareholders as part of our overall scheme here. Does that make sense to you, Neil? 
SPEAKER05
No, that's really helpful, Mike. And my follow-up is kind of a housekeeping modeling type of stuff, which has 2 parts to it. One is tax rate came in a little bit lower than expected this quarter. Should we think about the tax rate going forward, given that midstream is such a big part of the earnings lower than the 24% effective tax rate that we've been base casing? And then just any flavor on '22 CapEx? So 2 kind of [indiscernible]"

So you're absolutely right. In the quarter, frankly, we actually did from continuing operations, about an $18 million benefit.

In the quarter, frankly, we actually did from continuing operations, about an $18 million benefit. Part of that is driven by our ability to carry back the incremental pension contribution and some other favorable discrete items in the quarter. The second question is whether or not we would actually migrate towards a statutory rate of 24%. And I think you've articulated that as we look at the amount of noncontrolling interest, we would most likely not see a statutory rate of 24%. But as the level of R&M continues to improve against that we'll see that rate get higher than the 2% that you were seeing on a year-to-date basis. So we will migrate from 2% trending toward, but we would not reach the statutory rate. We have to make this adjustment since the first quarter of 2020. And we'll do that in the fourth quarter for consistency but most likely going forward beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will not be making a tax adjustment to bring all of our earnings to 24%. I hope that answered the question.
And then I'll address your second question around capital. As you saw, we had a significant reduction from 2020 to 2021, and we're largely on track to reach that CapEx number for 2021. We have not given guidance for 2022 as yet, and we'll do that on our fourth quarter earnings call as we normally do. But I think one of the key strategic pillars along with cost reduction is strict capital discipline. We've begun to outline for you the amount of capital that we are targeting or committing to renewables, and we would expect to be able to share that with you as well for when we give our guidance."

I often say, I use the football analogy that just getting it between the 40s, let alone try and cycle.
So -- but most importantly for me, Doug, I will tell you the way we manage the company is we're not concerned about calling the 50% versus the 40%. I'd like to think about the 2 end zones. How do we feel about a low environment in a high environment? And how are we set up from a portfolio standpoint whether each of those come at us. Because over time, as you've seen, you'll see a little high margin environments. And then obviously, we've seen some pretty low ones with the pandemic. So I don't really have a number for you. That's not something we see with Obviously, internally, we also like to think about where is our balance sheet and leverage, et cetera, et cetera. As Maryann talked about, right now, we're in a different situation than normal, a lot of cash on the balance. We did a short-term optimization around that cash management. Ultimately, I think our leverage to a normal mid-cycle would be higher in the future. But we'll keep debating that and ultimately try and frame ourselves that we're in a good position. But at the end of the day, I don't have the crystal ball to tell you exactly what I think mid-cycle is going to be. But I do think that we're going to manage the company such that we're prepared for either end of it, and we're going to have management disciplines and financial disciplines around those scenarios."

We made early moves to idle some high-cost facilities in our refining system. Converted Martinez to renewable diesel, that's in progress. completed a feedstock JV and an equity position in the feedstock situation for Dickinson.
So we continue to examine the portfolio. I think we've done some things that shows the market that it is a high priority for us. It's 1 of my 3 main initiatives that I stated from the start. With respect to Kenai, I would tell you that normally, I'm not a big fan in stuff until things are done or not as a general rule.
But in this particular case, we have done an analysis and the reason we disclose it now is we're in pretty advanced discussions with several parties. And because of the timing of this call, we didn't want to have this call. And if something progresses to closure in the near future, we didn't want everybody saying, ""hey, why didn't you do it?"" So we decided to kind of go off our norm a little bit and disclose that we may be able to execute something here in the short term, but it may not happen as well. So we're trying to be as open as transparent as we can be. We're evaluating it. It is advanced discussions, and that's the main reason that we've decided to the market, that's where we are.
But I will tell you that we'll continue to evaluate the portfolio. There's more work in our mind that needs to be done. And hopefully, over time, people continue to see a pattern of us challenging ourselves to have a very robust portfolio that works in all market conditions. And ultimately, what I try and say to our team is we want all of our assets to provide free cash over the cycle of cash flows and margin environments that we hit."

Parts of the portfolio that we do not think long term is core. But at the same time, we're generating free cash from those areas, and we'll continue to keep those part of the portfolio unless we see something that adds more value. The bid ask on the noncore has been wide and like I say, maybe no good de goes unpunished.
The fact that we've been open about that option, I think, has led people to try and low ball us as far as some of the bids. But we know what the value of the assets are in our mind. We're not going to move them for numbers less than that. We're happy with the execution of the assets at this point.
So we're in a what I call a good position. We're generating free cash. The portfolio is working for us. We'll look for an opportunity if it makes sense at some point to divest something that we think can be more useful to somebody else in the long term. But if not, we'll manage the capital into those areas and continue to generate free cash and deploy capital where we think there's more longer-term value.

And then, of course, as we complete the share repurchase, we'll see that leverage move up a bit as well.

Before we get into results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. Midway through the quarter, we were impacted by Hurricane Ida. The Ida Hurricane passed over our Garyville refinery with wind speeds topping",1146,"Thanks, Kristina. Before we get into results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. Midway through the quarter, we were impacted by Hurricane Ida. The Ida Hurricane passed over our Garyville refinery with wind speeds topping 120 miles per hour. Fortunately, all of our employees in the region were safe, but many of them experienced severe damage to their homes and the communities around them. Our team was able to shut down our refinery in a controlled manner a day ahead of the storm and ensure operational integrity and safety of all of our employees. It took roughly a week to restore some power, which enabled the first crude unit to restart over the next several days. The remainder of the refinery restarted sequentially over the next 10 days as more power became available to the facility. 
I'd like to recognize our refining team and our support groups for their dedication and efforts. Our commercial teams also did an excellent job in keeping our customers in the region supplied through coordinated efforts across the company. Maryann will cover the specific impacts when she reviews the refining results. In addition to the Louisiana hurricane, our Los Angeles refinery was impacted by an earthquake on September 18. Again, the major challenge was the loss of power. Once power was restored, the units were restarted, the refinery was back to normal operations in roughly one week. 
Our teams did an excellent job responding to these events and minimizing the negative impact of our financial results. Looking more broadly, during the quarter, we saw gradual increases in the demand for our products as mobility continued to recover. Globally, product inventories are at their tightest level in many years, and this improvement has lifted margins. 
In the U.S., gasoline and diesel inventories have steadily improved and are both at the low end of their 5-year averages. Jet fuel inventories have moved into the 5-year range, although demand is still well below pre-pandemic levels, and we expect that to be a headwind for some time. Our system is seeing gasoline demand currently 2% to 3% below 2019 levels with the West Coast still lagging at about 8% below. 
Diesel demand is now slightly above 2019 levels. Jet demand has improved, but still remains down, nearly 15% to 20% below pre-pandemic levels. Natural gas costs steadily rose during the quarter, with an average increase of over $1 from the second to the third quarter. There's still some uncertainty as we head into the fourth quarter, but lower inventory levels and strong holiday travel could be supportive. And looking at next year, if global product inventories remain tight and demand continues to recover, we would expect the refining sector to rebound in 2022. 
At the same time, we're watching prices to see if there's a consumer demand pullback. On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we advanced several key initiatives. We progressed our renewables initiative with the addition of a new strategic partnership with ADM. This JV will own and operate ADM soybean processing complex in Spiritwood, North Dakota. Upon completion, which is expected in 2023, this facility will source and process local soybeans, supplying approximately 600 million pounds of soybean oil exclusively for MPC, enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. While this JV provides a locally advantaged feedstock for our Dickinson project, we continue to evaluate feedstock options for our Martinez facility in California. 
At Martinez, our renewable fuels facility conversion reached another project milestone when its environmental impact report was issued for public comment in mid-October. The process highlights our extensive effort working with the local regulators and other stakeholders. Also in October, United Airlines, Marathon and others conducted a successful test flight of a 737, which flew for 90 minutes using drop-in sustainable aviation fuel. The SAF used during the test flight was 100% renewable drop-in fuel made possible by proprietary technology from Virent, our wholly-owned subsidiary, which has a demonstration plant in Madison, Wisconsin.
And as we continue to focus on ways to strengthen the competitive position of our assets, today we announce that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for the Kenai refinery, which could include a potential sale. We often share our belief that our business is both a return on and a return of capital business. In this quarter, we made progress strengthening our portfolio, continuing our low-cost focus and progressing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. 
As of today, we've completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we're confident in our ability to return the remaining $7.5 billion by the end of 2022. 
Finally, MPLX announced a third quarter distribution consisting of a 2.5% increase to its base distribution amount and a special distribution amount as well. MPC will receive a total of $829 million. This announcement reinforces the strategic importance of MPLX as part of MPC's portfolio and its ability to return substantial cash to MPC and all unitholders. 
Slide 4 provides a framework around some of the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. Our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social and governance or ESG dimensions of our operations. It encompasses strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conserving natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies, and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders. 
We have three company-wide targets many of our investors and stakeholders know well. First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030. Second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025. And lastly, a 20% reduction in our freshwater withdrawal intensity by 2030. 
The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects. In late 2020, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson, North Dakota facility, the second largest of its kind in the United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez California refinery to a renewable diesel facility. 
I'd also like to highlight a few specific updates from the quarter. We were recently awarded an ESG A rating by MSCI. We are the only U.S.-based refiner that holds this rating. We continue to focus on enhancing our disclosures in this quarter. We also submitted data on our Scope 3 emissions through CDP. And we are the first in our refining sector to do so. We invite you to go to the Sustainability section of our website and learn more about how we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. 
At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the third quarter results."

This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.09, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.73. Adjusted earnings exclude $48 million of pretax charges primarily related to Hurricane Ida, impairments and idling cost. Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $272 million of tax expense which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate. 
Our year-to-date effective rate is just under 2%. We, therefore, expect to retain the tax benefits realized in 2021. We will continue to make this tax rate adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $500 million higher from the prior quarter. 
Cash from operations, excluding working capital and a voluntary pension contribution was nearly $1.8 billion, which is an increase of $230 million from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we paid $575 million into our pension plan. We elected to contribute this additional amount, as it was beneficial from a tax perspective. This amount covers nearly 3 years of estimated contributions, and we forecast the plan would be fully funded at year-end. This also increased the CARES Act benefit to a total of $2.3 billion. 
Similar to last quarter, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business and capital commitments as well as covered our dividend and distributions. Finally, we returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. 
Slide 6 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have taken almost $1.5 billion out of the company's total costs. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion. Midstream reduced by $300 million and corporate cost by about $100 million. Regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion. 
We continue to emphasize our safe, reliable and low-cost focus the organization. While we do not see further cost reductions of the same magnitude that we have already taken out, there are still opportunities for us to reduce cost. Natural gas prices were higher in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. For every $1 change in natural gas prices, we anticipate there is an approximate $360 million impact to annual EBITDA to our R&M segment. Based on current prices, we estimate that in the fourth quarter, higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our refining cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021 as we continue -- and we continue to believe these are structural reductions. 
While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. 
As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities and in no way, jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations. 
Slide 7 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter 2021 to third quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $500 higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing, but also benefiting from our strength in midstream. $48 million of pretax charges during the quarter reflected in the adjustment column. 
Moving to our segment results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported continuing improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion -- This was an increase of $444 million when compared to the second quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Gulf Coast region, as that region's crack improved 34% from the second quarter. 
As Mike mentioned, our Garyville refinery was impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $19 million this quarter with an additional $11 million to be incurred in the fourth quarter. We estimate the lost opportunity from the hurricane to be approximately $80 million. The Garyville refinery was down for about 10 days and took another 10 days to ramp back up to full production. 
The throughput impact was approximately 8.3 million barrels. We also believe there was an additional $10 million of lost opportunity impact associated with the earthquake at our Los Angeles refinery, which was back to the planned rate after roughly one week. Utilization was 93% for the quarter flat with the second quarter, we saw lower utilization in the Gulf Coast compared to the second quarter due to hurricane impacts. The Mid-Con region continued its strong utilization and West Coast strengthened as reopening in California continued to increase demand. If adjusted to include capacity, which was idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 88% in the third quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. 
Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2021, our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. This strong cash flow profile and lower capital spending supported the decision to return more cash to unitholders. 
Today, MPLX announced a 2.5% increase in the partnerships based quarterly distribution and a special distribution amount of approximately $600 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter, our midstream assets in the region were also impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $4 million this quarter, with an additional $7 million to be incurred in the fourth quarter. 
Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $1.765 billion in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this excludes changes in working capital and an incremental payment of approximately $575 million into our pension plans. Also, this amount does changes to our CARES tax receivable in the quarter, which was a $500 million source of cash and is included in the income taxes bar of this chart. Working capital was really flat this quarter. 
During the quarter, MPLX reduced its third-party debt by $1 billion, funded by borrowing an additional $877 million under the MPC or Marathon intercompany loan agreement. Our income tax balances represented a use of cash, primarily driven by a decrease in accrued taxes. We made a tax payment due for the Speedway gain of $2.9 billion, out of a total of $4.2 billion we have accrued. We were able to offset about $400 million of the amount using our CARES tax receivable. There were about $100 million of other charges in our tax balances. 
During the quarter, we adjusted our CARES tax refund up to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion last quarter. We have identified a total of about $700 million that can be offset against our Speedway tax obligation, including the $400 million we used this quarter and $300 million that we expect to use in the fourth quarter of 2021 to offset remaining balances for taxes due from our Speedway transaction. We received $1.55 billion of the CARES Act refund in October. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect to receive in the first half of 2022. 
With respect to capital return, MPC returned $370 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $928 million worth of shares in the quarter using Speedway's proceeds. At the end of the quarter, MPC had $13.2 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit. 
Last quarter, we promised to continue to provide status updates on our progress, deploying Speedway proceeds. We have repurchased an incremental $1.5 billion in shares since the end of the second quarter. This is comprised of $928 million of repurchase in the third quarter plus additional shares purchased through the end of October. As Mike indicated, we are approximately 25% complete with our $10 billion share repurchase program. We are continuing to use a program that allows us to buy on an ongoing basis, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls. 
To meet our $10 billion share repurchase commitment, we are progressing steps to be able to complete the remaining repurchases of approximately $7.5 billion by the end of 2022, the options we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete this objective. Today, we also announce that we intend to redeem an additional $2.1 billion of debt. This entails 2 tranches of notes that mature in 2023. Given the current interest rate environment as well as our cash position, it makes economic sense to redeem these notes early, and we anticipate this will lead to roughly $20 million of savings. This short-term cash management provides immediate interest payment savings and we'll have the ability to reissue notes at the appropriate time. With this redemption, we have no maturities over the next 3 years. 
Our third quarter debt-to-capital ratio for MPC, excluding MPLX was approximately 24%. The redemption of these notes will continue to lower this ratio. As we manage our balance sheet, we continue to ensure that we maintain our investment-grade credit portfolio. 
Turning to guidance. On Slide 12, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day, planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Mid-Con region. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.40 barrel for the quarter. Based on the current prices, we estimate that in the fourth quarter, higher natural have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half-way to this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million reflecting the approximately $100 million in cost that have been removed on an annual basis. 
With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina."

We do believe that we have opportunity as we go forward, given the timing of our earnings to be a little more opportunistic. So I would not assume in any way that ratably is the only plan that we have.

So I'm going to give you a little bit of a long-winded answer, but hopefully, I'll get to the meat of your question. So at MPLX, one of the things that we decided to do was to move the business model such that we would have free cash after distributions and after growth capital that would put us in a financial flexibility situation where could have options. We achieved that about the third quarter of 2020. And as a result of that, we now have a situation where we have capital for deployment at MPLX that can be growth capital, buybacks, additional distribution to the base as you saw us pump that up today. Additional distribution amounts in the form of a special, which we talked about a little bit here, and I'll address it further. 
But the bottom line there is we're going to be dynamic and evaluating what's the best opportunity for us on that side of the house based on market conditions, business needs, et cetera, et cetera. An important note, though, from the MPC side of it is, we often get asked the question, how does MPLX provide value to MPC shareholders? Well, we tried to enumerate many different ways, but this is one other example where this is additional cash that's coming from MPLX to MPC. So at the base distribution amount, MPC gets about $1.8 billion, and that's been pretty ratable since 2020.
With this special distribution amount, it will now be $2.2 billion because it's about $400 million MPCs take-up of the special that went to all unitholders. So instead of 1.8 billion EBITDA addition from MPC, you're now looking at $2.2 billion, and we'll continue to evaluate that going forward. It's clearly our intent to grow earnings at MPLX. And as a result of that, there's going to be more cash available to come to MPC over time, whether it's through distributions to the base or special while we also continue to look at buybacks at MPC as well. So hopefully, everybody sees this as a nice strategic importance of MPLX to MPC shareholders as part of our overall scheme here. Does that make sense to you, Neil?"

In the quarter, frankly, we actually recorded from continuing operations, about an $18 million benefit. Part of that is driven by our ability to carry back the incremental pension contribution and some other favorable discrete items in the quarter. The second part of your question is whether or not we would actually migrate towards a statutory rate of 24%? And I think you've articulated that, as we look at the amount of noncontrolling interest, we would most likely not see a statutory rate of 24%. 
But as the level of R&M continues to improve against that, we'll see that rate get higher than the 2% that you were seeing on a year-to-date basis. 
So we will migrate from 2% trending toward, but we would not reach the statutory rate. We have to make this adjustment since the first quarter of 2020. And we'll do that in the fourth quarter for consistency but most likely going forward beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will not be making a tax adjustment to bring all of our earnings to 24%. I hope that answered the question. 
And then I'll address your second question around capital. As you saw, we had a significant reduction from 2020 to 2021, and we're largely on track to reach that CapEx number for 2021. We have not given guidance for 2022 as yet, and we'll do that on our fourth quarter earnings call as we normally do. But I think 1 of the key strategic pillars along with cost reduction is strict capital discipline. We've begun to outline for you the amount of capital that we  are targeting or committing to renewables, and we would expect to be able to share that with you as well for when we give our guidance."

As you know from some of our previous conversations, I think it's very, very hard to call the mid-cycle. I often say, I use the football analogy that just getting it between the 40s, its tough enough, let alone trying to find midcycle.
So -- but most importantly for me, Doug, I will tell you the way we manage the company is, we're not concerned about calling the 50 versus the 40. I'd like to think about the two end zones. How do we feel about a low environment and a high environment? And how are we set up from a portfolio standpoint, whether each of those come at us. Because invariably over time, as you've seen, you'll see a cyclical high-margin environments. And then obviously, we've seen some pretty low ones with the pandemic. So I don't really have a number for you. That's not something we spend a lot of time with. Obviously, internally, we also like to think about where is our balance sheet and leverage, et cetera, et cetera. 
As Maryann talked about, right now, we're in a different situation than normal. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. We did a short-term optimization around that cash management. Ultimately, I think our leverage to a normal mid-cycle would be higher in the future. But we'll keep debating that and ultimately try and frame ourselves that we're in a good position. But at the end of the day, I don't have the crystal ball to tell you exactly what I think mid-cycle is going to be. But I do think that we're going to manage the company such that we're prepared for either end of it, and we're going to have the appropriate management disciplines and financial disciplines around those scenarios."

So we continue to examine the portfolio. I think we've done some things that shows the market that it is a high priority for us. It's one of my three main initiatives that I stated from the start. With respect to Kenai, I would tell you Doug, normally I'm not a big fan of announcing stuff until things are done or not as a general rule.
But in this particular case, we have done an analysis and the reason we disclose it now is we're in pretty advanced discussions with several parties. And because of the timing of this call, we didn't want to have this call, and if something progresses to closure in the near future, we didn't want everybody saying, ""hey, why didn't you tell us about it?"" So we decided to kind of go off our norm a little bit and disclose that we may be able to execute something here in the short term, but it may not happen as well. So we're trying to be as open and as transparent as we can be. We're evaluating it. It is advanced discussions, and that's the main reason that we've decided to tell the market that's where we are.
But I will tell you that we'll continue to evaluate the portfolio. There's more work in our mind that needs to be done. And hopefully, over time, people continue to see a pattern of us challenging ourselves to have a very robust portfolio that works in all market conditions. And ultimately, what I try and say to our team is we want all of our assets to provide free cash over the cycle of cash flows in margin environments that we hit."

Those parts of the portfolio that we do not think long term is core, but at the same time were generating free cash from those areas, and we'll continue to keep those part of the portfolio unless we see something that adds more value. The bid ask on the noncore has been wide and like I say, maybe no good deed goes unpunished.
The fact that we've been open about that option, I think, has led people to try and low ball us as far as some of the bids. But we know what the value of the assets are in our mind. We're not going to move them for numbers less than that. We're happy with the execution of the assets at this point.
So we're in a what I call a good position. We're generating free cash. The portfolio is working for us. We'll look for an opportunity if it makes sense at some point to divest something that we think can be more useful to somebody else in the long term. But if not, we'll manage the capital into those areas and continue to generate free cash and deploy capital where we think there's more longer-term value. So long answer to your question, but yes, the portfolio is obviously something that matters at both MPC and MPLX."

That will lower that obviously as we take that incremental debt out. But it's short term, we'll continue to look at the cash position.
And then, of course, as we complete the share repurchase, we'll see that leverage move up a bit as well. But this in no way changes the way that we are thinking about the optimal capital structure for MPC and MPLX. We remain comfortable. If you will, we've been talking about 4x at the MPLX.

I will tell you that, again, everybody knows this, when you are doing deals, even in advanced discussions, it may happen, it may not happen. We'll see how it plays out. And if it does, we will try to give you some insight to it, and then we'll be able to talk a lot further about it if it does happen. If it does not happen, obviously we'll come out and say that as well. But it's just the timing of the call and where we are in the discussions that we felt it was worth giving some disclosure."

Yes, we have the ability to ramp up if the expansion is required. So I'll give you my take on top of Rick's. The whole genesis of the project is that Eastern Gulf is looking for more grades, as Rick mentioned. Over time, my personal belief is that there's going to be more interest there. The issue is supplying the pipe, whether it comes from the north. As you know, there was a project come out of Cushing that doesn't look like it's going to go forward at this point. But whatever can get supplied to that pipe, I think, is going to be advantageous to get more optionality down to the Gulf Coast.
As Rick mentioned, our facility in Garyville is interested in some of the grades. The rest of the Eastern Gulf refining area would be interested in different types of opportunities as far as grade selection as well. So I'm a personal believer that over time, we're going to get debottlenecked and get more of crude into that system. And I do believe over time, it is going to expand."

So one question that we've been trying to figure out is you guys obviously had the significant savings that you flagged already from OpEx but I think you have also flagged some operational improvements as well that might flow through more in terms of the capture rate or throughput margin, however you want to define it. Do you have any framework for how people can think about it? I know you don't want to go to the mid-cycle framework, but just any thoughts on improvements that we should look for over the next year or 2-year.
