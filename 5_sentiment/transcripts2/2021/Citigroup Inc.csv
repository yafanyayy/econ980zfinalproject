Given this is my last earnings call with you, we're going to do things a little bit differently today. After I'm done speaking, I'll turn it over to Mark. And before we open up to Q&A, Jane will make some comments on the transformation she's been leading and how she sees our strategy evolving. So with that, let's go ahead and get started. 
We had a strong finish to a tumultuous year with net income of $4.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.08 in the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with over $11 billion in net income despite the doubling of credit reserves as a result of the pandemic and the impact of CECL. Overall, we increased our ACL by $10 billion over the course of the year. 
As a sign of the strength and durability of our diversified franchise, our revenues were flat to 2019 despite the massive economic impacts of COVID-19 globally. Our deposits were up nearly 20% as we supported our clients throughout the year, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Our Institutional Clients Group performed well as they have throughout the year, highlighted by our markets businesses, which saw revenues up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Banking saw a 7% revenue decline as Investment Banking activity slowed and low rates continued to impact Treasury and Trade Solutions, although the Private Bank was a standout with a 6% increase. Our Consumer Banking revenues continued to be impacted by the pandemic, although we did see deposit growth in every region. 
In the U.S., our retail business did benefit from exceptionally high mortgage refinancing as homeowners saw opportunities in this ultra low rate environment. And we saw continued momentum in digital deposits. In Mexico, lower loan volumes pressured our revenues. In Asia, card spending was down again, but we continue to see strong performance in Wealth Management. 
We remain very well capitalized with robust liquidity to serve our clients. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 11.8%, well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $73.83, up 5% from a year ago. And we welcome the Federal Reserve's decision regarding share repurchases as we have excess capital, we can return to shareholders. And we plan to resume buybacks during the current quarter. 
Given my upcoming retirement from Citi at the end of February, I recently looked through some of the challenges we faced when I became CEO. And while there's always more work to do, I'm very proud of what the firm has accomplished. We're in a fundamentally different place than we were in October of 2012. 
We've streamlined our consumer business and embraced the shift to digital, so we can serve our clients the way they want to be served. We've reestablished Citi as a go-to bank for our institutional clients throughout our global network. No matter what part of the world you're in, our bankers have a seat at the table during the most significant transactions. We've optimized our capital base, working through our legacy assets and reducing our DTA by more than half, generating $7 billion of regulatory capital in the process. 
We dramatically increased the return of our capital to our shareholders. We went from a $0.01 dividend to returning over $85 billion in capital since 2013, and we've reduced our share count by 30%. 
Before the pandemic, we had significantly improved the quality and consistency of our earnings, our return on assets and return on our equity. As a result of the pandemic, while the financial results this year aren't what I would have wanted them to be for my last year as CEO, in many ways, I couldn't be prouder. All the work we did to strengthen our firm helped us get through this extraordinary year, and I'm proud of the fact that we've shown we can go through a crisis and emerge even stronger unlike the events of more than a decade ago. 
Just for context, let's compare 2012 to 2020. In 2020, the year of a pandemic, we had nearly $4 billion more in net income, a 12 basis point higher return on assets and 180 basis points higher return on tangible common equity than we had in 2012. That shows you just how far Citi has come. 
And we also showed what our firm is about by serving our customers, our clients and our communities. We were the first bank to launch an accommodation program for consumers when the pandemic hit. We stood up a small business program for lending in just a matter of weeks. We donated [indiscernible] profits to COVID relief efforts, part of $100 million in such grants we made throughout the year. And in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, we announced $1 billion in strategic actions to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States. 
As I said, there's always more to do. But I feel really good about the firm as Jane prepares to take over. She's thrown yourself into the transformation we've launched to strengthen our risk and control environment and ensure the firm operates with excellence in every area. I know she'd do everything she can to maximize returns and move Citi forward for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 
With that, Mark is going to go through the presentation."

Citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of $4.6 billion. Revenues declined 10% from the prior year. While trading remained strong, this was more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of consumer activity. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in our transformation, including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment, along with higher repositioning costs as we look to adjust capacity in targeted areas. 
Credit performance remained strong with credit losses of $1.5 billion, down sequentially as well as year-over-year. And cost of credit was roughly neutral for the quarter, as these losses were offset by an ACL release of $1.5 billion, driven primarily by an improvement in our base macro scenario. 
EPS was $2.08 and  ROTCE was 11.4%. 
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 19%, reflecting consistent client engagement with corporate clients building liquidity, along with higher savings rates and reduced spending in consumer. 
Turning to full year results. In 2020, we delivered solid performance despite the pricing with net income of over $11 billion, even as we increased reserves by roughly $10 billion. We ended the year with strong capital and liquidity and grew tangible book value throughout the year. 
On the top line, while the pandemic had a significant impact, we held full year revenues flat in 2019, with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest [indiscernible]. Expenses increased 2%, in line with guidance as we invested in our transformation. Results also included COVID-19-related expenses and the civil money penalty in the third quarter offset by lower discretionary spending and continued efficiency savings. 
Full year EPS also includes a $0.16 impact related to revising the previously determined accounting for third-party collection fees reversing the benefit to net income with the corresponding increase to opening retained earnings capital neutral as of year-end. 
On Slide 4, we provide additional detail on reserving actions. As a reminder, these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which provides for the possibility for a more adverse outcome. Our reserve release this quarter primarily reflects our improving macroeconomic outlook, although I would note, we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty as the pace and shape of the recovery is still evolved. Overall, looking at the reserves we hold today, we believe that we are well positioned with nearly $28 billion in reserves, which represents an allowance for credit losses of roughly 4% on funded loan. 
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $4.8 billion, up 30% from last year. Operating margin declined 5% on lower revenues and a 2% increase in expenses, primarily reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, while credit costs were down considerably given a $1.3 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvement in the outlook for global GDP as well as fewer downgrades in the portfolio. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.4%, including 4.4% on the noninvestment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $210 million. 
Looking at full year results, the ICG business has performed well this year with 13% revenue growth, positive operating leverage and operating margin growth of 24%. But given the ACL build this year, ICG EBIT declined 6%. And for the full year, ICD delivered a 13.8% return on allocated capital. 
Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Revenues decreased 1% in the fourth quarter as strong trading performance was offset by lower revenues in TTS, Investment Banking and Corporate Lending. 
On the banking side, revenues declined 7%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 8% as reported and 6% in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenue. Average deposits were up 22% from constant dollars, and we had solid growth in our underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown, with increased digital adoption, cross-border transaction volumes growing over 10% and a record quarter in clearing. Investment Banking revenues were down 5% from last year, as solid growth in equity underwriting was more than offset by lower revenues in M&A and debt underwriting. 
Private Bank revenues grew 6%, driven by capital market strength as well as improved managed investment revenues and higher lending. Corporate Lending revenues were down 25%, driven by lower spreads, higher hedging costs and lower average volume. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues increased 13% from last year. Fixed Income revenues grew 7% as higher revenues across Fed products and commodities were partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currency. Although I would note that we saw solid performance in FX and global rates and good client engagement across the entire business. 
Equity revenues were up 57% versus last year, driven by strong performance in cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting higher client volumes and more favorable market conditions. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were unchanged on a reported basis, but up 2% in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients with broken deposits, settlement volumes and assets under custody were partially offset by lower spreads. 
For full year 2020, revenues increased 13% driven by the significant strength in markets this year, along with a solid contribution from Investment Banking and the Private Bank. Throughout the year, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses as we actively helped our clients navigate through this uncertain environment, given our global platform, our progress in creating new digital solutions and our full-service model, which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise. And given the momentum we've seen this year in key drivers, including digital adoption, deposit growth and client engagement, we're even better positioned to ensure additional share gains in 2021 as these clients more fully recognize the benefits of using Citi as their platform of choice. 
Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking and cost in dollars on Slide 7. GCB delivered EBIT of $1.7 billion. Revenues declined 13% as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in Wealth Management were more than offset by lower card volume and lower interest rates across all regions. That said, we did see signs of stabilization sequentially this quarter. 
Expenses increased 4% across both North America and international consumers, driven mostly by higher repositioning. Excluding repositioning costs, total GCB expenses were flat as COVID-related costs were largely offset by efficiency savings. Credit cost decreased 45% as lower volumes and improved delinquencies led to lower net credit loss, coupled with an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions. And looking at full year results, GCB delivered EBIT of $1.1 billion, down significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and higher reserve builds under CECL. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Total fourth quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, but we did see positive momentum in our drivers this quarter. And on a sequential basis, revenues grew 3%. Branded cards revenues were down 13%, reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans. Purchase sales grew 9% sequentially on both seasonal activity as well as the continued recovery in consumer spending but were still down year-over-year. At the same time, we're seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid, and we have not yet seen stress in their overall ability to pay. So while purchase activity has improved, our clients are also paying down more quickly, resulting in continued pressure on our loan balance. Retail services revenues were down 16% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner [income ] . 
Net interest revenues were down 12% as average loans declined by 11% on lower purchase sales activities and higher payment rates. Similar to branded cards, purchase sales grew 18% sequentially, but remained down year-over-year. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year reflecting the impact of lower losses in 2020 and, therefore, higher income share. 
Retail Banking revenues were down 1% year-over-year as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenue were more than offset by lower deposit spread. Average deposits were up 21%, including 29% growth in checking. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with digital deposits increasing $2 billion quarter-over-quarter. 
We saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with 18% year-over-year growth in Citigold client and 11% growth in assets under management. Overall, we feel good about our client engagement as we exit the year, with spend activity continuing to recover, underlying strength in wealth management drivers and significant deposit growth giving us the opportunity to grow and deepen these relationships going forward as we continue to invest in our products and digital capability. 
On Slide 9, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We continue to see good momentum in Wealth Management as investment revenues grew 16%, with a 7% increase in Citigold client and 13% growth in net new money. And average deposit growth remained strong at 14%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year with purchase sales down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we did see sequential improvement in purchase sales this quarter, in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Latin America. Total revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter with average balances up 13% and purchase sales improved sequentially. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment. 
Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit loss rates generally trended downward this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S., lower spending and the benefits of relief program. However, in Asia, credit loss rates increased, mostly driven by those accounts that exited relief programs in line with our expectations. The year-over-year rise in delinquencies outside the U.S. is concentrated in accounts rolling off relief programs and reflects more modest levels of stimulus in these regions relative to the U.S. Given these trends, we continue to expect peak losses to occur in Asia and Mexico during the first half of 2021 and should begin to recover thereafter. 
Meanwhile, in the U.S., while we do expect losses to begin to rise in 2021, Given today's delinquency trend and the expected impact of recent stimulus, we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out to the first half of 2022. Whether continuing to push out these losses is simply a matter of timing or if it will ultimately result in lower aggregate losses remains to be seen, and it's something we are watching closely. 
Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of lower rates, the wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of episodic gains. Expenses were roughly flat as the wind-down of legacy assets offset investments in infrastructure, risk management and control. And the pretax loss was $690 million this quarter, roughly in line with our prior outlook. 
Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.5 billion in the quarter declined $1.3 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and excluding market was roughly flat to the third quarter. And net interest margin declined 3 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenue and balance sheet expansion due to strong deposit growth. 
Turning to noninterest revenues in the fourth quarter, non-NIR declined 6% to just over $6 billion, given lower levels of consumer activity year-over-year. 
Turning to full year results. Revenues were flat with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenue driven by continued strong performance in markets throughout the year as well as strength in investment banking. 
On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.8% or 180 basis points above our regulatory minimum. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $73.83 driven by net income. 
Before I hand it back to Mike, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the top line, we saw an extraordinary year end market performance in 2020 and would expect some degree of normalization this year. And subject to how that plays out, we can see revenues down in the mid- to high single-digit range this year, largely driven by market. This outlook assumes industry wallets more similar to 2019 levels. And for net interest revenue specifically, it assumes continued stabilization in the first half of the year with an improvement in the back half, [either ]  through our base case, which assumes loan growth by this point in the recovery. 
On a full year basis, the decline in net interest revenues is somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion versus 2020. On the expense side, we expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation. 
Our cost of credit should be meaningfully lower than 2020. And we expect a tax rate of roughly 21% for the year. 
So pulling this together, we expect operating margin pressure this year. But given lower credit costs, we should still see significant improvement in profitability relative to 2020. 
And finally, as Mike mentioned earlier, we look forward to repurchasing shares through the balance of 2021, subject to Board approval, starting this quarter. 
To wrap up, as I look at how we performed in 2020, we demonstrated the significant earnings power and resilience of the franchise. We sit here today with strong capital and liquidity position. Overall client engagement remains strong. We grew book value every quarter, and we remain focused on supporting colleagues, customers, clients and community, all of which give me a great deal of confidence as we move into 2021. 
With that, let me hand it back to Mike."

I want to thank Mike for his support and for working so closely with me during this transition. It was important to him to ensure Citi has a seamless CEO transition and has obviously been tremendously helpful",888,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I want to thank Mike for his support and for working so closely with me during this transition. It was important to him to ensure Citi has a seamless CEO transition and has obviously been tremendously helpful to me as I prepare to step into the role at the end of February. 
I am extremely excited by the opportunities ahead for our firm, and I am equally determined to address the deficiencies in our risk and control environment that have been raised by our regulators. We've embarked on a transformation program that will clearly benefit our clients and investors as well as meeting the regulators' expectations of one of the world's most globally significant financial institutions. And of course, we still have to get through this pandemic. 
While we hope the end is in sight, this virus has surprised us and taught us the folly of best-laid plans, so we will remain vigilant and adaptable. 
My 2 major priorities as I transition with Mike are our transformation effort and refreshing our strategy, so we ultimately achieved 3 things: best position Citi to win to improve our returns significantly and to address the issues raised by our regulators. While it's early days, our work on these priorities is well underway. 
So on the transformation, We're taking the time to step back, to tackle the root cause issues, to define our target end state and develop the detailed plans to get us there. We put in place specific work streams against risk and controls, data and compliance, but we also have work streams on creating a culture of excellence and accountability and on strengthening our critical business processes. Each stream is led by a member of the executive management team. Together, we are accountable for simplifying and modernizing the bank. In February, we will deliver our GAAP analysis to the target state and in May, the detailed implementation plan. This effort will take time and it will require significant investment in technology and talent. 
You have my commitment that we will invest your capital wisely, and that you, our clients and our regulators will all see and benefit from the results. At the end of the day, we want to achieve a state of excellence in our risk and controls, in our operations and in our service to clients. 
Switching tax to strategy. I have the benefit of having worked in a number of businesses in regions in Citi over the last 16 years. Nonetheless, this transition is giving me valuable time to step back and to take a dispassionate look at our strategy and businesses. You wouldn't expect me to come out with specifics at this rather early stage, but I can talk about how we are looking at this. 
We have a wonderful franchise, first-class capabilities and a terrific brand name. We are the world's most global bank with a network no one can match. And this means we are uniquely able to help clients grow and succeed globally. Our capital and balance sheet is strong. We have a deep talent bench around the world. So while we have work to do, this is a pretty good hand to play. 
A few principles will guide how we refresh our strategy. We're taking a clinical look at our strategic positioning assessing which businesses can attain leading market positions in a much more digitized world. Similarly, I believe in the value of focus and directing our investments and resources to the businesses that will drive stronger growth and improve returns over the long run. 
I also believe in ensuring the businesses we're in fit well together. So collectively, they are competitively advantaged and generate synergies. 
And finally, like any true Scot, I believe there is value to unlock by simplifying the firm. As you know, on Wednesday, we announced that we will integrate Consumer Wealth Management and our Private Bank into one business line. It's a growth opportunity I'm particularly excited about in Asia as well as the U.S. 
Earlier in the week, we also announced the new head of our TTS franchise and our U.S. consumer leadership. And I look forward to sharing new opportunities and moves with you as we go. 
I want to end as I began, by thanking Mike. He has spent his 38-year career at Citi. No one has been more dedicated. He always put Citi first. And he took over at a very difficult time. He had to make tough calls, steering the company through the post-crisis restructuring. He made Citi a simpler, smaller, safer and far stronger institution, returning it to growth, closing the gap with our peers and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders just as he promised he would. 
His steady leadership this year helped us through this very difficult period for all of us. But this last year showed how the work he led has strengthened our firm as we supported our people, clients and communities through this pandemic. He leaves us with a tremendous foundation, and I am committed to building on his success. We are very grateful to him and proud of him. And all of us at Citi wish him the very best in the next chapter. 
Mike, would you like to say something to close?"

So we saw a tremendous growth in Mexico that starts with a much lower digital base. And so with COVID, we saw a pretty rapid acceleration across the industry. And we were -- we're a major leader in that. .
When we look at the States, we already have an extremely active card customer base on the digital front. And so we weren't expecting to see the same levels of pickup. 
I'd say the other piece as well is customer acquisition across the board is lower because of COVID. And you typically do tend to see that the new customers, when they come on board anyone's platform, they tend to have a higher digital adoption rate. So I think we're pretty optimistic that as and when we see the recovery, that we'll also see growth in that digital adoption in the U.S. going forward."

Most of that is likely to be driven by the transformation spend as we get our arms around what that cost is going to be. You know already we spent $1 billion this year. That's in our run rate already. But there is a broader investment strategy that we're working towards, and we're doing that in the context of -- we'll obviously do that in the context of how the strategy Jane spoke to evolves. 
And so continued investment in digital capabilities, both on the consumer side, as you heard me mention, but also on the ICG side, particularly in our TTS platform where we've seen good benefits from the investments already made there, but as you know, that's an area where innovation and technology is what's required to maintain a competitive advantage there. We just announced the wealth management business, if you will, bringing together wealth from the consumer and in the private bank. And that, I would imagine, will be or not I would imagine that will be an area of investment for us as we grow fee revenues, as Jane has pointed to, as an important objective of ours. We'll also see growth in advertising and marketing. 
So in that outlook, I talked about net interest revenue stabilizing but picking up in the back half of the year, with growth in loans. And that growth in loans is going to be a byproduct of us starting to put money to work again back in advertising and marketing, which was down materially this year as we manage through this crisis. 
So those are a couple of areas that we would look to invest in, in the context of that 2% to 3%. But again, a lot of it is going to be towards this transformation. And it is an investment, which I continue to remind folks of, and that is to say that we expect to and we'll focus on ensuring that we get a payback on that in the coming years. And so hopefully, that gives you a good sense, John."

That said, I would add that we have seen on the card side, you heard me mention this in my prepared remarks, we saw good sequential momentum across purchase sale activity. Some of that's seasonal, but some of that just really good activity with our customers, and we're looking for that to continue. We -- obviously, there's been a stimulus that's been announced already.

I think the normalization of GDP in the credit environment is going to be helpful as well. And then as many people know, we've got a deferred tax asset and some legacy assets that we'll continue to work down over time.

Look, I mean, we -- when we think about our reserve levels and the activity there, we certainly did factor in the impact of stimulus. 
I think what's important to point to is the stimulus thus far has resulted in high payment rates and a consistent kind of ability to pay for the consumer, and that's been good. And it showed up not only in our payment rates, but it also shows up in the lower level of delinquencies that we've seen and obviously, the lower level of losses that we've seen. 
There certainly is a need for additional stimulus. And I think the good thing about that is it should continue to support the payment rates that we've seen. And if it is significant enough, can ultimately drive greater consumption and support improved GDP, improved unemployment. 
Our current forecast, as you heard me mention earlier, assumes that, that loan momentum picks up towards the end of -- or the mid -- I'm sorry, the back half of 2021. If we see that take hold sooner, we could see higher levels of volume in loan growth. And obviously, that would be beneficial to our NIR forecast. So stimulus is good in that regard. It also will put -- as it takes hold, there'll likely be some early pressure on lending volumes because people tend -- are using it as a liquidity tool and to pay down. But over time, I think it will be beneficial."

When we step back 5 or 10 years from now and have a picture of Citi, and the reason I ask that is you mentioned Citi being global.

You can go back to Sandy Will and John Reed, the financial supermarket. You can go back to the financial crisis, And even with the retrenching and derisking, and I agree the chance of bankruptcy is far less, the return on capital has fallen short of the cost of capital for the last decade. .
So you'll be the seventh CEO at Citigroup when you take over, why will it be different this time? What can you do differently, whether it's business mix or customer mix or geographic mix? Because from my perspective and I -- it's great, you're going to take a clinical look, a dispassionate look, but I'm extremely passionate about the underperformance of the Citi over almost any time frame over the last 50 years. And so I'm just trying to figure out what you can do given your 16 years at Citi, your experience at McKinsey, to actually finally change Citi to generate sustainable returns above the cost of capital.

And you're right, the headline numbers are affected by interest rates. But we feel very good about the underlying momentum in the business, and we think that's evidenced by a couple of key drivers. 
You're aware we're in 95 countries. That gives our clients the ability to transact in over 140 currencies. And we do that on a global platform. We have 600,000 users on that platform, which is up about 9% from last year. And within that, the mobile users are up about 95%. 
We're continuing to grow accounts with our clients. And we now have the ability to open accounts digitally in 50 countries. In 2020, we opened over 14,000 accounts digitally, representing more than a 200% increase. And growing accounts deepens our relationship with clients and allows us to penetrate new activity centers that allows us to capture more flows across our platform. And ultimately, that delivers more revenue. And so this digital activity drives revenue for us in the future, and it also is more in a more efficient way for us to do business with clients. 
We're also seeing good transaction volumes across different payment types with these clients. We've had very good clearing performance and cross-border flows through the year. And so those things give us a lot of insight into what the momentum will look like coming out of this crisis. And that's not to mention additional opportunities with new clients. As you know, we've moved our commercial business squarely into the ICG. There's more upside for our TTS platform with a commercial -- with the commercial client base. 
And so we feel very good about where we are. We're not taking our position for granted. We're going to continue to invest in this platform, and we're looking forward to capturing the growth and supporting our clients as they come out of this crisis."

These are investments, as you've heard me mention repeatedly, and they're going to be -- there is going to be a return on the investment. The return will come in both revenue and a more efficient operating platform. 
We've got a history now. We've got some credibility now with having demonstrated productivity across our platform, whether that's through automating processes or reducing data centers or low-cost location strategies. 
Since our Investor Day, we've continued to improve our productivity. And that's what you should expect. That's what we're expecting of ourselves and we'll deliver on kind of coming out of these investments that we need to make. And so no, not a bloated expense base. 
With that said, so put that aside, we are going to continue to invest in the business. And so if there are opportunities that present themselves, either as a byproduct of the strategy refresh that Jane has mentioned or otherwise, we intend to take advantage of making those investments because that is the only way we get to those improved returns that we're targeting and focused on. So hopefully, that answers your question."

With  what we're looking at the moment is much more around what do we want to be going forward.

Digitization is changing quite a few things, as Mark was referring to. It's providing a lot of new opportunities, but also some important investments for growth as well as for returns. And if it ends up that there are businesses as we look at it, that we don't think that fit well into the mix, then I think we've got good skills in terms of thinking about how we divest of those in a way that makes sense. But that's honestly not where we are at the moment. We're focused on what we're going to be.

And given the fact that you have a great brand in the U.S., you have a really good mobile app. And we have a relatively low interest rate environment, why not put up a high-cost savings product and reduce your wholesale cost of funds by switching from wholesale to a high-cost savings product, which at this rate, you can actually -- you should be able to pick up some ROA on that?"

Look, we have seen very good deposit growth, and some of that is a byproduct of our high-yield savings accounts. But we've also seen strong checking account growth this quarter, and we've seen the growth in our digital deposits as well. 
And so you're right, there's a funding cost advantage to that. We've seen that play out and the liquidity that's in the market. We intend to continue to grow as it relates to increasing those deposits. And we've been smart about how we've been managing our liquidity, keeping some liquidity, obviously, there for lending needs as they may evolve for our customers and clients but also paying down wholesale debt. We did that through the year and also investing. 
We've made some investments through the year. I think we've invested as much as another $78 billion or so, up 21% for the year. And so we've been thoughtfully managing the liquidity that we've seen through the course of this year. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to grow deposits on the consumer side because you're right, it is a lower-cost funding alternative. And we'll do that as it actually makes a lot of sense."

Maybe one question there is on the reserve analysis and what kind of level of unemployment you're looking for in your reserving today at year-end '21. And is there some room for that reserve release to be potentially larger as we go through the year? 
And then maybe -- I know you talked about how stimulus could help net charge-off peaks. It's hard to give an estimate on that. But maybe give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the trajectory for credit costs year-on-year."

So one, as you know, Betsy, when we model this, we look at kind of the macroeconomic variables that we have at any point in time. And so you look at kind of Page 4, we laid out the variables that we've used this",436,"Sure. So I guess a couple of pieces there. So one, as you know, Betsy, when we model this, we look at kind of the macroeconomic variables that we have at any point in time. And so you look at kind of Page 4, we laid out the variables that we've used this quarter. And you can see that both for U.S. unemployment as well as for U.S. real GDP, we've seen improvement since the third quarter forecast that we ran. 
And I'd tell you, even as you look at this, there's been further improvement even off of the fourth quarter '20 forecast that's here. And so those are important factors in the assumptions and what we're able to model in the way of reserve levels. And as we see that improve or improve further, we would expect that, that would be -- that would play out in the way of even lower reserves. 
I think the other important factor is the stimulus and how that -- and the additional stimulus that is out there and how that ultimately evolves and what that means and whether that drives consumer consumption and whether that drives even further levels of improved unemployment will be important factors that come into play here. 
And then I guess the final piece I'd mention is that we continue to hold management adjustment for economic uncertainty. And as we see these variables continue to improve, that's going to impact how we think about severity and probability associated with that downside scenario. So all of those factors come into play as to how we think about the reserve levels that we carry. While we still feel good about the $28 billion roughly that we have in the way of balances, we feel very good about the direction that these economic variables appear to be moving. 
In terms of losses, again, it's been interesting the way this has played out. And so really, what we're all trying to figure out is whether the lower delinquencies and lower level of losses that we've seen thus far is a delay or is it a deflation of losses, right? And that only time will tell as we sit here today. And as you heard me say in my prepared remarks, we think it's a bit of a delay in that we would expect to see losses peak in 2022 now, particularly for U.S. consumer. But again, with another stimulus right around the corner, that, in fact, could be further delayed and ultimately, we would hope that it would just go away and be deflated and come down. So..."

So again, we see -- we continue to have good dialogue on the Investment Banking side with our clients. Obviously, we've seen very strong performance as it relates to the SPAC space and equity capital markets, and that will continue to play out just when you think about the nature of those deals, and so that will continue to play out into 2021. But the dialogue has been very good. And that's both in Investment Banking, but also just broadly with the corporate clients as corporate clients are trying to figure out what coming out of this crisis means for their own business models. and how they think about their digital capabilities and needs and how they think about their supply chains and how that might be shifting and those types of dialogues they're having both internally but also with us. And so we're part of that conversation, and being part of that creates opportunities on the TTS side, on the Investment Banking side and potentially even as it relates to the corporate lending activity, which we hope to pick up in the back half of the year as well. 
And so very, very strong and continued corporate dialogue, and I think that's going to contribute ultimately to driving some of that fee revenue that you mentioned. 
In terms of the markets piece, we -- again, we've had an extraordinary year. The industry has seen a great deal of wallet growth in markets. And that's got to normalize at some point, obviously, and we are forecasting that it does. 
But I'll tell you in the early days of January, we've continued to see robust activity. And it is early days in the quarter. But we have seen that. And so we'll have to see how that plays out over the balance of the quarter and going into the balance of '21."

At the same time, we continue to see paydowns in terms of credit cards. Businesses on different trajectories.

And so it was our analysts going out with what they believed was a recommendation around that. And so that shouldn't be read as the firm necessarily having that position. Independent research came out with that. 
On your second piece, I think as you look at FICC trading, for us, if you look at the fourth quarter and the numbers that we've posted, I think if you look in there, I think, relative strength in terms of credit and credit spread products, again, as we measure that against our rates and currencies business, it's not as large. It's still a meaningful business for us, but not as large. Some of that other people have spoken to as having outsized your quite significant returns in the leverage lending space. We're not as large in that space. 
And I think as we look at our trading revenues, we tend to look at those over not just quarter but longer cycles. And if you look at The Street research today, it's indicating that the trading wallet for 2020 was up somewhere in the neighborhood of mid-20s. As you look at our trading revenues for 2020, we're probably up somewhere in the mid-30s. So again, quarter-to-quarter, less important. But again, for us continuing to take share in there and the underlying mix tends to kind of bounce that around a little bit. But again, I think we feel pretty good about our position and the dialogues where we are. 
I think as we think forward, I think it's unlikely to think that we're going to see wallets up to the same degree, certainly in the trading space that we saw this year. We think seasonality will resume. But as Mark said, as we kind of started and it's early in the new year, we have seen activity remain high. And as I think we see more potential stimulus or governmental programs coming out, the Fed and others continuing to take stances on rates and trajectory and where things go, that could keep trading volumes, keep creating volumes relatively high. 
So again, we think we're pretty well positioned, and we're in dialogue around those, but we clearly can't escape all of the market dynamics of where the wallets go."

That is the backdrop. 
Would you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program if you got the green light rather than doing it every quarter like it was done in the past because that's what the regulations required in the past?"

We'll need to look at -- first of all, distressed capital buffer, obviously, is an important component to how this all comes together. And coming out of the recent resubmission, you saw the prospective stressed capital will go up by 10 basis points. They haven't applied that. We're still subject to the 2.5% stress capital buffer, but that will be a factor that we have to consider in the outer quarters from 2021. 
And then post that, there'll be another CCAR submission, and we'll get results that inform the go-forward there. Every quarter, we'll look at what our projected performance would suggest, including that stress capital buffer juxtaposed against our target. And that view will allow for us to take the capital actions that we think are appropriate inside of what those results would suggest. 
And so we will take this in quarterly decisions, so to speak, ensuring that our outlook supports the capital action that we want to take. And so that's how we intend to approach it."

I just wanted to see how that pans out for Citi, whether you see that same kind of pressure and how you think about that.
And then if I could ask 2 short technical questions, I didn't quite catch what you said about Lat Am NPLs coming down. What was the reason for that? It just strikes me as a bit surprising that, that should be the case. 
And then just lastly, on your risk-weighted assets, they climbed quite a bit this quarter. It doesn't seem to be that it could be entirely credit driven. Just if you could give a bit more color on that."

Let me start with your first question, which was on, I think, the impact of deposits. And so yes, we have seen a significant increase in deposits. That does impact a number of the important metrics. From an SLR point of view, if not for the relief,",467,"Sure. Let me start with your first question, which was on, I think, the impact of deposits. And so yes, we have seen a significant increase in deposits. That does impact a number of the important metrics. From an SLR point of view, if not for the relief, which kind of goes away at the end of the first quarter, we'd have a lower SLR by 109 basis points. So the reg relief provided 109 basis points of relief there. 
It also has had an impact on -- and by the way, we are managing to that SLR relief going away at the end of the first quarter. So we're aware of that. We're managing accordingly to that. 
It's also had an impact on our GCIB score, which is -- has kind of tripped into the next bucket, the 3.5% bucket. And the large percentage of that increase that we've seen in the GCIB score was also driven by deposits. And so we'll have to manage that as well. Obviously, there -- we have a view that some consideration needs to be given to both of these metrics as the Fed has been clear in terms of their view that there's enough capital in the system, and so we're hopeful that as kind of things evolve that some consideration is given to that. But in the meantime, we're managing the balance sheet and deposits and capital accordingly and with full knowledge of how the relief might evolve in the case of the SLR. 
In terms of your question on credit risk in Latin America, the point that I was making here was that because we've had customers that were part of a relief program, that the NCLs that we've seen have been lower than what they would have been if those customers were not running through the relief program. So you see the NCL -- the lower NCL in the quarter, but you also start to see delinquencies pick up. And those delinquencies are picking up as people come out of that relief program and start to -- or stop paying, I should say, and therefore, you see delinquencies take up. 
And so shortly, you'll see the NCL start to pick up as people go beyond the 90 days past due delinquent and go into losses. Hopefully, that was clear. 
The last question you asked was on advanced RWA growth. I mean we did see RWA increase quarter-over-quarter. The drivers there was -- they were a combination of credit risk, market risk and operational risk. And inside of that, we saw FX drive some of that increase as well as derivatives and mostly derivative and FX exposure increases, including CBA. So those are the major drivers of the RWA on an advanced basis tick-up that we saw."

Given this is my last earnings call with you, we're going to do things a little bit differently today. After I'm done speaking, I'll turn it over to Mark. And before we open up to Q&A, Jane will make some comments on the transformation she's been leading and how she sees our strategy evolving. So with that, let's go ahead and get started.  
We had a strong finish to a tumultuous year with net income of $4.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.08 in the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with over $11 billion in net income despite the doubling of credit reserves as a result of the pandemic and the impact of CECL. Overall, we increased our ACL by $10 billion over the course of the year.  
As a sign of the strength and durability of our diversified franchise, our revenues were flat to 2019 despite the massive economic impacts of COVID-19 globally. Our deposits were up nearly 20% as we supported our clients throughout the year, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base.  
Turning to the fourth quarter. Our Institutional Clients Group performed well as they have throughout the year, highlighted by our markets businesses, which saw revenues up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Banking saw a 7% revenue decline as Investment Banking activity slowed and low rates continued to impact Treasury and Trade Solutions, although the Private Bank was a standout with a 6% increase. Our Consumer Banking revenues continued to be impacted by the pandemic, although we did see deposit growth in every region.  
In the U.S., our retail business did benefit from exceptionally high mortgage refinancing as homeowners saw opportunities in this ultra-low rate environment. And we saw continued momentum in digital deposits. In Mexico, lower loan volumes pressured our revenues. In Asia, card spending was down again, but we continue to see strong performance in wealth management.  
We remain very well capitalized with robust liquidity to serve our clients. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 11.8%, well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $73.83, up 5% from a year ago. And we welcome the Federal Reserve's decision regarding share repurchases as we have excess capital we can return to shareholders, and we plan to resume buybacks during the current quarter.  
Given my upcoming retirement from Citi at the end of February, I recently looked through some of the challenges we faced when I became CEO. And while there's always more work to do, I'm very proud of what the firm has accomplished. We're in a fundamentally different place than we were in October of 2012.  
We've streamlined our consumer business and embraced the shift to digital, so we can serve our clients the way they want to be served. We've reestablished Citi as a go-to bank for our institutional clients throughout our global network. No matter what part of the world you're in, our bankers have a seat at the table during the most significant transactions. 
We've optimized our capital base, working through our legacy assets and reducing our DTA by more than half, generating $7 billion of regulatory capital in the process.  We dramatically increased the return of our capital to our shareholders. We went from a $0.01 dividend to returning over $85 billion in capital since 2013, and we've reduced our share count by 30%.  
Before the pandemic, we had significantly improved the quality and consistency of our earnings, our return on assets and return on our equity. As a result of the pandemic, while the financial results this year aren't what I would have wanted them to be for my last year as CEO, in many ways, I couldn't be prouder. All the work we did to strengthen our firm helped us get through this extraordinary year. And I'm proud of the fact that we've shown we can go through a crisis and emerge even stronger, unlike the events of more than a decade ago.  
Just for context, let's compare 2012 to 2020. In 2020, the year of a pandemic, we had nearly $4 billion more in net income, a 12 basis point higher return on assets and 180 basis points higher return on tangible common equity than we had in 2012. That shows you just how far Citi has come.  
And we also showed what our firm is about by serving our customers, our clients and our communities. We were the first bank to launch an accommodation program for consumers when the pandemic hit. We stood up a small business program for lending in just a matter of weeks. We donated these profits to COVID relief efforts, part of $100 million and such grants we made throughout the year. And in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, we announced $1 billion in strategic actions to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States.  
As I said, there's always more to do. But I feel really good about the firm as Jane prepares to take over. She's thrown herself into the transformation we've launched to strengthen our risk and control environment and ensure the firm operates with excellence in every area. I know she'd do everything she can to maximize returns and move Citi forward for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.  
With that, Mark is going to go through the presentation."

Citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of $4.6 billion. Revenues declined 10% from the prior year. While trading remained strong, this was more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of consumer activity. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in our transformation, including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment, along with higher repositioning costs as we look to adjust capacity in targeted areas.  
Credit performance remained strong with credit losses of $1.5 billion, down sequentially as well as year-over-year. And cost of credit was roughly neutral for the quarter, as these losses were offset by an ACL release of $1.5 billion driven primarily by an improvement in our base macro scenario.  EPS was $2.08 and  ROTCE was 11.4%.  
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 19%, reflecting consistent client engagement with corporate clients building liquidity, along with higher savings rates and reduced spending in consumer.  
Turning to full year results. In 2020, we delivered solid performance despite the pricing with net income of over $11 billion, even as we increased reserves by roughly $10 billion. We ended the year with strong capital and liquidity and grew tangible book value throughout the year.  
On the top line, while the pandemic had a significant impact, we held full year revenues flat in 2019, with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenues. Expenses increased 2%, in line with guidance as we invested in our transformation. Results also included COVID-19-related expenses and the civil money penalty in the third quarter offset by lower discretionary spending and continued efficiency savings.  
Full year EPS also includes a $0.16 impact related to revising the previously determined accounting for third-party collection fees, reversing the benefit to net income with a corresponding increase to opening retained earnings, capital neutral as of year-end.  
On Slide 4, we provide additional detail on reserving actions. As a reminder, these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which provides for the possibility for a more adverse outcome. Our reserve release this quarter primarily reflects our improving macroeconomic outlook, although I would note, we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty as the pace and shape of the recovery is still evolved. 
Overall, looking at the reserves we hold today, we believe that we are well positioned with nearly $28 billion in reserves, which represents an allowance for credit losses of roughly 4% on funded loan.  
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $4.8 billion, up 30% from last year. Operating margin declined 5% on lower revenues and a 2% increase in expenses, primarily reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, while credit costs were down considerably given a $1.3 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvement in the outlook for global GDP as well as fewer downgrades in the portfolio. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.4%, including 4.4% on the noninvestment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $210 million.  
Looking at full year results, the ICG business has performed well this year with 13% revenue growth, positive operating leverage and operating margin growth of 24%. But given the ACL build this year, ICG EBIT declined 6%. And for the full year, ICG delivered a 13.8% return on allocated capital.  
Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Revenues decreased 1% in the fourth quarter as strong trading performance was offset by lower revenues in TTS, Investment Banking and Corporate Lending.  
On the banking side, revenues declined 7%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 8% as reported and 6% in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenue. Average deposits were up 22% in constant dollars, and we had solid growth in our underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown, with increased digital adoption, cross-border transaction volumes growing over 10% and a record quarter in clearing. Investment Banking revenues were down 5% from last year, as solid growth in equity underwriting was more than offset by lower revenues in M&A and debt underwriting.  
Private Bank revenues grew 6%, driven by capital market strength as well as improved managed investment revenues and higher lending. Corporate Lending revenues were down 25%, driven by lower spreads, higher hedging costs and lower average volume. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues increased 13% from last year. Fixed Income revenues grew 7% as higher revenues across spread products and commodities were partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currency, although I would note that we saw solid performance in FX and global rates and good client engagement across the entire business.  
Equity revenues were up 57% versus last year, driven by strong performance in cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting higher client volumes and more favorable market conditions. 
And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were unchanged on a reported basis, but up 2% in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients with broken deposits, settlement volumes and assets under custody were partially offset by lower spreads.  
For full year 2020, revenues increased 13% driven by the significant strength in markets this year, along with a solid contribution from Investment Banking and the Private Bank. Throughout the year, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses as we actively helped our clients navigate through this uncertain environment, given our global platform, our progress in creating new digital solutions and our full-service model, which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise. 
And given the momentum we've seen this year in key drivers, including digital adoption, deposit growth and client engagement, we're even better positioned to ensure additional share gains in 2021 as these clients more fully recognize the benefits of using Citi as their platform of choice.  
Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. GCB delivered EBIT of $1.7 billion. Revenues declined 13% as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in Wealth Management were more than offset by lower card volume and lower interest rates across all regions. That said, we did see signs of stabilization sequentially this quarter.  
Expenses increased 4% across both North America and international consumers, driven mostly by higher repositioning. Excluding repositioning costs, total GCB expenses were flat as COVID-related costs were largely offset by efficiency savings. Credit cost decreased 45% as lower volumes and improved delinquencies led to lower net credit loss, coupled with an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions. 
And looking at full year results, GCB delivered EBIT of $1.1 billion, down significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and higher reserve builds under CECL.  
Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Total fourth quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, but we did see positive momentum in our drivers this quarter. And on a sequential basis, revenues grew 3%. Branded cards revenues were down 13%, reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans. 
Purchase sales grew 9% sequentially on both seasonal activity as well as the continued recovery in consumer spending but were still down year-over-year. At the same time, we're seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid, and we have not yet seen stress in their overall ability to pay. So while purchase activity has improved, our clients are also paying down more quickly, resulting in continued pressure on our loan balance. Retail services revenues were down 16% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments.
Net interest revenues were down 12% as average loans declined by 11% on lower purchase sales activities and higher payment rates. Similar to branded cards, purchase sales grew 18% sequentially but remained down year-over-year. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower losses in 2020 and, therefore, higher income share.  
Retail Banking revenues were down 1% year-over-year as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spread. Average deposits were up 21%, including 29% growth in checking. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with digital deposits increasing $2 billion quarter-over-quarter. We saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with 18% year-over-year growth in Citigold client and 11% growth in assets under management. 
Overall, we feel good about our client engagement as we exit the year, with spend activity continuing to recover, underlying strength in wealth management drivers and significant deposit growth giving us the opportunity to grow and deepen these relationships going forward as we continue to invest in our products and digital capability. 
On Slide 9, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 16%, with a 7% increase in Citigold client and 13% growth in net new money. And average deposit growth remained strong at 14%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year with purchase sales down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we did see sequential improvement in purchase sales this quarter, in line with our expectations. 
Turning to Latin America. Total revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter with average balances up 13% and purchase sales improved sequentially. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment. 
Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit loss rates generally trended downward this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S., lower spending and the benefits of relief program. However, in Asia, credit loss rates increased, mostly driven by those accounts that exited relief programs in line with our expectations. The year-over-year rise in delinquencies outside the U.S. is concentrated in accounts rolling off relief programs and reflects more modest levels of stimulus in these regions relative to the U.S. Given these trends, we continue to expect peak losses to occur in Asia and Mexico during the first half of 2021 and should begin to recover thereafter. 
Meanwhile, in the U.S., while we do expect losses to begin to rise in 2021, given today's delinquency trend and the expected impact of recent stimulus, we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out to the first half of 2022. Whether continuing to push out these losses is simply a matter of timing or if it will ultimately result in lower aggregate losses remains to be seen, and it's something we are watching closely. 
Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of lower rates, the wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of episodic gains. Expenses were roughly flat as the wind-down of legacy assets offset investments in infrastructure, risk management and control. And the pretax loss was $690 million this quarter, roughly in line with our prior outlook. 
Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.5 billion in the quarter declined $1.3 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and excluding market was roughly flat to the third quarter. And net interest margin declined 3 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenue and balance sheet expansion due to strong deposit growth. 
Turning to noninterest revenues in the fourth quarter, non-NIR declined 6% to just over $6 billion, given lower levels of consumer activity year-over-year. 
Turning to full year results. Revenues were flat with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenue driven by continued strong performance in markets throughout the year as well as strength in investment banking. 
On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.8% or 180 basis points above our regulatory minimum. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $73.83 driven by net income. 
Before I hand it back to Mike, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the top line, we saw an extraordinary year in market performance in 2020 and would expect some degree of normalization this year. And subject to how that plays out, we can see revenues down in the mid to high single-digit range this year, largely driven by market. This outlook assumes industry wallets more similar to 2019 levels. And for net interest revenue specifically, it assumes continued stabilization in the first half of the year with an improvement in the back half to our base case, which assumes loan growth by this point in the recovery. 
On a full year basis, the decline in net interest revenues is somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion versus 2020. On the expense side, we expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation. Our cost of credit should be meaningfully lower than 2020. And we expect a tax rate of roughly 21% for the year. 
So pulling this together, we expect operating margin pressure this year. But given lower credit costs, we should still see significant improvement in profitability relative to 2020. 
And finally, as Mike mentioned earlier, we look forward to repurchasing shares through the balance of 2021, subject to Board approval, starting this quarter. 
To wrap up, as I look at how we performed in 2020, we demonstrated the significant earnings power and resilience of the franchise. We sit here today with strong capital and liquidity position. Overall client engagement remains strong. We grew book value every quarter, and we remain focused on supporting colleagues, customers, clients and community, all of which give me a great deal of confidence as we move into 2021. 
With that, let me hand it back to Mike."

I want to thank Mike for his support and for working so closely with me during this transition. It was important to him to ensure Citi has a seamless CEO transition and has obviously been tremendously helpful",888,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I want to thank Mike for his support and for working so closely with me during this transition. It was important to him to ensure Citi has a seamless CEO transition and has obviously been tremendously helpful to me as I prepare to step into the role at the end of February. 
I am extremely excited by the opportunities ahead for our firm, and I am equally determined to address the deficiencies in our risk and control environment that have been raised by our regulators. We've embarked on a transformation program that will clearly benefit our clients and investors as well as meeting the regulators' expectations of one of the world's most globally significant financial institutions. And of course, we still have to get through this pandemic. While we hope the end is in sight, this virus has surprised us and taught us the folly of best-laid plans, so we will remain vigilant and adaptable. 
My 2 major priorities as I transition with Mike are our transformation effort and refreshing our strategy so we ultimately achieved 3 things: best position Citi to win, to improve our returns significantly and to address the issues raised by our regulators. While it's early days, our work on these priorities is well underway. 
So on the transformation, we're taking the time to step back, to tackle the root cause issues, to define our target end state and develop the detailed plans to get us there. We put in place specific work streams against risk and controls, data and compliance, but we also have work streams on creating a culture of excellence and accountability and on strengthening our critical business processes. Each stream is led by a member of the executive management team. Together, we are accountable for simplifying and modernizing the bank. 
In February, we will deliver our gap analysis to the target state; and in May, the detailed implementation plan. This effort will take time and it will require significant investment in technology and talent. 
You have my commitment that we will invest your capital wisely, and that you, our clients and our regulators, will all see and benefit from the results. At the end of the day, we want to achieve a state of excellence in our risk and controls, in our operations and in our service to clients. 
Switching back the strategy. I have the benefit of having worked in a number of businesses and regions in Citi over the last 16 years. Nonetheless, this transition is giving me valuable time to step back and to take a dispassionate look at our strategy and businesses. You wouldn't expect me to come out with specifics at this rather early stage, but I can talk about how we are looking at this. 
We have a wonderful franchise, first-class capabilities and a terrific brand name. We are the world's most global bank with a network no one can match. And this means we are uniquely able to help clients grow and succeed globally. Our capital and balance sheet is strong. We have a deep talent bench around the world. So while we have work to do, this is a pretty good hand to play. 
A few principles will guide how we refresh our strategy. We're taking a clinical look at our strategic positioning, assessing which businesses can attain leading market positions in a much more digitized world. Similarly, I believe in the value of focus and directing our investments and resources to the businesses that will drive stronger growth and improve returns over the long run.  I also believe in ensuring the businesses we're in fit well together. So collectively, they are competitively advantaged and generate synergies. 
And finally, like any true Scot, I believe there is value to unlock by simplifying the firm. As you know, on Wednesday, we announced that we will integrate Consumer Wealth Management and our Private Bank into one business line. It's a growth opportunity I'm particularly excited about in Asia as well as the U.S. 
Earlier in the week, we also announced the new head of our TTS franchise and our U.S. consumer leadership. And I look forward to sharing new opportunities and moves with you as we go. 
I want to end as I began, by thanking Mike. He has spent his 38-year career at Citi. No one has been more dedicated. He always put Citi first. And he took over at a very difficult time. He had to make tough calls, steering the company through the post-crisis restructuring. He made Citi a simpler, smaller, safer and far stronger institution, returning it to growth, closing the gap with our peers and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders just as he promised he would. 
His steady leadership this year helped us through this very difficult period for all of us, but this last year showed how the work he led has strengthened our firm as we supported our people, clients and communities through this pandemic. He leaves us with a tremendous foundation, and I am committed to building on his success. We are very grateful to him and proud of him. And all of us at Citi wish him the very best in the next chapter. 
Mike, would you like to say something to close?"

When we look at the States, we already have an extremely active card customer base on the digital front. And so we weren't expecting to see the same levels of pickup. 
I'd say the other piece as well is customer acquisition across the board is lower because of COVID. And you typically do tend to see that the new customers, when they come on board anyone's platform, they tend to have a higher digital adoption rate. So I think we're pretty optimistic that as and when we see the recovery, that we'll also see growth in that digital adoption in the U.S. going forward."

Most of that is likely to be driven by the transformation spend as we get our arms around what that cost is going to be. You know already we spent $1 billion this year. That's in our run rate already. 
But there is a broader investment strategy that we're working towards, and we're doing that in the context of -- we'll obviously do that in the context of how the strategy Jane spoke to evolves. 
And so continued investment in digital capabilities, both on the consumer side, as you heard me mention, but also on the ICG side, particularly in our TTS platform where we've seen good benefits from the investments already made there. But as you know, that's an area where innovation and technology is what's required to maintain a competitive advantage there. 
We just announced the wealth management business, if you will, bringing together wealth from the consumer and in the private bank. And that, I would imagine, will be -- not I would imagine, that will be an area of investment for us as we grow fee revenues, as Jane has pointed to, as an important objective of ours. We'll also see growth in advertising and marketing. 
So in that outlook, I talked about net interest revenue stabilizing but picking up in the back half of the year with growth in loans. And that growth in loans is going to be a byproduct of us starting to put money to work again back in advertising and marketing, which was down materially this year as we managed through this crisis. 
So those are a couple of areas that we would look to invest in, in the context of that 2% to 3%. But again, a lot of it is going to be towards this transformation. And it is an investment, which I continue to remind folks of, and that is to say that we expect to and we'll focus on ensuring that we get a payback on that in the coming years. And so hopefully, that gives you a good sense, John."

Some of that's seasonal, but some of that just really good activity with our customers, and we're looking for that to continue. We -- obviously, there's been a stimulus that's been announced already.

Look, I mean we -- when we think about our reserve levels and the activity there, we certainly did factor in the impact of stimulus. 
I think what's important to point to is the stimulus thus far has resulted in high payment rates and a consistent kind of ability to pay for the consumer, and that's been good. And it showed up not only in our payment rates, but it also shows up in the lower level of delinquencies that we've seen and obviously the lower level of losses that we've seen. 
There certainly is a need for additional stimulus. And I think the good thing about that is it should continue to support the payment rates that we've seen. And if it is significant enough, can ultimately drive greater consumption and support improved GDP, improved unemployment. 
Our current forecast, as you heard me mention earlier, assumes that, that loan momentum picks up towards the end of -- or the mid -- I'm sorry, the back half of 2021. If we see that take hold sooner, we could see higher levels of volume in loan growth. And obviously, that would be beneficial to our NIR forecast. 
So stimulus is good in that regard. It also will put -- as it takes hold, there'll likely be some early pressure on lending volumes because people tend -- are using it as a liquidity tool and to pay down. But over time, I think it will be beneficial."

And the reason I ask that is you mentioned Citi being global. But despite this global status, Citi's fallen short of expectations in each of the past 5 decades. You can go back to Walter Wriston, you can go back to the '80s, you can go back to Sandy Weill and John Reed, the financial supermarket, you can go back to the financial crisis, and even with the retrenching and derisking, and I agree the chance of bankruptcy is far less, the return on capital has fallen short of the cost of capital for the last decade.
So you'll be the seventh CEO at Citigroup when you take over. Why will it be different this time? What can you do differently, whether it's business mix or customer mix or geographic mix? Because from my perspective and I -- it's great. You can take a clinical look, a dispassionate look. But I'm extremely passionate about the underperformance of the Citi over almost any time frame over the last 50 years. And so I'm just trying to figure out what you can do given your 16 years at Citi, your experience at McKinsey to actually finally change Citi to generate sustainable returns above the cost of capital. So once again, where -- what's Citi's endgame?"

That means top-tier franchises in their respective competitive sets with a strategy that has been well understood by the market over that time frame. We want to be best-in-class in serving our clients and our customers, certainly in safety and soundness. And I'd add in, we want to be seen as playing a positive role in society as I think that's a very important part of mix these days. But all of that is with the purpose of generating the desired returns for our investors. 
So to be fair, while we have made demonstrable progress over the last 10 years since the crisis, equally know that there is a gap to close with our peers. You can hold me accountable for doing so along with the management team. We're a team on a mission to get this done, and we will get this done."

We've come out with one already that we think is an important one on that dimension in wealth, where we've got many different parts of the puzzle that we think will enable us to be highly successful in this domain, bringing the different pieces of the firm together to drive this forward and is clearly going to be one of several areas that we see helping us improve our returns. 
And as Mike said, that's not the only piece. There are other elements, as I said, in the different principles. We see value from simplification. And that's in terms of, obviously, the operating efficiencies and the like that we would get from that as well as potentially business mix. And we want to drive the businesses to make sure that they're really fitting well together so that they are achieving the synergies as well as the competitive and collective comparative advantage. 
So it's going to be a combination of pieces. But as I say, we're doing this work.

Yes, there are some drags. I mentioned that earlier. They certainly do weigh on the returns between the DTA and legacy assets. But we also have excess capital as we sit here with the CET1 ratio of an 11.80% versus 11.50% target that we have.

We think of it as part of our services business inside of the ICG services would include TTS and security services. As you know, we have a very unique position within this part of our franchise. And you're right, the headline numbers are affected by interest rates. But we feel very good about the underlying momentum in the business, and we think that's evidenced by a couple of key drivers. 
You're aware we're in 95 countries. That gives our clients the ability to transact in over 140 currencies. And we do that on a global platform. We have 600,000 users on that platform, which is up about 9% from last year. And within that, the mobile users are up about 95%. 
We're continuing to grow accounts with our clients. And we now have the ability to open accounts digitally in 50 countries. In 2020, we opened over 14,000 accounts digitally, representing more than a 200% increase. And growing accounts deepens our relationship with clients and allows us to penetrate new activity centers, that allows us to capture more flows across our platform. And ultimately, that delivers more revenue. And so this digital activity drives revenue for us in the future, and it also is more -- in a more efficient way for us to do business with clients. 
We're also seeing good transaction volumes across different payment types with these clients. We've had very good clearing performance and cross-border flows through the year. And so those things give us a lot of insight into what the momentum will look like coming out of this crisis. And that's not to mention additional opportunities with new clients. As you know, we've moved our commercial business squarely into the ICG. There's more upside for our TTS platform with a commercial -- with the commercial client base. 
And so we feel very good about where we are. We're not taking our position for granted. We're going to continue to invest in this platform, and we're looking forward to capturing the growth and supporting our clients as they come out of this crisis."

Jane mentioned we're in the midst of making progress against our transformation. And we'll need to submit a plan in May and get that plan approved and continue to invest to get that executed against. And that will inform the thinking around some of the outer-years. But to answer your question around a bloated expense base, I would say no. It's not a bloated expense base at all. These are investments, as you've heard me mention repeatedly, and they're going to be -- there is going to be a return on the investment. The return will come in both revenue and a more efficient operating platform. 
We've got a history now. We've got some credibility now with having demonstrated productivity across our platform, whether that's through automating processes or reducing data centers or low-cost location strategies. 
Since our Investor Day, we've continued to improve our productivity. And that's what you should expect. That's what we're expecting of ourselves and we'll deliver on kind of coming out of these investments that we need to make. And so no, not a bloated expense base. 
With that said, so put that aside, we are going to continue to invest in the business. And so if there are opportunities that present themselves, either as a byproduct of the strategy, refresh that Jane has mentioned or otherwise, we intend to take advantage of making those investments because that is the only way we get to those improved returns that we're targeting and focused on. So hopefully, that answers your question."

And if it ends up that there are businesses as we look at it that we don't think that fit well into the mix, then I think we've got good skills in terms of thinking about how we divest of those in a way that makes sense.

And so you're right, there's a funding cost advantage to that. We've seen that play out and the liquidity that's in the market. We intend to continue to grow as it relates to increasing those deposits. And we've been smart about how we've been managing our liquidity, keeping some liquidity, obviously, there for lending needs as they may evolve for our customers and clients but also paying down wholesale debt. We did that through the year and also investing. 
We've made some investments through the year. I think we've invested as much as another $78 billion or so, up 21% for the year. And so we've been thoughtfully managing the liquidity that we've seen through the course of this year. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to grow deposits on the consumer side because you're right, it is a lower-cost funding alternative.

And is there some room for that reserve release to be potentially larger as we go through the year?

So one, as you know, Betsy, when we model this, we look at kind of the macroeconomic variables that we have at any point in time. And so you look at kind of Page 4, we laid out the variables that we've used this quarter. And you can see that both for U.S. unemployment as well as for U.S. real GDP, we've seen improvement since the third quarter forecast that we ran. 
And I'd tell you, even as you look at this, there's been further improvement even off of the fourth quarter '20 forecast that's here. And so those are important factors in the assumptions and what we're able to model in the way of reserve levels. And as we see that improve or improve further, we would expect that, that would be -- that would play out in the way of even lower reserves. 
I think the other important factor is the stimulus and how that -- and the additional stimulus that is out there and how that ultimately evolves and what that means and whether that drives consumer consumption and whether that drives even further levels of improved unemployment will be important factors that come into play here. 
And then I guess the final piece I'd mention is that we continue to hold management adjustment for economic uncertainty. And as we see these variables continue to improve, that's going to impact how we think about severity and probability associated with that downside scenario. So all of those factors come into play as to how we think about the reserve levels that we carry. While we still feel good about the $28 billion roughly that we have in the way of balances, we feel very good about the direction that these economic variables appear to be moving. 
In terms of losses, again, it's been interesting the way this has played out. And so really, what we're all trying to figure out is whether the lower delinquencies and lower level of losses that we've seen thus far is a delay or is it a deflation of losses, right? And that only time will tell as we sit here today. And as you heard me say in my prepared remarks, we think it's a bit of a delay in that we would expect to see losses peak in 2022 now, particularly for U.S. consumer. But again, with another stimulus right around the corner, that, in fact, could be further delayed and ultimately we would hope that it would just go away and be deflated and come down. So..."

But the dialogue has been very good. And that's both in investment banking, but also just broadly with the corporate clients as corporate clients are trying to figure out what coming out of this crisis means for their own business models and how they think about their digital capabilities and needs and how they think about their supply chains and how that might be shifting. And those types of dialogues they're having both internally but also with us. And so we're part of that conversation. And being part of that creates opportunities on the TTS side, on the Investment Banking side and potentially even as it relates to the corporate lending activity, which we hope to pick up in the back half of the year as well. 
And so very, very strong and continued corporate dialogue, and I think that's going to contribute ultimately to driving some of that fee revenue that you mentioned.

The unevenness, the way that we went into this in terms of timing, in terms of position, in terms of health response, in terms of economic response. You look at the demographics, and clearly, in -- at the different layers or different strata, you see different things. Headlines in the paper this morning, 1 out of every 5 in New York City on rent subsidy are behind in their payments, at least 2 payments. But at the same time, we continue to see paydowns in terms of credit cards. Businesses on different trajectories. 
And so again, as I think as we see vaccines roll out on a state-by-state basis, that will cause different outcomes. And then as we see the second round and what President-elect Biden announced last night and ultimately what comes through and how that makes its way into the sector. 
So from our perspective, not just in the U.S., but around the globe, we are really taking a very granular approach on a geographic by geographic, client segment by client segment around that and trying to remain very sensitive to each of those. And so I don't think there is a single formula that allows you to look at this and come with the outcome. It's got to be done at a pretty granular level."

And specifically, I wanted to focus on your FICC trading businesses. Can you give us a little bit more color as it relates to the fourth quarter where the strength in FICC was and where the weakness was in terms of rates, credit, commodities, currencies? 
And then as part of that, it's my understanding that you were caught wrong-footed in the rand. And I was wondering -- and I'm assuming that losses there were not material because it's not a deep market. But is there something changing about the environment that's going to make it more difficult in 2021 for positioning or market making or trading? Because you do talk about normalizing. Was there anything in that rand experience that you can extrapolate?"

And so it was our analysts going out with what they believed was a recommendation around that. And so that shouldn't be read as the firm necessarily having that position. Independent research came out with that. 
On your second piece, I think as you look at FICC trading, for us, if you look at the fourth quarter and the numbers that we've posted, I think you should look in there, I think relative strength in terms of credit and credit spread products, again, as we measure that against our rates and currencies business, it's not as large. It's still a meaningful business for us but not as large. Some of that other people have spoken to as having outsized, quite significant returns in the leverage lending space. We're not as large in that space. 
And I think as we look at our trading revenues, we tend to look at those over not just quarter but longer cycles. And if you look at The Street research today, it's indicating that the trading wallet for 2020 was up somewhere in the neighborhood of mid-20s. As you look at our trading revenues for 2020, we're probably up somewhere in the mid-30s. So again, quarter-to-quarter, less important. But again, for us continuing to take share in there and the underlying mix tends to kind of bounce that around a little bit. But again, I think we feel pretty good about our position and the dialogues where we are. 
I think as we think forward, I think it's unlikely to think that we're going to see wallets up to the same degree, certainly in the trading space that we saw this year. We think seasonality will resume. But as Mark said, as we kind of started and it's early in the new year, we have seen activity remain high. And as I think we see more potential stimulus or governmental programs coming out, the Fed and others continuing to take stances on rates and trajectory and where things go, that could keep trading volumes, keep creating volumes relatively high. 
So again, we think we're pretty well positioned, and we're in dialogue around those, but we clearly can't escape all of the market dynamics of where the wallets go."

Every quarter, we'll look at what our projected performance would suggest, including that stress capital buffer juxtaposed against our target.

And then if I could ask 2 short technical questions. I didn't quite catch what you said about LatAm NCLs coming down. What was the reason for that? It just strikes me as a bit surprising that, that should be the case.

And so yes, we have seen a significant increase in deposits. That does impact a number of the important metrics. From an SLR point of view, if not for the relief, which kind of goes away at the end of the first quarter, we'd have a lower SLR by 109 basis points. So the reg relief provided 109 basis points of relief there. 
It also has had an impact on -- and by the way, we are managing to that SLR relief going away at the end of the first quarter. So we're aware of that. We're managing accordingly to that. 
It's also had an impact on our GCIB score, which is -- has kind of tripped into the next bucket, the 3.5% bucket. And the large percentage of that increase that we've seen in the GCIB score was also driven by deposits. And so we'll have to manage that as well. Obviously, there -- we have a view that some consideration needs to be given to both of these metrics as the Fed has been clear in terms of their view that there's enough capital in the system. And so we're hopeful that as kind of things evolve, that some consideration is given to that. But in the meantime, we're managing the balance sheet and deposits and capital accordingly and with full knowledge of how the relief might evolve in the case of the SLR. 
In terms of your question on credit risk in Latin America, the point that I was making here was that because we've had customers that were part of a relief program, that the NCLs that we've seen have been lower than what they would have been if those customers were not running through the relief program. So you see the NCL -- the lower NCL in the quarter, but you also start to see delinquencies pick up. And those delinquencies are picking up as people come out of that relief program and start to -- or stop paying, I should say, and therefore, you see delinquencies take up. 
And so shortly, you'll see the NCL start to pick up as people go beyond the 90 days past due delinquent and go into losses. Hopefully, that was clear. 
The last question you asked was on advanced RWA growth. I mean we did see RWA increase quarter-over-quarter. The drivers there was -- they were a combination of credit risk, market risk and operational risk. And inside of that, we saw FX drive some of that increase as well as derivatives and mostly derivative and FX exposure increases, including CVA. So those are the major drivers of the RWA on an advanced basis tick-up that we saw."

Mark and I have a lot to cover today, so let's get cracking. 
Earlier today, we announced our earnings for the first quarter as well as the initial strategic actions we're taking in our Global Consumer Bank to focus on our competitive advantages and to improve our returns to our shareholders. I'll start with some observations, therefore, in the first quarter and then -- and update you on the ongoing work on our strategy. 
It's been a much better-than-expected start of the year, and we are optimistic about the recovery ahead of us, and we're positioning the bank for a period of sustained growth. 
For the quarter, we reported earnings of $3.62 per share on net income of $7.9 billion. This was a record quarter in net income, driven by good performance in our institutional business, and a release of $3.9 billion from our allowance for credit losses as a result of the improving economic outlook. 
In the Institutional clients group, our markets businesses benefited yet again from an active environment. We saw solid performance in fixed income after a very strong first quarter last year and a record quarter in equities. We also had a record quarter in Investment Banking, reflecting high levels of activity in equity underwriting. 
Treasury and trade solutions, which is the backbone of our global network, grew deposits even though revenues continued to be impacted by low interest rates. 
Global Consumer Banking revenues were down quarter-over-quarter as a result of the pandemic. However, we clearly see a recovery taking root in Asia as well as the U.S., and that was reflected in our ACL release. And I'd note this is the healthiest we have seen the consumer emerge from a crisis in recent history, driven in large part by the U.S. government stimulus package. 
Now while loan demand was down, we did see strong growth in wealth management and in digital engagement, both of which are central to the consumer franchise we are building. 
And our capital levels remained strong and stable, allowing us to respond to the needs of our clients and to return capital to our shareholders. 
At 11.7%, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was unchanged from the fourth quarter, and we resumed the repurchase of common stock which we voluntarily paused at the onset of the pandemic. 
Our tangible book value increased to $75.50, up 5% from a year ago. 
Now turning to our strategy. When we spoke in January, I pointed to 4 principles which we're using to guide the refresh of our strategy. First, we said we will be clinical in assessing which businesses we can retain or secure leading market positions in. Next, we're going to be focused by directing resources to high-returning businesses and away from the others. Third, we're going to be connected so we ensure our businesses fit well together and that they generate synergies. And last, we're going to be simpler to better serve our clients, fulfill our obligations to our regulators and unlock value for our shareholders. 
We also committed to take the strategic decisions needed to best position Citi to win and to close the gap in returns with our competitors. And we committed to share these decisions with you as we make them, and that's what we're doing again today. 
Now I spoke in January about our new focus on wealth. We believe we're very well positioned to capture strong growth and attractive returns in this business, particularly in Asia and the U.S. Today, wealth at Citi represents roughly $6.5 billion in revenues, with 3/4 of $1 trillion of client assets. And there's many synergies with our markets, BCMA and commercial banking franchises, across our global network. 
Yesterday, we announced the management team for Citi Global Wealth and the work and investments are well underway on the business strategy and growth plans. 
And today, we announced our decision to focus our consumer banking franchise in Asia and EMEA solely on 4 wealth centers, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE and London. This positions us to capture the full spectrum of the wealth opportunity through these important hubs where we can serve onshore and offshore clients. And in Asia, this will allow us to continue operating our leading consumer businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, which are both scaled and very high-returning. 
We will, therefore, pursue exits of our consumer businesses in the remaining 13 markets in Asia and EMEA. Now while these are excellent franchises, we don't have the scale we need to compete, and we've decided we simply aren't the best owners of them over the long term. So consistent with the principles we outlined at the strategy refresh, we believe our capital, our investment dollars and other resources are better redeployed against higher returning opportunities elsewhere. 
What does this mean? This means that Global Consumer Banking will consist of 2 scale franchises in the U.S. and Mexico and these 4 hubs serving 100 million customers in total. 
Let me be very clear on one very important point. Citi will continue to invest behind and serve our institutional clients in these 13 markets. We have a high-returning and leading institutional franchise in Asia, and it is an absolutely central part of our success going forward. And we see important opportunities to invest and gain share with our institutional clients region-wide. 
Indeed, I saw from my own experience in Latin America how the institutional businesses in each market really benefited from the increased focus once we had exited our subscale consumer franchises and simplify the operating model in the region. I fully expect the same will be true in Asia. 
And in the meantime, the comprehensive work on our strategy refresh continues. We will continue to share the decisions we make with you as we work to close the gap in returns with our peers. 
In parallel, we are, of course, hard at work on our transformation. We're making our next submission to the OCC this quarter. It's a massive body of work. We continue to work closely with our regulators to meet their expectations, and we expect to submit our complete plan to both regulators no later than the third quarter. We've identified the end state, performed the gap analysis and are currently working through the detailed resourcing and program plans and interdependencies and we've begun execution on several fronts. The investments required go hand-in-hand with our strategy work. So for example, when we talk about simplification, we're pursuing it through changes to our operating model, but also by removing manual processes and controls. 
And make no mistake about it. We want to achieve nothing less than a fundamental transformation by delivering excellence in our risk and control environment, in our operations and in our service to clients. 
So I am excited about the road ahead. And I have no doubt that these investments and others that we're going to make in talent and technology are going to help us modernize the bank and position Citi to win. 
And finally, I want to update you on some of the commitments we're making in terms of ESG. Now we've prided ourselves in being a leader in many dimensions of ESG over the years. I see it as embedded in what we offer to our clients and the communities we serve around the world. And as you may know, on my first day as CEO in the beginning of March, I committed that Citi would reach net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and we will deliver our plan on how we will do so within the next 12 months. 
Critical to helping our clients transition to a low-carbon economy is the support we provide them through our environmental finance activities. So to that end, we're going to extend our current environmental finance target from $250 billion by 2025 to $500 billion by 2030. 
And in addition, we finance other activities in support of the UN's sustainable development goals outside of environmental finance. And these include our important investments in affordable housing, in health care and workforce development. We are committing an additional $500 billion to these activities by 2030, making our total sustainable development goal commitment $1 trillion by 2030. 
And with that, I am going to turn over to Mark, and then we will both be delighted to take your questions. Mark."

Overall, we had a stronger-than-expected start to",2761,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Let me briefly review the results for the quarter, and then I'll go into more detail on the strategic refresh and specific actions we announced earlier today. 
Overall, we had a stronger-than-expected start to the year, driven by a constructive capital markets backdrop as well as a benefit from the cost of credit for the quarter. 
For the quarter, Citigroup reported net income of $7.9 billion. Revenues declined 7% from the prior year. While we saw continued strength in Investment Banking and a solid markets performance, it was more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, along with lower card loans in consumer and the absence of the prior year mark-to-market gains on loan hedges. 
Expenses were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued investments in our transformation, including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. 
Credit performance remained strong, with net credit losses of $1.7 billion, more than offset by an ACL release of $3.9 billion driven primarily by an improvement in our macroeconomic outlook as well as lower loan balances. 
EPS was $3.62 and RoTCE was just over 20%. 
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 10% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. 
Deposits grew 7%, reflecting consistent client engagement with both corporate and consumer clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity. 
Before I go into more detail on each business, on Slide 4, I'd like to cover the strategic refresh that Jane discussed earlier. 
Last quarter, we spoke about the significant opportunity wealth represents for Citi going forward and announced the formation of Citi Global Wealth in order to better connect assets and capabilities across the consumer and institutional franchises and to transform the way we serve clients across the wealth spectrum. 
We've continued the build-out of Citi Global Wealth this quarter and have provided some details on the scope of the business on the slide, with additional information on key drivers in the appendix. 
Citi Global Wealth represented roughly $6.6 billion in allocated annual revenues. And it delivered 15% growth in investment revenues last year, driven by higher client activity and growth in client investment assets. As we continue to integrate the component businesses into a single wealth platform, we will finalize how best to implement this strategy from an organizational standpoint over the coming quarters and update you accordingly. 
Turning next to the actions we announced today. Given our strategic focus on global wealth management, we announced the decision to focus our Global Consumer Banking presence in Asia and EMEA on 4 wealth centers. As Jane mentioned, this strategic shift will allow us to simplify our operating model, while directing investments and resources to the businesses where we have competitive advantages and the scale necessary to drive higher returns over the long run. 
Let me describe the 13 markets where we will pursue an exit, shown on the slide, with added details in the appendix. 
Last year, these businesses contributed roughly $4 billion of revenues. And while historically profitable, like other consumer businesses, the impact of CECL weighed on full year results given the pandemic, with cost of credit nearly doubling in these markets year-over-year. Total assets were $82 billion as of the end of 2020, and the businesses are supported by roughly $7 billion of allocated TCE. 
We have a good track record of reducing expenses in similar situations. However, as noted on the slide, we are including fully allocated expenses to these markets, which could differ somewhat from the ultimate expense reductions. We will continue to manage these markets as part of the GCB franchise but we already have relevant actions well underway. We plan to share more information with you as we make progress against these and other actions as part of our ongoing strategy refresh. 
Finally, I want to emphasize a point that Jane made earlier. We will continue to serve ICG clients, including our commercial banking clients, in all these markets. And more broadly, this strategic shift will allow us to focus more investments on ICG in Asia. 
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients group. We delivered a solid performance in the quarter, driven by strong execution in the constructive operating environment. 
For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $7.7 billion, up 65% from last year. Revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the absence of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges seen last year. Excluding this, revenues were up 5%, with 9% growth in banking and 2% growth in markets and security services. 
Expenses increased 8%, reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, along with other strategic investments, higher compensation cost and volume-driven growth. 
Credit costs were down considerably, given a $1.9 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvements in the outlook for global GDP as well as modest improvements in portfolio credit quality. 
As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.1%, including 3.6% on the non investment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $186 million, and ICG delivered a 25.7% return on allocated capital. 
Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were up 5%, driven by record revenues in both equity underwriting and equity trading. Looking at these strong results across our overarching equities franchise, we feel good about the strategic investments we've been making which enabled us to leverage our full-service model to better monetize the current market. 
On the banking side, revenues increased 9%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 10% in constant dollars, as good client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues. 
Despite these headwinds, we continue to see strength in our underlying business drivers, including 14% growth in average deposits in constant dollars this quarter. And over the past year, we've seen significant increases in digital adoption and penetration as well as 7% growth in cross-border flows and 6% growth in clearing volumes. 
Investment Banking experienced its best quarter ever with revenues up 46%, driven by equity underwriting given our leading position in the Spac market. 
Private Bank revenues grew 8%, also its best quarter ever, driven by higher lending volumes and managed investments revenues. 
Corporate lending revenues were also up 8%, reflecting the absence of prior year marks, partially offset by lower volumes. 
Total Markets & Securities Services revenues increased 2% from last year. 
Fixed Income revenues decreased 5%, reflecting a strong performance in rates and currencies last year. 
However, spread products revenues were up from the prior year as clients search for yield in this low rate environment, with steady demand across flow and structured products. 
Equities revenues were up 26% versus last year, driven by cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. 
And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and roughly flat in constant dollars. Here, we saw good growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients, driven by growth in deposits, assets under custody and settlement volumes, offset by lower spreads. 
Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. While we are still seeing the impact of the pandemic and high payment rates on revenues, consumer spending continues to improve and credit remains healthy, pointing to a recovery as we move through the year. 
For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.8 billion, up significantly from last year, primarily driven by improved credit costs. 
Revenues declined 15% as lower card balances and lower interest rates across all 3 regions were partially offset by continued strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management. 
Expenses decreased 1% as efficiency savings and lower volume-related costs were partially offset by investments. 
Credit costs decreased significantly driven by an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions and lower net credit losses. The release this quarter primarily reflected lower volumes as well as improvements in the macro outlook. And GCB delivered a 25% return on allocated capital. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues were down 15% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues. 
Branded cards revenues were down 11%, reflecting a 15% decline in average loans as clients are using the liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt. 
Retail Services revenues were down 26%, reflecting higher partner payments as well as lower average loans. 
Net interest revenues were down 18% as average loans declined by 13% on higher payment rates. 
Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower forecasted losses and, therefore, higher income sharing. 
Looking more broadly on our cards businesses, we're continuing to see a recovery in sales activity. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were unchanged year-over-year, but essential spend was up 12%, and we are starting to see the recovery in areas like travel and dining. 
And in Retail Services, purchase sales grew 4%. So purchase sales are improving slightly faster than our prior expectations. And with the vaccine rollout, this should support a further recovery in discretionary spend. 
The bigger impact on loans is from the high payment rates. This is creating revenue pressure, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. 
So the good news is that we're seeing the recovery in spend, which should continue, and our credit portfolio is proving to be quite resilient. We are now focused on loan and revenue recovery through driving spend activity, reentering the market for new account acquisitions and investing in lending capabilities and new value propositions. 
Turning to Retail Banking, revenues were down 8% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. 
Average deposits were up 22%, including 30% growth in checking. And AUMs were up 32%. 
We're also continuing to broaden our digital capabilities to extend from deposits to wealth management to mortgage lending. As Jane mentioned, we're committed to the franchise, and all of this gives us confidence in our ability to scale our U.S. retail bank with a digitally led, client-centric approach supported by life physical expansion in new markets over time. 
On Slide 9, we show the results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. 
In Asia, revenues declined 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 22% with a 14% increase in Citigold clients and 13% growth in net new money. And the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 global wealth hubs. 
Average deposit growth remained strong at 13%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. 
Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year, with purchase sales down 5% and average loans down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. 
However, we are seeing some signs of a recovery, with the pickup in new card acquisitions and purchase sales year-over-year in the month of March. 
Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits and assets under management in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 9% and AUMs up 17%. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment. 
Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remained favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. And so peak losses may not occur until late 2022, depending on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. 
By contrast, in both Mexico and Asia, we saw a peak in credit losses in the first quarter of 2021. This was expected driven by the impact of customer accounts rolling off relief programs. The impact was pronounced in Mexico, with a peak NCL rate of over 10%, as we saw most customers roll off the relief programs at the end of the third quarter of last year. Excluding those accounts that participated in relief programs, our credit trends in both Mexico and Asia remain stable. And you can see improvement this quarter in delinquency rates. 
Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were roughly flat in dollar terms as the impact of lower rates was offset by the absence of marks versus the prior year as well as some episodic gains this quarter. 
Expenses were down 1% as investments in infrastructure, risk and controls were roughly offset by the allocation of certain costs to the businesses. This change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level. And given it was immaterial, we have not reflected the change retrospectively. 
Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. 
Finally, the pretax loss was $231 million this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $500 million for the remainder of 2021, although with some variation quarter-to-quarter. 
Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.2 billion this quarter declined $1.4 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances as well as the impact of 1 fewer day versus last year, partially offset by slightly higher trading-related NIR. 
Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and, excluding the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter, was roughly flat to the fourth quarter. 
And net interest margin declined 5 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenues, partially offset by treasury actions and balance sheet optimization. 
Turning to noninterest revenues. In the first quarter, non-NIR declined slightly to just over $9 billion, predominantly driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges offsetting strong Investment Banking revenues. 
On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics, which, as Jane mentioned, remained strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET 1 capital ratio remained 11.7% as net income was roughly offset by buybacks and dividends, along with the impact of OCI and an increase in risk-weighted assets. 
During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $2.7 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1.6 billion. 
Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $75.50, driven by net income. 
Before we move to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. 
First, our full year top line outlook has improved since last quarter. At that time, coming off the performance of 2020, we had expected industry wallets to return closer to the 2019 levels this year. Given the strong start to the year as well as the increasingly positive signs of a recovery ahead, we now believe wallets will be somewhat higher relative to 2019. 
Meanwhile, our outlook for net interest revenues is unchanged, and we continue to expect a decline in net interest revenues of somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion, with stabilization continuing into the second quarter and an improvement in the back half. 
Taken together, this suggests revenues down in the mid single-digit range, better than our prior guidance for a mid to high single-digit range decline. 
Second, on the expense side, we continue to expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation agenda. In addition, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I mentioned earlier, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. 
Finally, on cost of credit, we continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to credit performance. And depending on the macroeconomic outlook, we could see further reserve releases, although given the size of the reserve release this quarter, we would not expect to see the same magnitude of ACL release going forward. 
With that, Jane and I are happy to take any questions."

So I gave you one of the examples just earlier. But data would be an obvious example of this, where investment that we make in the quality of our data will have a big impact for our shareholders in terms of driving revenues, improving our client experience in making faster decision-making on risk or on business decisions as well as making sure that the data that we do have is properly governed from a safety and soundness perspective.

And I highlight that because as we make more investments, we will undoubtedly continue to seek out productivity opportunities that move to offset those."

What are the important linkages with the other businesses that can be maximized better? What systems and product platforms you need to add to get to these higher aspirations?"

Mark gave you some of the visibility into the size and scale of the business today. 
When I look at it, we've got a phenomenal brand name, an aspirational one, in the wealth space, particularly in Asia, but around the world. We have our commercial bank which operates in 30 different geographies around the world and is where a lot of the wealth is being created. So we have relationships and are helping with the actual wealth generation and source of wealth from many of our clients as well as obviously in ICG. We've got a top-tier institutional platform and capability. And we've got our presence very well established in these major wealth hubs around the world. 
So I do feel we're incredibly well positioned when we can bring these different assets and capabilities into a single platform. So the investments that we've already begun making is putting a single wealth platform organization in place. We made the announcement yesterday around the leadership, you'd have seen that. 
We've started investing in growing our relationship managers and FAs around the world and really bringing together the best of the firm. And I expect, as we work on the technology plan, we'll have some different tech stack lined up against that, too. 
So [ Jim O'Donnell, ] putting the plans together right now, but we see this as a tremendous opportunity, and you'll be able to measure us and hold us to account for this in terms of the returns that we generate, the growth in the fee income and continuing to steadily capture share in the years ahead."

And I think the broader theme of digitization, we have very high-quality clients in and out of footprint. And they've been very digitally engaged, and that's only increased. 50% of the new accounts this quarter in the retail bank were acquired digitally and about 75% of our clients, for example, are digitally engaged already.

Is this probably partially -- how you laid out guidance probably partially answers this question. But investors seem to believe that there could be upside to revenue for banks, whether it's continued expansion of wallet in your ICG business or in more traditional NIR sources. And I'm wondering -- it's a 2-part question. One, if we get better revenue from here, could you still achieve the 2% to 3% expense target? And as a follow-up, on the expenses that would be carved out from those exits, we heard from one of your peers that if you exclude overhead or expenses allocated to businesses exited, we would see a sort of a net expense saves of about 75% to 80% of identified expenses. And I'm wondering if that's the right ratio to think about those 13 markets that you're exiting."

So the first thing, just in terms of revenue, I did speak to this in the guidance. And what I referenced was, I talked about in the last quarter, the normalization of the markets' wallets and what we're seeing just at the on start of this year and the strong start that Jane referenced is that while I do expect there'll be some normalization, I would expect at this point that the market wallets will be above the 2019 levels. And so we do think that, that presents some upside. I talked about the -- and that's what kind of feeds in part the down mid single-digit guidance that I gave for total revenues. 
You're right with the steepening of the curve. That does present some opportunities. We've got dry powder to put liquidity to work. And we've done some of that, but we have more dry powder to do that. With that said, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing higher payment rates from the consumer business that offsets some of that potential upside. 
And I did describe the NIR in the way of a range, down $1 billion to $2 billion. And so that range gives you some sense for the ability or the opportunity if we were to capture more of that upside. 
In terms of the expenses, two things. One, you mentioned relative to revenues. And the answer is that if wallets continue to perform even stronger or the recovery is even more significant on the lending side or consumer side or ICG side for that matter, then that will come with higher expenses, transaction expenses, compensation expenses. But I think everyone would agree that, that would be good cholesterol. And so we'll see how that plays out. Obviously, I did mention episodic costs associated with the exits. What I'd say about that is -- and your point around allocations, both Jane and I have deep experience at this. I have experience from Citi Holdings and being part of that team and ultimately running Citi Holdings, Jane has run Latin America, both of those parts of the franchise historically have exited countries and we have both been keenly focused on ensuring that we get as much of the stranded costs associated with exits out of the organization in the past. And you can rest assure that, that would be the same type of focus we put to these exits. 
So that's kind of the view there. I don't have a ratio that I'd want to share at this point. But please know that, that will be a focal point for us in order to ensure that we get the most value out of this decision."

Yes, there are some things that you heard us referenced that we had started even before the order. There were a number of remediation efforts that were underway in some of the areas that are referenced in the order. We're leveraging the work that we had started already.

So as Mark said, as we know more, we'll update you on the process, but we've been very transparent about what we're intending to do. 
And then in terms of Mexico, look, Mexico is a scaled franchise. When I compare Mexico to our Asian consumer franchises, they really benefit from their scale. The returns are good.

And frankly, I look at it in terms of what we want to be, not what we don't, because what you don't want to be kind of falls out a bit pretty easily. So the main consideration we have is how do we close the return gap with our peers and make sure that the businesses we're in that can win. And we're very disciplined about going back to those principles I laid out at the very beginning and we talked about back in January, we've been using this consistently in the strategy refresh work. 
So the first thing we're looking at is, is this sector or is this client segment or is this business, does it have attractive dynamics as we look out over the medium and long term? And importantly, within those dynamics, can we win? Does this make -- can we be well positioned in this? And I think we're certainly seeing in the world of financial services today that scale is obviously a very important consideration. So the corollary of that is if you don't have scale, that's usually a disadvantage. 
We look at it in terms of connectivity. I think it's very, very important that we have synergies across our major platforms and our client segments. And you'll hear us talking about that a lot more going forward and what are some of the metrics that we look at to demonstrate that we're really capturing those synergies. 
We look at fees and returns. So therefore, if it's capital, is it generating returns? Are we getting the growth? [ We're efficient  ]on the fee revenues relative to what Mark and I would like to be. So that becomes a consideration. 
And then does it really fit with the strategic identity that we have for Citi and we're working on as part of the refresh? If it's yes, then this is a candidate for investment, laying out what the strategy is. If it's not, it's the opposite. 
And dispositions, we're always going to take into time -- into consideration timing. As I said in the last question, there's no fire sales here. We are going to be thoughtful on how we ensure we generate value for shareholders on the exit at the potential value of partnerships with the potential buyers, et cetera and how best can we monetize and generate value as we do this. 
So in many ways, it's a little bit of all of the above on your list, but we kind of -- we start in the opposite place, if you know what I mean. What are we going to be? And then focus on making sure that we generate the greatest value from that. And the other decisions kind of fall out of it pretty quickly. And I think you can see that being demonstrated in the decisions we made on both why wealth and the hubs that we're investing in, in Asia and EMEA, but then equally, the other decisions on the remaining 13 markets on consumer being the exit."

Just looking at the strategic actions that you guys had taken, if I think back to 2014, right, and what was outlined then, Jane, was actually pretty similar in terms of the profitability profile of the businesses that you are exiting, the capital benefits that were ultimately going to be reaped. And it was at least difficult to see some of those benefits if I look at how the profitability profile has changed. So I guess from your point of view, having been at the firm when that was undertaken, what lessons did you learn from that process? And are there any differences in the approach that you might take this go-around to potentially drive maybe more conspicuous or clear benefits to the bottom line?"

So I think, first of all, we were able to very much focus on our strengths in our institutional franchise. We were able to make sure that we had truly world-class talent. We invested in our technology and platforms. We were very focused on that client base of the multinationals we serve there, in particular, in the investor base, engaged in Latin America. And we drove the returns up from teenagers to mid-20s in a pretty short period of time. We rose up the rankings in the banking side and really solidified our leadership on the institutional front. 
I'd also say we simplified the management structure as well in the region and gained quite a lot of benefits from simplification that hit the bottom line as well. 
So I'd say my experience has been one in which there's real benefit from focus. You get better at the businesses that you're in. You get strong talent and you're able to bring more focused talent. That's what's different. And you get -- you're able to really get the linkages across the different businesses and hone in on them.

It feels like a lot of that's actually NII- or rate-related. But I was hoping to give some perspective on what are some of the underlying trends that you're seeing in that business? What's your outlook at least from here and now that most of the rate pressure at least should be fully absorbed or reflected in the run rate?"

But look, the revenues, you're right, were down about 10% year-over-year on an ex FX basis. And you hit it right on the head. I mean, the low rate environment that we've been in is a very big driver in what we've seen in the aggregate TTS revenues now. Now we have seen higher deposit volumes, and that obviously plays through with that impact. 
What I would say in terms of your broader question, what we look at is, one, the engagement that we have with clients. And we have very meaningful, significant engagement with clients throughout the entire crisis that we've been managing through. And that engagement kind of plays through. And the increase in number of accounts, digital accounts that we've opened for them, really kind of reinforcing some of the investments that we've been making in onboarding and enhancing -- and in enhancing our digital capability, that engagement plays through in the clearing activity and cross-border transactions that we've seen, which are both up 6% and 7% over the past 12 months. So good solid underlying drivers. While we do see pressure on commercial card activity, fee revenues ex commercial card activity has been good. And frankly, as we see the economy recover and we look at some of the GDP forecast and that starts to play out, we would expect to see the business activity turn in a way that starts to play through the top line. But we see again, very, very strong continued engagement with our clients and with how they're evolving their own strategies. 
And the last example I'd mention is many of our clients with the acceleration of digitization are focused on business-to-consumer activity. And that's an important area of growth. And we're part of that dialogue. We're part of creating that solution as it relates to their business model or business models. 
Jane, I don't know if anything you want to add to that."

And so the growth that we're going to see from this next year is, I think it's going to be very material. 
You'll hear us also talk more about the commercial bank going forward as well because the mid-market clients and the born digital clients are ones who use our TTS platform and their capabilities and services around it to also themselves start growing internationally and it becomes a core part of them. So this is -- this is we've got more to grow with our existing clients. We've got a lot of new clients that are coming on board this. And this is going to be an exciting part of the story going forward. And the underlying opportunities here separate to the rates environment."

And parts of the emerging markets are struggling. So you do see a different picture in different parts of the world. And as I think you heard from me at the beginning of the call, we're pretty optimistic about the U.S. in particular Over the next few years. There's a lot of unspent savings out there with consumers. Huge amount of liquidity in the market. Corporate balance sheets are broadly healthy. And then you've also got a lot of dynamism from digitization that's changing consumer behaviors and driving investment. 
So overall, it's certainly a very improved outlook around the world, but it is an asynchronous one. And we're seeing, as Mark had talked about, strong pipelines, a lot of client engagement, a lot of client activity.

One, we are seeing continued pressure on our consumer business, right? So we talked about loan volumes being down, particularly in branded cards, almost 15% or 15%. Retail services average loans, down 13%. What I would say is we are seeing signs of the recovery. And while those loans are down, payment rates remain high. That helps from a cost of credit point of view. And purchase sales are starting to show some good signs. So Branded Cards purchase sales were flat year-over-year. The Retail Services purchase sales were up 4% year-over-year. And the outlook is positive in terms of kind of GDP and unemployment. 
And so the stimulus that's out there still has to play out in North America. But we are optimistic that consumer spending trends look like they're going to go favorable. And that will undoubtedly help the forecast that I spoke to, which is recovery in NIR and some loan activity towards the back half of the year. 
On the corporate ICG side, similarly, we're certainly seeing good signs as it relates to the markets activity, we've talked about that, and that's continued since last year. But when I think about even ICG loans, we've seen loan activity in the private bank. We've seen loan activity in parts of markets. And so those are good. And loan activity as relates to trade, which is -- which are all good signs of the recovery that we're all marching towards."

So Latin America, on the chart on Slide 10, big jump in the -- in the quarter, almost 11% of NCLs. But again, that is a byproduct of customers coming off of the relief program in the third quarter. And as we look at the delinquency buckets, we're not seeing meaningful signs of increases in those buckets. And that gives us comfort in the case of Latin America that we've reached the peak there. 
Similarly for other regions, there are no signs in the delinquency bucket to suggest that we're going to see big increases in our NCLs. And in fact, in North America, what you heard me say is that we likely would not see that until late in 2022. And so it's the payment rates that we're seeing. It's the low activity as it relates to the delinquency buckets. It's obviously the impact of stimulus playing through all of that, that give us some comfort at this stage that we're not likely to see a pop in NCL certainly in 2021."

Our corporate clients have lots of liquidity by and large. And they have a -- many of the clients we serve have the option of how they want to access the market for that liquidity. And you saw that in some of the ECM, DCM activity through the balance of last year and even some of it continuing. 
So long-winded way of saying it is -- this is a client-driven business. This is about client demand. And so it's not a a question of risk appetite. Risk appetite is always important.

But as to who and what, I'm certainly not going to speculate yet. 
When you ask about operational linkages, I mean this is something, as Mark said, he and I have gone through quite a few divestitures in different geographies. And we are well skilled how to make sure that we can separate out the consumer franchises and then invest in the capabilities for the ICG businesses. It's not been a problem in any of the divestitures that we've done, which were many. It was about 11 or 12 across Latin America and others before. So our team is good at this. It's not going to be an issue. And in fact, it will enable us, as we said, to target our investments more into the institutional platforms and wealth in the hubs, as we talked about. 
And then in terms of Branded Cards, do Branded Cards go as part of the sale? Yes is the very simple answer to that one. 
Transaction services, of course, remains an important part of the franchises in these 13 geographies. And so our capabilities in commercial cards and our capabilities and payments, et cetera, for the GTS side of the business remain intact and will be invested in."

I don't think it takes us a long time to complete the strategy refresh work, and we'll be looking forward to sharing that with everybody as we go along, as we said. And we get on with execution as soon as it makes sense. 
So I don't honestly know, as a former consultant, as to whether you're ever done with strategy. This world is highly dynamic. It's a fascinating world. I think part of the excitement is I'm excited about the franchise. I'm excited about the prospects of the firm. I'm also realistic, we've got quite a bit of work to do. And we're very -- Mark and I are very clear on what our priorities are. 
So I don't think it's going to take us very long to come back to everybody with a clearer view of where we're going. I'm looking forward to doing so and, more than anything, looking forward to getting on with it. [ And I don't get your effort on. ]"

And that's a single geography with about 20% market share and a -- and is a full offering to the consumer as opposed to our franchises in Asia that were a bit of smaller. They're excellent franchises. As you know, they've got a good brand name. They've got -- they've got terrific card franchises and an affluent client base, but they haven't had the same scale that we have in Mexico. So I do view them as rather different. 
And in terms of what are there -- I guess the question you're asking is what's the ramification of the -- of the divestitures for this -- for our wealth business in Asia? If you look at the individual Asian markets, the domestic capital markets are not that well developed. And so the offshore markets in Hong Kong and Singapore, and indeed in the Middle East and in the states and in I know London and the like, become very important markets, for the onshore wealth opportunity is usually massively dwarfed by the offshore wealth opportunity. And that's where we feel we're best placed to focus our attention and resources. 
What I would also say, though, is one of the advantages for Citi is we're not just an investment sales proposition, that we also do have the deposit franchise, the card franchise, we have the capital market platform for sure. We've got the ability to offer our clients tremendous managed investments. The content that we're able to offer, thanks to our ICG franchise, that's really best-in-class. I know it's quite extraordinary in the asset allocation advice. This is really the capabilities we can provide. The client is very well diversified from lending, banking as well as the investment and the managed investment capital market revenues that you see. 
So I don't just think of this as investment sales. This is something that we're able to offer that's much more broad in those wealth center hubs. And the offshore is far greater than the onshore opportunity in those 13 markets. And we'll -- you'll get more guidance on this as we go forward, as Mark said, and as Jim fleshes out the strategy and the plan that we've got. So you can expect to get some more details."

I am delighted to join you for my first earnings call as the Citi's CEO. Mark and I have a lot to cover today, so let's get cracking.
Earlier today, we announced our earnings for the first quarter as well as the initial strategic actions we're taking in our Global Consumer Bank to focus on our competitive advantages and to improve our returns to our shareholders. I'll start with some observations, therefore, in the first quarter and then I'll update you on the ongoing work on our strategy.
It's been a much better-than-expected start of the year, and we are optimistic about the recovery ahead of us, and we're positioning the bank for a period of sustained growth. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $3.62 per share on net income of $7.9 billion. This was a record quarter in net income, driven by good performance in our Institutional business, and a release of $3.9 billion from our allowance for credit losses as a result of the improving economic outlook.
In the Institutional Clients Group, our Markets businesses benefited yet again from an active environment. We saw solid performance in fixed income after a very strong first quarter last year and a record quarter in Equities. We also had a record quarter in Investment Banking, reflecting high levels of activity in equity underwriting.
Treasury and Trade Solutions, which is the backbone of our global network, grew deposits even though revenues continued to be impacted by low interest rates. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down quarter-over-quarter as a result of the pandemic. However, we clearly see a recovery taking root in Asia as well as the U.S., and that was reflected in our ACL release. And I'd note, this is the healthiest we have seen the consumer emerge from a crisis in recent history, driven in large part by the U.S. government stimulus package.
Now while loan demand was down, we did see strong growth in wealth management and in digital engagement, both of which are central to the consumer franchise we are building. And our capital levels remained strong and stable, allowing us to respond to the needs of our clients and to return capital to our shareholders. At 11.7%, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was unchanged from the fourth quarter, and we resumed the repurchase of common stock which we voluntarily paused at the onset of the pandemic. Our tangible book value increased to $75.50, up 5% from a year ago.
Now turning to our strategy. When we spoke in January, I pointed to 4 principles which we're using to guide the refresh of our strategy. First, we said we will be clinical in assessing which businesses we can retain or secure leading market positions in. Next, we're going to be focused by directing resources to high-returning businesses and away from the others. Third, we're going to be connected so we ensure our businesses fit well together and that they generate synergies. And last, we're going to be simpler to better serve our clients, fulfill our obligations to our regulators and unlock value for our shareholders.
We also committed to take the strategic decisions needed to best position Citi to win and to close the gap in returns with our competitors. And we committed to share these decisions with you as we make them, and that's what we're doing again today.
Now I spoke in January about our new focus on wealth. We believe we're very well positioned to capture strong growth and attractive returns in this business, particularly in Asia and the U.S. Today, wealth at Citi represents roughly $6.5 billion in revenues, with 3/4 of $1 trillion of client assets. And there's many synergies with our markets, BCMA and commercial banking franchises, across our global network.
Yesterday, we announced the management team for Citi Global Wealth and the work, and investments are well underway on the business strategy and growth plans. And today, we announced our decision to focus our consumer banking franchise in Asia and EMEA solely on 4 wealth centers, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE and London. This positions us to capture the full spectrum of the wealth opportunity through these important hubs where we can serve onshore and offshore clients. And in Asia, this will allow us to continue operating our leading consumer businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, which are both scaled and very high-returning.
We will, therefore, pursue exits of our consumer businesses in the remaining 13 markets in Asia and EMEA. Now while these are excellent franchises, we don't have the scale we need to compete, and we've decided we simply aren't the best owners of them over the long term. So consistent with the principles we outlined for the strategy refresh, we believe our capital, our investment dollars and our other resources are better redeployed against higher returning opportunities elsewhere. What does this mean? This means that Global Consumer Banking will consist of 2 scale franchises in the U.S. and Mexico and these 4 hubs serving 100 million customers in total.
Let me be very clear on one very important point. Citi will continue to invest behind and serve our institutional clients in these 13 markets. We have a high-returning and leading institutional franchise in Asia, and it is an absolutely central part of our success going forward. And we see important opportunities to invest and gain share with our institutional clients region-wide.
Indeed, I saw from my own experience in Latin America how the institutional businesses in each market really benefited from the increased focus once we had exited our subscale consumer franchises and simplify the operating model in the region. I fully expect the same will be true in Asia. And in the meantime, the comprehensive work on our strategy refresh continues. We will continue to share the decisions we make with you as we work to close the gap in returns with our peers.
In parallel, we are, of course, hard at work on our transformation. We're making our next submission to the OCC this quarter. It's a massive body of work. We continue to work closely with our regulators to meet their expectations, and we expect to submit our complete plan to both regulators no later than the third quarter. We've identified the end state, performed the gap analysis and are currently working through the detailed resourcing and program plans and interdependencies and we've begun execution on several fronts. The investments required go hand-in-hand with our strategy work.
So for example, when we talk about simplification, we're pursuing it through changes to our operating model, but also by removing manual processes and controls and make no mistake about it. We want to achieve nothing less than a fundamental transformation by delivering excellence in our risk and control environment, in our operations and in our service to clients. So I am excited about the road ahead. And I have no doubt that these investments and others that we're going to make in talent and technology are going to help us modernize the bank and position Citi to win.
And finally, I want to update you on some of the commitments we're making in terms of ESG. Now we've prided ourselves in being a leader in many dimensions of ESG over the years. I see it as embedded in what we offer to our clients and the communities we serve around the world. And as you may know, on my first day as CEO in the beginning of March, I committed that Citi would reach net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and we will deliver our plan on how we will do so within the next 12 months.
Critical to helping our clients transition to a low-carbon economy is a support we provide them through our environmental finance activities. So to that end, we're going to extend our current environmental finance target from $250 billion by 2025 to $500 billion by 2030. And in addition, we finance other activities in support of the UN's sustainable development goals outside of environmental finance. And these include our important investments in affordable housing, in health care and workforce development. We are committing an additional $500 billion to these activities by 2030, making our total sustainable development goal commitment $1 trillion by 2030.
And with that, I am going to turn over to Mark, and then we will both be delighted to take your questions. Mark?"

Let me briefly review the results for the quarter, and then I'll go into more detail on the strategic refresh and specific actions we announced earlier today.
Overall, we had a stronger-than-expected start to the year, driven by a constructive capital markets backdrop as well as a benefit from the cost of credit for the quarter. For the quarter, Citigroup reported net income of $7.9 billion. Revenues declined 7% from the prior year, while we saw continued strength in Investment Banking and a solid markets performance, it was more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, along with lower card loans in consumer and the absence of the prior year mark-to-market gains on loan hedges.
Expenses were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued investments in our transformation, including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit performance remained strong, with net credit losses of $1.7 billion, more than offset by an ACL release of $3.9 billion driven primarily by an improvement in our macroeconomic outlook as well as lower loan balances. EPS was $3.62 and RoTCE was just over 20%.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 10% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 7%, reflecting consistent client engagement with both corporate and consumer clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity.
Before I go into more detail on each business, on Slide 4, I'd like to cover the strategic refresh that Jane discussed earlier. Last quarter, we spoke about the significant opportunity wealth represents for Citi going forward and announced the formation of Citi Global Wealth in order to better connect assets and capabilities across the consumer and institutional franchises and to transform the way we serve clients across the wealth spectrum. We've continued the build-out of Citi Global Wealth this quarter and have provided some details on the scope of the business on the slide, with additional information on key drivers in the appendix.
Citi Global Wealth represented roughly $6.6 billion in allocated annual revenues. And it delivered 15% growth in investment revenues last year, driven by higher client activity and growth in client investment assets. As we continue to integrate the component businesses into a single wealth platform, we will finalize how best to implement this strategy from an organizational standpoint over the coming quarters and update you accordingly.
Turning next to the actions we announced today. Given our strategic focus on global wealth management, we announced the decision to focus our Global Consumer Banking presence in Asia and EMEA on 4 wealth centers. As Jane mentioned, this strategic shift will allow us to simplify our operating model, while directing investments and resources to the businesses where we have competitive advantages and the scale necessary to drive higher returns over the long run.
Let me describe the 13 markets where we will pursue an exit, shown on the slide, with added details in the appendix. Last year, these businesses contributed roughly $4 billion of revenues. And while historically profitable, like other consumer businesses, the impact of CECL weighed on full year results given the pandemic, with cost of credit nearly doubling in these markets year-over-year. Total assets were $82 billion as of the end of 2020, and the businesses are supported by roughly $7 billion of allocated TCE.
We have a good track record of reducing expenses in similar situations. However, as noted on the slide, we are including fully allocated expenses to these markets, which could differ somewhat from the ultimate expense reductions. We will continue to manage these markets as part of the GCB franchise but we already have relevant actions well underway. We plan to share more information with you as we make progress against these and other actions as part of our ongoing strategy refresh.
Finally, I want to emphasize a point that Jane made earlier. We will continue to serve ICG clients, including our commercial banking clients, in all these markets. And more broadly, this strategic shift will allow us to focus more investments on ICG in Asia.
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients group. We delivered a solid performance in the quarter, driven by strong execution in the constructive operating environment. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $7.7 billion, up 65% from last year. Revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the absence of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges seen last year. Excluding this, revenues were up 5%, with 9% growth in banking and 2% growth in markets and security services. Expenses increased 8%, reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, along with other strategic investments, higher compensation cost and volume-driven growth.
Credit costs were down considerably, given a $1.9 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvements in the outlook for global GDP as well as modest improvements in portfolio credit quality. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.1%, including 3.6% on the non investment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $186 million, and ICG delivered a 25.7% return on allocated capital.
Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were up 5%, driven by record revenues in both equity underwriting and equity trading. Looking at these strong results across our overarching equities franchise, we feel good about the strategic investments we've been making which enabled us to leverage our full service model to better monetize the current market. On the banking side, revenues increased 9%.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 10% in constant dollars, as good client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues. Despite these headwinds, we continue to see strength in our underlying business drivers, including 14% growth in average deposits in constant dollars this quarter. And over the past year, we've seen significant increases in digital adoption and penetration as well as 7% growth in cross-border flows and 6% growth in clearing volumes.
Investment Banking experienced its best quarter ever with revenues up 46%, driven by equity underwriting given our leading position in the SPAC market. Private Bank revenues grew 8%, also its best quarter ever, driven by higher lending volumes and managed investments revenues. Corporate Lending revenues were also up 8%, reflecting the absence of prior year marks, partially offset by lower volumes. Total Markets & Securities Services revenues increased 2% from last year.
Fixed Income revenues decreased 5%, reflecting a strong performance in rates and currencies last year. However, spread products revenues were up from the prior year as clients search for yield in this low rate environment, with steady demand across flow and structured products. Equities revenues were up 26% versus last year, driven by cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions.
And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and roughly flat in constant dollars. Here, we saw good growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in deposits, assets under custody and settlement volumes, offset by lower spreads.
Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. While we are still seeing the impact of the pandemic and high payment rates on revenues, consumer spending continues to improve and credit remains healthy, pointing to a recovery as we move through the year.
For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.8 billion, up significantly from last year, primarily driven by improved credit costs. Revenues declined 15% as lower card balances and lower interest rates across all 3 regions were partially offset by continued strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management. Expenses decreased 1% as efficiency savings and lower volume-related costs were partially offset by investments. Credit costs decreased significantly driven by an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions and lower net credit losses. The release this quarter primarily reflected lower volumes as well as improvements in the macro outlook. And GCB delivered a 25% return on allocated capital.
Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues were down 15% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues. Branded cards revenues were down 11%, reflecting a 15% decline in average loans as clients are using the liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt.
Retail Services revenues were down 26%, reflecting higher partner payments as well as lower average loans. Net interest revenues were down 18% as average loans declined by 13% on higher payment rates. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower forecasted losses and, therefore, higher income sharing.
Looking more broadly on our cards businesses, we're continuing to see a recovery in sales activity. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were unchanged year-over-year, but essential spend was up 12%, and we are starting to see the recovery in areas like travel and dining. And in Retail Services, purchase sales grew 4%. So purchase sales are improving slightly faster than our prior expectations. And with the vaccine rollout, this should support a further recovery in discretionary spend.
The bigger impact on loans is from the high payment rates. This is creating revenue pressure, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. So the good news is that we're seeing the recovery in spend, which should continue, and our credit portfolio is proving to be quite resilient. We are now focused on loan and revenue recovery through driving spend activity, reentering the market for new account acquisitions, and investing in lending capabilities and new value propositions.
Turning to Retail Banking. Revenues were down 8% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 22%, including 30% growth in checking. And AUMs were up 32%.
We're also continuing to broaden our digital capabilities to extend from deposits to wealth management to mortgage lending. As Jane mentioned, we're committed to the franchise, and all of this gives us confidence in our ability to scale our U.S. retail bank with a digitally led, client-centric approach supported by light physical expansion in new markets over time.
On Slide 9, we show the results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 22% with a 14% increase in Citigold clients and 13% growth in net new money. And the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 global wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 13%, albeit at lower deposit spreads.
Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year, with purchase sales down 5% and average loans down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we are seeing some signs of a recovery, with the pickup in new card acquisitions and purchase sales year-over-year in the month of March.
Turning to Latin America. Total consumer revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits and assets under management in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 9% and AUMs up 17%. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment.
Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remained favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. And so peak losses may not occur until late 2022, depending on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit.
By contrast, in both Mexico and Asia, we saw a peak in credit losses in the first quarter of 2021. This was expected driven by the impact of customer accounts rolling off relief programs. The impact was pronounced in Mexico, with a peak NCL rate of over 10%, as we saw most customers roll off the relief programs at the end of the third quarter of last year. Excluding those accounts that participated in relief programs, our credit trends in both Mexico and Asia remain stable. And you can see improvement this quarter in delinquency rates.
Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were roughly flat in dollar terms as the impact of lower rates was offset by the absence of marks versus the prior year as well as some episodic gains this quarter. Expenses were down 1% as investments in infrastructure, risk and controls were roughly offset by the allocation of certain costs to the businesses. This change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level. And given it was immaterial, we have not reflected the change retrospectively. Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year.
Finally, the pretax loss was $231 million this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $500 million for the remainder of 2021, although with some variation quarter-to-quarter.
Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.2 billion this quarter declined $1.4 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances as well as the impact of 1 fewer day versus last year, partially offset by slightly higher trading-related NIR.
Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and, excluding the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter, was roughly flat to the fourth quarter. And net interest margin declined 5 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenues, partially offset by treasury actions and balance sheet optimization.
Turning to noninterest revenues. In the first quarter, non-NIR declined slightly to just over $9 billion, predominantly driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges offsetting strong Investment Banking revenues.
On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics, which, as Jane mentioned, remained strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 capital ratio remained 11.7% as net income was roughly offset by buybacks and dividends, along with the impact of OCI and an increase in risk-weighted assets.
During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $2.7 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1.6 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $75.50, driven by net income.
Before we move to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. First, our full year top line outlook has improved since last quarter. At that time, coming off the performance of 2020, we had expected industry wallets to return closer to the 2019 levels this year. Given the strong start to the year as well as the increasingly positive signs of a recovery ahead, we now believe wallets will be somewhat higher relative to 2019.
Meanwhile, our outlook for net interest revenues is unchanged, and we continue to expect a decline in net interest revenues of somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion, with stabilization continuing into the second quarter and an improvement in the back half. Taken together, this suggests revenues down in the mid single-digit range, better than our prior guidance for a mid- to high single-digit range decline.
Second, on the expense side, we continue to expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation agenda. In addition, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I mentioned earlier, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials.
Finally, on cost of credit, we continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to credit performance. And depending on the macroeconomic outlook, we could see further reserve releases, although given the size of the reserve release this quarter, we would not expect to see the same magnitude of ACL release going forward.
With that, Jane and I are happy to take any questions."

So it's fascinating at the moment. I have a chance to go and talk to the CEOs of banks who are our clients all around the world and all of us talk about the same thing, which is there's a major transformation that's going on, a digital transformation in the industry.
And so as we look at the consent order and the transformation, the transformation we're going through is much broader than just the consent orders, although they're obviously a very critical component of it. And so as we look at the -- as we look at the investments we're making, I look at the ones that we're making in our infrastructure, in our data as very much linked into a strategic need as well as what's being required and asked of us from the consent orders.
So I gave you one of the examples just earlier. But data would be an obvious example of this, where investment that we make in the quality of our data will have a big impact for our shareholders in terms of driving revenues, improving our client experience in making faster decision-making on risk or on business decisions as well as making sure that the data that we do have is properly governed from a safety and soundness perspective. So many of the investments we've got at the moment are really the strategy and transformation work coming together as it is for many banks."

And as we as we bring those plans together, I'll continue to share openly what our best estimates are for how the expenses continue to evolve.
What I would say, John, is that, and I say this a lot, I guess, these are investments. As Jane mentioned, there are benefits that we expect from them. The data was a great example as to how we leverage that with our clients but also how getting that quality data in and not having to rework it and reconcile it, et cetera, et cetera, saves us on the operating cost as well.

And after that, after kind of ensuring that we're capturing those opportunities that deliver returns, that are consistent with our objective of narrowing the gap to peers, then we want to, obviously, return excess capital to shareholders as we've been doing.
So that's the way we think about it. First, let's lead with what is the strategy. Second, let's make sure that strategy is rooted in growth opportunities and commensurate returns that make sense for us. Let's allocate capital there to take advantage of that.

When I look at it, we've got a phenomenal brand name, an aspirational one, in the wealth space, particularly in Asia, but around the world. We have our commercial bank which operates in 30 different geographies around the world and is where a lot of the wealth is being created. So we have relationships and are helping with the actual wealth generation and source of wealth from many of our clients as well as obviously in ICG. We've got a top-tier institutional platform and capability. And we've got our presence very well established in these major wealth hubs around the world.
So I do feel we're incredibly well positioned when we can bring these different assets and capabilities into a single platform. So the investments that we've already begun making is putting a single wealth platform organization in place. We made the announcement yesterday around the leadership, you'd have seen that. We've started investing in growing our relationship managers and FAs around the world and really bringing together the best of the firm.

And I think the broader theme of digitization, we have very high-quality clients in and out of footprint. And they've been very digitally engaged, and that's only increased. 50% of the new accounts this quarter in the retail bank were acquired digitally and about 75% of our clients, for example, are digitally engaged already.

Is this probably partially -- how you laid out guidance probably partially answers this question. But investors seem to believe that there could be upside to revenue for banks, whether it's continued expansion of wallet in your ICG business or in more traditional NIR sources.
And I'm wondering -- it's a 2-part question. One, if we get a better revenue from here, could you still achieve the 2% to 3% expense target? And as a follow-up, on the expenses that would be carved out from those exits, we heard from one of your peers that if you exclude overhead or expenses allocated to businesses exited, we would see a sort of a net expense saves of about 75% to 80% of identified expenses. And I'm wondering if that's the right ratio to think about those 13 markets that you're exiting."

So the first thing, just in terms of revenue, I did speak to this in the guidance. And what I referenced was, I talked about in the last quarter, the normalization of the markets' wallets and what we're seeing just at the on start of this year and the strong start that Jane referenced is that while I do expect there'll be some normalization, I would expect at this point that the market wallets will be above the 2019 levels. And so we do think that, that presents some upside. I talked about the -- and that's what kind of feeds in part the down mid-single-digit guidance that I gave for total revenues.
You're right with the steepening of the curve. That does present some opportunities. We've got dry powder to put liquidity to work. And we've done some of that, but we have more dry powder to do that. With that said, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing higher payment rates from the consumer business that offsets some of that potential upside. And I did describe the NIR in the way of a range, down $1 billion to $2 billion. And so that range gives you some sense for the ability or the opportunity if we were to capture more of that upside.
In terms of the expenses, two things. One, you mentioned relative to revenues. And the answer is that if wallets continue to perform even stronger or the recovery is even more significant on the lending side or consumer side or ICG side for that matter, then that will come with higher expenses, transaction expenses, compensation expenses. But I think everyone would agree that, that would be good cholesterol. And so we'll see how that plays out.
Obviously, I did mention episodic costs associated with the exits. What I'd say about that is -- and your point around allocations, both Jane and I have deep experience at this. I have experience from Citi Holdings and being part of that team and ultimately running Citi Holdings. Jane has run Latin America. Both of those parts of the franchise historically have exited countries, and we have both been keenly focused on ensuring that we get as much of the stranded costs associated with exits out of the organization in the past. And you can rest assure that, that would be the same type of focus we put to these exits.
So that's kind of the view there. I don't have a ratio that I'd want to share at this point. But please know that, that will be a focal point for us in order to ensure that we get the most value out of this decision."

We'll look to complete the exits in a timely fashion and we expect to be out in some markets this quarter.
Equally, this is -- we're going to be thoughtful about who the buyers are and the -- how we do this and the value that we create for shareholders in the process. So while there is urgency on action, we're going to make sure that this is a good move for our shareholders and act appropriately. And the timing is going to be driven by regulatory approvals in different geographies. So as Mark said, as we know more, we'll update you on the process, but we've been very transparent about what we're intending to do.
And then in terms of Mexico, look, Mexico is a scaled franchise. When I compare Mexico to our Asian consumer franchises, they really benefit from their scale. The returns are good. And there's a lot of upside potential there. The investments in digitization have really paid off. So while the country is going through a very challenging time at the moment, there's a lot to like in the franchise over the longer term. And we'll give you a better sense of the strategy there as we carry on the strategy refresh work. But a lot to like.

And frankly, I look at it in terms of what we want to be, not what we don't, because what you don't want to be kind of falls out a bit pretty easily. So the main consideration we have is how do we close the return gap with our peers and make sure that the businesses we're in that can win. And we're very disciplined about going back to those principles I laid out at the very beginning and we talked about back in January, we've been using this consistently in the strategy refresh work.
So the first thing we're looking at is, is this sector or is this client segment or is this business? Does it have attractive dynamics as we look out over the medium and long term? And importantly, within those dynamics, can we win? Does this make -- can we be well positioned in this? And I think we're certainly seeing in the world of financial services today that scale is obviously a very important consideration. So the corollary of that is if you don't have scale, that's usually a disadvantage.
We look at it in terms of connectivity. I think it's very, very important that we have synergies across our major platforms and our client segments. And you'll hear us talking about that a lot more going forward and what are some of the metrics that we'll look at to demonstrate that we're really capturing those synergies.
We look at fees and returns. So therefore, if it's capital, is it generating returns? Are we getting the growth? We're efficient on the fee revenues relative to what Mark and I would like to be. So that becomes a consideration.
And then does it really fit with the strategic identity that we have for Citi and we're working on as part of the refresh? If it's yes, then this is a candidate for investment, laying out what the strategy is. If it's not, it's the opposite.
And dispositions, we're always going to take into time -- into consideration timing. As I said in the last question, there's no fire sales here. We are going to be thoughtful on how we ensure we generate value for shareholders on the exit at the potential value of partnerships with the potential buyers, et cetera and how best can we monetize and generate value as we do this.
So in many ways, it's a little bit of all of the above on your list, but we kind of -- we start in the opposite place, if you know what I mean. What are we going to be, and then focus on making sure that we generate the greatest value from that. And the other decisions kind of fall out of it pretty quickly. And I think you can see that being demonstrated in the decisions we made on both why wealth and the hubs that we're investing in, in Asia and EMEA, but then equally, the other decisions on the remaining 13 markets on consumer being the exit."

And we drove the returns up from teenagers to mid-20s in a pretty short period of time. We rose up the rankings in the banking side and really solidified our leadership on the institutional front.
I'd also say we simplified the management structure as well in the region and gained quite a lot of benefits from simplification that hit the bottom line as well. So I'd say my experience has been one in which there's real benefit from focus. You get better at the businesses that you're in. You get strong talent and you're able to bring more focused talent.

But look, the revenues, you're right, were down about 10% year-over-year on an ex FX basis. And you hit it right on the head. I mean, the low rate environment that we've been in is a very big driver in what we've seen in the aggregate TTS revenues now. Now we have seen higher deposit volumes, and that obviously plays through with that impact.
What I would say in terms of your broader question, what we look at is, one, the engagement that we have with clients. And we have very meaningful, significant engagement with clients throughout the entire crisis that we've been managing through. And that engagement kind of plays through. And the increase in number of accounts, digital accounts that we've opened for them, really kind of reinforcing some of the investments that we've been making in onboarding and enhancing -- and in enhancing our digital capability, that engagement plays through in the clearing activity and cross-border transactions that we've seen, which are both up 6% and 7% over the past 12 months. So good solid underlying drivers.
While we do see pressure on commercial card activity, fee revenues ex commercial card activity has been good. And frankly, as we see the economy recover and we look at some of the GDP forecast and that starts to play out, we would expect to see the business activity turn in a way that starts to play through the top line. But we see again, very, very strong continued engagement with our clients and with how they're evolving their own strategies.
And the last example I'd mention is many of our clients with the acceleration of digitization are focused on business-to-consumer activity. And that's an important area of growth. And we're part of that dialogue. We're part of creating that solution as it relates to their business model or business models. Jane, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that."

You'll hear us also talk more about the commercial bank going forward as well because the mid-market clients and the born digital clients are ones who use our TTS platform and their capabilities and services around it to also themselves start growing internationally and it becomes a core part of them. So this is -- we've got more to grow with our existing clients. We've got a lot of new clients that are coming on board this.

So we talked about loan volumes being down, particularly in Branded Cards, almost 15% or 15%. Retail Services average loans, down 13%. What I would say is we are seeing signs of the recovery. And while those loans are down, payment rates remain high. That helps from a cost of credit point of view. And purchase sales are starting to show some good signs. So Branded Cards purchase sales were flat year-over-year. The Retail Services purchase sales were up 4% year-over-year. And the outlook is positive in terms of kind of GDP and unemployment.
And so the stimulus that's out there still has to play out in North America. But we are optimistic that consumer spending trends look like they're going to go favorable. And that will undoubtedly help the forecast that I spoke to, which is recovery in NIR and some loan activity towards the back half of the year.
On the corporate ICG side, similarly, we're certainly seeing good signs as it relates to the markets activity, we've talked about that, and that's continued since last year. But when I think about even ICG loans, we've seen loan activity in the private bank. We've seen loan activity in parts of markets. And so those are good.

Similarly for other regions, there are no signs in the delinquency bucket to suggest that we're going to see big increases in our NCLs. And in fact, in North America, what you heard me say is that we likely would not see that until late in 2022. And so it's the payment rates that we're seeing.

I mean, look, as you know, we're managing through this crisis. But if you look back to early last year and the second quarter last year, this was about ensuring that clients had an appropriate level of liquidity. And that has continued to happen, as you see in our deposit growth, as you've heard others mention, as you've seen monetary action there.
Our corporate clients have lots of liquidity by and large. And they have a -- many of the clients we serve have the option of how they want to access the market for that liquidity. And you saw that in some of the ECM, DCM activity through the balance of last year and even some of it continuing.
So long-winded way of saying it is -- this is a client-driven business. This is about client demand. And so it's not a question of risk appetite. Risk appetite is always important. We operate inside of our risk appetite framework always. But the dynamic that you're seeing here is about client demand."

These are fabulous franchises, and we've got really tremendous talent, tremendous capabilities there in the individual markets. And so we expect to get a lot of interest. But as to who and what, I'm certainly not going to speculate yet.
When you ask about operational linkages, I mean this is something, as Mark said, he and I have gone through quite a few divestitures in different geographies. And we are well skilled at how to make sure that we can separate out the consumer franchises and then invest in the capabilities for the ICG businesses. It's not been a problem in any of the divestitures that we've done, which were many. I think it was about 11 or 12 across Latin America and others before. So our team is good at this. It's not going to be an issue. And in fact, it will enable us, as we said, to target our investments more into the institutional platforms and wealth in the hubs, as we talked about.
And then in terms of Branded Cards, do Branded Cards go as part of the sale? Yes is the very simple answer to that one. Transaction services, of course, remains an important part of the franchises in these 13 geographies. And so our capabilities in commercial cards and our capabilities and payments, et cetera, for the GTS side of the business remain intact and will be invested in."

Can you share with us -- I think if I recall back on day 1, January '20, when the new CECL rules came into place, your loan loss reserve to loans was about 2.6%. And I think today, it's about 3.3%. Can you give us some color of directionally do you think you could get there? I know there's a lot of moving parts in change of mix of loans and different economic outlooks.

And that's a single geography with about 20% market share and a full -- and is a full offering to the consumer as opposed to our franchises in Asia that were a bit of smaller. They're excellent franchises. As you know, they've got a good brand name. They've got terrific card franchises and an affluent client base, but they haven't had the same scale that we have in Mexico. So I do view them as rather different.
And in terms of what are there -- I guess the question you're asking is what's the ramification of the divestitures for this -- for our wealth business in Asia. If you look at the individual Asian markets, the domestic capital markets are not that well developed. And so the offshore markets in Hong Kong and Singapore, and indeed in the Middle East and in the states and in London and the like, become very important markets. So the onshore wealth opportunity is usually massively dwarfed by the offshore wealth opportunity. And that's where we feel we're best placed to focus our attention and resources.
What I would also say, though, is one of the advantages for Citi is we're not just an investment sales proposition, that we also do have the deposit franchise, the card franchise. We have the capital market platform for sure. We've got the ability to offer our clients tremendous managed investments. The content that we're able to offer, thanks to our ICG franchise, that's really best-in-class. I know it's quite extraordinary in the asset allocation advice. So this is really the capabilities we can provide. The client is very well diversified from lending, banking as well as the investment and the managed investment capital market revenues that you see.
So I don't just think of this as investment sales. This is something that we're able to offer that's much more broad in those wealth center hubs. And the offshore is far greater than the onshore opportunity in those 13 markets. And we'll get -- you'll get more guidance on this as we go forward, as Mark said, and as Jim fleshes out the strategy and the plan that we've got. So you can expect to get some more details."

I'm delighted to join you again today. And first, I'm again to discuss the results of my first full quarter as CEO and then update you on the progress against our strategic priorities. For the quarter, we",1217,"Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everyone. I'm delighted to join you again today. 
And first, I'm again to discuss the results of my first full quarter as CEO and then update you on the progress against our strategic priorities. 
For the quarter, we reported $6.2 billion in net income or $2.85 per share. We continue to benefit from an improving macro environment as evidenced by another significant release of our allowances for credit losses. Indeed, the pace of the macro recovery is exceeding earlier expectations across the globe and with it comes growing consumer and corporate confidence. And this also came through loud and clear in my conversations with clients over the course of the week I just spent in London. 
Now clearly, we have to remain mindful of the unevenness in that global recovery due to continued contagion and challenges in vaccine distribution in several parts of the world. But we are optimistic about the momentum ahead. And as a result, we deliberately accelerated some of our investments. 
In our institutional businesses, we saw the expected normalization of fixed income trading compared to the striking volatility of Q2 last year, and our equities franchise had a particularly strong quarter. Looking forward, we do expect the volatile wallet in markets to be higher than pre-COVID levels. 
Performance in our Investment Banking franchise remained healthy, with good momentum in M&A and a very solid pipeline ahead for the rest of the year. We saw very good progress in our strategies to increase fee revenues, with double-digit growth in our ICG fee revenues, and specifically, over 20% year-over-year fee growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions, in Security Services and in the Private Bank. 
Now TTS is the backbone of the unique global network we deliver for our clients. And while the business continues to be impacted by lower rates, we particularly like how we are positioned here from a market share perspective as the post-pandemic recovery takes shape. 
In Consumer Banking, while our loan book and revenues were impacted by the elevated payment rates in cards, spending is well above pre-COVID levels now, with a 38% increase in global purchase sales year-over-year. We expect this to translate into loan growth in the second half of the year. And we continue to have good momentum in both deposit growth and AUMs across our Consumer franchises. 
In the U.S., as we've discussed, we're investing in our home market, as demonstrated by the well-received launch of our innovative custom Cash Card in June. Internationally, the picture for our Consumer businesses diverges. So while there is still the softness in the Mexican economy, in Asia, loan growth returned, and that's despite new COVID outbreaks. 
Turning to capital. For the first 2 quarters of 2021, we returned close to $7 billion to our shareholders, which was the maximum amount permitted under the Federal Reserve's rules. Going forward, we are committed to returning any excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise. 
So while our stress capital buffer increased to 3% as a result of the Fed's recent stress test, that won't impact the common equity Tier 1 target we'd be managing to of approximately 11.5%. We ended the quarter at 11.9% on a standardized basis and have excess capital to return to our shareholders through a healthy dividend and ongoing stock repurchase program. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $77.87, up over 9% from a year ago. 
Now let's turn to 3 of our strategic priorities: strategy, transformation and talent. 
I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy refresh. We have moved swiftly to begin the sales process for the 13 consumer markets we plan to exit in Asia and EMEA. The first round of bids was very encouraging and competitive, which isn't a surprise because these are terrific businesses for the right owners. In those regions, we're off to a running start in our wealth strategy. We're making significant strategic investments in product capabilities, technology and talent, and have already seen this in increased client acquisition. We continue to do thorough and rigorous work to refresh our strategy across our consumer and institutional businesses, guided by the 4 principles I outlined to you earlier in the year: being clinical; being focused; and ensuring both connectivity and simplification. 
Our overarching goal is to increase the returns we generate and close the gap with our peers by investing in the franchises that will drive the most growth. The 3 most notable of which are TTS, Wealth and Commercial Banking. And I'm very confident in the growth and return prospects these connected franchises will afford us. 
As we have done so far, we will share our decisions with you as we make them on the strategy. And we're also looking forward to presenting our plans to you more comprehensively during an Investor Day, which we intend to hold in the first quarter of next year. We're going to put our entire vision for the firm in front of you so you can then hold us accountable for executing against it. 
As we discussed in the call last quarter, we're also working very hard and diligently on our transformation. This is a significant, it's also an exciting body of work. And we're working closely with our regulators to meet their expectations, and we intend to submit our plans to them this quarter. 
Now while addressing the consent orders is an intense focus of the transformation, our work here goes well beyond the orders themselves. We've set out to modernize our bank. We want to achieve nothing less than excellence. And this means investing in our risk and control environment, but also in the infrastructure we need to serve our clients in an increasingly digital world. 
So let me give you an example in TTS. These investments will improve the scalability of our platform. Automation will drive efficiency and client experience, and investments in data will enhance revenues. And the investments we're making will help position us to retain our leading position as the preeminent global corporate bank. 
And that leads me finally to talent, where we have made material progress over the last few months. I'm delighted with the caliber of talent we have been attracting to the firm to grow our businesses and support our transformation. We've enhanced our existing ranks with best-in-market hires in data, risk, strategy and controls, as well as in the front lines of Wealth, the Commercial Bank and BCMA in particular. We continue to invest in a culture of excellence and our own people, providing them with new leadership and growth opportunities. And it's this combination of new perspectives and our existing high-caliber talent pool that will enable us to take the firm forward with excellence, urgency and accountability. 
Now before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to thank Liz -- Lynn for her great work leading our Investor Relation efforts over the past several years. And as you know, and as she mentioned, she is going to be our finance lead for BCMA, where we all know that she is going to do a wonderful job. 
With that, Mark will go through our presentation, and then we'll both be happy to take your questions."

Starting on Slide 3. 
Citigroup reported second quarter net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $2.85 and a 15.2% ROTCE. Revenues declined 12% from the prior year, reflecting a normalization in fixed income market along with lower card loans in consumer as well as the impact of lower interest rates. 
Expenses were up 7% year-over-year. In constant dollars, expenses were up 4%, reflecting a normalization relative to the low print last year, along with continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by productivity savings. 
Credit performance remained strong, with net credit losses of $1.3 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $2.4 billion, reflecting portfolio improvements as well as the continued improvement in our macroeconomic outlook. 
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher repayment rates across institutional and consumer, although I would note that we are starting to see some pockets of loan growth emerge. And for the first time in over a year, loans were up sequentially. 
Deposits grew modestly, up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients. 
Looking at the first half of 2021. Total revenues declined 9% year-over-year and 10% in constant dollars, mainly driven by the normalization in fixed income markets and lower card balances in consumer, although we did see strong fee revenue growth across consumer and in ICG, excluding fixed income markets. Total expenses were up 6% on a reported basis and 3% in constant dollars midway through the year. 
I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of the year in a moment. 
Cost of credit was a benefit of roughly $3 billion, as we released over $6 billion in reserves. And we delivered roughly $14 billion in net income and an ROTCE of 17.6%. 
Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $7 billion in capital so far this year. And we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise as well as returning any excess capital to shareholders given the flexibility provided by the SCB framework. 
Turning now to each business. 
Slide 4 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $4.9 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues decreased 14%, driven mainly by the decline in fixed income markets. Expenses increased 4% and were up 2% in constant dollars, as investments in transformation along with other strategic investments were mostly offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings. Credit costs were down considerably given a roughly $900 million ACL release as well as lower net credit losses. And ICG delivered a 16.4% return on allocated capital. 
Slide 5 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. 
Product revenues were down 17% in the second quarter, primarily reflecting a comparison to a strong prior year period, particularly in fixed income markets. However, we are continuing to see robust client engagement and strong underlying growth in our fee businesses across the franchise, including TTS, Investment Banking, Security Services, Commercial Banking and the Private Bank. And excluding the markets-related component, noninterest revenues were up 24% this quarter. And we are confident in our outlook for continued strong fee growth in the back half of the year. 
Looking at the results in greater detail. On the banking side, revenues decreased 1%. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, significant growth in fee revenues of roughly 25%, reflecting solid client engagement as well as growth in trade, were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, with revenues down 1%. We're continuing to see momentum across our payments business with 13% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearing volumes over the past year as well as the early days of a recovery in commercial cards. And as of the end of the quarter, TTS loans grew roughly 5%, reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions. 
Investment Banking revenues were up 1% as higher M&A and equity underwriting revenues were largely offset by a decline in debt underwriting. While the overall DCM while it was up in the second quarter, all the growth was in non-investment grade, which did not benefit our results given our skew to investment grade. But looking at results versus a more normal year, revenues were up 38% versus the second quarter of 2019, with strong growth across all products. 
Private Bank revenues grew 4%, driven by higher fees and lending volumes, reflecting momentum with both new and existing clients, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Corporate lending revenues were down 15%, primarily driven by lower volumes. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues decreased 30% from last year. Fixed income revenues decreased 43%, reflecting a comparison to a strong prior year period in both rates and spread products. However, we remained engaged with our clients, with steady growth in both corporate and investor client revenues relative to the historical average. Equities revenues were up 37% versus last year, primarily driven by good performance in both derivatives and prime finance, reflecting robust client activity and favorable market conditions. In Security Services, revenues were up 9% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Here, we saw a strong growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients, driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes, partially offset by lower spreads. Finally, looking at first half results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from investment banking as well as good results in the Private Bank and Security Services, which helped to offset the expected normalization in fixed income markets. I would also note that equity markets revenues are up over 30%. 
Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 6. 
For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.4 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues declined 10%, as continued strong deposit growth, albeit with lower spreads, and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances across all 3 regions. 
In cards, while we are encouraged by the continued improvement in consumer spending, with purchase sales up close to 40% versus last year and almost 20% on versus last quarter, we are still seeing the impact of high payment rates on revenues. 
Expenses increased 7%, reflecting continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, along with an acceleration in marketing and higher volume-related costs from the low point a year ago, partially offset by efficiency savings. 
Credit remains healthy. And credit costs decreased significantly, driven by the $1.4 billion ACL reserve release and lower net credit losses. And GCB delivered a 20.8% return on allocated capital. 
Finally, looking at results for the first half of the year. We've seen steady improvement in our drivers, which gives us confidence in our outlook as we move into the back half of the year. 
Slide 7 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. 
Second quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues, but better than the 15% decline last quarter on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined in both branded cards and retail services by 12% and 14%, respectively, reflecting continued headwinds from higher payment rates, as consumers have continued to use liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt, driving lower loans and a shift in mix towards transactor balances. This is creating pressure on our net interest revenues, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. 
However, we are continuing to see a recovery in sales activity. Repurchased sales now above pre-pandemic levels, led by discretionary spend, including travel and dining. In branded cards, total purchase sales were up 40% versus last year, and importantly, up 11% versus the second quarter of 2019. And in Retail Services, purchase sales also grew versus both second quarter 2019 and 2020. 
So the good news is that we're continuing to see the recovery in spend and we're also returning to pre-COVID acquisition levels. Looking ahead, we expect the growth in purchase sales to translate into loan growth by the end of the year as stimulus moderates, and consumers return to more normal payment patterns. 
Turning to Retail Banking. Revenues were down 7% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen our retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 18%, including 24% growth in checking. And the number of Citigold households increased by 16%, contributing to a 23% increase in AUMs. 
On Slide 8, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. 
Revenues declined 6% year-over-year in the second quarter, with an 11% decline in Latin America and a 3% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we are seeing good momentum in Investment Management, with 15% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia. And the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 international wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 8%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. And similar to the U.S., we saw a 26% increase in purchase sales year-over-year, but cards loan growth remained a challenge this quarter, with average card loans down 8% due to elevated payment rates. 
Slide 9 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. 
In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remain favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. And the ultimate timing and level of losses as we look into next year will depend on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. And as expected, credit losses and delinquency rates trended downward in both Mexico and Asia, following a peak in the first quarter of 2021. 
So overall, we're seeing a rebound in activity, along with a consumer who is in a very healthy financial position, suggesting good momentum as we move into the back half of the year. 
Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other. 
Revenues were down slightly in dollar terms, as episodic gains this quarter were more than offset by previously disclosed onetime items in the prior year. Expenses were up slightly in dollar terms, mainly reflecting the impact of FX. And similar to last quarter, we have further allocated cost to the businesses related to investments in infrastructure, risk and controls. As we mentioned previously, this change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level. However, we have recast prior periods to enable better comparability of results. Credit costs declined year-over-year, driven by our release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, EBIT was breakeven this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $200 million to $300 million for the remainder of 2021. 
Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as noninterest revenues on a reported basis. We've also provided net interest revenues in constant dollars on Slide 19 in the appendix for comparison to prior periods. 
In the second quarter, net interest revenue of $10.2 billion declined $880 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize as the extra day in the quarter was offset by lower cards revenues. And net interest margin declined 3 basis points, driven by lower Cards NIR and modest growth in the balance sheet due to deposits, partially offset by the increase in Markets NIR in the quarter. 
Turning to noninterest revenues on the bottom of the slide. 
In the second quarter, non-NIR declined $1.4 billion, driven by normalization in fixed income markets. However, outside of Markets, we did see strong broad-based fee growth of over $600 million across GCB and ICG. And for the past 2 quarters, we've seen these fee revenues return to pre-pandemic levels of roughly $4.4 billion per quarter, pointing to a somewhat faster-than-expected recovery. 
Looking at these results midway through the year, we are comfortable with our prior outlook and continue to expect total Citi revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a full year basis, although the composition is likely to be somewhat different, which I will talk more about in a moment. 
On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics, which remain strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. 
Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.9%, as net income was mostly offset by buybacks and dividends. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9%, a decline from the prior quarter, largely driven by the expiration of the temporary SLR relief. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $77.87, driven by net income. 
Before we move on to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. 
On the top line, for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis. But as I mentioned, the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated. Year-to-date, we've seen stronger-than-expected growth in noninterest revenues. And we do expect the strength in fee growth to continue in the back half of the year, driven primarily by ICG. Meanwhile, for net interest revenues, we expect continued stabilization in the back half, and we should start to see some loan growth by the end of the year. So while net interest revenues are down roughly $2.2 billion year-to-date, just outside our original outlook for the full year, assuming this base case holds, we do not expect a significant further decline in net interest revenues from here on a full year basis. So again, in aggregate, for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits. 
On the expense side, based on our latest work on the strategic refresh, we've made the decision to further accelerate certain strategic investments, in part in reaction to what is shaping up to be a faster-than-expected recovery. As a result, we now expect total Citigroup expenses to be up mid-single digits. 
These are strategic investments that we are making to strengthen our franchise and drive long-term growth. For example, we've accelerated investments where we believe there are significant opportunities for growth, including holistically across Wealth and the Commercial Bank. We've also doubled down on our existing strengths in businesses like TTS, Security Services and the Investment Banking business. Finally, given the faster recovery we are seeing today, we are accelerating investments in areas like cards marketing to capture this upside. All of these investments will have significant benefits over time. 
Meanwhile, expenses related directly to the transformation, which we had expected to drive the 2% to 3% increase in total Citi expenses this year, are coming in largely as expected. These investments include the work around the consent order as well as the broader work to modernize the bank, which will improve our risk and control environment as well as allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and clients through an improved operating environment, leading to faster decision-making, better efficiency and improved client experience. And I'd point out that the mix of this spend is 30% technology and 70% non-tech-related investments. 
Finally, this outlook includes the realization of productivity savings as a byproduct of the investments we've been making over the past few years. And to be clear, we will continue, as we have done in the past, to look for ways to operate as efficiently as possible during this investment period. 
And one additional note. We could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I've mentioned previously, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. 
So in summary, we feel good about the investments that we are making and firmly believe these investments will position us well to close our return gap to peers over time. 
Before we get started with questions, I also want to take a moment to thank Liz Lynn for her time as the Head of Citi Investor Relations. Liz has been with the Citi IR team since 2013 and has led the group since 2019. I know that she has built strong relationships with all of you and has been a key part of my team since I was named CFO a little over 2 years ago. She will be moving on to be the Chief Financial Officer for our Investment Banking business. And as Liz mentioned, Jen Landis will be joining us in August as our new Head of Investor Relations. I hope you will all join me in congratulating Liz on her new role and welcoming Jen to Citi at our next earnings call. 
With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

Just wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit more. You're not the only bank that's been kind of raising expense guidance. So I was wondering how much of this might be inflationary to the cost of doing business as a big bank here? How much is Citi specific? And does the run rate that you're expecting to be at on expenses in the back half of this year feel like that's the run rate you'd go into next year with? Or are there things that are elevated this year?"

Look, I'll start by saying and repeating a little bit of what I said in my remarks, which is that we are taking a very deliberate decision on how we manage the franchise, right? And so what I spoke to was, Jane and I, along with the leadership team are going through a very thoughtful strategy refresh. And as we go through that, we are identifying, particularly given the pace of the recovery, some real strategic opportunities to invest in the franchise. And we don't want to -- we're not going to miss this window of opportunity. You've heard me mention that before. And it's in parts of the franchise that will undoubtedly grow and are high returning. So when we talk about TTS, we talk about the Commercial Banking business, we talk about Wealth, those are businesses that have strong growth prospects and have returns that are north of 20% in a normal environment. And so like I said, we're jumping at that. 
On the transformation side, I've been very clear and consistent that we expected that to drive the 3% -- 2% to 3% increase year-over-year. That's coming in largely as expected, and again, the right thing to do, an important thing to do to modernize this bank. Inflation, of course, is going to be a factor, particularly as we look at labor and the competition for talent. But again, that's -- we deal with that on a regular basis. And we continue to look for productivity and efficiency savings that largely tend to offset that. 
In terms of 2022, I'm not going to give any guidance on that. But again, this is, I think, an important period of time as we come out of this to ensure we're putting money to work in a smart fashion that prepares the firm for the future."

The good news is that plays through in the form of a benefit as it relates to cost of credit, lower losses than expected, and now lower reserves as we see releases.

As it relates to the SCB and the recent results, as you know, we have a target of approximately 11.5% from a CET1 ratio point of view. The target includes an estimate for the stress capital buffer. That's somewhere between 2.5% and 3%. Up until this recent set of results, the prior couple had been at the 2.5%. The 3% will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. And more importantly, we will actively manage the drivers that impact that stress capital buffer. That is to say, PPNR as well as the balance sheet, risk-weighted assets. And we intend to do so with an eye towards how we bring that stress capital buffer back down. 
As we think about capital actions, as you know, with the SCB in place, we have the flexibility to take those decisions in a given quarter in line with our -- with the reg minimums, and we intend to do that. Given where the stock trades, it makes a lot of sense for us to be buying back shares. And so we'll continue to skew towards that. And as of right now, our dividend is going to remain at the 51%.

And as you point out, Betsy, TTS, for example, has -- we're moving $4 trillion of volume a day in -- around the world. And we've got a number of franchises that have material scale, and we only expect them to be growing. And this is where the transformation program will be very helpful in ensuring the scalability of our platforms. 
We made the decision on Asia Pac and EMEA to exit the 13 markets where we didn't believe that we would be able to achieve the scale needed to compete in those very local part of the business. So that we can focus our firepower in those areas where we're either ensuring we retain a leading market position or in other areas where we want to be investing to attain the scale that we think is going to be needed going forward. U.S. consumer is an obvious example of that. 
So I think as we -- you'll hear from us going forward, more and more focused around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this, aided by the transformation program, or in the areas where we'll be investing attain greater scale. And as I say, U.S. consumer is the obvious one. There are pockets in Commercial Bank we're excited by. Security Services, one where we think it is very, very readily attainable, particularly given our pre and post trade capabilities. And part of that scale finally, it will come from the linkages between our businesses. As we create more connectivity, that will also provide us scale. So collectively, the different franchises we have will be competitively advantaged and not just individually strong."

What to do with that excess liquidity? Should they be buying or what? And so we're part of that dialogue, which is incredibly representative, I think.

The general view from our clients is optimistic in terms of the go-forward environment. Yes, there are some things to kind of manage to, but there's a general level of optimism.

Mike, excellent question. The partnership with Big Tech is an important part of our disruptor strategy in the U.S. as we're looking at both how do we enhance value propositions to customers, the customer base itself and then these new ecosystems that are evolving. And I think there's no question that COVID has accelerated the embedded finance model in the U.S. Just think of the travel ecosystem, think of home improvement ecosystems. 
The benefit we've got is that for us, it's not a new space to us. We've been very much engaged with partners in Asia, Grab, Paytm and WeBank as well as our traditional partners. What we find with these partnerships is that we learn a lot, because it's still early days in the development of these new ecosystems. We learn a lot about marketing, about user experiences around the tech stacks. It certainly enables us to tap into next-generation customer bases. 
But also importantly, it goes beyond consumer. And so if we look on the corporate side, our partnership with Stripe, the work that we're doing in TTS with Project Spring of enabling payments around is a core piece, particularly as wholesale and retail kind of collapses some of these payment chains into one. 
So with the -- at Google Plex and several other tech partnerships that we have in the States and elsewhere in the world, we're very deliberately going about creating a broad suite of APIs and partner integration capabilities so that we're able to integrate other partners into our offerings, develop more innovative solutions without necessarily having to build it or buy it all ourselves.

And there are elements of that, as I mentioned earlier, that we can influence and control. So the stress capital buffer is part of that. And I talked earlier about our ability to influence those levers. Without having full understanding of the Fed models, we know we can influence PPNR. We know we can influence the balance sheet and how it gets allocated, and ultimately, what stress losses come out of it. And so we will continue to manage that. We will still have a buffer obviously even with a higher G-SIB score. And as you know, regulators continue to talk about capital as being at about the right levels in the system. And they'll continue to look at drivers that influence the stack as well, including G-SIB and balance sheet size, et cetera. And we'll see how that evolves.

I'm delighted to join you again today. And first, I'm going to discuss the results of my first full quarter as CEO and then update you on the progress against our strategic priorities.
For the quarter, we reported $6.2 billion in net income or $2.85 per share. We continue to benefit from an improving macro environment as evidenced by another significant release of our allowances for credit losses. Indeed, the pace of the macro recovery is exceeding earlier expectations across the globe and with it comes growing consumer and corporate confidence. And this also came through loud and clear in my conversations with clients over the course of the week I just spent in London.
Now clearly, we have to remain mindful of the unevenness in that global recovery due to continued contagion and challenges in vaccine distribution in several parts of the world. But we are optimistic about the momentum ahead. And as a result, we deliberately accelerated some of our investments.
In our institutional businesses, we saw the expected normalization of fixed income trading compared to the striking volatility of Q2 last year, and our equities franchise had a particularly strong quarter. Looking forward, we do expect the volatile market to be higher than pre-COVID levels.
Performance in our Investment Banking franchise remained healthy, with good momentum in M&A and a very solid pipeline ahead for the rest of the year. We saw very good progress in our strategies to increase fee revenues, with double-digit growth in our ICG fee revenues, and specifically, over 20% year-over-year fee growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions, in Securities Services and in the Private Bank.
Now TTS is the backbone of the unique global network we deliver for our clients. And while the business continues to be impacted by lower rates, we particularly like how we are positioned here from a market share perspective as the post-pandemic recovery takes shape.
In Consumer Banking, while our loan book and revenues were impacted by the elevated payment rates in cards, spending is well above pre-COVID levels now, with a 38% increase in global purchase sales year-over-year. We expect this to translate into loan growth in the second half of the year. And we continue to have good momentum in both deposit growth and AUMs across our consumer franchises.
In the U.S., as we've discussed, we're investing in our home market, as demonstrated by the well-received launch of our innovative Custom Cash Card in June. Internationally, the picture for our consumer businesses diverges. So while there is still the softness in the Mexican economy, in Asia, loan growth returned, and that's despite new COVID outbreaks.
Turning to capital. For the first 2 quarters of 2021, we returned close to $7 billion to our shareholders, which was the maximum amount permitted under the Federal Reserve's rules. Going forward, we are committed to returning any excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise.
So while our stress capital buffer increased to 3% as a result of the Fed's recent stress test, that won't impact the common equity Tier 1 target we'd be managing to of approximately 11.5%. We ended the quarter at 11.9% on a standardized basis and have excess capital to return to our shareholders through a healthy dividend and ongoing stock repurchase program. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $77.87, up over 9% from a year ago.
Now let's turn to 3 of our strategic priorities: strategy, transformation and talent. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy refresh. We have moved swiftly to begin the sales process for the 13 consumer markets we plan to exit in Asia and EMEA. The first round of bids was very encouraging and competitive, which isn't a surprise because these are terrific businesses for the right owners.
In those regions, we're off to a running start in our wealth strategy. We're making significant strategic investments in product capabilities, technology and talent, and have already seen this in increased client acquisition. We continue to do thorough and rigorous work to refresh our strategy across our consumer and institutional businesses, guided by the 4 principles I outlined to you earlier in the year: being clinical, being focused, and ensuring both connectivity and simplification.
Our overarching goal is to increase the returns we generate and close the gap with our peers by investing in the franchises that will drive the most growth. The 3 most notable of which are TTS, Wealth and Commercial Banking. And I'm very confident in the growth and return prospects these connected franchises will afford us.
As we have done so far, we will share our decisions with you as we make them on the strategy. And we're also looking forward to presenting our plans to you more comprehensively during an Investor Day, which we intend to hold in the first quarter of next year. We're going to put our entire vision for the firm in front of you so you can then hold us accountable for executing against it.
As we discussed in the call last quarter, we're also working very hard and diligently on our transformation. This is a significant, it's also an exciting body of work. And we're working closely with our regulators to meet their expectations, and we intend to submit our plans to them this quarter.
Now while addressing the consent orders is an intense focus of the transformation, our work here goes well beyond the orders themselves. We've set out to modernize our bank. We want to achieve nothing less than excellence. And this means investing in our risk and control environment, but also in the infrastructure we need to serve our clients in an increasingly digital world.
So let me give you an example in TTS. These investments will improve the scalability of our platform. Automation will drive efficiency and client experience, and investments in data will enhance revenues. And the investments we're making will help position us to retain our leading position as the preeminent global corporate bank.
And that leads me finally to talent, where we have made material progress over the last few months. I'm delighted with the caliber of talent we have been attracting to the firm to grow our businesses and support our transformation. We've enhanced our existing ranks with best-in-market hires in data, risk, strategy and controls, as well as in the front lines of wealth, the commercial bank and BCMA in particular. We continue to invest in a culture of excellence and our own people, providing them with new leadership and growth opportunities. And it's this combination of new perspectives and our existing high-caliber talent pool that will enable us to take the firm forward with excellence, urgency and accountability.
Now before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to thank Liz Lynn for her great work leading our investor relation efforts over the past several years. And as you know, and as she mentioned, she is going to be our finance lead for BCMA, where we all know that she is going to do a wonderful job.
With that, Mark will go through our presentation, and then we'll both be happy to take your questions."

Revenues declined 12% from the prior year, reflecting a normalization in fixed income markets",2880,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone.
Starting on Slide 3. Citigroup reported second quarter net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $2.85 and a 15.2% RoTCE. Revenues declined 12% from the prior year, reflecting a normalization in fixed income markets along with lower card loans in consumer as well as the impact of lower interest rates. Expenses were up 7% year-over-year. In constant dollars, expenses were up 4%, reflecting a normalization relative to the low print last year, along with continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by productivity savings. 
Credit performance remained strong, with net credit losses of $1.3 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $2.4 billion, reflecting portfolio improvements as well as the continued improvement in our macroeconomic outlook.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher repayment rates across institutional and consumer, although I would note that we are starting to see some pockets of loan growth emerge. And for the first time in over a year, loans were up sequentially. Deposits grew modestly, up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients.
Looking at the first half of 2021, total revenues declined 9% year-over-year and 10% in constant dollars, mainly driven by the normalization in fixed income markets and lower card balances in consumer, although we did see strong fee revenue growth across consumer and in ICG, excluding fixed income markets. Total expenses were up 6% on a reported basis and 3% in constant dollars midway through the year. I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of the year in a moment.
Cost of credit was a benefit of roughly $3 billion, as we released over $6 billion in reserves. And we delivered roughly $14 billion in net income and an RoTCE of 17.6%. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $7 billion in capital so far this year. And we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise as well as returning any excess capital to shareholders given the flexibility provided by the SCB framework.
Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $4.9 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues decreased 14%, driven mainly by the decline in fixed income markets. Expenses increased 4% and were up 2% in constant dollars, as investments in transformation along with other strategic investments were mostly offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings. Credit costs were down considerably given a roughly $900 million ACL release as well as lower net credit losses. And ICG delivered a 16.4% return on allocated capital.
Slide 5 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were down 17% in the second quarter, primarily reflecting a comparison to a strong prior year period, particularly in fixed income markets. However, we are continuing to see robust client engagement and strong underlying growth in our fee businesses across the franchise, including TTS, Investment Banking, Securities Services, Commercial Banking and the Private Bank. And excluding the markets-related component, noninterest revenues were up 24% this quarter. And we are confident in our outlook for continued strong fee growth in the back half of the year.
Looking at the results in greater detail. On the banking side, revenues decreased 1%. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, significant growth in fee revenues of roughly 25%, reflecting solid client engagement as well as growth in trade, were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates with revenues down 1%. We're continuing to see momentum across our payments business with 13% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearing volumes over the past year as well as the early days of a recovery in commercial cards. And as of the end of the quarter, TTS loans grew roughly 5%, reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions.
Investment Banking revenues were up 1% as higher M&A and equity underwriting revenues were largely offset by a decline in debt underwriting. While the overall DCM while it was up in the second quarter, all the growth was in non-investment grade, which did not benefit our results given our skew to investment grade. But looking at results versus a more normal year, revenues were up 38% versus the second quarter of 2019, with strong growth across all products.
Private Bank revenues grew 4%, driven by higher fees and lending volumes, reflecting momentum with both new and existing clients, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Corporate lending revenues were down 15%, primarily driven by lower volumes. Total Markets & Securities Services revenues decreased 30% from last year. Fixed income revenues decreased 43%, reflecting a comparison to a strong prior year period in both rates and spread products. However, we remained engaged with our clients, with steady growth in both corporate and investor client revenues relative to the historical average.
Equities revenues were up 37% versus last year, primarily driven by good performance in both derivatives and Prime Finance, reflecting robust client activity and favorable market conditions. In Securities Services, revenues were up 9% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Here, we saw a strong growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients, driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes, partially offset by lower spreads.
Finally, looking at first half results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking as well as good results in the Private Bank and Securities Services, which helped to offset the expected normalization in fixed income markets. I would also note that equity markets revenues are up over 30%.
Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 6. For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.4 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues declined 10% as continued strong deposit growth, albeit with lower spreads, and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances across all 3 regions. In cards, while we are encouraged by the continued improvement in consumer spending, with purchase sales up close to 40% versus last year and almost 20% on versus last quarter, we are still seeing the impact of high payment rates on revenues.
Expenses increased 7%, reflecting continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, along with an acceleration in marketing and higher volume-related costs from the low point a year ago, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit remains healthy. And credit costs decreased significantly, driven by the $1.4 billion ACL reserve release and lower net credit losses. And GCB delivered a 20.8% return on allocated capital. Finally, looking at results for the first half of the year. We've seen steady improvement in our drivers, which gives us confidence in our outlook as we move into the back half of the year.
Slide 7 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues, but better than the 15% decline last quarter on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined in both Branded Cards and Retail Services by 12% and 14%, respectively, reflecting continued headwinds from higher payment rates, as consumers have continued to use liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt, driving lower loans and a shift in mix towards transactor balances. This is creating pressure on our net interest revenues, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends.
However, we are continuing to see a recovery in sales activity with purchased sales now above pre-pandemic levels, led by discretionary spend, including travel and dining. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were up 40% versus last year, and importantly, up 11% versus the second quarter of 2019. And in Retail Services, purchase sales also grew versus both second quarter 2019 and 2020. So the good news is that we're continuing to see the recovery in spend and we're also returning to pre-COVID acquisition levels. Looking ahead, we expect the growth in purchase sales to translate into loan growth by the end of the year as stimulus moderates, and consumers return to more normal payment patterns.
Turning to Retail Banking. Revenues were down 7% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen our retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 18%, including 24% growth in checking. And the number of Citigold households increased by 16%, contributing to a 23% increase in AUMs.
On Slide 8, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year in the second quarter, with an 11% decline in Latin America and a 3% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we are seeing good momentum in investment management, with 15% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia. And the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 international wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 8%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. And similar to the U.S., we saw a 26% increase in purchase sales year-over-year. But cards loan growth remained a challenge this quarter with average card loans down 8% due to elevated payment rates.
Slide 9 provides additional detail on Global Consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remain favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. And the ultimate timing and level of losses as we look into next year will depend on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit.
And as expected, credit losses and delinquency rates trended downward in both Mexico and Asia, following a peak in the first quarter of 2021. So overall, we're seeing a rebound in activity, along with a consumer who is in a very healthy financial position, suggesting good momentum as we move into the back half of the year.
Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were down slightly in dollar terms, as episodic gains this quarter were more than offset by previously disclosed onetime items in the prior year. Expenses were up slightly in dollar terms, mainly reflecting the impact of FX. And similar to last quarter, we have further allocated cost to the businesses related to investments in infrastructure, risk and controls. As we mentioned previously, this change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level, however, we have recast prior periods to enable better comparability of results.
Credit costs declined year-over-year, driven by our release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, EBIT was breakeven this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $200 million to $300 million for the remainder of 2021.
Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as noninterest revenues on a reported basis. We've also provided net interest revenues in constant dollars on Slide 19 in the appendix for comparison to prior periods.
In the second quarter, net interest revenue of $10.2 billion declined $880 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize as the extra day in the quarter was offset by lower cards revenues. And net interest margin declined 3 basis points, driven by lower cards NIR and modest growth in the balance sheet due to deposits, partially offset by the increase in Markets NIR in the quarter.
Turning to noninterest revenues on the bottom of the slide. In the second quarter, non-NIR declined $1.4 billion, driven by normalization in fixed income markets. However, outside of Markets, we did see strong broad-based fee growth of over $600 million across GCB and ICG. And for the past 2 quarters, we've seen these fee revenues return to pre-pandemic levels of roughly $4.4 billion per quarter, pointing to a somewhat faster-than-expected recovery.
Looking at these results midway through the year, we are comfortable with our prior outlook and continue to expect total Citi revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a full year basis, although the composition is likely to be somewhat different, which I will talk more about in a moment.
On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics, which remain strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.9%, as net income was mostly offset by buybacks and dividends. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9%, a decline from the prior quarter, largely driven by the expiration of a temporary SLR relief. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $77.87, driven by net income.
Before we move on to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the top line, for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis. But as I mentioned, the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated. Year-to-date, we've seen stronger-than-expected growth in noninterest revenues. And we do expect the strength in fee growth to continue in the back half of the year, driven primarily by ICG.
Meanwhile, for net interest revenues, we expect continued stabilization in the back half, and we should start to see some loan growth by the end of the year. So while net interest revenues are down roughly $2.2 billion year-to-date, just outside our original outlook for the full year, assuming this base case holds, we do not expect a significant further decline in net interest revenues from here on a full year basis. So again, in aggregate, for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits.
On the expense side, based on our latest work on the strategic refresh, we've made the decision to further accelerate certain strategic investments, in part in reaction to what is shaping up to be a faster-than-expected recovery. As a result, we now expect total Citigroup expenses to be up mid-single digits.
These are strategic investments that we are making to strengthen our franchise and drive long-term growth. For example, we've accelerated investments where we believe there are significant opportunities for growth, including holistically across Wealth and the Commercial Bank. We've also doubled down on our existing strengths in businesses like TTS, Securities Services and the Investment Banking business. Finally, given the faster recovery we are seeing today, we are accelerating investments in areas like cards marketing to capture this upside. All of these investments will have significant benefits over time.
Meanwhile, expenses related directly to the transformation, which we had expected to drive the 2% to 3% increase in total Citi expenses this year, are coming in largely as expected. These investments include the work around the consent order as well as the broader work to modernize the bank, which will improve our risk and control environment as well as allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and clients through an improved operating environment, leading to faster decision-making, better efficiency and improved client experience. And I'd point out that the mix of this spend is 30% technology and 70% non-tech-related investments.
Finally, this outlook includes the realization of productivity savings as a byproduct of the investments we've been making over the past few years. And to be clear, we will continue, as we have done in the past, to look for ways to operate as efficiently as possible during this investment period.
And one additional note, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I've mentioned previously, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. So in summary, we feel good about the investments that we are making and firmly believe these investments will position us well to close our return gap to peers over time.
Before we get started with questions, I also want to take a moment to thank Liz Lynn for her time as the Head of Citi Investor Relations. Liz has been with the Citi IR team since 2013 and has led the group since 2019. I know that she has built strong relationships with all of you and has been a key part of my team since I was named CFO a little over 2 years ago. She will be moving on to be the Chief Financial Officer for our Investment Banking business. And as Liz mentioned, Jen Landis will be joining us in August as our new Head of Investor Relations. I hope you will all join me in congratulating Liz on her new role and welcoming Jen to Citi at our next earnings call.
With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

Just wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit more. You're not the only bank that's been kind of raising expense guidance.
So I was wondering how much of this might be inflationary to the cost of doing business as a big bank here. How much is Citi specific? And does the run rate that you're expecting to be at on expenses in the back half of this year feel like that's the run rate you'd go into next year with? Or are there things that are elevated this year?"

Look, I'll start by saying and repeating a little bit of what I said in my remarks, which is that we are taking a very deliberate decision on how we manage the franchise, right? And so what I spoke to was, Jane and I, along with the leadership team are going through a very thoughtful strategy refresh. And as we go through that, we are identifying, particularly given the pace of the recovery, some real strategic opportunities to invest in the franchise.
And we don't want to -- we're not going to miss this window of opportunity. You've heard me mention that before. And it's in parts of the franchise that will undoubtedly grow and are high returning. So when we talk about TTS, we talk about the Commercial Banking business, we talk about Wealth, those are businesses that have strong growth prospects and have returns that are north of 20% in a normal environment. And so like I said, we're jumping at that.
On the transformation side, I've been very clear and consistent that we expected that to drive the 3% -- 2% to 3% increase year-over-year. That's coming in largely as expected. And again, the right thing to do, an important thing to do to modernize this bank. Inflation, of course, is going to be a factor, particularly as we look at labor and the competition for talent. But again, that's -- we deal with that on a regular basis, and we continue to look for productivity and efficiency savings that largely tend to offset that.
In terms of 2022, I'm not going to give any guidance on that. But again, this is, I think, an important period of time as we come out of this to ensure we're putting money to work in a smart fashion that prepares the firm for the future."

Now the good news is, as we've said, purchase sale activity is up meaningfully year-over-year and relative to the prior quarter. But it's really those payment rates are remaining quite high, quite elevated. The good news is that plays through in the form of a benefit as it relates to cost of credit, lower losses than expected, and now lower reserves as we see releases. But it's really that dynamic of payment rates high, lower loan volumes, average interest earning in particular, that is putting pressure on that top line."

Look, the first thing I'd say is that, as you can tell through the second quarter, we bought back as much as the regulatory rules would allow for in the way of the average 4 quarters of net income. And so we continue to be very excited about the prospect of continued capital return. 
As it relates to the SCB and the recent results, as you know, we have a target of approximately 11.5% from a CET1 ratio point of view. The target includes an estimate for the stress capital buffer. That's somewhere between 2.5% and 3%. Up until this recent set of results, the prior couple had been at the 2.5%. The 3% will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. And more importantly, we will actively manage the drivers that impact that stress capital buffer. That is to say, PPNR as well as the balance sheet, risk-weighted assets. And we intend to do so with an eye towards how we bring that stress capital buffer back down.
As we think about capital actions, as you know, with the SCB in place, we have the flexibility to take those decisions in a given quarter in line with our -- with the reg minimums, and we intend to do that. Given where the stock trades, it makes a lot of sense for us to be buying back shares. And so we'll continue to skew towards that. And as of right now, our dividend is going to remain at the 51%. But as I mentioned, we will continue to look at that quarter-to-quarter given the flexibility from the SCB."

I understand the preference to buy back stock, and you're very explicit about wanting to do that below tangible book. So that makes sense. But I guess just kind of signaling in the market, keeping a stable dividend, is there like a message there about the underlying earnings power or limited ability to increase the dividend? Because I would think you'd want to at least top it up by a couple of pennies just to kind of signal a positive trend because it doesn't take that much capital to do that.
So maybe you can elaborate a little bit on the dividend, again, specifically on -- should we read into implied underlying earnings power? Are there any limits on increase from dividend?"

And we've got a number of franchises that have material scale, and we only expect them to be growing. And this is where the transformation program will be very helpful in ensuring the scalability of our platforms.
We made the decision on Asia Pac and EMEA to exit the 13 markets where we didn't believe that we would be able to achieve the scale needed to compete in those very local part of the business. So that we can focus our firepower in those areas where we're either ensuring we retain a leading market position or in other areas where we want to be investing to attain the scale that we think is going to be needed going forward. U.S. consumer is an obvious example of that.
So I think as we -- you'll hear from us going forward, more and more focused around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this, aided by the transformation program, or in the areas where we'll be investing attain greater scale. As I say, U.S. consumer is the obvious one. There are pockets in Commercial Bank we're excited by. Securities Services, one where we think it is very, very readily attainable, particularly given our pre and post trade capabilities.
And part of that scale finally, it will come from the linkages between our businesses. As we create more connectivity, that will also provide us scale. So collectively, the different franchises we have will be competitively advantaged and not just individually strong."

Mike, excellent question. The partnership with big tech is an important part of our disruptor strategy in the U.S. as we're looking at both how do we enhance value propositions to customers, the customer base itself and then these new ecosystems that are evolving. And I think there's no question that COVID has accelerated the embedded finance model in the U.S. Just think of the travel ecosystem, think of home improvement ecosystems.
The benefit we've got is that for us, it's not a new space to us. We've been very much engaged with partners in Asia, Grab, Paytm and WeBank as well as our traditional partners. What we find with these partnerships is that we learn a lot, because it's still early days in the development of these new ecosystems. We learn a lot about marketing, about user experiences around the tech stacks. It certainly enables us to tap into next-generation customer bases.
But also importantly, it goes beyond consumer. And so if we look on the corporate side, our partnership with Stripe, the work that we're doing in TTS with project Spring of enabling payments around is a core piece, particularly as wholesale and retail kind of collapses some of these payment chains into one.
So with the -- at Google Plex and several other tech partnerships that we have in the States and elsewhere in the world, we're very deliberately going about creating a broad suite of APIs and partner integration capabilities so that we're able to integrate other partners into our offerings, develop more innovative solutions without necessarily having to build it or buy it all ourselves. And Citi Plex with Google is an example of that. We are actively testing features with our own employees at the moment. We'll be finalizing dates. We'll share that with you when available. But it's one of many different partnerships that we have and an important partner for us, but far from the only one here in the States to help us disrupt and grow going forward."

And look, as you know, with all of the liquidity in the market, many of us have seen pressure on our G-SIB score. That certainly has been the case for us. And it wouldn't go into effect, a higher G-SIB score of 3.5% until the beginning of 2023. And we look at the entire capital stack holistically, the 11.5% target in our case, which is well above reg minimums, but certainly does consider that in it. And there are elements of that, as I mentioned earlier, that we can influence and control. So the stress capital buffer is part of that.
And I talked earlier about our ability to influence those levers. Without having full understanding of the Fed models, we know we can influence PPNR. We know we can influence the balance sheet and how it gets allocated, and ultimately, what stress losses come out of it. And so we will continue to manage that. We will still have a buffer obviously even with a higher G-SIB score. And as you know, regulators continue to talk about capital as being at about the right levels in the system. And they'll continue to look at drivers that influence the stack as well, including G-SIB and balance sheet size, et cetera, and we'll see how that evolves.
But again, we feel good about where we are. We're well capitalized. We have a good sense for the drivers going forward that will create capital capacity for us. And we intend to, again, invest that where it makes sense and return that otherwise to our shareholders."

I'm delighted to join you today.

I'm delighted to join you today.  So let's kick off the call with what we're seeing from a macro perspective and the tremendous engagement we continue to experience with clients, before I give you an update on our results and priorities. 
Certainly, the recovery from the pandemic continues to drive corporate and consumer confidence. I particularly like the robust pipelines we see through the rest of the year and beyond. 
Corporate client sentiment remains very positive, with healthy cash flows and liquidity driving M&A activity and deleveraging. And consumer balance sheets remain unusually strong on the back of the increasing consumer net worth during the pandemic. 
Now all that said, growth has come off the ball's it had. We're watching 3 things very closely: the slowdown in China and its impact on global growth; inflation and supply constraints in labor, materials and energy; and finally, what happens next with the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations These are also the issues which repeatedly surface in our conversations with clients. 
So turning to the quarter. We reported net income of $4.6 billion and EPS of $2.15. Embedded in these results is a pretax loss related to the sale of our Australia consumer business, which Mark is going to provide the details on. Excluding this transaction, our third quarter revenues would have been up 3% over last year, and our EPS would have been $2.44. 
In the Institutional Clients Group, we grew revenues by 4% year-over-year as we continue to see strong client engagement with momentum in investment banking, equity markets and securities services more than offsetting a 16% decline in fixed income markets. I'm very proud to tell you that it was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second best investment banking quarter in a decade and lending in the ICG grew again this quarter, albeit modestly. We also had a very strong quarter in equity markets, with revenues up 40% year-over-year. So despite that normalization in fixed income versus the pretty extraordinary performance of 2020, overall markets revenues were only down 5%, and they were up 11% versus the third quarter of 2019. 
We continue to successfully execute on our strategy to grow fee revenue across the ICG businesses. For example, wealth TTS continues to be impacted by interest rate headwinds. Our fees this quarter were the highest in a decade. You can also see how our global network uniquely positions us to help our clients navigate the supply chain challenges so many of them are facing, a dynamic that we expect to persist for the near future. 
Similarly, we drove double-digit fee revenue growth in security services in the private bank as client assets under custody and assets under management continued their vigorous growth trajectory. In Global Consumer Banking, healthy consumer balance sheets and persistently elevated payment rates did mean that loan growth remained under pressure.
The other key drivers are a bit more encouraging, however. U.S. branded cards purchase sales are well above 2019 levels. And acquisitions across branded cards, Mexico and the Asia hub are also all now at or above pre-COVID levels. Similarly, we continue to benefit from double-digit growth in deposits and assets under management across the franchise.
Let me briefly touch on our U.S. retail strategy. Now our digital strategy and investments are starting to pay dividends. Digital deposits stand at $19 billion, having grown 26% in the last year. And we see more than 2/3 of our digital deposit balances coming from customers outside of our branch footprint. And with about half of those deposits from [ customers ] who did not previously have a retail relationship with us. Now obviously, we were disappointed by Google's decision to discontinue Google Plex, but we learned a lot through the effort, and the vast majority of the investments will be leveraged for our proprietary efforts and future partnerships. 
So all in all, we ended the quarter with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7% on a standardized basis. And our tangible book value per share increased to $79.07, up over 10% from a year ago. So far this year, we've returned close to $11 billion to shareholders through a healthy dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to returning excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise and to maintain our safety and soundness. 
So overall, I'm quite pleased with these results given the environment we're operating in. And while we have much work ahead, we're seeing the results of the previous investments that we have made. 
Now I'd like to update you on our strategic priorities. Turning to Slide 3. We've included a page that clearly lays out our top priorities and some of the actions we've taken to date against them. And we're going to share this page with you each quarter to ensure you're up-to-date on where we are and the milestones and progress along the way. 
And as you can see, we've been hard at work, acting against the priorities that I've laid out: the transformation, the strategy refresh, and our culture and talent. Now clearly, the transformation is our #1 priority right now, and key to that transformation is our safety and soundness in addressing the consent orders by modernizing our risk and control environment. During the quarter, we submitted our plans to our regulators and continue to have a constructive dialogue with them as we pivot now firmly towards execution. We're already well underway in the investment in our risk and control environment. And we're really bringing a culture of excellence to this effort, and we are moving with urgency. 
We also continue to make progress refreshing our strategy. In addition to announcing the sale of our consumer business in Australia, with deepened effect around [ bids] for the remaining exit markets. We've begun the work on how these exits will enable us to simplify our operations in Asia and eliminate stranded costs. And we're really looking forward to bringing all the strategy work together for you on Investor Day and presenting our vision for the firm. 
And as Mark is going to touch on, we've begun executing on many of the decisions that we've already made, including in TTS, wealth and commercial banking with investments in front office hires as well as enhanced digital product and service offerings. And we're already starting to see the impact of these investments emerge through key drivers across these businesses. 
And finally, turning to culture and talent. We continue to attract high-caliber external talent whilst driving towards our diversity goals, ensuring clear accountability and breaking down the silos that have historically impeded our progress as a company. It's a new Citi. And all of this work has one overarching goal: to responsibly narrow the returns gap with our peers. We will update you with the metrics and milestones that we'll use to hold ourselves accountable, so you can hold us accountable to them as well. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to go through our performance in more detail. And then we will both be delighted to take your questions."

Embedded in these results is a pretax loss of",1951,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 4. As Jane mentioned, Citigroup reported third quarter net income of $4.6 billion, EPS of $2.15 and an RoTCE of 11% on $17.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results is a pretax loss of $680 million related to the sale of our Australia consumer business. Excluding this item, EPS would have been $2.44 with an RoTCE of 12.5%. 
As a reminder, while we received a premium to book on the sale of the business, we did incur a pretax loss primarily related to the currency translation adjustment that is built up over time and is already included in our capital. Upon closing, the capital impact of this loss will be largely neutralized, and we will release approximately $800 million of capital allocated to the business. 
Revenues declined 1% from the prior year. Excluding the loss on sale, revenues would have been up 3%, largely driven by investment banking fees as well as strong growth in equity markets and security services. 
Expenses were up 5% year-over-year. In constant dollars, expenses were up 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our expenses have grown by 5% with 2 main drivers: investments in the transformation including the 6 programs to address the consent orders, which drove about 3% of the growth so far this year; and business-led investments, which focus on our front office expansion in the investment bank, wealth and securities services and investments to improve our client experience and digitize our network. 
So far this year, we added over 500 bankers, advisers and other front office support in wealth, including the private bank and the consumer wealth businesses; and 200 corporate and investment bankers globally in high-growth areas, including senior hires across tech, health care, fintech and private equity coverage. In our services businesses, TTS and security services, we continue to improve client experience and digital capabilities, which is enabling us to capture significant new mandates. In consumer, these investments include development and marketing for new offerings like the custom cash card and installment lending as well as investments in our mobile and digital user experience.
In addition, there were also increases in volume and revenue-related expenses as well as business as usual expenses, which were largely offset by efficiency savings. As a reminder, we will continue to analyze our expenses to look for opportunities to self-fund investments. 
And now turning to credit. Credit performance remained strong, with net credit losses of just under $1 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $1.2 billion, largely reflecting continued improvement in portfolio quality. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans were down 1% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Australia exit. Excluding this impact, loans would have been up 1% year-over-year, driven by active client engagement in TTS private bank and markets. End-of-period deposits were up 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients as well as continued momentum in client acquisition and deepening across both corporate clients and consumers.
Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $11 billion in capital so far this year. And while we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise, we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders.
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year and sequentially, mainly driven by investment banking, equity markets and security services. Expenses increased 9%, with about half of the increase driven by transformation and the other half driven by business-led investments and higher revenue-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs were largely benign in the quarter as minimal net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL reserve release. This resulted in net income of $3.4 billion, which grew 21% in the quarter and 60% on a year-to-date basis. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 14.5% for the quarter and 18.8% year-to-date. 
Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. On the banking side, revenues were up 11% In Treasury and Trade Solutions, continued growth in fee revenues of 20% year-over-year. The highest quarter for fees in a decade reflected solid client engagement and client acquisition as well as a recovery in commercial card revenues. However, all of this was more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads, driving total revenues down 4%. 
We're continuing to see momentum across our payment business with 15% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearing transactions over the past year. As of quarter end, TTS loans grew 15% mainly in trade loans where our technology investments in supply chain and deep local knowledge are enabling us to meet our clients' needs across the globe. 
Investment banking revenues were up 39% year-over-year, largely driven by M&A as we continue to see the benefits from our front office investments, which positioned us well to take advantage of increased deal activity. As Jane mentioned, this was the second best quarter for investment banking revenues and the best quarter for M&A in a decade. 
Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by growth in assets under management, loans and deposits, reflecting momentum with new and existing clients. This quarter, we added almost 200 bankers, investment counselors and other front office support and onboarded over 200 new clients. Our investments in talent continue to drive growth which bodes well for our overall strategy in Wealth. 
Corporate Lending revenues were up 17%, primarily driven by lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale, partially offset by lower loan volumes. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues decreased 4% from last year. Fixed income revenues decreased 16%, reflecting the continued normalization in market activity across rates and spread products. However, we saw strong activity with our corporate clients, engaging with them in foreign exchange products to support their global operations and hedging solutions to assist with their risk mitigation efforts. 
Equity Markets revenues were up 40%, our second best quarter in a decade, driven by cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. This is another business where we see our investments in talent and technology paying off. 
In Securities Services, revenues were up 10%. Here, we saw a strong growth in fee revenues as the investments that we've been making in our platform and product capabilities enabled us to grow revenue with both new and existing clients, partially offset by lower deposit spreads.
Finally, looking at year-to-date results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from investment banking and equity markets as well as solid results in the Private Bank and Securities Services, which helped to offset the expected normalization in fixed income markets.
Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. Revenues declined 14%, and 5% excluding the loss on sale, as solid deposit growth and momentum in Investment Management were more than offset by lower card balances and lower deposit spreads. Expenses increased 5% with about half driven by transformation and the remainder driven by business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Cost of credit was a modest benefit this quarter as a roughly $1 billion ACL reserve release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in net income of $1.3 billion, which grew 44%. And GCB delivered a 15% RoTCE, and a 21.5% RoTCE excluding the loss on sale.
Finally, looking at year-to-date results, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers over the course of the year, with purchase sales up 5% relative to 2019 and acquisitions nearing pre-COVID levels globally. And the business delivered 22.4% RoTCE, excluding the loss on sale. 
Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Total third quarter revenues were down 4% from last year as we continue to see headwinds from higher payment rates and deposit spreads. That said, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in both cards and retail banking. In branded cards and retail services, purchase sales were up versus the prior year by 24% and 14% respectively, with both above 2019 levels. And in Retail Banking average deposits and within that, checking deposits, were both up 14%. AUMs were up 16%, and Citigold households were up 13% this quarter. 
We're also making progress on our U.S. digital strategy. U.S. digital deposits grew 26% compared to the prior year and installment loan balances, including our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products, have also grown substantially, up 22% compared to the prior year. And over 80% of these loans are originated digitally.
On Slide 9, we show results for our International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 30% year-over-year in the third quarter. Excluding the loss on sale, revenues declined 5% with a 7% decline in Latin America and a 4% decline in Asia. 
Looking at international consumer overall, we are seeing good momentum in investment management. with 10% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia. And the growth is meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 international wealth hubs. Purchase sales grew 8% versus the prior year. and average deposits grew 3%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. 
Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit remained favorable again this quarter across all regions. And given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. 
Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased by over $300 million, driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses declined by $300 million due to the absence of the civil money penalty which we incurred in the third quarter of last year, offset by an increase in expenses related to the transformation. Credit costs were still a benefit in the quarter, but reflect a lower ACL release in the legacy portfolio relative to last year. Finally, EBIT was a loss of $330 million. 
Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as noninterest revenues on a reported basis. In the third quarter, net interest revenue of $10.4 billion declined roughly $100 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. On a year-to-date basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $2.3 billion.
Turning to noninterest revenues on the bottom of the slide. In the third quarter, non-NIR declined by approximately $50 million year-over-year, driven by the impact from the loss on the sale of the Australian consumer business. Excluding the loss, noninterest revenues would have grown by over $600 million or 9%, driven by strong growth in fees in ICG.
On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio ticked down to 11.7%. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was largely unchanged at 5.8%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 10% year-over-year to $79.07, driven by net income.
Before we move to Q&A, let me touch briefly on our outlook for 2021. On the top line for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis, excluding any divestiture-related impacts.
On the expense side, we continue to expect full year expenses to be up in the mid-single-digit range, excluding any divestiture-related impacts, as we continue to transform our risk and control environment and invest in our businesses. And we will continue to look for ways to partially self-fund these investments over time.
With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions."

The second, I mentioned earlier that we saw some loan growth in cards sequentially, branded cards in particular up 3%. But also within that, we saw some of the late fees and balcon fees and cards kind of play through. As you know, there's an extra day in the quarter. And so the combination of those things contributed to the tick up here that we've seen.
In terms of kind of the balance of the year, that all feeds into the guidance that I've given for total revenues. And that really hasn't changed, but we continue to look to invest in the cards portfolio through new acquisitions with a long-term perspective of how we grow loans over time there."

We want to ensure that we can invest in the business. And then anything in excess of that, we want to return to shareholders. So that perspective has not changed. 
Obviously, the SCB allows for us to take those decisions in the given quarter based on what we're seeing in terms of our expected performance and based on all of the other factors I mentioned, including the capital release and SAC and things of that sort. And so we'll continue to take those decisions with that philosophy in mind, which is how do we return any excess we have to shareholders over time."

And in terms of buy now pay later, I think this is one where, obviously, we're divesting our operations in Asia on that front, but we've certainly -- look, we've taken the learnings from our operations throughout the Asian region and particularly been applying them to the U.S. over the last few years.
So we've certainly not been sitting still in the U.S. We've been building out our personal lending platform since 2019, and that's part of our broader digitization strategy in the U.S. consumer. We've been seeing very strong growth in our Flex portfolios, both as we leverage some of our existing partnerships such as American Airlines. And we worked to expand with new partners and POS. 
And one of the areas I'm particularly excited about is the partnering that we're doing with the largest e-commerce player, Amazon, on point-of-sale lending for our cards customers. And those capabilities are and will be leveraged with many additional partners and channels in the States and into Mexico. 
And finally, we've been expanding our product suite by developing off-card lending capabilities. And I think as you've heard from Mark, our [indiscernible] installment loans to existing card customers, 88% of those total sales are in digital channels. 
So as we look at all of this, I would say clearly there's a trend towards multiple different formats of how a customer can and wants to pay. And we're really on the front foot of this and making some strong progress on the back of the investments that we've been making over the last few years, and we'll continue to do so."

And I'll start with kind of your comments related to cards.
 And so look, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, particularly when you look at U.S. branded cards, we did start to see a tick up there as it relates to loan balances. The loans were up about 1% year-over-year. They were up about 3% quarter-over-quarter. 
What I think is really important here is the market reentry. Because as you're seeing purchase sales are up, but payment rates are still quite high. And we've got to see how stimulus and liquidity plays out over time. And so what we're focused on is how we're reentering into the market. And we're doing that both through our custom cash launch, which is helping to drive new acquisitions. 
In fact, our new acquisition volumes are back to 2019 levels. Over half of those acquisitions are in proprietary cards. We're being thoughtful about that. So over the last 5 years, we've been shortening our promotional periods and adding higher fees for balance transfers and targeting a lower mix of promotional balances. And those things, as you know, will feed future average interest earning balances as our experience is that roughly half of those balances ultimately convert to revolving over time. So that's an important step.
The second thing that I'll mention is just to reiterate what Jane pointed out, which is we're thinking about lending more broadly. And we're driving growth on the on-card lending products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan. And those don't have promotional periods associated with them, and they start to generate interest from day 1. 
And so we're keenly focused on this. We're obviously a big player here. It's obviously an important part of our portfolio and generates healthy returns. But we need to be positioned to capture growth as the economy continues to recover and behavior normalizes. And we need to be prepared if behavior doesn't normalize as quickly as we'd like with things like broader lending products."

So let me start by saying as I pointed out in the prepared remarks, our expenses in aggregate are on guidance, so to speak. Both as it relates to the transformation expected spend, which year-to-date is up 3%, as well as our total expenses, which are up 5% year-to-date, again consistent with the guidance. 
As I think about this, those are 2 very important categories of spend. As Jane has pointed out, transformation is our top priority. And we're going to spend what's necessary to get that done, and we need to ensure that we're investing long term across the franchise. And so we're going to continue to do that. 
But I would also highlight that expenses is something that we control, right? So we are very deliberate about the spend that you're seeing. And in fact I'm scrubbing, we are scrubbing every single expense line that we have, right, to ensure that the dollars that we're putting to work are being put to work in an optimal fashion, that they're necessary dollars to be spent. And in doing that, we're also looking for productivity and efficiency opportunities. 
And in fact we've seen that play through the expense levels that you see today. If you look at if we -- as we look at our expenses, we've generated somewhere between $300 million and $400 million a quarter in efficiencies through 2021, right? So expense management is something that we're very disciplined about, we're very deliberate about. And we handle that in a very controlled fashion, recognizing the priorities that we've pointed out. 
I'm not going to give you guidance for 2022. I will tell you that our guidance hasn't changed for the balance of 2021. We're obviously in the middle of our budget season, right? And as we firm that up and finalize that, we'll share that with you and our investors more broadly."

If you'll bear with me for a minute, let's just take a step back and start with our compensation philosophy, because I think it's really important for our shareholders to understand this. 
So the compensation of the management team is designed to be performance-based. It's aligned with the interest of our shareholders, most importantly. 
So first, any of the deferred awards we have, have downside built in. And we clearly saw this last year in the PSU performance, which paid out only 28% of its target. And then secondly, the annual process holds management accountable for results, as we also saw last year with meaningful comp reductions resulting from the consent orders. 
So then if we then turn to the transformation program, as I said in the opening, there isn't anything that's more important than the successful execution of the program. It's our #1 priority. We want to make sure the bank is modernizing its risk and control environment. And it will also benefit our shareholders in terms of the performance of the bank. The Board and I hold the senior leaders driving that transformation accountable for its successful execution. 
I'm certainly driving this program with urgency. And I also need to retain key talent because it's a pretty tight talent market right now, as we all know. And we need to do this so that we can hit the milestones and deliver with excellence. So as to hold people accountable and drive the outcomes, we need both carrots and we need sticks. 
And to your question, we're going to put in rigorous metrics to determine if the rewards get paid out at all; and if so, what percentage will be paid out. And we laid out a criteria in the 8-K. And the final metrics will be ones that reflect input from the Board, from myself and the other stakeholders involved, and we'll make -- and those will obviously be disclosed in the proxy, et cetera. So you'll see them. 
So as you can see, I think the main message from me is there will be consequences if we fall short of what is expected, just as they were last year, for the management and the leaders of the program. I'm accountable, my team's accountable. And very simply, we must and we will deliver."

So I obviously as I said in the opening, we were disappointed in their decision, but it is just one part of our digital strategy.

And what I am pleased is the strength of the digital engagement that we are seeing across the U.S. [ It's logged] other geographies around the world across the industry on this dimension, and also the growth in sticky digital deposits that we're seeing in the U.S. The piece I like is we deliberately invested in very reusable capabilities for future partnerships and existing ones that we have as well as our own proprietary efforts. 
So if I can try and make that come a bit to life: we've added 80 APIs, which really make it very easy to operate with partners. We've developed a whole suite of embedded services that are ready to deploy. That's things like real-time digital alerts, partner branded communications. 
And probably most importantly, and maybe this is the geek in me, we put together new tech stacks, and we've learned a lot about doing this. That's very valuable for what we're doing right now and for partnerships going forward. 
So at the end of the day, I think all the things that we've been doing, both in some of the work with Google but also with partnerships around the world, is going to further our digitization strategy in U.S. consumer, continue helping us grow and drive the returns here. And I would say, we're always feeling urgency in improving the performance, the growth and returns in consumer franchises."

Karen Peak and her team are ensuring we have the capabilities and rigorous governance, so we're executing in a very disciplined way. We deliver the outcomes from the investments we're making.

[What you have any] change in your philosophy. It's because the discount to book value is just getting greater and greater. Your discount versus peer has increased. Citi has worst-in-class returns, adjusted efficiency and stock market valuation. So why not a little change to that philosophy to more buybacks versus investing if you have such a great opportunity with your share price? 
So what can you do from a symbolic nature, like everyone gets paid in stock? Or what can you do about the capital freed up from the sale of Australia and use all that to buy back stock? Or what can you do to show that -- obviously, regulators matter, stakeholders matter. But what can you do to sure that shareholders also matter, given such the underperformance of the share price? 
And then since you're only give me one question at a time, just a little bit more follow-up on your U.S. consumer strategy as far as digital deposits, cross-selling to credit cards, point of sale with Amazon, a little bit more on that."

Unequivocally, our shareholders are incredibly important to us. And when we look at where we're trading and the underperformance around that, it is something that we are determined in the strategy refresh and the transformation work we're doing and in the culture and talent work we're doing to address this. We are going to do what is necessary to narrow the gap with our peers. We are going to ensure we have the right business mix and strategies to drive up the returns. And you're starting to see where that is where we're headed to with that, from the different decisions we've already announced, and obviously, it will all come together at Investor Day. 
But secondly, we're also going to do it by running the bank better. And we've laid out on Page 3 of the presentation, what are the different priorities, so that our investors realize the value that we think lies in Citi and what we are going to be doing to unlock that for their benefit. And I think I hope it's pretty clear in terms of the framework that we're using and the principles around that. 
And in terms of as Mark said, from a -- not only [ unlock the value] that we see in Citi, which I really do think is pretty tremendous and I'm quite excited about that. It also then with our excess capital. You've heard me say given where we trade, so disappointingly below book, obviously share repurchases make sense for our shareholders. We also do have a healthy dividend yield, but that's an important part of the mix. But there's no question around the attractiveness for a shareholder relatively of the stock buybacks. 
And we will certainly be returning excess capital to our shareholders and be very mindful of the bar that is required for investment internally. And you've seen that with the decisions that we've made on the exits in Asia on consumer and some of the other moves that we will exit the businesses we think are lower returning and reinvest where we -- where appropriate that we'll return that to shareholders. And I can see my CFO is chomping at the bit here to jump in as well."

I just -- I think you answered it very well. I'd just add a couple of quick things. 
One, that when we invest in the business towards clients or more broadly in the business, we're doing it where returns are above our cost of capital. So we're making smart decisions about how to redeploy that capital to ensure that we're narrowing that gap to peers.
The second thing I'd point out is that in the first couple of quarters of the year, we've maxed out the capital return that was available for us to deliver before the SCB came into play. And that is because our shareholders are so important. 
And then the third, as Jane mentioned, is that we have a skew towards buybacks, again just given where the stock is trading and given where our dividend yield is. So thank you for the question."

But just at a high level, I was hoping you could speak to what differentiates Citi's value prop from some of the peers in the space, whether you have the technology or infrastructure in place to support some of your growth ambitions?

So I'm pretty pleased around our opportunities here because we have all the pieces to be very successful. We have a strong brand in amongst the affluent, not just here in the States of our retail banking franchise. We've go",542,"Yes. Thank you so much, Steven. So I'm pretty pleased around our opportunities here because we have all the pieces to be very successful. We have a strong brand in amongst the affluent, not just here in the States of our retail banking franchise. We've got a very we've got a pretty heavily affluent base, but around the world. And when you go into Asia in particular, this is the aspirational wealth management brand on the ground there. 
We've also got real breadth of client relationships, and this is where the connectivity points also become important in those 4 principles that we laid out under the strategy refresh. We have commercial banking operations in 30 geographies around the world that have been operating for many years now. This is the engine of wealth creation in the world, and we have the relationship with the owners already. 
And so the synergies that we will be able to generate by much more closely connecting them will be very important. Similarly, the elevator from the affluent client base in our consumer franchise all the way up to the ultra-high net worth and the private bank is obviously a natural area to build out that we haven't really invested in that elevator and thinking of it that way. We have some great platforms. Our institutional client business around the world means that we've got top 2 platforms for our private banking clients in particular to take advantage of, but it's also ones that our consumer clients have as well. So the opportunity here is bring all these different pieces together into a single integrated offering, across the full spectrum of clients in the U.S. and in the global offshore wealth centers. 
And I would also point to the fact that we're already the top 3 player in Asia. It's not as if we don't have scale and that this is a start-up business here. And we've already seen that this is coming into fruition quickly, what we see announced the focus on wealth at the beginning of the year. We've already acquired 21,500 new-to-bank clients in Asia this year so far this year; that we've added over 500 bankers, advisers and other front office support year-to-date. We've done one of the biggest tech releases for wealth in the third quarter of this year, with over 70-plus features going live on the back of the digital platform we launched last quarter. 
So I think the fact that we thought all these different pieces, we're putting them all together is really giving us momentum and accelerating the opportunity for us. And this is a trend, the wealth trend is going to be one that's one of those unstoppable trends, particularly in Asia in the years ahead. 
We'll look at acquisitions at the moment. Obviously, it's more focused around what our digital capabilities, what are other things value propositions and the technological side. And those aren't just acquisitions. It's partnerships and the like that we've been investing in, so that we really serve the wealthy client across the full spectrum of their needs, rather than just narrowly as some of the other players are in just [ a set] of investment products. We've got the benefit across the board."

I'm delighted to join you today. So let's kick off the call with what we're seeing from a macro perspective and the tremendous engagement we continue to experience with clients before I give you an update on",1198,"So thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to join you today. So let's kick off the call with what we're seeing from a macro perspective and the tremendous engagement we continue to experience with clients before I give you an update on our results and priorities. 
Certainly, the recovery from the pandemic continues to drive corporate and consumer confidence. I particularly like the robust pipelines we see through the rest of the year and beyond. Corporate client sentiment remains very positive, with healthy cash flows and liquidity driving M&A activity and deleveraging. And consumer balance sheets remain unusually strong on the back of the increasing consumer net worth during the pandemic. Now all that said, growth has come off the boil a tad. We are watching 3 things very closely: the slowdown in China and its impact on global growth; inflation and supply constraints in labor, materials and energy; and finally, what happens next with the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations. These are also the issues which repeatedly surface in our conversations with clients. 
So turning to the quarter. We reported net income of $4.6 billion and EPS of $2.15. Embedded in these results is a pretax loss related to the sale of our Australia consumer business, which Mark is going to provide the details on. Excluding this transaction, our third quarter revenues would have been up 3% over last year, and our EPS would have been $2.44. 
In the Institutional Clients Group, we grew revenues by 4% year-over-year as we continue to see strong client engagement with momentum in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Securities Services more than offsetting the 16% decline in Fixed Income Markets.
I'm very proud to tell you that it was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second best investment banking quarter in a decade, and lending in the ICG grew again this quarter, albeit modestly. We also had a very strong quarter in Equity Markets, with revenues up 40% year-over-year. So despite that normalization in Fixed Income versus the pretty extraordinary performance of 2020, overall Markets revenues were only down 5%, and they were up 11% versus the third quarter of 2019.  
We continue to successfully execute on our strategy to grow fee revenue across the ICG businesses. For example, while TTS continues to be impacted by interest rate headwinds, our fees this quarter were the highest in a decade. You can also see how our global network uniquely positions us to help our clients navigate the supply chain challenges so many of them are facing, a dynamic that we expect to persist for the near future.  
Similarly, we drove double-digit fee revenue growth in Securities Services in the Private Bank as client assets under custody and assets under management continued their vigorous growth trajectory. In Global Consumer Banking, healthy consumer balance sheets and persistently elevated payment rates did mean that loan growth remained under pressure. 
The other key drivers are a bit more encouraging, however, U.S. Branded Cards purchase sales are well above 2019 levels. And acquisitions across Branded Cards Mexico and the Asia hub are also all now at or above pre-COVID levels. Similarly, we continue to benefit from double-digit growth in deposits and assets under management across the franchise. 
Let me briefly touch on our U.S. retail strategy. Now our digital strategy and investments are starting to pay dividends. Digital deposits stand at $19 billion, having grown 26% in the last year. And we see more than 2/3 of our digital deposit balances coming from customers outside of our branch footprint. With about half of those deposits from our card holders who did not previously have a retail relationship with us. 
Now obviously, we were disappointed by Google's decision to discontinue Google Plex, but we learned a lot through the effort, and the vast majority of the investments will be leveraged for our proprietary efforts and future partnerships.  
So all in all, we ended the quarter with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7% on a standardized basis. And our tangible book value per share increased to $79.07, up over 10% from a year ago. So far this year, we've returned close to $11 billion to shareholders through a healthy dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to returning excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise and to maintain our safety and soundness.  
So overall, I'm quite pleased with these results given the environment we're operating in. And while we have much work ahead, we're seeing the results of the previous investments that we have made.  
Now I'd like to update you on our strategic priorities. Turning to Slide 3. We've included a page that clearly lays out our top priorities and some of the actions we've taken to date against them. And we're going to share this page with you each quarter to ensure you're up-to-date on where we are and the milestones and progress along the way. 
And as you can see, we've been hard at work, acting against the priorities that I've laid out: the transformation, the strategy refresh, and our culture and talent. Now clearly, the transformation is our #1 priority right now, and key to that transformation is our safety and soundness in addressing the Consent Orders by modernizing our risk and control environment. 
During the quarter, we submitted our plans to our regulators and continue to have a constructive dialogue with them as we pivot now firmly towards execution. We're already well underway in the investment in our risk and control environment, and we're really bringing a culture of excellence to this effort, and we are moving with urgency. We also continue to make progress refreshing our strategy. 
In addition to announcing the sale of our consumer business in Australia, we're deep in the second round for of bids for the remaining exit markets. We've begun the work on how these exits will enable us to simplify our operations in Asia and eliminate stranded costs. And we're really looking forward to bringing all the strategy work together for you on Investor Day and presenting our vision for the firm.  
And as Mark is going to touch on, we've begun executing on many of the decisions that we've already made, including in TTS, wealth and commercial banking with investments in front office hires as well as enhanced digital product and service offerings. And we're already starting to see the impact of these investments emerge through key drivers across these businesses.  
And finally, turning to culture and talent. We continue to attract high-caliber external talent whilst driving towards our diversity goals, ensuring clear accountability and breaking down the silos that have historically impeded our progress as a company. It's a new Citi. And all of this work has one overarching goal: to responsibly narrow the returns gap with our peers. We will update you with the metrics and milestones that we'll use to hold ourselves accountable, so you can hold us accountable to them as well.  
And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to go through our performance in more detail. And then we will both be delighted to take your questions."

As Jane mentioned, Citigroup reported third quarter net income of $4.6 billion, EPS of $2.15 and an RoTCE of 11% on $17.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results is a pretax loss of $680 million related to the sale of our Australia consumer business. Excluding this item, EPS would have been $2.44 with an RoTCE of 12.5%.  
As a reminder, while we received a premium to book on the sale of the business, we did incur a pretax loss primarily related to the currency translation adjustment that is built up over time and is already included in our capital. Upon closing, the capital impact of this loss will be largely neutralized, and we will release approximately $800 million of capital allocated to the business.  
Revenues declined 1% from the prior year. Excluding the loss on sale, revenues would have been up 3%, largely driven by investment banking fees as well as strong growth in Equity Markets and Securities Services.  
Expenses were up 5% year-over-year. In constant dollars, expenses were up 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our expenses have grown by 5% with 2 main drivers: investments in the transformation including the 6 programs to address the consent orders, which drove about 3% of the growth so far this year; and business-led investments, which focus on our front office expansion in the investment bank, wealth and securities services; and investments to improve our client experience and digitize our network.  
So far this year, we added over 500 bankers, advisers and other front office support in wealth, including the private bank and the consumer wealth businesses; and 200 corporate and investment bankers globally in high-growth areas, including senior hires across tech, health care, fintech and private equity coverage. In our services businesses, TTS and Securities Services, we continue to improve client experience and digital capabilities, which is enabling us to capture significant new mandates. In consumer, these investments include development and marketing for new offerings like the Custom Cash Card and installment lending as well as investments in our mobile and digital user experience. 
In addition, there were also increases in volume and revenue-related expenses as well as business as usual expenses, which were largely offset by efficiency savings. As a reminder, we will continue to analyze our expenses to look for opportunities to self-fund investments.  
And now turning to credit. Credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of just under $1 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $1.2 billion, largely reflecting continued improvement in portfolio [ quality ]. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans were down 1% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Australia exit. Excluding this impact, loans would have been up 1% year-over-year, driven by active client engagement in TTS, Private Bank and Markets. End-of-period deposits were up 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients as well as continued momentum in client acquisition and deepening across both corporate clients and consumers. 
Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $11 billion in capital so far this year. And while we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise, we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders. 
Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year and sequentially, mainly driven by Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Securities Services. Expenses increased 9%, with about half of the increase driven by transformation and the other half driven by business-led investments and higher revenue-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs were largely benign in the quarter as minimal net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL reserve release. This resulted in net income of $3.4 billion, which grew 21% in the quarter and 60% on a year-to-date basis. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 14.5% for the quarter and 18.8% year-to-date.  
Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. On the banking side, revenues were up 11%. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, continued growth in fee revenues of 20% year-over-year, the highest quarter for fees in a decade reflected solid client engagement and client acquisition as well as a recovery in commercial card revenues. However, all of this was more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads, driving total revenues down 4%.  
We're continuing to see momentum across our payment business with 15% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearing transactions over the past year. As of quarter end, TTS loans grew 15%, mainly in trade loans where our technology investments in supply chain and deep local knowledge are enabling us to meet our clients' needs across the globe.  
Investment banking revenues were up 39% year-over-year, largely driven by M&A as we continue to see the benefits from our front office investments, which positioned us well to take advantage of increased deal activity. As Jane mentioned, this was the second best quarter for investment banking revenues and the best quarter for M&A in a decade.  
Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by growth in assets under management, loans and deposits, reflecting momentum with new and existing clients. This quarter, we added almost 200 bankers, investment counselors and other front office support and onboarded over 200 new clients. Our investments in talent continue to drive growth which bodes well for our overall strategy in wealth.  
Corporate Lending revenues were up 17%, primarily driven by lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale, partially offset by lower loan volumes. Total Markets & Securities Services revenues decreased 4% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 16%, reflecting the continued normalization in market activity across rates and spread products. However, we saw strong activity with our corporate clients, engaging with them in foreign exchange products to support their global operations and hedging solutions to assist with their risk mitigation efforts.  
Equity Markets revenues were up 40%, our second best quarter in a decade, driven by cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. This is another business where we see our investments in talent and technology paying off.  
In Securities Services, revenues were up 10%. Here, we saw strong growth in fee revenues as the investments that we've been making in our platform and product capabilities enabled us to grow revenue with both new and existing clients, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. 
Finally, looking at year-to-date results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking and Equity Markets as well as solid results in the Private Bank and Securities Services, which helped to offset the expected normalization in Fixed Income Markets. 
Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. Revenues declined 14%, and 5% excluding the loss on sale, as solid deposit growth and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances and lower deposit spreads. Expenses increased 5% with about half driven by transformation and the remainder driven by business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Cost of credit was a modest benefit this quarter as a roughly $1 billion ACL reserve release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in net income of $1.3 billion, which grew 44%. And GCB delivered a 15% RoTCE and a 21.5% ROTCE excluding the loss on sale. 
Finally, looking at year-to-date results, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers over the course of the year, with purchase sales up 5% relative to 2019 and acquisitions nearing pre-COVID levels globally. And the business delivered 22.4% ROTCE, excluding the loss on sale.  
Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Total third quarter revenues were down 4% from last year as we continue to see headwinds from higher payment rates and deposit spreads. That said, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in both cards and Retail Banking. In Branded Cards and Retail Services, purchase sales were up versus the prior year by 24% and 14% respectively, with both above 2019 levels. And in Retail Banking, average deposits and within that, checking deposits, were both up 14%. AUMs were up 16%, and Citigold households were up 13% this quarter.  
We're also making progress on our U.S. digital strategy. U.S. digital deposits grew 26% compared to the prior year and installment loan balances, including our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products, have also grown substantially, up 22% compared to the prior year. And over 80% of these loans are originated digitally. 
On Slide 9, we show results for our International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 30% year-over-year in the third quarter. Excluding the loss on sale, revenues declined 5% with a 7% decline in Latin America and a 4% decline in Asia.  
Looking at international consumer overall, we are seeing good momentum in investment management, with 10% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia. And the growth is meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 international wealth hubs. Purchase sales grew 8% versus the prior year. And average deposits grew 3%, albeit at lower deposit spreads.  
Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit remained favorable again this quarter across all regions. And given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021.  
Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased by over $300 million, driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses declined by $300 million due to the absence of the civil money penalty which we incurred in the third quarter of last year, offset by an increase in expenses related to the transformation. Credit costs were still a benefit in the quarter, but reflect a lower ACL release in the legacy portfolio relative to last year. Finally, EBIT was a loss of $330 million.  
Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as noninterest revenues on a reported basis. In the third quarter, net interest revenue of $10.4 billion declined roughly $100 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. On a year-to-date basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $2.3 billion. 
Turning to noninterest revenues on the bottom of the slide. In the third quarter, non-NIR declined by approximately $50 million year-over-year driven by the impact from the loss on the sale of the Australia consumer business. Excluding the loss, noninterest revenues would have grown by over $600 million or 9%, driven by strong growth in fees in ICG. 
On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio ticked down to 11.7%. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was largely unchanged at 5.8%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 10% year-over-year to $79.07, driven by net income. 
Before we move to Q&A, let me touch briefly on our outlook for 2021. On the top line for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis, excluding any divestiture-related impacts. 
On the expense side, we continue to expect full year expenses to be up in the mid-single-digit range, excluding any divestiture-related impacts, as we continue to transform our risk and control environment and invest in our businesses.

The second, I mentioned earlier that we saw some loan growth in cards sequentially, branded cards in particular up 3%. But also within that, we saw some of the late fees and Balcon fees in cards kind of play through. As you know, there's an extra day in the quarter. And so the combination of those things contributed to the tick up here that we've seen.
In terms of kind of the balance of the year, that all feeds into the guidance that I've given for total revenues. And that really hasn't changed, but we continue to look to invest in the cards portfolio through new acquisitions with a long-term perspective of how we grow loans over time there."

We want to ensure that we can invest in the business. And then anything in excess of that, we want to return to shareholders. So that perspective has not changed. 
Obviously, the SCB allows for us to take those decisions in the given quarter based on what we're seeing in terms of our expected performance and based on all of the other factors I mentioned, including the capital release and SACR and things of that sort. And so we'll continue to take those decisions with that philosophy in mind, which is how do we return any excess we have to shareholders over time."

We're currently serving a very large number of investors in that market, 70% of the Fortune 500 corporates in China, how they operate on the ground and gain access to China's capital market. And we're looking at -- we're very happy to have the custody license in China. It will also help support our operations in Hong Kong. And it's part of the growth of our Securities Services strategy that we've got. You've seen the benefits starting to flow through in this quarter's results from some of these previous investments. And this is just another one of the investments that we're making in that business that we like a lot and we think we're well positioned in. 
And in terms of buy now pay later, I think this is one where, obviously, we're divesting our operations in Asia on that front, but we've certainly -- we've taken the learnings from our operations throughout the Asian region and particularly been applying them to the U.S. over the last few years. So we've certainly not been sitting still in the U.S. We've been building out our personal lending platform since 2019, and that's part of our broader digitization strategy in the U.S. consumer. 
We've been seeing very strong growth in our Flex portfolios, both as we leverage some of our existing partnerships such as American Airlines. And we worked to expand with new partners in POS. And one of the areas I'm particularly excited about is the partnering that we're doing with the largest e-commerce player, Amazon, on point-of-sale lending for our cards customers. And those capabilities are and will be leveraged with many additional partners and channels in the States and into Mexico. 
And finally, we've been expanding our product suite by developing off-card lending capabilities. And I think as you've heard from Mark, our [ pay later ] installment loans to existing card customers, 88% of those total sales are in digital channels. 
So as we look at all of this, I would say clearly there's a trend towards multiple different formats of how a customer can and wants to pay. And we're really on the front foot of this and making some strong progress on the back of the investments that we've been making over the last few years, and we'll continue to do so."

Why don't I get started? And then Jane may want to jump in. And I'll start with kind of your comments related to cards.
And so look, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, particularly when you look at U.S. branded cards, we did start to see a tick up there as it relates to loan balances. The loans were up about 1% year-over-year. They were up about 3% quarter-over-quarter. 
What I think is really important here is the market reentry. Because as you're seeing, purchase sales are up but payment rates are still quite high. And we've got to see how stimulus and liquidity plays out over time. And so what we're focused on is how we're reentering into the market. And we're doing that both through our custom cash launch, which is helping to drive new acquisitions. 
In fact, our new acquisition volumes are back to 2019 levels. Over half of those acquisitions are in proprietary cards. We're being thoughtful about that. So over the last 5 years, we've been shortening our promotional periods and adding higher fees for balance transfers and targeting a lower mix of promotional balances. And those things, as you know, will feed future average interest earning balances as our experience is that roughly half of those balances ultimately convert to revolving over time. So that's an important step.
The second thing that I'll mention is just to reiterate what Jane pointed out, which is we're thinking about lending more broadly. And we're driving growth on the on-card lending products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan. And those don't have promotional periods associated with them, and they start to generate interest from day 1. 
And so we're keenly focused on this. We're obviously a big player here. It's obviously an important part of our portfolio and generates healthy returns. But we need to be positioned to capture growth as the economy continues to recover and behavior normalizes. And we need to be prepared if behavior doesn't normalize as quickly as we'd like with things like broader lending products."

So look, let me start by saying as I pointed out in the prepared remarks, our expenses in aggregate are on guidance, so to speak. Both as it relates to the transformation expected spend, which year-to-date is up 3% as well as our total expenses, which are up 5% year-to-date, again consistent with the guidance. 
As I think about this, those are 2 very important categories of spend. As Jane has pointed out, transformation is our top priority. And we're going to spend what's necessary to get that done, and we need to ensure that we're investing long term across the franchise. And so we're going to continue to do that. 
But I would also highlight that expenses is something that we control, right? So we are very deliberate about the spend that you're seeing. And in fact I'm scrubbing, we are scrubbing every single expense line that we have, right, to ensure that the dollars that we're putting to work are being put to work in an optimal fashion, that they're necessary dollars to be spent. And in doing that, we're also looking for productivity and efficiency opportunities. 
And in fact we've seen that play through the expense levels that you see today. If you look at if we -- as we look at our expenses, we've generated somewhere between $300 million and $400 million a quarter in efficiencies through 2021, right? So expense management is something that we're very disciplined about, we're very deliberate about. And we handle that in a very controlled fashion, recognizing the priorities that we've pointed out. 
I'm not going to give you guidance for 2022. I will tell you that our guidance hasn't changed for the balance of 2021. We're obviously in the middle of our budget season, right? And as we firm that up and finalize that, we'll share that with you and our investors more broadly."

If you'll bear with me for a minute, let's just take a step back and start with our compensation philosophy because I think it's really important for our shareholders to understand this. 
So the compensation of the management team is designed to be performance-based. It's aligned with the interest of our shareholders, most importantly. So first, any of the deferred awards we have, have downside built in. And we clearly saw this last year in the PSU performance, which paid out only 28% of its target. And then secondly, the annual process holds management accountable for results, as we also saw last year with meaningful comp reductions resulting from the consent orders. 
So then if we then turn to the transformation program, as I said in the opening, there isn't anything that's more important than the successful execution of the program. It's our #1 priority. We want to make sure the bank is modernizing its risk and control environment. And it will also benefit our shareholders in terms of the performance of the bank. 
The Board and I hold the senior leaders driving that transformation accountable for its successful execution. I'm certainly driving this program with urgency. And I also need to retain key talent because it's a pretty tight talent market right now, as we all know. And we need to do this so that we can hit the milestones and deliver with excellence. So to hold people accountable and drive the outcomes, we need both carrots and we need sticks. 
And to your question, we're going to put in rigorous metrics to determine if the rewards get paid out at all; and if so, what percentage will be paid out. And we laid out a criteria in the 8-K. And the final metrics will be ones that reflect input from the Board, from myself and the other stakeholders involved, and we'll make -- and those will obviously be disclosed in the proxy, et cetera. So you'll see them. 
So as you can see, I think the main message from me is there will be consequences if we fall short of what is expected, just as there were last year, for the management and the leaders of the program. I'm accountable, my team's accountable. And very simply, we must and we will deliver."

So as I -- obviously, as I said in the opening, we were disappointed in their decision, but it is just one part of our digital strategy. We certainly didn't have all the eggs in that basket as we've been talking about for a few quarters now. 
And what I am pleased is the strength of the digital engagement that we are seeing across the U.S. It's lagged other geographies around the world across the industry on this dimension, and also the growth in sticky digital deposits that we're seeing in the U.S. The piece I like is we deliberately invested in very reusable capabilities for future partnerships and existing ones that we have as well as our own proprietary efforts. 
So if I can try and make that come a bit alive. We've added 80 APIs, which really make it very easy to operate with partners. We've developed a whole suite of embedded services that are ready to deploy. That's things like real-time digital alerts, partner-branded communications. 
And probably most importantly, and maybe this is the geek in me, we put together new tech stacks, and we've learned a lot about doing this that's very valuable for what we're doing right now and for partnerships going forward. 
So at the end of the day, I think all the things that we've been doing, both in some of the work with Google, but also with partnerships around the world, is going to further our digitization strategy in U.S. consumer, continue helping us grow and drive the returns here. And I would say, we're always feeling urgency in improving the performance, the growth and returns in consumer franchises."

You obviously have -- has always had bonuses for short term; and you've had a long-term incentive comp that you've always paid your executives, similar to everybody else. 
So the transformation project seems to be over and above that. Shouldn't that be part of what long-term compensation and incentive awards are meant for? I'm trying to understand what the logic behind adding an additional payment here is, because that's what management is already being partly compensated for, which is longer-term moves and changes in performance."

And I want to make sure that there is no question from anyone involved in these -- in the programs that this is their #1 priority for the bank, to execute this with excellence, that there are both carrots and sticks here. And those come through the individual program and the individual assessments that everyone participates in every year as well as in this piece. 
So I think this is fully aligned with the shareholders' interest. You want to have management really incented to deliver this with excellence, but equally with all the downsides if we fail to do so. And the program is designed to do just that."

And as Vivek expressed, Jane and Mark, you mentioned, look, you have to serve regulators, number one. I think that's clear to everybody on this call. And then you mentioned serving stakeholders. But I think the comp question really gets to what's being done for shareholders? And shareholders have been left behind at Citigroup over almost any time frame. 
And what -- and Mark, maybe I might disagree with your philosophy a little bit. And your philosophy set is first serve clients, then invest in the business, then you do buybacks. Why should you have any change in your philosophy? It's because the discount to book value is just getting greater and greater. Your discount versus peer has increased. Citi has worst-in-class returns, adjusted efficiency and stock market valuation. So why not a little change in that philosophy to more buybacks versus investing if you have such a great opportunity with your share price? 
So what can you do from a symbolic nature, like everyone gets paid in stock? Or what can you do about the capital freed up from the sale of Australia and use all that to buy back stock? Or what can you do to show that -- obviously, regulators matter, stakeholders matter. But what can you do to sure that shareholders also matter, given such the underperformance of the share price? 
And then since you're only giving me one question at a time, just a little bit more follow-up on your U.S. consumer strategy as far as digital deposits, cross-selling to credit cards, point of sale with Amazon, a little bit more on that."

Unequivocally, our shareholders are incredibly important to us. And when we look at where we're trading and the underperformance around that, it is something that we are determined in the strategy refresh and the transformation work we're doing and in the culture and talent work we're doing to address this. We are going to do what is necessary to narrow the gap with our peers. We are going to ensure we have the right business mix and strategies to drive up the returns. And you're starting to see where that is -- where we're headed to with that from the different decisions we've already announced, and obviously, it will all come together at Investor Day. 
But secondly, we're also going to do it by running the bank better. And we've laid out on Page 3 of the presentation, what are the different priorities so that our investors realize the value that we think lies in Citi and what we are going to be doing to unlock that for their benefit. And I think -- I hope it's pretty clear in terms of the framework that we're using and the principles around that. 
And in terms of, as Mark said, from a -- not only unlocking the value that we see in Citi, which I really do think is pretty tremendous and I'm quite excited about. It's also then what will we do with our excess capital. You've heard me say it, given where we trade so disappointingly below book, obviously share repurchases make sense for our shareholders. We also do have a healthy dividend yield, but that's an important part of the mix. But there's no question around the attractiveness for a shareholder relatively of the stock buybacks. 
And we will certainly be returning excess capital to our shareholders and be very mindful of the bar that is required for investment internally. And you've seen that with the decisions that we've made on the exits in Asia on consumer and some of the other moves that we will exit the businesses we think are lower returning and reinvest where we -- where appropriate that we'll return that to shareholders. And I can see my CFO is chomping at the bit here to jump in as well."

I just -- I think you answered it very well. I'd just add a couple of quick things. 
One, that when we invest in the business towards clients or more broadly in the business, we're doing it where returns are above our cost of capital. So we're making smart decisions about how to redeploy that capital to ensure that we're narrowing that gap to peers.
The second thing I'd point out is that in the first couple of quarters of the year, we've maxed out the capital return that was available for us to deliver before the SCB came into play. And that is because our shareholders are so important. 
And then the third, as Jane mentioned, is that we have a skew towards buybacks, again just given where the stock is trading and given where our dividend yield is. So thank you for the question."

So I'm pretty pleased around our opportunities here because we have all the pieces to be very successful. We have a strong brand in amongst the affluent, not just here in the States of our Retail Banking franchise. We've got a very we've got a pretty heavily affluent base, but around the world. And when you go into Asia in particular, this is the aspirational wealth management brand on the ground there. 
We've also got real breadth of client relationships, and this is where the connectivity points also become important in those 4 principles that we laid out under the strategy refresh. We have commercial banking operations in 30 geographies around the world that have been operating for many years now. This is the engine of wealth creation in the world, and we have the relationship with the owners already. 
And so the synergies that we will be able to generate by much more closely connecting them will be very important. Similarly, the elevator from the affluent client base in our consumer franchise all the way up to the ultra-high net worth in the Private Bank is obviously a natural area to build out that we haven't really invested in that elevator and thinking of it that way. 
We have some great platforms. Our institutional client business around the world means that we've got top 2 platforms for our private banking clients in particular to take advantage of, but it's also ones that our consumer clients have as well. So the opportunity here is bring all these different pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients in the U.S. and in the global offshore wealth centers. 
And I would also point to the fact that we're already the top 3 player in Asia. It's not as if we don't have scale and that this is a start-up business here. And we've already seen that this is coming into fruition quickly, we obviously announced the focus on wealth at the beginning of the year. We've already acquired 21,500 new-to-bank clients in Asia this year -- so far this year. We've added over 500 bankers, advisers and other front office support year-to-date. We've done one of the biggest tech releases for wealth in the third quarter of this year, with over 70-plus features going live on the back of the digital platform we launched last quarter. 
So I think the fact that we've got all these different pieces, we're putting them all together is really giving us momentum and accelerating the opportunity for us. And this is a trend, the wealth trend is going to be one that's one of those unstoppable trends, particularly in Asia in the years ahead. 
We'll look at acquisitions at the moment. Obviously, it's more focused around what are digital capabilities, what are other things to enhance the value propositions and the technological side. And those aren't just acquisitions, it's partnerships and the like that we've been investing in, so that we really serve the wealthy client across the full spectrum of their needs rather than just narrowly as some of the other players are in just the sort of investment products. We've got the benefit across the board."
