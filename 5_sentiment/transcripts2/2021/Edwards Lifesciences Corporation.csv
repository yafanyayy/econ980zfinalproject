411220,698698471,2182945,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Before we discuss fourth quarter results and our expectations for 2021 and beyond, I want to spend a minute reflecting on 2020. Structural heart patients were severely impacted beginning in March experiencing significant difficulties ente",2258,"Thank you, Mark. Before we discuss fourth quarter results and our expectations for 2021 and beyond, I want to spend a minute reflecting on 2020. Structural heart patients were severely impacted beginning in March experiencing significant difficulties entering the system, which also had a profound impact on second quarter procedures. And even though health care systems adapted to the challenge, the resurgence of COVID, that began late in the year, continues to impact structural heart patients who need care. 
Despite unprecedented challenges throughout the year, I'm proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient-focused strategy. We continue to invest in developing solutions that extend lives, improve the quality of life and offer greater value for the health care system. 
Along those lines, we celebrated some exciting milestones in 2020 that directly impacted patients. In TAVR, despite headwinds, more than 100,000 patients benefited from treatment with SAPIEN valves worldwide. In Surgical Structural Heart, we launched our KONECT aortic valve conduit, and INSPIRIS became the leading aortic surgical valve worldwide. We've seen early positive clinical evidence across the TMTT platform. Physician feedback is encouraging, and patient outcomes have been distinguished. And in Critical Care, we met the increased demand for core pressure monitoring products due to the pandemic, and we're proud that we are able to help over 1 million COVID patients globally with our monitoring technology. 
To support our innovation and growth, we continued to invest in our people and our infrastructure. During a year when job losses impacted many families across the globe, Edwards prioritized protecting our employees, and we grew our team to 15,000 worldwide. We continue to make strategic R&D investments that enabled us to fuel progress. And despite this unique environment and extraordinary prior year growth, underlying sales grew 1% in 2020 to $4.4 billion, which is a reflection of the life-threatening needs of the patients that Edwards serves. 
Looking into 2021, while we expect the pandemic to continue to impact the global health care system, we remain optimistic about the year ahead. As we indicated at our investor conference, we expect full year sales between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion, representing mid-teens underlying growth on a year-over-year basis. Based on our year-to-date experience, we expect Q1 sales to be slightly down sequentially, although in line with the first quarter of last year, which was largely unaffected by COVID. 
Our 2021 guidance continues to assume COVID will stress the global health care system at least through the winter months with procedures ramping later in the year. This expectation assumes that vaccines are effective and widely administered by midyear 2021 and hospitals continue to improve their ability to treat non-COVID patients who need care for conditions such as aortic stenosis. And even though we expect the COVID impact on sales at the start of the year, we are continuing to invest now in our innovations that have the tremendous opportunity to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the health care system. 
We recognize the uncertain impact and time frame for recovery from this unique global challenge, but we remain confident that our patient-focused strategy of continued investment positions us well and even stronger when the world emerges from the pandemic. 
Now turning to our quarterly results. Consistent with our guidance at our investor conference last month, fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion were in line with the year ago period when Edwards grew nearly 20% on an underlying basis reflecting the strength even during the ongoing pandemic. Full year 2020 global sales -- global TAVR sales of $2.9 billion increased 4% on an underlying basis over the prior year. 2020 growth reflected increased sales in every region, lifted by greater awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy and increased adoption of our leading technologies. 
Based on the strength of the SAPIEN platform, we retained our strong leadership position while also maintaining our disciplined price strategy. In the fourth quarter, global TAVR sales were $776 million, up slightly from the year ago period. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. And globally, average selling prices were stable. 
Although the rollout was somewhat impacted, SAPIEN 3 Ultra now represents more than 2/3 of our global TAVR sales, and physician feedback on ease-of-use and improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. In the U.S., our Q4 TAVR sales were approximately level with the third quarter and declined in the mid-single-digit range versus last year. We estimate overall Q4 U.S. procedures declined at a comparable rate. Recall that our U.S. TAVR sales in the year ago period increased nearly 40%, driven by the strong PARTNER III evidence that led to a third quarter 2019 indication expansion and improved patient access under an updated TAVR NCD. We expect these factors to resume lifting treatment rates as the pandemic subsides. 
Growth at smaller TAVR centers, which are providing local access to aortic stenosis patients was more than offset by declines in larger accounts where referrals have been disrupted by the resurgence of COVID. Outside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, we estimated total TAVR procedures grew in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis, and Edwards' growth was comparable. Edwards underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single-digit range. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was more pronounced in countries that were more severely impacted by the first wave of COVID in 2020. 
Outside of the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see very good TAVR adoption in the fourth quarter. Sales growth in Japan, Australia and Korea were strong where therapy adoption is still low. In Japan, we continue to anticipate providing SAPIEN 3 for low-risk patients prior to the end of this year. In China, which was a minor contributor to Q4 sales, we remain focused on growing our dedicated clinical support team to assist leading hospitals as they build their TAVR programs. 
In addition to geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion. We talked at our recent investor conference about our EARLY-TAVR Trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic patients. Enrollment is now 2/3 complete, and we remain optimistic that the trial will be fully enrolled in 2021. 
Separately, we continue to plan to initiate an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to determine the optimal time to treat patients who have this progressive disease. We believe that some patients may benefit from earlier treatment when they have moderate AS rather than risking irreversible damage as the disease progresses. We're optimistic about the potential of this trial, and we anticipate FDA approval to begin enrollment this year. 
In November 2020, we were pleased that the American Heart Association announced the launch of an initiative called Target: Aortic Stenosis, a quality improvement program aimed to develop optimal standards of care. The program features a learning collaborative comprised of experts and volunteers from pilot hospital locations around the nation. AHA noticed that if left untreated, the condition worsens. And patients with severe aortic stenosis have a survival rate as low as 50% at 2 years. 
Aortic stenosis is also a risk factor for heart failure, a costly disease projected to cost the U.S. health care system $70 billion in 2030. 
In summary, we continue to anticipate 2021 underlying TAVR sales growth in the 15% to 20% range as we shared at our investor conference. We expect continuing COVID-related challenges early in 2021, turning to a more normalized growth environment in the second half of the year. We remain confident this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. 
Turning to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies, or TMTT. We've made meaningful progress moving from early-stage development to clinical use across all of our platforms with over 3,000 patients treated to date. To transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity, we remain focused on 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. 
In Europe, PASCAL leaflet repair continues to deliver excellent results. In Q4, we continued the introduction of PASCAL ACE for mitral and tricuspid patients. And we're pleased with the early real-world results and positive physician feedback regarding its differentiated features and narrower profile. We plan to make both PASCAL ACE and PASCAL available on a single next-generation platform called the PASCAL Precision System. This new system is designed to elevate the user experience with enhanced maneuverability, navigation and stability, enabling improved procedural precision. 
From a clinical perspective, in this challenging near-term environment, we are experiencing a negative impact to clinical trial enrollment. However, our team and research partners are highly motivated to build on the differentiated data presented in 2020 and expand our body of clinical evidence in this exciting field. We will look forward to presenting meaningful follow-up data across our portfolio at medical meetings later this year. 
We progressed in the enrollment of our 3 CLASP pivotal studies. We also received approval for use of the Edwards PASCAL Precision System in these pivotal studies. The company still expects U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. 
We continue enrolling SAPIEN M3 pivotal study, ENCIRCLE, designed to demonstrate strong safety and efficacy for transcatheter mitral replacement. And we're on track to initiate our first clinical experience with our next-generation EVOQUE mitral replacement system. The EVOQUE tricuspid replacement study, TRISCEND, continued to enroll in Q4. And we're on track to initiate the TRISCEND II randomized pivotal study based on FDA's breakthrough pathway designation. We look forward to bringing this important treatment option to more patients that are in significant need. 
Turning to recent news. We commend CMS for ensuring mitral valve disease patients have improved access to therapy options through the updated NCD. This update, which includes coverage with evidence development, achieves the balance of patient access with high-quality outcomes. 
Fourth quarter global sales were $13 million, representing sequential improvement versus Q3. Full year 2020 sales were $42 million. We expect continuing COVID-related challenges early in 2021, but we anticipate a ramp-up through the rest of the year. We maintain our belief that the total TMTT sales will approximately double in 2021. We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach $3 billion by 2025, with significant growth beyond. We remain committed to transforming the treatment of these patients and believe our portfolio strategy positions us well for ultimate leadership. 
In Surgical Structural Heart, full year 2020 global sales of $762 million decreased 10% on an underlying basis over the prior year, in line of our guidance -- with our guidance of 5% to 15% decline. Fourth quarter sales of $204 million held steady with Q3 and declined 2% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was below our previous expectation for positive growth. 
Over the course of the quarter, hospitals experienced an influx of COVID patients limiting surgical procedures. Despite this impact, we are encouraged that the U.S. achieved positive growth in Q4 driven by adoption of our newest premium technologies. 
We remain very encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards premium RESILIA tissue valves, including the INSPIRIS aortic surgical valve and the recently launched KONECT aortic valve conduit. In the fourth quarter, INSPIRIS valve utilization grew in all regions, and we continue to add new centers. 
Sales in the U.S. are ramping for KONECT, the first preassembled ready to implant aortic tissue valve conduit for patients who require replacement of the aortic valve, root and ascending aorta, which is a critical unmet patient need. 
We continue to focus on comprehensive physician training and robust data collection for the HARPOON beating heart mitral valve repair system. We are seeing favorable patient outcomes with faster surgery and recovery times with this minimally invasive therapy. The U.S. pivotal trial is now underway, and the first patient was treated in December. 
In summary, we expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our newest technologies. After a challenging start, we expect improving year-over-year comparisons as we progress through the year. We are excited by our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our global leadership in premium surgical structural heart technologies. We believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structural Heart opportunity will grow mid-single digits through 2026. 
In Critical Care, full year 2020 global sales of $725 million decreased 3% on an underlying basis versus the prior year, in line with our guidance of flat to down 5%. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $198 million decreased 2% on an underlying basis, driven by the decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as hospitals limited their capital spending. Sales of our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU were lifted by the increased COVID hospitalizations late in the fourth quarter in both the U.S. and Europe. Demand for our products used in more intense surgeries remained strong, but were more than offset by the impact of delayed elective procedures. 
In summary, we expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for critical care. We remain excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. 
Now I'll ask Scott to provide some more detail on the company's financial results."

Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2020 including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021. Despite the wave of COVID that began during the fourt",804,"Hey. Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2020 including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021. 
Despite the wave of COVID that began during the fourth quarter, we are pleased that we were able to achieve our sales guidance ranges across all product lines. Sales in the fourth quarter were flat year-over-year on an underlying basis, and adjusted earnings per share grew 2% to $0.50 versus the prior year. GAAP earnings per share was similar at $0.49. For the full year 2020, sales increased 1% on an underlying basis to $4.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was flat at $1.86, and we generated over $700 million of adjusted free cash flow. 
During 2020, we achieved cost efficiencies, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy. 
I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2021. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.3% compared to 75.8% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding to COVID partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Our rate should be lifted by an improved product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $339 million or 28.4% of sales compared to $347 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced spending resulting from COVID and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by the impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%, which is similar to pre-COVID levels. 
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 1% to $196 million or 16.4% of sales. This small increase was primarily the result of higher investments in TMTT and costs associated with discontinuing our SUTRAFIX program, partially offset by reduced performance-based compensation. 
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT including enrolling 7 clinical trials. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1% or 13.9%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 350 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. Our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items, was 12.5%. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. 
Foreign exchange rates increased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 150 basis points or $18 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million positive impact or about 2% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $287 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $400 million less capital spending of $113 million. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and investments as of the end of the year. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit of up to $1 billion. We have public bonds outstanding of about $600 million that don't mature until 2028. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were 632 million, relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We now expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635 million. 
So before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with financial guidance for 2021. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. For TAVR, we expect sales of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. For TMTT, we expect sales of approximately $80 million. We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $800 million to $900 million and Critical Care sales of $725 million to $800 million. 
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2 to $2.20. For the first quarter of 2021, we project total sales to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.50. 
And so with that, I'll pass it back to Mike."

So if we could actually develop a great solution for them, it's going to be an important deal. They don't have great answers. And so the burden is going to be on us to develop great solutions and to create evidence that we are actually doing that. We have a high level of confidence that we can do it. Of course, mitral is going to be bigger here in the near term. It's got an earlier start, but we think there's a lot of potential in this. 
The patients themselves are very diverse. And that's why we think when it's all done for tricuspid patients, it's going to require a portfolio."

And so although there were delays, I don't know if it's fair to characterize it as an 18-month delay, David, I think that's probably overstating it to some extent. I think we talked when we said what happened in 2020, for example, in some of the TMTT trials, it certainly cost us a couple of quarters, and now we're seeing it a little slow again. But our team really feels, through conversations with researchers, that it's going to come back. 
When you're trying to develop real new opportunities like TMTT or expand indications in TAVR like early TAVR in moderate AS, those are heavy lifts that take long-term commitment, and we're getting really nice participation in cooperation with FDA. So it's going to get done. It just is a bit of a headwind right now."

So having said that, when these centers slow down, yes, they also slow down qualifying patients. So it takes a while for that pipeline to refill. So that is -- that's legitimate. But then again, when we gave our estimates, we've taken that into account.

So we've got now multiple production facilities around the world. We've recently gotten a lot further along and are almost completed with Costa Rica. We've broken ground on a new facility in Ireland. And as the company continues to grow, we'll continue to in a disciplined fashion, invest capital to support that growth on the production side. 
As it relates to M&A, we're very active on the business development front. And we are continually looking for external growth opportunities. As you know, most of these are typically small. We usually buy pre-revenue companies or technologies or we'll make investments in companies or buy options to acquire companies based upon how they perform in development efforts. And so those activities will continue. We've got this -- we've got a good problem to have, which is we continue to generate net cash, and that's why we've got over $2 billion now on the balance sheet. And so we think carefully about how to do that, and we think carefully about how to manage the share count.

So going back to the large centers versus small centers. First of all, this was simply an observation on our part. If we looked at our largest centers versus our smaller centers, the smallest centers grew faster in the fourth quarter than the largest centers. So now why is that? Well, now we start speculating to some extent because we really don't have that clear a picture. It's just the fact of how that happened. 
Part of what we have heard anecdotally is that the large centers will often prove -- a matter of fact, attract patients, let's say, from a multistate area, whereas a small center might only attract patients in their local area. And given COVID being what it is, are these elderly patients willing to travel long distances to a referral center? We wonder and we hear from others, they speculate that that's the reason. So again, you can take that for what it's worth, but that's probably the best answer that we have on that one. 
The -- in terms of the centers that are adopters, how does it compare? We feel really good about the outcomes. We've been doing a lot of work in Europe trying to help people have outstanding outcomes. And so clinicians have experience with PASCAL, and many of those experiences have -- many of those clinicians also have experience with the MitraClip system. We have both PASCAL and PASCAL ACE, so they have options in terms of what they might use. And I think it's a patient-specific decision that clinicians are making at this point of what they think might be best for their patients. 
It's still early. Our data by comparison is still relatively light, although we're proud that we have 3,000 patients that were treated last year, and most of those are with PASCAL. So we're starting to get some pretty good experience. But it's still -- there is some time before this plays out."

411220,698698471,2183066,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Before we discuss fourth quarter results and our expectations for 2021 and beyond, I want to spend a minute reflecting on 2020.

Before we discuss fourth quarter results and our expectations for 2021 and beyond, I want to spend a minute reflecting on 2020. Structural heart patients were severely impacted beginning in March, experiencing significant difficulties entering the system, which also had a profound impact on second quarter procedures. And even though health care systems adapted to the challenge, the resurgence of COVID that began late in the year continues to impact structural heart patients who need care.  
Despite unprecedented challenges throughout the year, I'm proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient-focused strategy. We continue to invest in developing solutions that extend lives, improve the quality of life and offer greater value for the health care system.  
Along those lines, we celebrated some exciting milestones in 2020 that directly impacted patients. In TAVR, despite headwinds, more than 100,000 patients benefited from treatment with SAPIEN valves worldwide. In Surgical Structural Heart, we launched our KONECT aortic valve conduit, and INSPIRIS became the leading aortic surgical valve worldwide. We've seen early positive clinical evidence across the TMTT platform. Physician feedback is encouraging, and patient outcomes have been distinguished. And in Critical Care, we met the increased demand for core pressure monitoring products due to the pandemic, and we're proud that we are able to help over 1 million COVID patients globally with our monitoring technology.  
To support our innovation and growth, we continued to invest in our people and our infrastructure. During a year when job losses impacted many families across the globe, Edwards prioritized protecting our employees, and we grew our team to 15,000 worldwide. We continue to make strategic R&D investments that enabled us to fuel progress. And despite this unique environment and extraordinary prior year growth, underlying sales grew 1% in 2020 to $4.4 billion, which is a reflection of the life-threatening needs of the patients that Edwards serves.  
Looking into 2021, while we expect the pandemic to continue to impact the global health care system, we remain optimistic about the year ahead. As we indicated at our investor conference, we expect full year sales between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion, representing mid-teens underlying growth on a year-over-year basis. Based on our year-to-date experience, we expect Q1 sales to be slightly down sequentially, although in line with the first quarter of last year, which was largely unaffected by COVID.  
Our 2021 guidance continues to assume COVID will stress the global health care system at least through the winter months with procedures ramping later in the year. This expectation assumes that vaccines are effective and widely administered by midyear 2021 and hospitals continue to improve their ability to treat non-COVID patients who need care for conditions such as aortic stenosis. And even though we expect the COVID impact on sales at the start of the year, we are continuing to invest now in our innovations that have the tremendous opportunity to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the health care system.
We recognize the uncertain impact and time frame for recovery from this unique global challenge, but we remain confident that our patient-focused strategy of continued investment positions us well and even stronger when the world emerges from the pandemic.  
Now turning to our quarterly results. Consistent with our guidance at our investor conference last month, fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion were in line with the year ago period when Edwards grew nearly 20% on an underlying basis reflecting the strength even during the ongoing pandemic. Full year 2020 global sales -- global TAVR sales of $2.9 billion increased 4% on an underlying basis over the prior year. 2020 growth reflected increased sales in every region, lifted by greater awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy and increased adoption of our leading technologies.  
Based on the strength of the SAPIEN platform, we retained our strong leadership position while also maintaining our disciplined price strategy. In the fourth quarter, global TAVR sales were $776 million, up slightly from the year ago period. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. And globally, average selling prices were stable.  
Although the rollout was somewhat impacted, SAPIEN 3 Ultra now represents more than 2/3 of our global TAVR sales, and physician feedback on ease-of-use and improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. In the U.S., our Q4 TAVR sales were approximately level with the third quarter and declined in the mid-single-digit range versus last year. We estimate overall Q4 U.S. procedures declined at a comparable rate. Recall that our U.S. TAVR sales in the year ago period increased nearly 40%, driven by the strong PARTNER III evidence that led to a third quarter 2019 indication expansion and improved patient access under an updated TAVR NCD. We expect these factors to resume lifting treatment rates as the pandemic subsides.  
Growth at smaller TAVR centers, which are providing local access to aortic stenosis patients was more than offset by declines in larger accounts where referrals have been disrupted by the resurgence of COVID. Outside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, we estimated total TAVR procedures grew in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis, and Edwards' growth was comparable. Edwards underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single-digit range. Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was more pronounced in countries that were more severely impacted by the first wave of COVID in 2020.  
Outside of the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see very good TAVR adoption in the fourth quarter. Sales growth in Japan, Australia and Korea were strong where therapy adoption is still low. In Japan, we continue to anticipate providing SAPIEN 3 for low-risk patients prior to the end of this year. In China, which was a minor contributor to Q4 sales, we remain focused on growing our dedicated clinical support team to assist leading hospitals as they build their TAVR programs.  
In addition to geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion. We talked at our recent investor conference about our EARLY-TAVR Trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic patients. Enrollment is now 2/3 complete, and we remain optimistic that the trial will be fully enrolled in 2021.  
Separately, we continue to plan to initiate an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to determine the optimal time to treat patients who have this progressive disease. We believe that some patients may benefit from earlier treatment when they have moderate AS rather than risking irreversible damage as the disease progresses. We're optimistic about the potential of this trial, and we anticipate FDA approval to begin enrollment this year.  
In November 2020, we were pleased that the American Heart Association announced the launch of an initiative called Target: Aortic Stenosis, a quality improvement program aimed to develop optimal standards of care. The program features a learning collaborative comprised of experts and volunteers from pilot hospital locations around the nation. AHA noticed that if left untreated, the condition worsens, and patients with severe aortic stenosis have a survival rate as low as 50% at 2 years. Aortic stenosis is also a risk factor for heart failure, a costly disease projected to cost the U.S. health care system $70 billion in 2030.  
In summary, we continue to anticipate 2021 underlying TAVR sales growth in the 15% to 20% range as we shared at our investor conference. We expect continuing COVID-related challenges early in 2021, turning to a more normalized growth environment in the second half of the year. We remain confident this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.  
Turning to transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies, or TMTT. We've made meaningful progress moving from early-stage development to clinical use across all of our platforms with over 3,000 patients treated to date. To transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity, we remain focused on 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes.  
In Europe, PASCAL leaflet repair continues to deliver excellent results. In Q4, we continued the introduction of PASCAL ACE for mitral and tricuspid patients, and we're pleased with the early real-world results and positive physician feedback regarding its differentiated features and narrower profile. We plan to make both PASCAL ACE and PASCAL available on a single next-generation platform called the PASCAL Precision System. This new system is designed to elevate the user experience with enhanced maneuverability, navigation and stability, enabling improved procedural precision.  
From a clinical perspective, in this challenging near-term environment, we are experiencing a negative impact to clinical trial enrollment. However, our team and research partners are highly motivated to build on the differentiated data presented in 2020 and expand our body of clinical evidence in this exciting field. We will look forward to presenting meaningful follow-up data across our portfolio at medical meetings later this year.  
We progressed in the enrollment of our 3 CLASP pivotal studies. We also received approval for use of the Edwards PASCAL Precision System in these pivotal studies. The company still expects U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. We continue enrolling SAPIEN M3 pivotal study, ENCIRCLE, designed to demonstrate strong safety and efficacy for transcatheter mitral replacement, and we're on track to initiate our first clinical experience with our next-generation EVOQUE mitral replacement system. The EVOQUE tricuspid replacement study, TRISCEND, continued to enroll in Q4, and we're on track to initiate the TRISCEND II randomized pivotal study based on FDA's breakthrough pathway designation. We look forward to bringing this important treatment option to more patients that are in significant need.  
Turning to recent news. We commend CMS for ensuring mitral valve disease patients have improved access to therapy options through the updated NCD. This update, which includes coverage with evidence development, achieves the balance of patient access with high-quality outcomes.  
Fourth quarter global sales were $13 million, representing sequential improvement versus Q3. Full year 2020 sales were $42 million. We expect continuing COVID-related challenges early in 2021, but we anticipate a ramp-up through the rest of the year. We maintain our belief that the total TMTT sales will approximately double in 2021. We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach $3 billion by 2025, with significant growth beyond. We remain committed to transforming the treatment of these patients and believe our portfolio strategy positions us well for ultimate leadership.  
In Surgical Structural Heart, full year 2020 global sales of $762 million decreased 10% on an underlying basis over the prior year, in line of our guidance -- with our guidance of 5% to 15% decline. Fourth quarter sales of $204 million held steady with Q3 and declined 2% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was below our previous expectation for positive growth.  
Over the course of the quarter, hospitals experienced an influx of COVID patients limiting surgical procedures. Despite this impact, we are encouraged that the U.S. achieved positive growth in Q4 driven by adoption of our newest premium technologies. We remain very encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards premium RESILIA tissue valves, including the INSPIRIS aortic surgical valve and the recently launched KONECT aortic valve conduit. In the fourth quarter, INSPIRIS valve utilization grew in all regions, and we continue to add new centers.  
Sales in the U.S. are ramping for KONECT, the first preassembled ready-to-implant aortic tissue valve conduit for patients who require replacement of the aortic valve, root and ascending aorta, which is a critical unmet patient need. We continue to focus on comprehensive physician training and robust data collection for the HARPOON beating heart mitral valve repair system. We are seeing favorable patient outcomes, with faster surgery and recovery times with this minimally invasive therapy. The U.S. pivotal trial is now underway, and the first patient was treated in December.  
In summary, we expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our newest technologies. After a challenging start, we expect improving year-over-year comparisons as we progress through the year. We are excited by our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our global leadership in premium surgical structural heart technologies. We believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structural Heart opportunity will grow mid-single digits through 2026.  
In Critical Care, full year 2020 global sales of $725 million decreased 3% on an underlying basis versus the prior year, in line with our guidance of flat to down 5%. Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $198 million decreased 2% on an underlying basis, driven by the decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S. as hospitals limited their capital spending. Sales of our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU were lifted by the increased COVID hospitalizations late in the fourth quarter in both the U.S. and Europe. Demand for our products used in more intense surgeries remained strong, but were more than offset by the impact of delayed elective procedures.  
In summary, we expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for critical care. We remain excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients.  
Now I'll ask Scott to provide some more detail on the company's financial results."
411220,698698471,2183066,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Hey. Thanks a lot, Mike. Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2020 including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021.  Despite the wave of COVID that began during the fo",804,"Hey. Thanks a lot, Mike. 
Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2020 including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021.  
Despite the wave of COVID that began during the fourth quarter, we are pleased that we were able to achieve our sales guidance ranges across all product lines. Sales in the fourth quarter were flat year-over-year on an underlying basis, and adjusted earnings per share grew 2% to $0.50 versus the prior year. GAAP earnings per share was similar at $0.49. For the full year 2020, sales increased 1% on an underlying basis to $4.4 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was flat at $1.86, and we generated over $700 million of adjusted free cash flow.  
During 2020, we achieved cost efficiencies, but we intentionally did not take any actions to significantly impact our employees or reduce investments supporting our long-term strategy.  
I'll now cover the details of our results and then discuss guidance for 2021. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.3% compared to 75.8% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding to COVID partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Our rate should be lifted by an improved product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $339 million or 28.4% of sales compared to $347 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by reduced spending resulting from COVID and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by the impact from foreign exchange. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%, which is similar to pre-COVID levels.  
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 1% to $196 million or 16.4% of sales. This small increase was primarily the result of higher investments in TMTT and costs associated with discontinuing our SUTRAFIX program, partially offset by reduced performance-based compensation.  
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT including enrolling 7 clinical trials.  
Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1% or 13.9%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 350 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. Our full year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items, was 12.5%. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.  
Foreign exchange rates increased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 150 basis points or $18 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million positive impact or about 2% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year.  
Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $287 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $400 million less capital spending of $113 million.  
Now turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and investments as of the end of the year. In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit of up to $1 billion. We have public bonds outstanding of about $600 million that don't mature until 2028. Average shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were 632 million, relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We now expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635 million.  
So before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with financial guidance for 2021. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. For TAVR, we expect sales of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. For TMTT, we expect sales of approximately $80 million. We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $800 million to $900 million and Critical Care sales of $725 million to $800 million.  
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2 to $2.20. For the first quarter of 2021, we project total sales to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.50.  
And so with that, I'll pass it back to Mike."

So would love your thoughts on that market and how quickly you think that could develop and what hurdles might be."

And we've talked about the fact that, that patient group is greatly underserved. So in terms of people actually getting procedures, you're talking about 1%, 2%, 3%, very low numbers. 
So if we could actually develop a great solution for them, it's going to be an important deal. They don't have great answers, and so the burden is going to be on us to develop great solutions and to create evidence that we are actually doing that. We have a high level of confidence that we can do it. Of course, mitral is going to be bigger here in the near term. It's got an earlier start, but we think there's a lot of potential in this. 
The patients themselves are very diverse. And that's why we think when it's all done for tricuspid patients, it's going to require a portfolio."

Yes, is it maybe slightly weaker than it was when we gave the guidance at the investor conference. Yes, maybe, but we're still very much in the range."

And then related is just figuring it benefits the incumbent for all the companies that are trying to get into this marketplace.

And so although there were delays, I don't know if it's fair to characterize it as an 18-month delay, David. I think that's probably overstating it to some extent. I think we talked when we said what happened in 2020, for example, in some of the TMTT trials, it certainly cost us a couple of quarters, and now we're seeing it a little slow again. But our team really feels, through conversations with researchers, that it's going to come back. 
When you're trying to develop real new opportunities like TMTT or expand indications in TAVR like early TAVR in moderate AS, those are heavy lifts that take long-term commitment, and we're getting really nice participation in cooperation with FDA. So it's going to get done. It just is a bit of a headwind right now."

So having said that, when these centers slow down, yes, they also slow down qualifying patients. So it takes a while for that pipeline to refill. So that is -- that's legitimate. But then again, when we gave our estimates, we've taken that into account.

So -- but having said that, all the dates that we gave you anticipated what's going on. We would give you new dates if we didn't think that we could achieve those. So yes, it's at a tough time right now. Yes, it is. But do we think that there's going to be a recovery? There's a lot of interest amongst the clinical researchers to get back at it. And really, they're enthusiastic about it as we are, and so we think that we're going to get after it pretty hard when it opens back up again."

So our focus and our priorities for use of cash haven't really changed. The first one, of course, is making sure that we've got sufficient cash to invest in internal growth opportunities, and that includes building out our plant infrastructure. So we've got now multiple production facilities around the world. We've recently gotten a lot further along and are almost completed with Costa Rica. We've broken ground on a new facility in Ireland. And as the company continues to grow, we'll continue to in a disciplined fashion, invest capital to support that growth on the production side. 
As it relates to M&A, we're very active on the business development front, and we are continually looking for external growth opportunities. As you know, most of these are typically small. We usually buy pre-revenue companies or technologies or we'll make investments in companies or buy options to acquire companies based upon how they perform in development efforts. And so those activities will continue. We've got this -- we've got a good problem to have, which is we continue to generate net cash, and that's why we've got over $2 billion now on the balance sheet. 
And so we think carefully about how to do that, and we think carefully about how to manage the share count. And for the time being and for the foreseeable future, our preferred means of returning capital to shareholders will be through continued share repurchase. And we've got over $600 million of share repurchase authorization left."

So going back to the large centers versus small centers. First of all, this was simply an observation on our part. If we looked at our largest centers versus our smaller centers, the smallest centers grew faster in the fourth quarter than the largest centers. So now why is that? Well, now we start speculating to some extent because we really don't have that clear a picture. It's just the fact of how that happened. 
Part of what we have heard anecdotally is that the large centers will often prove -- a matter of fact, attract patients, let's say, from a multistate area, whereas a small center might only attract patients in their local area. And given COVID being what it is, are these elderly patients willing to travel long distances to a referral center? We wonder and we hear from others, they speculate that that's the reason. So again, you can take that for what it's worth, but that's probably the best answer that we have on that one. 
The -- in terms of the centers that are adopters, how does it compare? We feel really good about the outcomes. We've been doing a lot of work in Europe trying to help people have outstanding outcomes. And so clinicians have experience with PASCAL, and many of those experiences have -- many of those clinicians also have experience with the MitraClip system. We have both PASCAL and PASCAL ACE, so they have options in terms of what they might use. And I think it's a patient-specific decision that clinicians are making at this point of what they think might be best for their patients. 
It's still early. Our data by comparison is still relatively light. Although we're proud that we have 3,000 patients that were treated last year, and most of those are with PASCAL. So we're starting to get some pretty good experience. But it's still -- there is some time before this plays out."

As we anniversary our 1-year impact of the pandemic on our financial results, I'd like to briefly reflect on the current environment and to discuss our 2021 and longer-term priorities as a company. I'd also like to touch on Edwards' response to the pandemic and our efforts to better support our patients, employees in the community. 
Recall that our sales were dramatically impacted in the last few weeks of Q1 2020 as procedures fell due to COVID disruptions. One year later after an extraordinarily difficult global crisis, I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery and although we recognize that many people are still struggling around the world. Our sales growth this quarter was better than expected across all product lines. Although we expect the pandemic will impact the global health care system, based on the environment as we exited the quarter, we have continued confidence in our positive 2021 outlook. We continue to believe that 2021 will be an important growth year for Edwards with mid-teen sales growth, highlighting the importance of treating structural heart patients, even during this pandemic. 
We also anticipate meaningful progress on expanding large underappreciated and underserved transcatheter opportunities in 2021. Recently, we achieved several important milestones. Let me mention 4. Just last week, in transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR, we received approval to initiate a pivotal trial for patients suffering from moderate aortic stenosis. Also, earlier this month, we received approval to begin treating patients at low surgical risk in Japan with SAPIEN 3. And in transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies or TMTT, I'm pleased to announce that the first patients were recently treated with EVOQUE Eos, our next-generation transcatheter mitral replacement system. Also in TMTT, we initiated the TRISCEND II U.S. pivotal trial for transcatheter tricuspid replacement. 
Looking beyond 2021, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative therapies. Our patient-focused culture drives us and motivates our employees around the world every day. Our R&D targets breakthrough therapies that can create significant value for patients and health systems, enabling strong organic sales growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Despite COVID disruptions, we've continued to invest aggressively for future growth. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our research and development investments today are focused on generating a robust body of guideline changing clinical evidence. And although clinical studies slowed during the pandemic, our dedicated clinician partners are eager to accelerate enrollment in this important research. Regulators have also been supported in addressing the impact of the pandemic and its impact on clinical studies. 
Finally, I want to provide some perspective on how we've maintained our focus on creating long-term value as we navigated the pandemic over the last year. We continue to invest in our people and our infrastructure. During a time when widespread uncertainty impacted many families across the globe, we have prioritized protecting our employees and have grown our team. We enhanced employee benefits, rewarded performance and protected incentives. We also moved ahead on expanding Edwards' research and production facilities around the world. We adjusted our agreements to support hospitals as they navigated COVID. And additionally, we provided extra support to the communities where our employees live and work. In fact, we recently converted one of our facilities into a mass COVID vaccination site to support the community of 3 million people where our company is headquartered. As a company, we expect that Edwards will be positioned even stronger and be able to help more patients than ever before as the world emerges from the pandemic. 
Now turning to our first quarter results. We reported $1.2 billion in sales this quarter, up 5% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Recall that our guidance assumed Q1 sales would be in line with the first quarter of last year, which was largely unaffected by COVID. We were pleased with how sales improved as the quarter progressed. In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $792 million, up 4% on an underlying basis. The SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform remains differentiated with low complication rates, ease-of-use and significant potential for length of stay efficiency. Our average selling prices were stable and we estimated that global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. 
In the U.S., our Q1 TAVR sales were flat with fourth quarter and year ago results, and we estimate that overall U.S. procedure growth was comparable. Consistent with our guidance on the Q4 earnings call in late January, COVID stressed the global health care system during the winter months. We are encouraged, however, that U.S. TAVR procedures grew as COVID hospitalizations decreased and vaccinations increased during the quarter. Small- and medium-sized centers played a valuable role in serving patients during the quarter. We continued to activate new centers this quarter as we have been throughout the pandemic. This demonstrates the clear interest of many smaller centers to provide state-of-the-art care for structural heart patients. 
Outside the U.S., in the first quarter, we estimated TAVR procedures grew in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis and Edwards' growth was comparable. Although we are off to a strong start, the slow vaccination progress outside the U.S. provides uncertainty for the remainder of the year. Edwards' underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single-digit range. Edwards' growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption rates outpace countries where the therapy is more established. Although TAVR centers were more prepared to treat patients, patient flow was disrupted due to regional lockdowns and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease. 
Sales growth in Japan and other countries was strong as aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease, and we remain focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. As previously noted, we received approval earlier this month in Japan for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk. We anticipate increased treatment rates when reimbursement is approved later this year. 
In addition to geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain dedicated to pursuing indication expansions. Our groundbreaking early TAVR trial is focused on patients who have severe aortic stenosis, but without recognized symptoms and who do not meet the current guidelines for valve replacement. We expect enrollment to increase as we and participating sites are motivated to complete enrollment of the trial this year. I'm also pleased to report that we received FDA approval for a pivotal trial for TAVR in moderate AS patients as we expect enrollment to begin later this year. Based on recent trials, we're learning on what was once thought of as a benign precursor to severe aortic stenosis may actually be associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality than previously recognized. Thus, we believe TAVR may be a future treatment option for these patients. 
Separately, last week, we received SAPIEN 3 CE Mark approval to begin treating patients with a previously repaired or replaced valve in the pulmonic position. Looking ahead to the upcoming virtual EuroPCR meeting next month, we expect long-term follow-up data from our European registry on SAPIEN 3 as well as a late-breaking clinical trial results on low-risk bicuspid patients. In summary, based on the strength we saw at the end of the first quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow in the 15% to 20% range in 2021. We expect continued near-term COVID-related regional disruptions and a more normalized second half of the year. We remain confident that this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double digits. 
Turning to TMTT, we're enrolling 5 pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio of technologies to support patients suffering from tricuspid and mitral valve disorders. This quarter, we progressed with the enrollment of our 3 CLASP pivotal trials for PASCAL. We continue to expect approval for patients with DMR late next year. This is expected to be the first commercial approval of the PASCAL system in the U.S. We've also begun treating patients with EVOQUE TR in the TRISCEND II randomized pivotal trial in accordance with the FDA's breakthrough pathway designation. This trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. 
In addition, the first patients were recently treated with our next-generation transcatheter mitral replacement system called EVOQUE Eos through the MISCEND study. This study will evaluate the safety and performance of EVOQUE Eos, which is designed to advance the treatment of patients with mitral regurgitation with a low-profile valve delivered through a sub-30 French transfemoral delivery system. We believe our 2 platform replacement strategy with SAPIEN M3 and EVOQUE Eos strongly positions us to be the leader in treating these underserved patients. As we expand our body of clinical evidence, we look forward to presenting meaningful data across our portfolio at the upcoming virtual ACC and EuroPCR medical meetings, including multiple late-breaking presentations. These include longer-term outcomes for transcatheter mitral repair from our CLASP trial and the first report of 30-day outcomes with EVOQUE tricuspid replacement from our TRISCEND study. 
Turning to our results, first quarter global sales were $16 million, driven by continued adoption of our PASCAL system and activation of more centers across Europe. Assuming diminishing COVID-related impact, we expect a ramp of sales throughout the year. We remain confident in our 2021 sales guidance of $80 million as we advance commercialization, staying focused on physician training, procedural success and patient outcomes. Adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes remain key drivers to transforming treatment. In summary, we are making meaningful progress toward our 2021 milestones and we continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2025. We remain committed to transforming the treatment of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease around the world. 
In Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter 2021 global sales was $213 million, increased 7% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Despite a soft start associated with COVID, we are encouraged by improvement across all regions over the course of the quarter. Notably, growth was lifted by premium products and improved as declining COVID cases enabled more hospitals to resume treating surgical structural heart patients. We remain very encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards' RESILIA tissue valves, including continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve. We anticipate that adoption will be bolstered by the 5-year data from our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, which demonstrates the excellent durability of this tissue technology. 
And we're pleased that in the first quarter, we initiated sales of INSPIRIS in China. Sales in the U.S. also continue to gain traction with KONECT RESILIA, the first preassembled aortic tissue valve conduit for patients who require replacement of the valve, root and ascending aorta, a critical unmet patient need. Finally, we're pleased to announce that we received regulatory approval with reimbursement in Japan for our MITRIS RESILIA valve, a new mitral valve, incorporating our newest tissue technology. Yesterday in Japan, we performed our first commercial cases with this differentiated innovation. In summary, we have confidence in our first -- in our full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for surgical structural heart, driven by market adoption of our premium technologies. We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion surgical structural heart market will grow in the mid-single digits through 2026. 
In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $196 million increased 4% on an underlying basis, driven by increased sales of technologies for both the operating room and intensive care units. HemoSphere orders increased as hospital capital spending began to show signs of recovery. Demand for our products used in high-risk surgeries remains strong, and our ClearSight noninvasive finger cuff used in elective procedures also recovered to near pre-COVID levels. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remained in demand due to elevated hospitalizations in both the U.S. and Europe at the beginning of Q1. We continue to expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for Critical Care. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations and as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Well, we are encouraged by the start to our year. Despite COVID still impacting the global health care system in the first quarter, we were able to post positive year-over-year sales growth across all of our product lines and regions as our advanced therapies helped patients globally. Total sales grew 5% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was better than the flat growth we expected when we gave guidance for the first quarter back in January. This stronger-than-expected sales performance fell through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, which was 8% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in our sales performance during the quarter was choppy, but we exited the quarter in a stronger position, and that gives us continued confidence in our outlook for the balance of the year. 
While macro conditions remain variable across our key geographies, we're projecting total sales in the second quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.60. As our business continues to rebound from the impact of COVID, we expect sales to strengthen and expenses to grow as travel and clinical trials ramp up. We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion; for TAVR, $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, approximately $80 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $800 million to $900 million; and for Critical Care, $725 million to $800 million. And based on our first quarter earnings, we are raising full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.07 to $2.27, up from $2 to $2.20. 
So now I'll cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76% compared to 76.7% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding to COVID, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $331 million or 27.2% of sales compared to $308 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro, and personnel-related costs, partially offset by reduced travel spending resulting from COVID. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate our spending will increase during the year as travel restrictions subside and we resume a more normalized operating environment. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%, similar to pre-COVID levels. 
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $207 million or 17% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. 
Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1%. This rate included a 290 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 4 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. 
Foreign exchange rates increased first quarter reported sales growth by 280 basis points or $30 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $60 million positive impact or about 1% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates positively impacted our first quarter EPS by about $0.01. 
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $195 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $301 million, less capital spending of $106 million. 
Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments as of March 31, 2021. We repurchased 3.6 million shares for $303 million during the first quarter and have approximately $300 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We plan to continue to execute our strategy of offsetting dilution from incentive stock compensation as well as opportunistically reducing our shares outstanding over time. Average shares outstanding during the first quarter were 631 million, down approximately 1 million from the prior quarter. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635 million. 
So with that, I'll pass it back to Mike."

And so this has been a long-term and consistent effort, and it's really nice to just continue to see the adoption. We are glad to see this approval for low risk in Japan that will start having some meaning later on in the year. 
In Europe, it was interesting. It was kind of choppy, I would say, not consistent across all countries. We still saw the countries that were less penetrated, probably have a little bit more growth in those countries that have traditionally been strong. And if you looked at it through the course of the quarter, it exited pretty solid, I think, similar to the overall growth rate of the quarter. So I don't think there was anything notable there, Bob."

Are you starting to see trends improve there? 
And then maybe I'll just ask a second question upfront. I've heard from a lot of doctors throughout the COVID time that the time from diagnosis to screening to treatment with TAVR is starting to compress. I want to see if you're seeing that on a company level, and if so, is that a durable trend?"

So let's talk about the U.S. The U.S. did improve during the course of the quarter, no doubt about it, but we would call it choppy. It wasn't straight up. So for example, things were tough in January and February, and clearly got better in March. Although when you got toward the back end of March and you had spring break, you felt that effect as well. But clearly, an upward trend. I just remember the sort of the roller coaster that we went on, Robbie, when we first put out the TAVR estimates of 15% to 20% growth in our December investor conference, we were feeling pretty good about it. When we got to the end of January and reported Q1, we were saying, well, we're still in that range, but probably we're a little lower in that range just based on things we're going. And then here, they went and recovered nicely. So we feel confident about the 15% to 20% range going forward. So hopefully, that helps you get a sense for the U.S. 
In terms of the question about, is it easier, all hospitals are not identical in the way that they screen patients. And so although some are more efficient and getting more efficient, others are more challenging. And one of the things that happens when you have COVID, so in addition to all the tests that you run through,  you also have to do COVID tests before you would come into the hospital. So it just becomes a hassle for these patients in addition to just the fear factor. So I wouldn't say it's uniform. Overall, hospitals will get a little better, but it's still a battle. The good news is length of stay is coming down. Hospitals are clearly improving in that regard. And maybe some of that is COVID driven, but it seems to be a trend as well."

If things go -- vaccinations go nicely and COVID really, we start winning the battle, it helps us trend toward the higher end.

Is that perhaps Edwards trying to take a portfolio approach? Are these valves different? Or I guess I'm trying to ask how derisked is mitral?

There's leaflet therapy out there right now that has a fair amount of data around it, but there is still limited data on replacement, limited data in tricuspid. And I think each time you see results from these trials, and you see them actually in human use, you start to see more and more derisking and more and more clarity and frankly, more clarity on which patients are appropriate for which therapies. And I would say that's not fully known at this point. We have some pretty good ideas.

So that should be an interesting data point and help give you some good insight. That's just here within the next couple of months. 
In terms of where we are in the journey for TAVR -- in TAVR versus TAVR and SAVR, you hear clinicians talking much more about how do I plan a lifetime therapy, right? What should be for a given patient, given their age, given their disease, what should be the first treatment? What might be the second? Should it be surgery first, TAVR second, SAVR first, then surgery, then another TAVR and all that. And that's a very active discussion. I think there's been some really strong evidence that says TAVR and TAVR is good, as well as TAVR in SAVR. So those are both proven to be realistic options.

We're optimistic about the U.S. It's very large. Even though things have been -- we've had nice growth in Europe. The pandemic doesn't make it easy. You can imagine the biggest user of this technology is Germany and when Germany goes through tough times, it doesn't make it so easy. So we're a bit dependent on this.

We think this is a really important trial One of the obstacles for patients to be treated is they can have severe aortic stenosis. And if there's uncertainty whether they have symptoms, then they're not treated because that's what guidelines say that assessing and identifying symptoms is a very sketchy game. It's subject to a lot of misinterpretation. So if we took that requirement out of the equation, we think it would be very meaningful. And if you could simply take some echo measurements and say, ""Hey, this patient has severe aortic stenosis and that drives treatment.""

I'd also like to touch on Edwards' response to the pandemic and our efforts to better support our patients, employees and the community.  
Recall that our sales were dramatically impacted in the last few weeks of Q1 2020 as procedures fell due to COVID disruptions. One year later after an extraordinarily difficult global crisis, I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery and although we recognize that many people are still struggling around the world. Our sales growth this quarter was better than expected across all product lines. 
Although we expect the pandemic will impact the global health care system, based on the environment as we exited the quarter, we have continued confidence in our positive 2021 outlook. We continue to believe that 2021 will be an important growth year for Edwards with mid-teen sales growth, highlighting the importance of treating structural heart patients even during this pandemic. 
We also anticipate meaningful progress on expanding large, underappreciated and underserved transcatheter opportunities in 2021. Recently, we achieved several important milestones. Let me mention 4. Just last week, in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, or TAVR, we received approval to initiate a pivotal trial for patients suffering from moderate aortic stenosis. Also, earlier this month, we received approval to begin treating patients at low surgical risk in Japan with SAPIEN 3. And in Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, or TMTT, I'm pleased to announce that the first patients were recently treated with EVOQUE Eos, our next-generation transcatheter mitral replacement system. Also in TMTT, we initiated the TRISCEND II U.S. pivotal trial for transcatheter tricuspid replacement.  
Looking beyond 2021, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative therapies. Our patient-focused culture drives us and motivates our employees around the world every day. Our R&D targets breakthrough therapies that can create significant value for patients and health systems, enabling strong organic sales growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Despite COVID disruptions, we've continued to invest aggressively for future growth. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our research and development investments today are focused on generating a robust body of guideline-changing clinical evidence. And although clinical studies slowed during the pandemic, our dedicated clinician partners are eager to accelerate enrollment in this important research. Regulators have also been supported in addressing the impact of the pandemic and its impact on clinical studies.  
Finally, I want to provide some perspective on how we've maintained our focus on creating long-term value as we navigated the pandemic over the last year. We continue to invest in our people and our infrastructure. During a time when widespread uncertainty impacted many families across the globe, we have prioritized protecting our employees and have grown our team. We enhanced employee benefits, rewarded performance and protected incentives. We also moved ahead on expanding Edwards' research and production facilities around the world. We adjusted our agreements to support hospitals as they navigated COVID. And additionally, we provided extra support to the communities where our employees live and work. In fact, we recently converted one of our facilities into a mass COVID vaccination site to support the community of 3 million people where our company is headquartered. As a company, we expect that Edwards will be positioned even stronger and be able to help more patients than ever before as the world emerges from the pandemic.  
Now turning to our first quarter results. We reported $1.2 billion in sales this quarter, up 5% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. Recall that our guidance assumed Q1 sales would be in line with the first quarter of last year, which was largely unaffected by COVID. We were pleased with how sales improved as the quarter progressed.  
In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $792 million, up 4% on an underlying basis. The SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform remains differentiated with low complication rates, ease of use, and significant potential for length-of-stay efficiency. Our average selling prices were stable, and we estimated that global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth.  
In the U.S., our Q1 TAVR sales were flat with fourth quarter and year ago results, and we estimate that overall U.S. procedure growth was comparable. Consistent with our guidance on the Q4 earnings call in late January, COVID stressed the global health care system during the winter months. We are encouraged, however, that U.S. TAVR procedures grew as COVID hospitalizations decreased and vaccinations increased during the quarter. Small and medium-sized centers played a valuable role in serving patients during the quarter. We continued to activate new centers this quarter as we have been throughout the pandemic. This demonstrates the clear interest of many smaller centers to provide state-of-the-art care for structural heart patients.  
Outside the U.S., in the first quarter, we estimated TAVR procedures grew in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis and Edwards' growth was comparable. Although we are off to a strong start, the slow vaccination progress outside the U.S. provides uncertainty for the remainder of the year. Edwards' underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single-digit range. Edwards' growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption rates outpaced countries where the therapy is more established. Although TAVR centers were more prepared to treat patients, patient flow was disrupted due to regional lockdowns and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease. Sales growth in Japan and other countries was strong as aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease, and we remain focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. As previously noted, we received approval earlier this month in Japan for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk. We anticipate increased treatment rates when reimbursement is approved later this year.  
In addition to geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain dedicated to pursuing indication expansions. Our groundbreaking early TAVR trial is focused on patients who have severe aortic stenosis but without recognized symptoms and who do not meet the current guidelines for valve replacement. We expect enrollment to increase as we and participating sites are motivated to complete enrollment of the trial this year. I'm also pleased to report that we received FDA approval for a pivotal trial for TAVR in moderate AS patients as we expect enrollment to begin later this year. Based on recent trials, we're learning on what was once thought of as a benign precursor to severe aortic stenosis may actually be associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality than previously recognized. Thus, we believe TAVR may be a future treatment option for these patients.
Separately, last week, we received SAPIEN 3 CE Mark approval to begin treating patients with a previously repaired or replaced valve in the pulmonic position. Looking ahead to the upcoming virtual EuroPCR meeting next month, we expect long-term follow-up data from our European registry on SAPIEN 3 as well as the late-breaking clinical trial results on low-risk bicuspid patients. 
In summary, based on the strength we saw at the end of the first quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow in the 15% to 20% range in 2021. We expect continued near-term COVID-related regional disruptions and a more normalized second half of the year. We remain confident that this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double digits.  
Turning to TMTT. We're enrolling 5 pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio of technologies to support patients suffering from tricuspid and mitral valve disorders. This quarter, we progressed with the enrollment of our 3 CLASP pivotal trials for PASCAL. We continue to expect approval for patients with DMR late next year. This is expected to be the first commercial approval of the PASCAL system in the U.S. We've also begun treating patients with EVOQUE TR in the TRISCEND II randomized pivotal trial in accordance with the FDA's breakthrough pathway designation. This trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation.  
In addition, the first patients were recently treated with our next-generation transcatheter mitral replacement system called EVOQUE Eos through the MISCEND study. This study will evaluate the safety and performance of EVOQUE Eos, which is designed to advance the treatment of patients with mitral regurgitation with a low-profile valve delivered through a sub-30 French transfemoral delivery system. We believe our 2-platform replacement strategy with SAPIEN M3 and EVOQUE Eos strongly positions us to be the leader in treating these underserved patients.  
As we expand our body of clinical evidence, we look forward to presenting meaningful data across our portfolio at the upcoming virtual ACC and EuroPCR medical meetings, including multiple late-breaking presentations. These include longer-term outcomes for transcatheter mitral repair from our CLASP trial and the first report of 30-day outcomes with EVOQUE tricuspid replacement from our TRISCEND study.  
Turning to our results. First quarter global sales were $16 million, driven by continued adoption of our PASCAL system and activation of more centers across Europe. Assuming diminishing COVID-related impact, we expect a ramp of sales throughout the year. We remain confident in our 2021 sales guidance of $80 million as we advance commercialization, staying focused on physician training, procedural success and patient outcomes. Adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes remain key drivers to transforming treatment. 
In summary, we are making meaningful progress toward our 2021 milestones and we continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2025. We remain committed to transforming the treatment of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease around the world.  
In Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter 2021 global sales was $213 million, increased 7% on an underlying basis over the prior year. Despite a soft start associated with COVID, we are encouraged by improvement across all regions over the course of the quarter. Notably, growth was lifted by premium products and improved as declining COVID cases enabled more hospitals to resume treating surgical structural heart patients. 
We remain very encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards' RESILIA tissue valves, including continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve. We anticipate that adoption will be bolstered by the 5-year data from our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, which demonstrates the excellent durability of this tissue technology. And we're pleased that in the first quarter, we initiated sales of INSPIRIS in China. Sales in the U.S. also continue to gain traction with KONECT RESILIA, the first preassembled aortic tissue valve conduit for patients who require replacement of the valve, root and ascending aorta, a critical unmet patient need. Finally, we're pleased to announce that we received regulatory approval with reimbursement in Japan for our MITRIS RESILIA valve, a new mitral valve incorporating our newest tissue technology. Yesterday in Japan, we performed our first commercial cases with this differentiated innovation. 
In summary, we have confidence in our first -- in our full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our premium technologies. We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structural Heart market will grow in the mid-single digits through 2026.  
In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $196 million increased 4% on an underlying basis, driven by increased sales of technologies for both the operating room and intensive care units. HemoSphere orders increased as hospital capital spending began to show signs of recovery. Demand for our products used in high-risk surgeries remains strong, and our ClearSight noninvasive finger cuff used in elective procedures also recovered to near pre-COVID levels. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remained in demand due to elevated hospitalizations in both the U.S. and Europe at the beginning of Q1. We continue to expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for Critical Care. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations and we -- as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients.  
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Well, we are encouraged by the start to our year. Despite COVID still impacting the global health care system in the first quarter, we were able to post positive year-over-year sales growth across all of our product lines and regions as our",825,"Thanks, Mike. Well, we are encouraged by the start to our year. Despite COVID still impacting the global health care system in the first quarter, we were able to post positive year-over-year sales growth across all of our product lines and regions as our advanced therapies helped patients globally. Total sales grew 5% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was better than the flat growth we expected when we gave guidance for the first quarter back in January. This stronger-than-expected sales performance fell through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, which was 8% higher than the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in our sales performance during the quarter was choppy, but we exited the quarter in a stronger position, and that gives us continued confidence in our outlook for the balance of the year.  
While macro conditions remain variable across our key geographies, we're projecting total sales in the second quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.60. As our business continues to rebound from the impact of COVID, we expect sales to strengthen and expenses to grow as travel and clinical trials ramp up. We're maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion; for TAVR, $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, approximately $80 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $800 million to $900 million; and for Critical Care, $725 million to $800 million. And based on our first quarter earnings, we are raising full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.07 to $2.27, up from $2 to $2.20.  
So now I'll cover additional details of our results. For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76% compared to 76.7% in the same period last year. This reduction was driven by a negative impact from foreign exchange and incremental costs associated with responding to COVID, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $331 million or 27.2% of sales compared to $308 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro, and personnel-related costs, partially offset by reduced travel spending resulting from COVID. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate our spending will increase during the year as travel restrictions subside and we resume a more normalized operating environment. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%, similar to pre-COVID levels.  
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $207 million or 17% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT.  
Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1%. This rate included a 290 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 4 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. 
Foreign exchange rates increased first quarter reported sales growth by 280 basis points or $30 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $60 million positive impact or about 1% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our January guidance, FX rates positively impacted our first quarter EPS by about $0.01.  
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $195 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $301 million less capital spending of $106 million.  
Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments as of March 31, 2021. We repurchased 3.6 million shares for $303 million during the first quarter and have approximately $300 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We plan to continue to execute our strategy of offsetting dilution from incentive stock compensation as well as opportunistically reducing our shares outstanding over time. Average shares outstanding during the first quarter were 631 million, down approximately 1 million from the prior quarter. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be between 630 million and 635 million.  
So with that, I'll pass it back to Mike."

And so the year-over-year comparisons are a bit stronger. But frankly, the numbers were just up. There -- we continue to see that therapy grow in those areas. China, we're very early in that game.

In Europe, it was interesting. It was kind of choppy. I would say not consistent across all countries. We still saw the countries that were less penetrated probably have a little bit more growth than those countries that have traditionally been strong. And if you looked at it through the course of the quarter, it exited pretty solid, I think, similar to the overall growth rate of the quarter.

So for example, things were tough in January and February and clearly got better in March. Although when you got toward the back end of March and you had spring break, you felt that effect as well but clearly an upward trend. I just remember the sort of the roller-coaster that we went on, Robbie. When we first put out the TAVR estimates of 15% to 20% growth in our December investor conference, we were feeling pretty good about it. When we got to the end of January and reported Q1, we were saying, ""Well, we're still in that range but probably we're a little lower in that range just based on how things we're going."" And then here, they went and recovered nicely. So we feel confident about the 15% to 20% range going forward. So hopefully, that helps you get a sense for the U.S. 
In terms of the question about is it easier, all hospitals are not identical in the way that they screen patients. And so although some are more efficient and getting more efficient, others are more challenging. And one of the things that happens when you have COVID, so in addition to all the tests that you run through,  you also have to do COVID tests before you would come in a hospital. So it just becomes a hassle for these patients in addition to just the fear factor. So I wouldn't say it's uniform. Overall, hospitals will get a little better, but it's still a battle. The good news is length of stay is coming down. Hospitals are clearly improving in that regard. And maybe some of that is COVID-driven, but it seems to be a trend as well."

Then when I look at your trials, you have 2 different trials on the replacement side, SAPIEN M3 and the EVOQUE. Is that a two-valve strategy? Is that perhaps Edwards trying to take a portfolio approach? Are these valves different? Or I guess I'm trying to ask how derisked is mitral. Are we at a point where we know exactly what patients we need to select and this is just a question of time before mitral ends up being much larger than TAVR?"

There's leaflet therapy out there right now that has a fair amount of data around it, but there is still limited data on replacement, limited data in tricuspid. 
And I think each time you see results from these trials and you see them actually in human use, you start to -- you see more and more derisking and more and more clarity and frankly more clarity on which patients are appropriate for which therapies. And I would say that's not fully known at this point. We have some pretty good ideas.

So that should be an interesting data point and help give you some good insight. That's just here within the next couple of months. 
In terms of where we are in the journey for TAVR-in-TAVR versus TAVR-in-SAVR, you hear clinicians talking much more about how do I plan a lifetime therapy, right? What should be -- for a given patient, given their age, given their disease, what should be the first treatment? What might be the second? Should it be surgery first, TAVR second; SAVR first then surgery then another TAVR; and all that. And that's a very active discussion. I think there's been some really strong evidence that says TAVR-in-TAVR is good as well as TAVR-in-SAVR. So those are both proven to be realistic options. And so now it's trying to sort through for any given patient what's the best therapy. And it's on the podium pretty regularly, and I think we're on a pretty steep learning curve in that regard."

And we found them routinely able to do it and not really be a big burden to them. And so it is clearly helpful when the length of stay is shorter. But some of it is their own practices. If they're able to do, for example, multiple TAVRs in a day, that really helps. If they're able to discharge a patient faster, that helps. And all those are improving. And also, I would just say generally their desire to be able to increase capacity. So it's -- we're getting to a place where TAVR is becoming far more predictable than it had been in the past, and that really helps hospitals' ability to plan."

We are encouraged by clear signs of recovery during the second quarter.

We are encouraged by clear signs of recovery during the second quarter. Vaccine adoption in key regions has contributed to an increasing number of patients seeking and, most importantly, receiving treatment. At Edwards, our dedication of providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular disease around the world motivates our employees every day. We never stopped our aggressive pursuit of breakthrough technologies with the potential to help an even broader group of patients. 
Last year, we noted that we were in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic. There were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter. This quarter, more than 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN valves, an indication that more patients are benefiting from our life-changing technologies than ever before. 
Comparisons to 2020 are challenging as last year marked an extraordinary time for structural heart patients, especially during the second quarter when the COVID surge overwhelmed hospitals and undermined regular ongoing care. Patients and their doctors around the world were forced to weigh the risk of COVID versus the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. Fortunately, we're now experiencing encouraging signs of increased patient confidence to visit their position. 
Turning now to our recent results. We're pleased to report better-than-expected second quarter sales of $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis from the year ago period. All 4 product groups delivered large increases in sales led by TAVR. Total company sales increased sequentially versus Q1. And importantly, sales grew 11% on a 2-year compounded annual basis compared to the strong pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019. 
While hospital heart teams have not been reporting significant backlogs, we believe that procedure rates in Q2 were lifted because patients who previously postponed their doctor visits returned and were treated. We are raising our full year outlook for 2021. We remain cautious about the mixed trends of the recovery from the pandemic. And additionally, we expect a more pronounced summer seasonality associated with a pent-up demand for vacations, yet given the better-than-expected year-to-date performance and momentum exiting the quarter, we now expect total sales growth to be in the high teens versus our previous guidance of mid-teens. 
In TAVR, second quarter global sales were $902 million, up 48% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period or 14% on a 2-year compounded annual basis. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards growth in the second quarter. 
Globally, our average selling price remains stable as we continued to exercise price discipline. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. 
In a recent article in the American Journal of Cardiology reported -- reported on the survival of severe AS patients since the introduction of TAVR in 2008, the analysis included clinical data on 4,000 patients obtained at the Mass General and concluded that, in the TAVR era, overall survival of patients with severe AS has doubled. 
The long-term potential, along with the rebound in procedures, reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, up from more than $5 billion today. And beyond 2024, bolstered by 2 pivotal trials currently being enrolled, we believe the impact of treating this deadly disease before symptoms and before the disease becomes severe has the potential to transform the lives of even more patients. 
In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew sequentially over Q1 and over 50% on a year-over-year basis. Our U.S. TAVR volumes were well above pre-COVID levels as our 2-year compounded annual growth rate was in the mid-teens. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. We're encouraged that U.S. TAVR procedures grew as vaccinations increased and patients decided to seek treatment during the quarter. Growth was broad-based across both high- and low-volume centers. 
Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our sales grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate that total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. On a 2-year compounded annual basis, we estimate that sales grew in the low double digits in the second quarter versus 2019. And although we're encouraged by the strong results, vaccination progress outside the U.S. creates uncertainty for the remainder of the year. Long term, though, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. 
TAVR procedure and Edwards growth in Europe also rebounded significantly on a year-over-year basis. Edwards growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based across all countries. Patient flow recovered throughout the quarter, although it remains suboptimal in several countries and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease. 
In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3 and broad growth across centers of all sizes. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country driven by the fact that aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population. As previously announced, we received approval earlier in the second quarter for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk, and we continue to anticipate increased treatment rates in Japan when reimbursement is approved in Q3. 
Now turning to several recent TAVR clinical trial highlights. Last week at the TVT conference data on the Vancouver's TAVR economic study were presented, which further demonstrated the favorable economic value of our SAPIEN 3 platform. A comparison of 1,100 patients was conducted to assess the economic impact of next-day discharge. The SAPIEN 3 platform with a minimalist approach achieved better patient outcomes, 30 days post procedure and enhanced resource utilization, which resulted in meaningful cost improvements. 
Also at TVT, results from the PARTNER III bicuspid registry showed similar outcomes to other TAVR patients as well as significant improvement in patient symptoms and quality of life. We remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity as patients and clinicians increasingly understand the significant benefits of TAVR therapy supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence. 
In summary, based on the strength that we saw in the second quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow around 20% in 2021 versus our previous expectation of 15% to 20% growth. 
Turning to TMTT. We continue to be very pleased with our clinical outcomes as they remain a key driver to treating many patients in need and unlocking the significant long-term growth opportunity. We continue to be committed to ensuring procedural success in employing a high-touch clinical support model. We are progressing in the enrollment of 5 pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio to support therapies for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We have initiated use of the PASCAL Precision platform and are currently enrolling class trials, and early physician feedback has been positive. We remain on track for U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. 
We advanced our clinical experience with transcatheter replacement as we continued enrollment with our TRISCEND II pivotal trial for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement. We also continue to treat patients with both our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. 
As we continue to build a body of compelling clinical evidence, we are pleased with the recent data from several late-breaking presentations across our comprehensive TMTT portfolio. In mitral, an analysis at EuroPCR of over 2,100 commercially treated patients provided further evidence of the efficacy, safety and ease of use of the PASCAL platform. In addition, 2-year results from the CLASS study of PASCAL highlighted strong and sustained MR reduction as well as high survival rates for both FMR and DMR patients. And in tricuspid, 30-day outcomes for our TRISCEND study for the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system demonstrated favorable technical feasibility and safety, along with significant improvements in tricuspid regurgitation and quality of life for patients. 
Similarly, outcomes for our PASCAL tricuspid valve repair resulted in significant TR reduction, low complication rates and sustained functional and quality of life improvements at 6 months. 
Turning to the financial performance in TMTT. Global sales of $22 million was driven by the continued adoption of our PASCAL platform as we activated more centers across Europe. We now expect 2021 TMTT sales of $80 million to $100 million, up from our previous sales guidance of $80 million. We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025, and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. 
In Surgical Structural Heart, record second quarter global sales of $237 million was up 42% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. Revenue growth was lifted by increased adoption of our premium RESILIA technologies around the world and rebounding surgical aortic treatment rates in the U.S. We were encouraged by steady improvement in global surgical procedure volumes as we progress through the quarter. 
We experienced strong year-over-year adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the Connect RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit as well as our new [ Mytrus ] RESILIA surgical mitral valve, which was launched in Japan in the second quarter. We believe the adoption of RESILIA tissue valves will be further bolstered by the 4-year mitral data from our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgery as well as the growing body of RESILIA clinical evidence which demonstrates excellent durability of this tissue technology even in the high-pressure mitral position. 
In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year surgical structural heart guidance. We now expect underlying sales growth in the mid-teens versus our previous expectation of high single-digit growth. We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion surgical structural heart market will grow in the mid-single digits through 2026. 
In Critical Care, second quarter global sales were $215 million, up 27% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. Growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere sales in the U.S. as hospital capital spending continues to show signs of recovery. Demand for products used in high-risk surgeries remains strong, and demand for the ClearSight noninvasive finger cup used in elective procedures accelerated following its recovery to pre-COVID levels in the first quarter. 
In Smart Recovery, we received FDA clearance for the software algorithm that powers our Hypotension Prediction Index, HPI, on HemoSphere and the Acumen IQ cuff. The noninvasive Acumen IQ cuff provides clinicians with an important new tool to reduce hypotension in a broader range of patients, including those that do not require an arterial line. 
In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Critical Care guidance to low double digits versus our previous expectation of high single-digit growth. We remain excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients.

411220,1673093148,2355423,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thanks a lot, Mike. I am pleased with the momentum we experienced as we exited the first quarter continued in the second quarter across all of our product lines. While we're expecting some headwinds due to the summer vacation schedule and flare-ups of COV",965,"Thanks a lot, Mike. I am pleased with the momentum we experienced as we exited the first quarter continued in the second quarter across all of our product lines. While we're expecting some headwinds due to the summer vacation schedule and flare-ups of COVID in various regions, we're optimistic about favorable business conditions for Edwards. Total sales grew 49% year-over-year as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing treatment in the second quarter. Of course, the unusually high growth rate also reflects depressed sales in last year's second quarter due to COVID. Our underlying 2-year compounded growth rate in the second quarter was 11%, another indicator that conditions are improving. The much stronger-than-expected sales performance lifted by unexpectedly high procedure volume fell through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. 
Based upon our strong start to the year and positive outlook, we are raising our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion; for TAVR, $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million; and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million. 
Now regarding second half margins, we're intending to resume a higher rate of spending as commercial activities increase, especially as we continue to build our clinical and field teams to support our planned new product introductions in multiple regions. In addition, we expect growth in research and development expenses as our clinical trial activities increase. The combination of these actions contributes to our more moderated guidance for margins in the second half. 
We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high end of our previous range of $2.07 to $2.27. While public health conditions remain uncertain, we're projecting total sales in the third quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.29 billion and $1.37 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.56. 
Now I'll cover additional details of our results. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.9% compared to 74.4% in the same period last year when we experienced lower sales and substantial costs responding to COVID. This increase was also driven by a more profitable product mix partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. 
We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $374 million or 27.2% of sales compared to $275 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs, including performance-based compensation, increased commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year and the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro. 
We're planning to see a ramp-up in the expenses noted above in the second half as COVID-related restrictions subside to support continued growth. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 24% to $225 million or 16.4% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations including increased clinical trial activity. 
We are planning to ramp up expenses in the second half as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect research and development expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range. 
During the second quarter, we recorded a $103 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.14.  This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 that I mentioned earlier. This reduction reflects accounting adjustments associated with reduced expectations of making future milestone payments for previous acquisitions. This accounting impact does not impact our 2021 guidance. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.3%. This rate included a larger-than-expected 590 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15% including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. 
Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter reported sales growth by 450 basis points or $29 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. 
Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 180 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, positively impacted our second quarter EPS by $0.01. 
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $457 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $526 million less capital spending of $69 million. 
Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and investments as of June 30. Average shares outstanding during the second quarter were 630 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter for $112 million. In the first half of the year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average price of $85. In May, we obtained Board approval to increase our share repurchase authorization and currently have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the program. We now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 million to 635 million guidance range. 
And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike."

Your observation is correct. We really haven't talked about this much in the past. Most of our data historically has come from talking to our heart teams really around the world but especially in the U.S. And when we talk to them, they really don't know the difference in their backlogs compared to what they've seen in the past. But we believe, based on a number of sources, some of the anecdotal conversations, some of it watching what's going on with other companies like insurers or others in the health care space, they noted much more patient activity. And we believe that this flow of patients, so patients visiting their primary care physicians, patients going back to their general cardiologists, their general cardiologist referring them on to heart teams, all those things that we think were potentially delayed, that there was a real pickup in the second quarter. And because of the rate of treatment being much larger than anything we've ever seen in our past, we believe that, that's in there. 
It's not based on -- we only have heart data, Bob, to quantify how much that was, but we believe that, that was a key part of what happened."

Also, all of us are all acutely aware of what's going on with the pandemic and the recent surge that's happening. And although this hasn't had a dramatic impact on the health care system so far, we think it can have impact. And so that's also baked into our thinking. 
Q3, we think there's going to be a pronounced seasonality associated with people in the health care system and patients themselves wanting to get away and take a vacation. And so all those went into our thinking. And I don't know, Scott, if there's much to add to that, but..."

One of the things you have to be a little bit careful of when you look at growth rates and use that as a way of measuring Q2 is to be a little bit more reflective on what the climate was like in Q2 of last year. So Japan just didn't decline as much as the U.S. and Europe last year. And so while the growth rate looks like less in Japan and it looks like it was less of a performer, actually, Japan was doing quite well and grew very nicely. Similarly, Europe didn't get hit quite as hard in Q2 as the U.S. did as the U.S. really got hit hard. So Europe has actually been performing, we think, at a pretty high level. 
Now having said that, you correctly note that, hey, Japan is a near lockdown in portions of the region. There's portions of Europe that are still troublesome, although there's encouraging signs in Europe as well. I just saw some data this morning that said vaccination rates in Europe are comparable to U.S. vaccination rates. And we know of some places that are under pressure in the U.S. 
So we've taken all that into account when we provided our guidance. But when we look backward at Q2, we feel like we saw a strength across each of the regions."

But the sort of comparing the number of centers that are doing stenting but not TAVR seems a little bit like a new way of highlighting the underpenetrated nature of the adoption.

I mean we have been, I think, pretty consistent since the new NCD was approved a few years ago that we thought this was going to head toward around 850 centers. That continues to be our belief. Nothing has really changed in that regard. And it's probably constrained by the way that the NCD is written. 
We probably argue that it might have been larger, but it is what it is. And so that's where it is. But what I really wouldn't focus overly on number of centers, for example, in the U.S. when you think about what the potential is for TAVR because the real issue is patients coming off the sidelines. There are many, many patients with severe AS that for one reason or another, don't get diagnosed or don't ever make it to a heart team and treatment. And that is going to be the key to the -- really the growth of TAVR overall. 
And we're fortunate to have a great procedure that has terrific results, and we're making progress on encouraging patients to come back. Now it's a challenge, obviously, with COVID because those same patients that are vulnerable to COVID are those that are -- have very similar characteristics to severe AS patients, but it's a real opportunity. 
And the other thing that we find is there's much conversation about health disparities these days. That's true in spades for severe aortic stenosis patients. There are real health disparities. And so as the overall system looks to tackle that, we think that's a bit of a tailwind to our efforts."

Adding new centers is important and valuable. One of the things that I think may not be clear to most is we've only had a high surgical risk indication up until now. And so we're going to jump to a low surgical risk indication. And once that reimbursement comes in place, which happens this quarter, or we expect to happen this quarter, that's when there should be some real reaction from clinicians in terms of treating these patients.

It's been, again, anecdotal, so I'm a little hesitant to say that we know exactly where that's coming from, Josh.

We believe that this occurred upstream, part of what which was driving our comments in the past. And you're exactly right.

But remember, we said there were 10,000 patients treated in -- I mean, 20,000 patients treated in Q2 and 30,000 this Q2, so a big difference. And so it's not as though all of those 10,000 patients all come. It doesn't take very many to move numbers like they moved in Q2. 
So we believe that it's patients across all risk levels. Even -- I think people sometimes don't understand that low-risk patients are quite old in many cases, and so it's not just simply the newer indication. It's broadly that these patients that were elderly and had risk of COVID were hesitant to enter the system. We believe that they were more likely when signs of optimism really reached their peak in the second quarter to reenter the system and be treated and that we got some lift out of that. We don't have perfect visibility on that, so I can't be more quantitative."

The same thing in Europe. There are countries, some of the Nordic countries, we can -- I could go on to a greater level of specifics, that are struggling more. But overall, Europe is doing pretty well. They performed at a high level in the second quarter. 
Japan in a lockdown, but then at the same time, they have the approval for low risk and we do have optimism about the future.

We are encouraged by clear signs of recovery during the second quarter. Vaccine adoption in key regions has contributed to an increasing number of patients seeking and, most importantly, receiving treatment. At Edwards, our dedication of providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular disease around the world motivates our employees every day. We never stopped our aggressive pursuit of breakthrough technologies with the potential to help an even broader group of patients. 
Last year, we noted that we were in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic. There were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter. This quarter, more than 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN valves, an indication that more patients are benefiting from our life-changing technologies than ever before. 
Comparisons to 2020 are challenging as last year marked an extraordinary time for structural heart patients, especially during the second quarter when the COVID surge overwhelmed hospitals and undermined regular ongoing care. Patients and their doctors around the world were forced to weigh the risk of COVID versus the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. Fortunately, we're now experiencing encouraging signs of increased patient confidence to visit their physician. 
Turning now to our recent results. We're pleased to report better-than-expected second quarter sales of $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis from the year ago period. All 4 product groups delivered large increases in sales led by TAVR. Total company sales increased sequentially versus Q1. And importantly, sales grew 11% on a 2-year compounded annual basis compared to the strong pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019. 
While hospital heart teams have not been reporting significant backlogs, we believe that procedure rates in Q2 were lifted because patients who previously postponed their doctor visits returned and were treated. We are raising our full year outlook for 2021. We remain cautious about the mixed trends of the recovery from the pandemic. And additionally, we expect a more pronounced summer seasonality associated with a pent-up demand for vacations. Yet given the better-than-expected year-to-date performance and momentum exiting the quarter, we now expect total sales growth to be in the high teens versus our previous guidance of mid-teens. 
In TAVR, second quarter global sales were $902 million, up 48% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period or 14% on a 2-year compounded annual basis. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards growth in the second quarter. 
Globally, our average selling price remains stable as we continued to exercise price discipline. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. 
In a recent article in the American Journal of Cardiology reported -- it reported on the survival of severe AS patients since the introduction of TAVR in 2008. The analysis included clinical data on 4,000 patients obtained at the Mass General and concluded that, in the TAVR era, overall survival of patients with severe AS has doubled. 
The long-term potential, along with the rebound in procedures, reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, up from more than $5 billion today. And beyond 2024, bolstered by 2 pivotal trials currently being enrolled, we believe the impact of treating this deadly disease before symptoms and before the disease becomes severe has the potential to transform the lives of even more patients. 
In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew sequentially over Q1 and over 50% on a year-over-year basis. Our U.S. TAVR volumes were well above pre-COVID levels as our 2-year compounded annual growth rate was in the mid-teens. We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. We're encouraged that U.S. TAVR procedures grew as vaccinations increased and patients decided to seek treatment during the quarter. Growth was broad-based across both high- and low-volume centers. 
Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our sales grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate that total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. On a 2-year compounded annual basis, we estimate that sales grew in the low double digits in the second quarter versus 2019. And although we're encouraged by the strong results, vaccination progress outside the U.S. creates uncertainty for the remainder of the year. Long term, though, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. 
TAVR procedure and Edwards growth in Europe also rebounded significantly on a year-over-year basis. Edwards growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad-based across all countries. Patient flow recovered throughout the quarter, although it remains suboptimal in several countries and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease. 
In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption driven by SAPIEN 3 and broad growth across centers of all sizes. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country driven by the fact that aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population. As previously announced, we received approval earlier in the second quarter for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk, and we continue to anticipate increased treatment rates in Japan when reimbursement is approved in Q3. 
Now turning to several recent TAVR clinical trial highlights. Last week at the TVT conference, data on the Vancouver's TAVR economic study were presented, which further demonstrated the favorable economic value of our SAPIEN 3 platform. A comparison of 1,100 patients was conducted to assess the economic impact of next-day discharge. The SAPIEN 3 platform, with a minimalist approach, achieved better patient outcomes, 30 days post procedure and enhanced resource utilization, which resulted in meaningful cost improvements. 
Also at TVT, results from the PARTNER III bicuspid registry showed similar outcomes to other TAVR patients as well as significant improvement in patient symptoms and quality of life. We remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity as patients and clinicians increasingly understand the significant benefits of TAVR therapy supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence. 
In summary, based on the strength that we saw in the second quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow around 20% in 2021 versus our previous expectation of 15% to 20% growth. 
Turning to TMTT. We continue to be very pleased with our clinical outcomes as they remain a key driver to treating many patients in need and unlocking the significant long-term growth opportunity. We continue to be committed to ensuring procedural success in employing a high-touch clinical support model. We are progressing in the enrollment of 5 pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio to support therapies for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We have initiated use of the PASCAL PRECISION platform and are currently enrolling CLASP trials, and early physician feedback has been positive. We remain on track for U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. 
We advanced our clinical experience with transcatheter replacement as we continued enrollment with our TRISCEND II pivotal trial for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement. We also continue to treat patients with both our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study for EVOQUE Eos. 
As we continue to build a body of compelling clinical evidence, we are pleased with the recent data from several late-breaking presentations across our comprehensive TMTT portfolio. In mitral, an analysis at EuroPCR of over 2,100 commercially treated patients provided further evidence of the efficacy, safety and ease of use of the PASCAL platform. In addition, 2-year results from the CLASP study of PASCAL highlighted strong and sustained MR reduction, as well as high survival rates for both FMR and DMR patients. And in tricuspid, 30-day outcomes for our TRISCEND study for the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system demonstrated favorable technical feasibility and safety, along with significant improvements in tricuspid regurgitation and quality of life for patients. 
Similarly, outcomes for our PASCAL tricuspid valve repair resulted in significant TR reduction, low complication rates and sustained functional and quality of life improvements at 6 months. 
Turning to the financial performance in TMTT. Global sales of $22 million was driven by the continued adoption of our PASCAL platform as we activated more centers across Europe. We now expect 2021 TMTT sales of $80 million to $100 million, up from our previous sales guidance of $80 million. We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025, and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. 
In Surgical Structural Heart, record second quarter global sales of $237 million was up 42% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. Revenue growth was lifted by increased adoption of our premium RESILIA technologies around the world and rebounding surgical aortic treatment rates in the U.S. We were encouraged by steady improvement in global surgical procedure volumes as we progress through the quarter. 
We experienced strong year-over-year adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit as well as our new MITRIS RESILIA surgical mitral valve, which was launched in Japan in the second quarter. We believe the adoption of RESILIA tissue valves will be further bolstered by the 4-year mitral data from our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgery as well as the growing body of RESILIA clinical evidence, which demonstrates excellent durability of this tissue technology even in the high-pressure mitral position. 
In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we're raising our full year surgical structural heart guidance. We now expect underlying sales growth in the mid-teens versus our previous expectation of high single-digit growth. We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion surgical structural heart market will grow in the mid-single digits through 2026. 
In Critical Care, second quarter global sales were $215 million, up 27% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. Growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere sales in the U.S. as hospital capital spending continues to show signs of recovery. Demand for products used in high-risk surgeries remains strong, and demand for the ClearSight noninvasive finger cup used in elective procedures accelerated following its recovery to pre-COVID levels in the first quarter. 
In Smart Recovery, we received FDA clearance for the software algorithm that powers our Hypotension Prediction Index, HPI, on HemoSphere and the Acumen IQ cuff. The noninvasive Acumen IQ cuff provides clinicians with an important new tool to reduce hypotension in a broader range of patients, including those that do not require an arterial line. 
In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Critical Care guidance to low double digits versus our previous expectation of high single-digit growth. We remain excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

I am pleased with the momentum we experienced as we exited the first quarter continued in the second quarter across all of our product lines. While we're expecting some headwinds due to the summer vacation schedule and flare-ups of COVID in various regions, we're optimistic about favorable business conditions for Edwards. 
Total sales grew 49% year-over-year as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing treatment in the second quarter. Of course, the unusually high growth rate also reflects depressed sales in last year's second quarter due to COVID. Our underlying 2-year compounded growth rate in the second quarter was 11%, another indicator that conditions are improving. The much stronger-than-expected sales performance lifted by an unexpectedly high procedure volume fell through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. 
Based upon our strong start to the year and positive outlook, we are raising our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion; for TAVR, $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million; and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million. 
Now regarding second half margins, we're intending to resume a higher rate of spending as commercial activities increase, especially as we continue to build our clinical and field teams to support our planned new product introductions in multiple regions. In addition, we expect growth in research and development expenses as our clinical trial activities increase. The combination of these actions contributes to our more moderated guidance for margins in the second half. 
We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high end of our previous range of $2.07 to $2.27. While public health conditions remain uncertain, we're projecting total sales in the third quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.29 billion and $1.37 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.56. 
Now I'll cover additional details of our results. For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.9% compared to 74.4% in the same period last year when we experienced lower sales and substantial costs responding to COVID. This increase was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. 
We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $374 million or 27.2% of sales compared to $275 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs, including performance-based compensation, increased commercial activities compared to the COVID impacted prior year and the strengthening of OUS currencies, primarily the euro. 
We're planning to see a ramp-up in the expenses noted above in the second half as COVID-related restrictions subside to support continued growth. We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%. Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 24% to $225 million or 16.4% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations including increased clinical trial activity. 
We are planning to ramp up expenses in the second half as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect research and development expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range. 
During the second quarter, we recorded a $103 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, which benefited earnings per share by $0.14.  This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 that I mentioned earlier. This reduction reflects accounting adjustments associated with reduced expectations of making future milestone payments for previous acquisitions. This accounting impact does not impact our 2021 guidance. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.3%. This rate included a larger-than-expected 590 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15% including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. 
Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter reported sales growth by 450 basis points or $29 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we now expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. 
Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 180 basis points compared to the prior year. Relative to our April guidance, FX rates positively impacted our second quarter EPS by $0.01. 
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $457 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $526 million less capital spending of $69 million. 
Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll finish with an update on our balance sheet and share repurchase activities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and investments as of June 30. Average shares outstanding during the second quarter were 630 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter for $112 million. In the first half of the year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average price of $85. In May, we obtained Board approval to increase our share repurchase authorization and currently have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the program. We now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 million to 635 million guidance range. 
And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike."

Most of our data historically has come from talking to our heart teams really around the world, but especially in the U.S. And when we talk to them, they really don't know the difference in their backlogs compared to what they've seen in the past. But we believe, based on a number of sources, some of the anecdotal conversations, some of it watching what's going on with other companies like insurers or others in the health care space, they noted much more patient activity. 
And we believe that this flow of patients, so patients visiting their primary care physicians, patients going back to their general cardiologists, their general cardiologist referring them on to heart teams, all those things that we think were potentially delayed, that there was a real pickup in the second quarter. 
And because of the rate of treatment being much larger than anything we've ever seen in our past, we believe that, that's in there. It's not based on -- we only have heart data, Bob, to quantify how much that was, but we believe that, that was a key part of what happened."

Also, all of us are all acutely aware of what's going on with the pandemic and the recent surge that's happening. And although this hasn't had a dramatic impact on the health care system so far, we think it can have impact. And so that's also baked into our thinking. 
Q3, we think there's going to be a pronounced seasonality associated with people, both in the health care system and patients themselves wanting to get away and take a vacation. And so all those went into our thinking. And I don't know, Scott, if there's much to add to that, but..."

One of the things you have to be a little bit careful of when you look at growth rates and use that as a way of measuring Q2 is to be a little bit more reflective on what the climate was like in Q2 of last year. So Japan just didn't decline as much as the U.S. and Europe last year. And so while the growth rate looks like less in Japan and it looks like it was less of a performer, actually, Japan was doing quite well and grew very nicely. 
Similarly, Europe didn't get hit quite as hard in Q2 as the U.S. did as the U.S. really got hit hard. So Europe has actually been performing, we think, at a pretty high level. Now having said that, you correctly note that, hey, Japan since a near lockdown in portions of the region, there's portions of Europe that are still troublesome, although there's encouraging signs in Europe as well. I just saw some data this morning that said vaccination rates in Europe are comparable to U.S. vaccination rates. And we know of some places that are under pressure in the U.S.. So we've taken all that into account when we provided our guidance. But when we look backward at Q2, we feel like we saw a strength across each of the regions."

And the reason I ask is that, in the past, you've talked about this sneaking up on maybe 850 centers in the U.S. and not really going to go to 1,100, 1,200 centers as we have for cardiac surgery. But the sort of -- comparing the number of centers that are doing stenting but not TAVR seems a little bit like a new way of highlighting the underpenetrated nature of the adoption.

I mean we have been, I think, pretty consistent since the new NCD was approved a few years ago that we thought this was going to head toward around 850 centers. That continues to be our belief. Nothing has really changed in that regard. And it's probably constrained by the way that the NCD is written. 
We'd probably argue that it might have been larger, but it is what it is. And so that's where it is. But what I really wouldn't focus overly on number of centers, for example, in the U.S. when you think about what the potential is for TAVR because the real issue is patients coming off the sidelines. There are many, many patients with severe AS that, for, one reason or another, don't get diagnosed or don't ever make it to a heart team and treatment. And that is going to be the key to the -- really the growth of TAVR overall. 
And we're fortunate to have a great procedure that has terrific results, and we're making progress on encouraging patients to come back. Now it's a challenge, obviously, with COVID because those same patients that are vulnerable to COVID are those that are -- have very similar characteristics to severe AS patients, but it's a real opportunity. 
And the other thing that we find is there's much conversation about health disparities these days. That's true in spades for severe aortic stenosis patients. There are real health disparities. And so as the overall system looks to tackle that, we think that's a bit of a tailwind to our efforts."

Adding new centers is important and valuable. One of the things that I think may not be clear to most is we've only had a high surgical risk indication up until now. And so we're going to jump to a low surgical risk indication. And once that reimbursement comes in place, which happens this quarter, or we expect to happen this quarter, that's when there should be some real reaction from clinicians in terms of treating these patients. So we look forward to adding these new centers and -- but we're also mindful of just COVID in Japan.

It's been, again, anecdotal, so I'm a little hesitant to say that we know exactly where that's coming from, Josh.

Any color you can give on the patient mix that gives you conviction that this is a backlog work down strong underlying volume."

We believe that this occurred upstream, part of what -- which was driving our comments in the past. And you're exactly right. We've said, hey, AS patients don't store very well, and we think that's true. But remember, we said there were 10,000 patients treated in -- I mean, 20,000 patients treated in Q2 and 30,000 this Q2, so a big difference. And so it's not as though all of those 10,000 patients all come. It doesn't take very many to move numbers like they moved in Q2. 
So we believe that it's patients across all risk levels. Even -- I think people sometimes don't understand that low-risk patients are quite old in many cases, and so it's not just simply the newer indication. It's broadly that these patients that were elderly and had risk of COVID were hesitant to enter the system. We believe that they were more likely, when signs of optimism really reached their peak in the second quarter, to reenter the system and be treated, and that we got some lift out of that. We don't have perfect visibility on that, so I can't be more quantitative."

The same thing in Europe. There are countries, some of the Nordic countries, like we can -- I could go on to a greater level of specifics, that are struggling more. But overall, Europe is doing pretty well. They performed at a high level in the second quarter. 
Japan, in a lockdown, but then at the same time, they have the approval for low risk and we do have optimism about the future. So each of these is positive. And even the rest of the world has put up very nice growth. So we don't have a hotspot that probably affects a major region more.

Let me begin by expressing appreciation for our global teams, who have been highly engaged throughout the pandemic. We're also pleased that our supply chain remained resilient during these challenging times to meet the needs of the patients we serve. 
Turning to results, third quarter total company sales of $1.3 billion increased 14% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Strong mid-teens growth was driven by our innovative platforms, although lower than our July expectations due to the significant impact COVID had on U.S. hospitals. Although we experienced encouraging signs of patient confidence and continued willingness to seek medical care in July, the Delta variant had a significant impact on hospital resources during the last 2 months of the third quarter, especially in the U.S. 
Despite the pronounced impact of the Delta variant in the U.S. in Q3, we're encouraged by the recent decline in hospital COVID admissions. We believe some procedures were unfortunately deferred in the third quarter. And based on what we saw in Q2, we expect many of these patients who deferred treatment in Q3 will be treated in the future. We continue to expect total company sales growth to be in the high teens for the full year. 
In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $558 million, up 14% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth in the third quarter. Globally, our average selling price remains stable. In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew 12% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. Growth was broad-based across both high- and low-volume centers. As you might expect, procedure volumes in Q3 were affected by seasonality and varied by geography and even by hospital as patients and providers turn their focus again to the pandemic. Our TAVR sales in July benefited from encouraging signs of continued recovery from the pandemic. However, procedures were negatively impacted in the last 2 months of Q3 due to the significant impact Delta had on hospital resources. 
Outside the U.S., in the third quarter, our sales grew approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by strong international adoption of TAVR broadly in all regions. And despite the impact of Delta, the TAVR market in Europe showed relative resilience with strong growth in procedure volumes. Growth was broad-based across Europe and driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform. We were pleased with the growth rate, considering that in Q3 of 2020, centers in Europe had already recovered from pandemic lows. Longer term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. 
It's worth noting that recently published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery now definitively recommend TAVR for patients over the age of 75. The acknowledgment by the surgical society that TAVR is preferred for those over 75 is a significant development. We believe these guidelines represent an important long-term opportunity. And although transcatheter valves have been commercially available for over a decade in Europe, it remains clear that there is still a large unmet need for this therapy. 
Strong TAVR adoption continued in Q3 in Japan. As expected, we received reimbursement approval in Q3 for treatment of patients at low surgical risk. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout this country, driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population. At the upcoming TCT meeting, there is a planned late-breaking update on the economic outcomes of PARTNER III at 2 years. 
In summary, based on October procedure trends, we expect Q4 growth for TAVR to be similar to Q3. We continue to expect underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% in 2021. We remain as confident as ever about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. The long-term potential reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a low double-digit compound annual growth rate. 
Now turning to TMTT. We've made meaningful progress across all our platforms, with over 6,000 patients treated to date. To transform treatment and unlock this significant long-term growth opportunity, we remain focused on 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. This quarter, we progressed on the enrollment of 5 pivotal trials across our portfolio to support therapies for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We are gaining experience with the PASCAL PRECISION platform as part of our CLASP trials and physician feedback continues to be positive. 
We look forward to presenting randomized data from the CLASP IID pivotal trial next year and remain on track for the U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. This important milestone will mark a transition from large single-arm studies to significant pivotal trial results that support approval and adoption and will be the first of several key data sets our CLASP trials. 
We continue to treat patients with both of our mitral -- our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study of EVOQUE Eos. We are ramping up enrollment with our novel EVOQUE Tricuspid Replacement therapy as part of the TRISCEND-II pivotal trial. These pricing transfemoral therapies are critical for many patients without treatment options today and exemplify the importance of a comprehensive portfolio. 
As we continue to expand our body of clinical evidence, we look forward to presenting meaningful data at TCT and PCR London Valves next month. Presentations will include 6-month outcomes of EVOQUE Tricuspid Replacement from our clinical trial experience in the TRISCEND study; in addition, 30-day outcomes for mitral repair with PASCAL from our MiCLASP post-market clinical follow-up study of over 250 patients. We also anticipate several live case demonstrations of our differentiated therapies. 
Turning to the financial performance in TMTT, despite the impact of Delta and summer seasonality, a global sales of $22 million were driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe. As we expanded commercially, we continue to experience high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes for patients, and we remain committed to employing our high-touch clinical support model. We are pleased with our level of site activation during the quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our previous full year guidance of $80 million to $100 million and estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025, and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. 
In Surgical Structural Heart, third quarter global sales were $217 million, up 6% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. Despite the Q3 resurgence in COVID cases, we are encouraged to see continued SAVR procedure growth across most regions. We remain encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the CONNECT RESILIA valve conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve. This advanced tissue treatment is increasingly supported by a growing body of real-world evidence as demonstrated at the European Association of Cardiac Thoracic Surgeons Annual Meeting earlier this year. Registry data confirmed excellent real-world outcomes with INSPIRIS RESILIA in patients under the age of 60. As patients increase their awareness of surgical valve choices, we believe that they are learning about the durability potential of RESILIA and engaging with their physicians to choose this technology. 
In summary, we have confidence that our full year 2021 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-teens for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market growth and adoption of our premium technologies. We continue to believe the Surgical Structural Heart market that we serve will grow mid-single digits through 2026. 
In Critical Care, third quarter global sales were $213 million, up 17% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines, led primarily by strong HemoSphere capital sales in the U.S. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remained in demand due to the elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. and demand for products used in high-risk surgery also grew year-over-year, in addition to demand for the ClearSight noninvasive finger cup used in elective procedures. 
In summary, we continue to believe that Critical Care will grow revenue in the low double-digit range in 2021. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."
411220,1683560232,2414703,"Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Edwards Lifesciences Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Today, I'll provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold and some color on what to expect at the investor conference on December 8. Total sales in the third quarter grew",913,"Thanks, Mike. Today, I'll provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold and some color on what to expect at the investor conference on December 8. 
Total sales in the third quarter grew 14% on an underlying basis over the prior year. As indicated earlier, this strong sales growth is lower than we expected in July before the U.S. Delta surge. Earnings in the quarter of $0.54 met our expectations as COVID-related constrained spending more than offset lower-than-expected sales. As Mike mentioned, based on the improving trends with the Delta variant and our October procedure trends, we are projecting total Q4 sales of between $1.30 billion and $1.38 billion. 
As it relates to each product line, we are forecasting fourth quarter TAVR sales of $850 million to $910 million, and still have the potential to reach underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% for the full year 2021. We are also maintaining our previous ranges for TMTT, Surgical Structural Heart and Critical Care. We continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high end of $2.07 to $2.27, with fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.53 to $0.59. 
And now I'll cover additional details of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.3%, up from 75.5% in the same period last year when we experienced substantial costs responding to COVID. The improvement was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. Like most companies, we are seeing signs of inflation generally in things like some of the raw materials we use in production as well as shipping and logistics. 
With that said, some of the extraordinary costs we incurred when COVID hit last year have lessened, and the net result is no material impact to our gross profit margin performance or guidance for 2021. More broadly, we are continuing our investments to ensure that our supply chain is strong and resilient, and capable of delivering life-saving products for our patients. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $364 million or 27.8% of sales compared to $307 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs and increased commercial activities compared to the COVID-impacted prior year. We are planning a sequential ramp-up of expenses in the fourth quarter as COVID-related restrictions continue to subside. We still expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%.
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 22% over the prior year to $238 million or 18.2% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. We are planning to increase these expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D expenses as a percentage of sales to be 17% to 18%. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13% or 13.9%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 320 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 4 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. 
Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points [ for $8 million ] compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. And relative to our July guidance, FX rates positively impacted our third quarter earnings per share by less than $0.01. 
Free cash flow for the third quarter was $471 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $532 million, less capital spending of $61 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $1.1 billion. The strong cash flows are a reflection of our exceptional portfolio of patient-focused technologies that are generating returns from previous investments, which allows us to fund future internal and external opportunities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $3 billion in cash and investments as of September 30. 
Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were 632 million, and we continue to expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 million to 635 million guidance range. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase program. 
Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll make a quick comment about our outlook for 2022. It's premature to offer detailed guidance today but we will provide 2022 financial guidance at our investor conference on December 8. In general, in 2022, we're planning on less disruption from COVID as we assume the resumption of more normalized sales and earnings growth. We will provide guidance for gross profit and operating margins as well as more visibility into any potential impact from changes in corporate tax rates. 
And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike."

Yes, like so many others, we really struggle with precisely projecting the pandemic. Edwards' business is strong. All the fundamentals are in a great place, and we know that there are many patients with structural heart disease in particular, that are in need. And so we feel great about it from that perspective, but the pandemic ends up having impact on hospitals and their ability to be able to handle the volumes. And we find it very spotty. It's regional in nature. 
And the good news is we're watching the Delta variant come down in the U.S., and that's where we felt most of the impact. And so that's very good. Of course, there is a concern of will there be kind of a winter surge that is not apparent at this point. So those things are always possible. We have, by and large, modeled the fact that we think things are going to get gradually better. We have taken into account where we are in October. In October, we saw run rates that were similar to what we saw in the last couple of months of Q3. And so that has also gone into our thinking. So I don't know if that answers your question, Vijay."

We're probably more impacted by the ICU capability, but it's not always the case. Sometimes it's just broadly across the hospital.

In general, we tried to give you some information to let you know that October was not so dissimilar than the end of Q3. So it's not -- we didn't want to send a signal that all of a sudden, October is back to the kind of thing that we were experiencing in Q2. So we're not experiencing that kind of an environment yet. But we're overall optimistic. I mean we talked to a lot of folks, anecdotally. Obviously, these -- the trends that I mentioned of Delta improving is something we think is going to pay off, we think.

Keep in mind, we're already starting from relatively strong margins compared to our industry. So our priority has been investing aggressively on internal growth more so than on trying to expand margins. But I do think there's going to be opportunity for those margins to gradually incrementally slowly expand over time. And it's something that we try to think carefully about. 
Short term, though, to your question about COVID, it's been remarkable. Our margins have remained pretty stable despite the fact that sales are down relative to pre-COVID levels, because expenses are down as well, largely driven by things that are happening out in the field. So travel, meetings, attendance at various different societies and events, and so it's been kind of a natural hedge against the sales headwinds that we've seen from COVID and we're benefiting from that. 
To be honest, though, we'd like to see expenses go back up along with sales because it's an indication that the environment is more normalized, that we're able to invest aggressively, that we can enroll our clinical trials at the higher rates that we saw pre-COVID. And so that's sort of the way we're thinking about margins overall."

You're on a key point, and we do talk about it quite a bit inside. It's -- we don't have perfect visibility and perfect data. So much of what we rely on are anecdotal reports, where we spent a lot of time with our customers and frontline clinical specialists to try and gain some kind of perspective. It's tough for us to nail the timing and magnitude to this. But clearly, we feel like we got a small lift in Q2 from patients that came into the system that had probably deferred care. 
If we reflect back on the total pandemic, when things first stopped back in 2020, back in the March-April time frame, it's difficult for us to say that we saw those patients come back into the system. But differently, it felt like the last winter's patients did indeed, surely some of those, some small quantity showed up and supplemented Q2. So that's not a giant number, but it's additive. And we speculate the similar kind of thing might happen as a result of the patients that have deferred care during the Delta variant. 
During the Delta variant, and we're speculating again, we may indeed have had these patients that actually saw their physician and got diagnosed, but that the actual treaters in regional hotspots weren't there to provide the therapy. So we think there's some reason why this might come back exactly. When it might come back is very difficult. But as COVID wanes, we're hoping that, indeed, we see a similar phenomenon as we saw in Q2."

And to the extent that, that lessens as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, beginning of the first quarter, for example, then prospects for 2022 growth are going to be higher. 
If COVID is playing a more meaningful role in certain regions or there are hotspots that are more noticeable, then that's going to impact our growth overall. That's probably the biggest uncertainty that we have going into 2022 because overall, we feel really positive about the growth prospects for TAVR in the U.S., in Europe and Japan and in the rest of the world. 
One of the things that we were talking about earlier with this low-risk penetration, while it's difficult to calculate the actual penetration, remember the timing on low risk, where we have the data for low risk with PARTNER III at ACC in 2019; we got approval in the third quarter of 2019 and shortly thereafter, COVID became a factor and interrupted our growth for TAVR. So we haven't really had this period that's uninterrupted from COVID for any extent of time since we got the low-risk approval.

That happened mid-quarter, I want to say, sometime in the August time frame. The -- there are indeed new centers that get added. Those get added on a pretty deliberate basis. And those new centers tend to be kind of slow to ramp up. There are significant regulatory requirements that are necessary to fire up new centers. 
But having said that, it's a dramatically undertreated disease in Japan. They have a very large elderly population. And when we think about it in terms of, for example, TAVR per million, we say, boy, there's still a long way to go. So we're very pleased with the growth rate. The growth rate in Japan was even higher than our international growth. And the reimbursement is important. It's an important key. It's exciting to be able to get that. And hopefully, that begins helping Japanese clinicians redefine the importance of TAVR for their patients. And I think we've gone take it for granted that low risk was -- is already present in other places around the world, and it just hasn't been in Japan until this last quarter."

And when you ask me what's it going to take to get your share up it's going to be impressive clinical results. And so that will show up two ways: one, in the day-to-day experiences of clinicians and patients; and the other is when they actually get a chance to see some of our results. And you see more and more data that is going to become available over time as you see clinical information. So even at the upcoming [ TV ] or TCT, I think you'll see more information on some of our early clinical experience. 
At this point, we're not even in every country in Europe. But our focus just to underline the point, again, is not on share. This is a really big opportunity. There are so many patients with mitral regurgitation, and there's many that are just not indicated, not being well served today. That's where our focus is."

As it relates to DTC, I'll start and then Mike can offer perspective as well. We think that market activation and inspiring more patients to come in to get treated is a really important part of the future and the long-term growth of TAVR. And so we are already investing some resources around getting directly to patients to primary care physicians to referring physicians, and we'll be doing more of that in the future. It's not aimed specifically at a patient in a particular risk category. We're trying to get to all patients, who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, and we expect that's going to be an important driver of growth."

And so as Scott said, we've gone on a number of roads here to make sure that the referral base is indeed, educated. We've made some good progress there, although we're far from satisfied in terms of where we are right now.

But remember, this characterization of patients by high risk, intermediate risk and low risk, was the characterization done by FDA as a regulatory pathway for TAVR to help make sure that the oldest sickest patients were treated first at the highest risk to try and minimize the risks associated with the new therapy. 
If you were to actually -- when you actually look at any patient, their key concern is not whether they're at risk surviving surgery, it's what is their risk for survival, what is it like to live with TAVR versus live with aortic stenosis. And that's the real question. So we spend less time and frankly, clinicians and patients spend less time talking about whether they're low risk or intermediate. So we really don't differentiate in that regard. 
So having said that, what do we think -- how did patients behave in the third quarter. We -- as I tried to infer before, we don't have perfect visibility there, but we think they were indeed seeing their doctor, they were indeed getting diagnosed, they were indeed getting screened, but there were a number of cases where the treating hospitals themselves just stopped taking patients, and that was the primary impact in the quarter."

Let me begin by expressing appreciation for our global teams, who have been highly engaged throughout the pandemic. We're also pleased that our supply chain remained resilient during these challenging times to meet the needs of the patients",1489,"Thanks, Mark. Let me begin by expressing appreciation for our global teams, who have been highly engaged throughout the pandemic. We're also pleased that our supply chain remained resilient during these challenging times to meet the needs of the patients we serve. 
Turning to results, third quarter total company sales of $1.3 billion increased 14% on a constant currency basis versus the year ago period. Strong mid-teens growth was driven by our innovative platforms, although lower than our July expectations due to the significant impact COVID had on U.S. hospitals. Although we experienced encouraging signs of patient confidence and continued willingness to seek medical care in July, the Delta variant had a significant impact on hospital resources during the last 2 months of the third quarter, especially in the U.S. 
Despite the pronounced impact of the Delta variant in the U.S. in Q3, we're encouraged by the recent decline in hospital COVID admissions. We believe some procedures were unfortunately deferred in the third quarter. And based on what we saw in Q2, we expect many of these patients who deferred treatment in Q3 will be treated in the future. We continue to expect total company sales growth to be in the high teens for the full year. 
In TAVR, third quarter global sales were $558 million, up 14% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth in the third quarter. Globally, our average selling price remains stable. In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew 12% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate that our share of procedures was stable. Growth was broad-based across both high- and low-volume centers. As you might expect, procedure volumes in Q3 were affected by seasonality and varied by geography and even by hospital as patients and providers turn their focus again to the pandemic. Our TAVR sales in July benefited from encouraging signs of continued recovery from the pandemic. However, procedures were negatively impacted in the last 2 months of Q3 due to the significant impact Delta had on hospital resources. 
Outside the U.S., in the third quarter, our sales grew approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, and we estimate total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. We continue to be encouraged by strong international adoption of TAVR broadly in all regions. And despite the impact of Delta, the TAVR market in Europe showed relative resilience with strong growth in procedure volumes. Growth was broad-based across Europe and driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform. We were pleased with the growth rate, considering that in Q3 of 2020, centers in Europe had already recovered from pandemic lows. Longer term, we see excellent opportunities for continued OUS growth as we believe global adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. 
It's worth noting that recently published guidelines from the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery now definitively recommend TAVR for patients over the age of 75. The acknowledgment by the surgical society that TAVR is preferred for those over 75 is a significant development. We believe these guidelines represent an important long-term opportunity. And although transcatheter valves have been commercially available for over a decade in Europe, it remains clear that there is still a large unmet need for this therapy. 
Strong TAVR adoption continued in Q3 in Japan. As expected, we received reimbursement approval in Q3 for treatment of patients at low surgical risk. We remain focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout this country, driven by the fact that AS remains a significantly undertreated disease amongst this large elderly population. At the upcoming TCT meeting, there is a planned late-breaking update on the economic outcomes of PARTNER III at 2 years. 
In summary, based on October procedure trends, we expect Q4 growth for TAVR to be similar to Q3. We continue to expect underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% in 2021. We remain as confident as ever about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. The long-term potential reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a low double-digit compound annual growth rate. 
Now turning to TMTT. We've made meaningful progress across all our platforms, with over 6,000 patients treated to date. To transform treatment and unlock this significant long-term growth opportunity, we remain focused on 3 key value drivers: a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. This quarter, we progressed on the enrollment of 5 pivotal trials across our portfolio to support therapies for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. We are gaining experience with the PASCAL PRECISION platform as part of our CLASP trials and physician feedback continues to be positive. 
We look forward to presenting randomized data from the CLASP IID pivotal trial next year and remain on track for the U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. This important milestone will mark a transition from large single-arm studies to significant pivotal trial results that support approval and adoption and will be the first of several key data sets our CLASP trials. 
We continue to treat patients with both of our mitral -- our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND study of EVOQUE Eos. We are ramping up enrollment with our novel EVOQUE Tricuspid Replacement therapy as part of the TRISCEND-II pivotal trial. These pricing transfemoral therapies are critical for many patients without treatment options today and exemplify the importance of a comprehensive portfolio. 
As we continue to expand our body of clinical evidence, we look forward to presenting meaningful data at TCT and PCR London Valves next month. Presentations will include 6-month outcomes of EVOQUE Tricuspid Replacement from our clinical trial experience in the TRISCEND study; in addition, 30-day outcomes for mitral repair with PASCAL from our MiCLASP post-market clinical follow-up study of over 250 patients. We also anticipate several live case demonstrations of our differentiated therapies. 
Turning to the financial performance in TMTT, despite the impact of Delta and summer seasonality, a global sales of $22 million were driven by the continued adoption of PASCAL in Europe. As we expanded commercially, we continue to experience high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes for patients, and we remain committed to employing our high-touch clinical support model. We are pleased with our level of site activation during the quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our previous full year guidance of $80 million to $100 million and estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025, and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. 
In Surgical Structural Heart, third quarter global sales were $217 million, up 6% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. Despite the Q3 resurgence in COVID cases, we are encouraged to see continued SAVR procedure growth across most regions. We remain encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve, the CONNECT RESILIA valve conduit and our MITRIS RESILIA mitral valve. This advanced tissue treatment is increasingly supported by a growing body of real-world evidence as demonstrated at the European Association of Cardio-Thoracic Surgeons Annual Meeting earlier this year. Registry data confirmed excellent real-world outcomes with INSPIRIS RESILIA in patients under the age of 60. As patients increase their awareness of surgical valve choices, we believe that they are learning about the durability potential of RESILIA and engaging with their physicians to choose this technology. 
In summary, we have confidence that our full year 2021 underlying sales growth will be in the mid-teens for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market growth and adoption of our premium technologies. We continue to believe the Surgical Structural Heart market that we serve will grow mid-single digits through 2026. 
In Critical Care, third quarter global sales were $213 million, up 17% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. Growth was driven by contributions from all product lines, led primarily by strong HemoSphere capital sales in the U.S. Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remained in demand due to the elevated hospitalizations in the U.S. and demand for products used in high-risk surgery also grew year-over-year, in addition to demand for the ClearSight noninvasive finger cuff used in elective procedures. 
In summary, we continue to believe that Critical Care will grow revenue in the low double-digit range in 2021. We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Scott."

Today, I'll provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold and some color on what to expect at the investor conference on December 8. Total sales in the third quarter grew",911,"Thanks, Mike. Today, I'll provide additional perspective on the third quarter, along with how we anticipate the rest of the year may unfold and some color on what to expect at the investor conference on December 8. 
Total sales in the third quarter grew 14% on an underlying basis over the prior year. As indicated earlier, this strong sales growth is lower than we expected in July before the U.S. Delta surge. Earnings in the quarter of $0.54 met our expectations as COVID-related constrained spending more than offset lower-than-expected sales. As Mike mentioned, based on the improving trends with the Delta variant and our October procedure trends, we are projecting total Q4 sales of between $1.30 billion and $1.38 billion. 
As it relates to each product line, we are forecasting fourth quarter TAVR sales of $850 million to $910 million, and still have the potential to reach underlying TAVR sales growth of around 20% for the full year 2021. We are also maintaining our previous ranges for TMTT, Surgical Structural Heart and Critical Care. We continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high end of $2.07 to $2.27, with fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.53 to $0.59. 
And now I'll cover additional details of our third quarter results. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 76.3%, up from 75.5% in the same period last year when we experienced substantial costs responding to COVID. The improvement was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. Like most companies, we are seeing signs of inflation generally in things like some of the raw materials we use in production as well as shipping and logistics. 
With that said, some of the extraordinary costs we incurred when COVID hit last year have lessened, and the net result is no material impact to our gross profit margin performance or guidance for 2021. More broadly, we are continuing our investments to ensure that our supply chain is strong and resilient, and capable of delivering life-saving products for our patients. We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $364 million or 27.8% of sales compared to $307 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs and increased commercial activities compared to the COVID-impacted prior year. We are planning a sequential ramp-up of expenses in the fourth quarter as COVID-related restrictions continue to subside. We still expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding special items, to be 28% to 29%.
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 22% over the prior year to $238 million or 18.2% of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in our transcatheter innovations, including increased clinical trial activity. We are planning to increase these expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D expenses as a percentage of sales to be 17% to 18%. 
Turning to taxes. Our reported tax rate this quarter was 13% or 13.9%, excluding the impact of special items. This rate included a 320 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation. We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 4 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting. 
Foreign exchange rates increased third quarter reported sales growth by 70 basis points or $8 million compared to the prior year. At current rates, we continue to expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our third quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. And relative to our July guidance, FX rates positively impacted our third quarter earnings per share by less than $0.01. 
Free cash flow for the third quarter was $471 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $532 million, less capital spending of $61 million. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $1.1 billion. The strong cash flows are a reflection of our exceptional portfolio of patient-focused technologies that are generating returns from previous investments, which allows us to fund future internal and external opportunities. We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $3 billion in cash and investments as of September 30. 
Average shares outstanding during the third quarter were 632 million, and we continue to expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 million to 635 million guidance range. We have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase program. 
Before turning the call back over to Mike, I'll make a quick comment about our outlook for 2022. It's premature to offer detailed guidance today but we will provide 2022 financial guidance at our investor conference on December 8. In general, in 2022, we're planning on less disruption from COVID as we assume the resumption of more normalized sales and earnings growth. We will provide guidance for gross profit and operating margins as well as more visibility into any potential impact from changes in corporate tax rates. 
And with that, I'll pass it back to Mike."

And so we feel great about it from that perspective, but the pandemic ends up having impact on hospitals and their ability to be able to handle the volumes. And we find it very spotty. It's regional in nature. 
And the good news is we're watching the Delta variant come down in the U.S., and that's where we felt most of the impact. And so that's very good. Of course, there is a concern of will there be some kind of a winter surge that is not apparent at this point. So those things are always possible. We have, by and large, modeled the fact that we think things are going to get gradually better. We have taken into account where we are in October. In October, we saw run rates that were similar to what we saw in the last couple of months of Q3. And so that has also gone into our thinking. So I don't know if that answers your question, Vijay."

We're probably more impacted by the ICU capability, but it's not always the case. Sometimes it's just broadly across the hospital. So I don't have one answer for all because it tends to be a little bit more snowflakes with each hospital being a bit different, but hopefully, it provides you with a little bit of color."

In general, we tried to give you some information to let you know that October was not so dissimilar than the end of Q3. So it's not -- we didn't want to send a signal that all of a sudden, October is back to the kind of thing that we were experiencing in Q2. So we're not experiencing that kind of an environment yet. 
But we're overall optimistic. I mean we talked to a lot of folks, anecdotally. Obviously, these -- the trends that I mentioned of Delta improving is something we think is going to pay off, we think. Often that maybe TAVR is a bit of a trailing indicator of what's happening with COVID, that the cases ultimately turn into ICU stays and it probably affects our case load a little bit later.

Where do you think -- you talked about spending more in the fourth quarter, but where do you think we are maybe from a gross margin and operating expense perspective versus a no-COVID environment?

Keep in mind, we're already starting from relatively strong margins compared to our industry. So our priority has been investing aggressively on internal growth more so than on trying to expand margins. But I do think there's going to be opportunity for those margins to gradually incrementally slowly expand over time. And it's something that we try to think carefully about. 
Short term, though, to your question about COVID, it's been remarkable. Our margins have remained pretty stable despite the fact that sales are down relative to pre-COVID levels, because expenses are down as well, largely driven by things that are happening out in the field. So travel, meetings, attendance at various different societies and events, and so it's been kind of a natural hedge against the sales headwinds that we've seen from COVID and we're benefiting from that. 
To be honest, though, we'd like to see expenses go back up along with sales because it's an indication that the environment is more normalized, that we're able to invest aggressively, that we can enroll our clinical trials at the higher rates that we saw pre-COVID. And so that's sort of the way we're thinking about margins overall."

You're on a key point, and we do talk about it quite a bit inside. It's -- we don't have perfect visibility and perfect data. So much of what we rely on are anecdotal reports, where we spent a lot of time with our customers and frontline clinical specialists to try and gain some kind of perspective. It's tough for us to nail the timing and magnitude of this. But clearly, we feel like we got a small lift in Q2 from patients that came into the system that had probably deferred care. 
If we reflect back on the total pandemic, when things first stopped back in 2020, back in the March-April time frame, it's difficult for us to say that we saw those patients come back into the system. But differently, it felt like the last winter's patients did indeed, surely some of those, some small quantity showed up and supplemented Q2. So that's not a giant number, but it's additive. And we speculate the similar kind of thing might happen as a result of the patients that have deferred care during the Delta variant. 
During the Delta variant, and we're speculating again, we may indeed have had these patients that actually saw their physician and got diagnosed, but that the actual treaters in regional hotspots weren't there to provide the therapy. So we think there's some reason why this might come back exactly. When it might come back is very difficult. But as COVID wanes, we're hoping that, indeed, we see a similar phenomenon as we saw in Q2."

And to the extent that, that lessens as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, beginning of the first quarter, for example, then prospects for 2022 growth are going to be higher. 
If COVID is playing a more meaningful role in certain regions or there are hotspots that are more noticeable, then that's going to impact our growth overall. That's probably the biggest uncertainty that we have going into 2022 because overall, we feel really positive about the growth prospects for TAVR in the U.S., in Europe and Japan and in the rest of the world. 
One of the things that we were talking about earlier with this low-risk penetration, while it's difficult to calculate the actual penetration, remember the timing on low risk, where we have the data for low risk with PARTNER III at ACC in 2019, we got approval in the third quarter of 2019, and shortly thereafter, COVID became a factor and interrupted our growth for TAVR. So we haven't really had this period that's uninterrupted from COVID for any extent of time since we got the low-risk approval. And it's one of the reasons why we think they're just great growth opportunities longer term for TAVR."

So typically, we talk about sales dollar ranges and underlying growth rates based upon our forecast for how the year is going to end up when we get to December. And we'll also talk about margins, gross margin, operating margins and whatever other financial metrics we've got clarity enough on to guide to. 
As it relates to DTC, I'll start and then Mike can offer perspective as well. We think that market activation and inspiring more patients to come and to get treated is a really important part of the future and the long-term growth of TAVR. And so we are already investing some resources around getting directly to patients, to primary care physicians, to referring physicians, and we'll be doing more of that in the future. It's not aimed specifically at a patient in a particular risk category. We're trying to get to all patients, who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, and we expect that's going to be an important driver of growth."

I'll just pile on there, Anthony. Thanks. It's a good question. If you go back historically, in the early days of TAVR, we really counted on the physicians that did TAVR to educate their referring base and that's the way that we counted on the word getting out. And I don't know, we were under the impression that, that actually would be sufficient. But we've learned over the years, that's dramatically insufficient. 
And so as Scott said, we've gone on a number of roads here to make sure that the referral base is indeed, educated. We've made some good progress there. Although we're far from satisfied in terms of where we are right now. But to be really specific, if we keep going all the way upstream to consumer, we do believe that, that could be a valuable lever. We're specifically doing some experimenting in that regard and maybe have some more specific things to share with you when you come to the investor conference."

Now overall, are we pleased with what's going on in Critical Care? Is there more innovation than ever? Are they sustaining a pretty healthy growth rate that are better than I think medtech averages? I think all those are true, and we're very proud of that, and we're going to continue hitting it hard in that regard. But in terms of being able to maintain these kind of growth rates that we did in this quarter, that's not likely."

Thanks for the question on use of cash. Really, our priorities have not changed. Our first priority is to fund prospects for long-term organic growth that are generated internally, and we want to make sure that we're fully funding those platforms. We supplement that with external investments. And so we'll buy small-sized, early-stage companies, usually pre-revenue. Sometimes we invest in options to acquire companies based upon certain milestones or targets being met. 
And so beyond growth internally and externally, then we look to the balance sheet. And we've been a consistent repurchaser of shares, as you know. We're going to continue to do that opportunistically. And we think that's going to be an important way that we can give capital back to shareholders over time."

We've said this before, so I apologize for taking you through it again. But remember, this characterization of patients by high risk, intermediate risk and low risk, was the characterization done by FDA as a regulatory pathway for TAVR to help make sure that the oldest, sickest patients were treated first at the highest risk to try and minimize the risks associated with the new therapy. 
If you were to actually -- when you actually look at any patient, their key concern is not whether they're at risk surviving surgery, it's what is their risk for survival, what is it like to live with TAVR versus live with aortic stenosis. And that's the real question. So we spend less time and frankly, clinicians and patients spend less time talking about whether they're low risk or intermediate. So we really don't differentiate in that regard. 
So having said that, what do we think how did patients behave in the third quarter. We -- as I tried to infer before, we don't have perfect visibility there, but we think they were indeed seeing their doctor, they were indeed getting diagnosed, they were indeed getting screened, but there were a number of cases where the treating hospitals themselves just stopped taking patients, and that was the primary impact in the quarter."

There are a couple of different elements to our TMTT business right now. One is our commercial position in Europe, where we're selling PASCAL primarily. And then the other is clinical trial enrollment, where there is reimbursement in the U.S. 
What we're really looking for is for there to be a normalization of patient flow in both Europe and the U.S., and that's really going to be an important determinant for where things go in the fourth quarter. But we're expecting sequential growth in Q4, and that will contribute to where we end up in that range of $80 million to $100 million in expected full year sales."
