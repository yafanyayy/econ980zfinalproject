First, I would like to wish all of you a bright year ahead that includes good health and a return to a more conventional way of life for all of us.

First, I would like to wish all of you a bright year ahead that includes good health and a return to a more conventional way of life for all of us. 
As we progress through the new year, I'm exceptionally encouraged by the resiliency of our business through this unprecedented period as well as the considerable opportunities emerging for Aramark. 
This morning, I'll highlight our first quarter performance, provide insight into our immediate expectations for the business and show our progress in Aramark's accelerated growth strategies. We remain committed to unlocking significant value for our stakeholders. Importantly, we continue to promote an ownership mentality within the organization, having just approved an employee stock purchase program that provides employees an opportunity to participate more broadly as owners of the business. We believe this action will further align our people, values and performance. 
Turning now to the first quarter. Revenue was in line with expectations that we articulated in the last quarter's earnings call and subsequent disclosures with organic revenue down 36% year-over-year, consistent, consistent with fourth quarter fiscal '20 organic revenue levels. These results reflected various stages of client reopenings as well as the expected timing shift within higher education as the majority of schools we serve intentionally concluded the first quarter early to preserve the ongoing ability to keep students safely on campus. 
Our teams across the business demonstrated unwavering resolve by effectively managing and maintaining extraordinary cost discipline that resulted in an AOI drop-through rate of 20%, at the low end of our stated expectations. This dedication contributed to a free cash flow improvement of $225 million compared to the prior year period, while reflecting seasonal outflow in the quarter. 
We maintained ample cash availability with approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end. As we commence the new fiscal year, our performance demonstrated continued stability across all business segments as we navigated the effects of COVID-19 while simultaneously working with clients and preparing for a business reemergence. U.S. Food & Facilities reported an organic revenue level in line with the preceding quarter as each business sector managed various stages of client activations. We added prominent new clients for our U.S. portfolio, including most recently, Florida State University as well as drove improved retention levels. 
Education serve clients operating both in-person and hybrid learning models. As noted earlier, Higher Education reflected shortened semester schedules that also resulted in reduced catering and retail activity to typically spike during the holiday season. The second semester is currently underway. We continue to serve approximately 90% of client locations in some manner with our clients experiencing a higher student population on campus than during the fall semester. 
In K-12, the team did a tremendous job navigating through changing client operating models and strategically designing menus and customized services to meet the needs of communities. Where -- and whether the student attend classes in person or joined virtually while participating in our curbside meal pickup, as we continue to offer the universal government-sponsored meal programs. 
Approximately 70% of the districts we serve are in a hybrid setting with many districts in the process of resuming increase in personal learning. This promising progress gives us considerable optimism for the business. 
Sports, Leisure and Corrections improved slightly quarter-over-quarter as we entered the new fiscal year. Sports & Entertainment began to activate as certain NFL teams introduced bans at a limited capacity based on local regulation. The NBA and NHL are implementing various strategies for partial attendance in their upcoming games. Leisure maintained steady performance as the team ramps up for the anticipated increased activity in National Parks as we head into the spring season. Lastly, Corrections remained stable. 
We experienced a longer recovery in Business & Industry. We are developing innovative solutions to offer clients that go beyond their traditional office setting. This includes the launch of Munch Mail a few weeks ago, an exclusive home delivery option that provides curated gourmet offerings. The B&I team has already fulfilled tens of thousands of client orders across the country. 
Facilities and Other has essentially returned to historic levels, largely from significant success in [ operational ] project-oriented services. The Facilities team is currently deploying educational and digital content to clients that provide new insights related to innovations occurring within the business. We are pursuing numerous cross-selling opportunities in this area, given the heightened demand for safety and hygiene. 
Healthcare remained relatively stable, and the team has worked tirelessly to provide capabilities in telehealth and mobile ordering, in addition to offering post-care meal delivery to patient homes, extending the boundaries Aramark operates to serve clients. 
International performance improvement quarter-over-quarter was driven by the team's ability to effectively leverage our expertise in managing complex and evolving government-mandated restrictions, specifically in Europe. Our Healthcare and extractive services businesses exhibited particular resilience across the portfolio, with China once again driving nearly double-digit revenue growth. The international team continued to with broad-based new business, totaling over $100 million in the first quarter, while simultaneously delivering strong retention rates. 
Uniform services offerings remained in high demand with the team committed to implementing additional value-enhancing strategies, including the expansion of our adjacency services that drove double-digit year-over-year growth in this area. And investments in growth resources, which are already demonstrating productivity and recent sales conversions, and the ongoing implementation of our ABS route accounting system integration that provides significant scale efficiencies while offering enhanced service capabilities to clients. 
In supply chain, we are progressing well with our priorities focused on value creation, innovation, culinary collaboration and supply [indiscernible]. As we pursue this mission, we're ensuring that our operating teams have the right tools to simplify their efforts. We introduced a new system that will serve to improve spend visibility, optimize adherence to programs and uphold Aramark's commitments to sustainability, supplier diversity and local regional suppliers. This approach has proven exceedingly advantageous and represents promising future opportunity as we strategic leverage our spend pools.
Lastly, as part of Aramark's be well, do well ESG commitments, we just released our sustainability impact report that highlights our efforts to further enable equity and well-being for millions related to healthy earing initiatives, employee resource capabilities, diverse owned business partners and tuition support for qualified frontline associates. 
Our strategies are centered on sourcing responsibly and operating efficiently, while mindful of our ongoing focus on margin progression. 
Before turning it over to Tom, I would like to highlight the recent election of Bridgette Heller to Aramark's Board of Directors. Bridgette is a highly respected business leader with 35 years of experience in food, health and wellness and consumer care with an extremely impressive track record of accelerating growth of several Fortune 100 companies, while simultaneously championing diversity and inclusion. We're thrilled for the opportunity to have Bridgette join the Board and to leverage her extensive value-creating experience. 
I will now turn the call over to Tom for a detailed financial review of the business."

Before we begin, I want to also commend our teams around the globe on their collective ability to rapidly adapt to the current environment, while maintaining an unwavering commitment to safely serve our clients. T",1067,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I want to also commend our teams around the globe on their collective ability to rapidly adapt to the current environment, while maintaining an unwavering commitment to safely serve our clients. Their focus and dedication continue to be reflected in our strong operating and financial performance. As John mentioned, while our results remained impacted by COVID-19, the first quarter materialized, as we discussed on the last earnings call, including stable sequential quarterly organic revenue performance across all segments, a favorable AOI drop-through rate of 20% on corresponding revenue decline and continued effective cash flow management, resulting in an improvement in free cash flow of $225 million compared to the same quarter last year. These results enabled us to maintain ample cash availability of approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end. 
For the total company, organic revenue was down 36% in the quarter compared to the prior year, in line with the preceding quarter and a considerable improvement since the trough early in the third quarter of last year. U.S. Food & Facilities reported organic revenue decline of [ 45 ]% versus the prior year, similar to the fourth quarter. All lines of business had stable revenue trends with the exception of Higher Ed, which was unfavorably affected by the early completion of the academic semester and nearly all of our operations. 
And Facilities, which benefited from higher frequency of services provided for existing clients and increased demand for project work. International organic revenue was down 29% compared to the prior year, which reflected a modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The teams continue to effectively navigate the government-imposed restrictions while also benefiting from the impact of delivering strong new business and retention rates. Organic revenue in Uniforms decreased 10% versus the prior year, also a relatively consistent performance compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Growing demand in ancillary, safety and hygiene services was offset by increased government-imposed restrictions, particularly in Canada. The investment in additional growth resources throughout the quarter as well as improved sales productivity continues to establish the foundation for future growth within this segment. 
Company reported adjusted operating loss of $9 million in the quarter. Once again, our operating teams effectively managed in-unit product, labor and other direct costs to appropriately serve clients based on their specific needs, while preparing for an anticipated increase in business activity. This purposeful balance led to a favorable AOI drop-through rate of 20% on corresponding revenue decline.
Corporate expenses on an adjusted basis were up $7.5 million compared to the prior year, primarily from higher equity-based compensation expense put in place to reward and inspire the organization to drive shareholder value creation. Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.31 in the first quarter, largely due to interest expense, including the relate -- that related to the $1.5 billion bond issuance last April. 
On a GAAP basis, Aramark reported revenue of $2.7 billion, [ or ] an operating loss of $20 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.32. 
Now let me turn to cash flow. As is normal due to the seasonal cadence of the business, specifically within Higher Ed, free cash flow was a use of -- during the first quarter. However, through disciplined cash flow management, the outflow of $180 million was $225 million better than prior year. A strong focus on working capital, improved cash flow, more than $200 million, coupled with slightly lower capital expenditures and smaller accrued expense and deferred income payments, more than offset lower net income compared to the same quarter last year. The company's strong cash flow and liquidity position provide a platform to advance our capital allocation priorities. First, we will continue to invest in growth through the disciplined use of capital to facilitate new business wins and invest to drive results in existing client accounts. Second, we will continue to be opportunistic with targeted and accretive tuck-in acquisitions. Third, we will look to delever. As previously announced, we repaid $680 million on our [indiscernible]. Later in the quarter, we repaid an additional $416 million on our U.S. revolver and receivables facility. These proactive repayments totaling $1.1 billion are expected to result in an interest expense savings of approximately $12 million over the remainder of the fiscal year. And lastly, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through the Board's approval a week of our upcoming quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share payable on March 3 for shareholders of record on March -- sorry, on February 17. 
We continued to participate in the appropriate country-specific government assisted programs, including benefits from the Cares Act in the U.S. Through these global programs, we received approximately $38 million of labor credits in the first quarter to offset the cost we incurred globally related to the retention of employees and for absorbing 100% of the benefit cost associated with furloughed employees. 
Under the Cares Act, specifically, we had deferred remittance of federal payroll taxes as well as approximately $6 million of income tax benefits in the quarter related to NOL carryback modifications. We will continue to pursue opportunities to optimize the available stimulus programs as appropriate. Finally, I want to provide an update of our view for the remainder of the fiscal year, appreciating the pace and exact timing of the recovery is evolving. We will continue to leverage our resilient variable cost operating model, while investing in the business with a growth-oriented long term mindset. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate organic revenue improvement over the course of the year with a modest improvement in business activity in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. And adjusted operating income drop-through rate of 18% to 22% in the second quarter as a result of improved operating efficiencies while continuing to invest in growth resources and preparing for client reopenings. AOI margins are expected to sharply improve in the second half of the fiscal year as we transition from managing a drop-through rate and driving margin progression. And free cash flow for fiscal 2021 raised to neutral to positive $200 million, depending on the pace of recovery and timing of underlying revenue growth and based on the delivery of strong cash flow management results in the first quarter. 
Thanks for you this time this morning. And now I'll turn the call back over to John."

And I think that's resulting in significant improvement in retention rates, and it's being demonstrated also in our ability to sell new business around the world and have strong results throughout the throughout the international sector in the last quarter. In terms of new business growth, we're seeing strong results domestically. With respect to bidding activity, we are seeing very strong pipelines in the business, with significant additions across the enterprise, and we're also seeing significant self op conversion opportunities begin to appear across a number of different businesses, some of which would not historically have looked at outsourcing as a way of serving their customers. So we see continued opportunity in the bidding sector. The business is -- we're in the bidding of the business.

We've been very explicit about the number of people we've added in Uniform services. We added 150 last year. We're adding an additional 100 this year on the Uniform side, and that's making making significant progress, and the sales productivity is ramping up pretty rapidly. 
On the foodservice side, we continue to add resources throughout a number of the lines of business, if you will. So we did guide early on that we believe if we were in a long-term cost cutting environment that we could get drop-through down to the 15% range. But we've been very disciplined about doing what's right in terms of the long-term health of the business. We have not made a single cut to a growth part of the organization or the marketing organization. We've been very disciplined about cost containment and cost management at all levels of the company, but we're still focused on accelerating growth in the future.

First of all, we are rapidly deploying ABS throughout the business. We anticipate that we'll have somewhere in the range of 75% of our revenues covered by the end of this fiscal year and that we'll finish deployment probably through the first quarter of next year. So that by January of 2022, we'll have the vast majority, if not all of the revenues, of the company operating under ABS. 
We've undertaken this in a, obviously, a pretty difficult operating environment, but the team has done extraordinarily well. We've got multiple teams doing implementations across the enterprise. And as you are probably aware, there's certainly prework when we go ahead and do these versions in our existing facilities, plus we're converting the former facilities that were operating on ABS to the new updated versions.  So there's multiple conversions taking place. 
The -- in those locations where we've transitioned to ABS from our old route accounting system, the margin improvements are dramatic and the customer service improvements are dramatic. It allows us to spend much more time with our customers to maintain -- to have 100% customer visitation schedules, to have our in the field managing the business as opposed to having to manag the accounting aspects of it. So they are significant, and we're seeing progress across all of those operations. Those results that were demonstrated during the pilot are -- we're seeing those results replicated as we move through the organization, and we're very excited about the long-term margin enhancement potential of this conversion. 
And I think in the past, we've talked about a couple of hundred basis points margin improvement that we can articulate from the impact of ABS."

I would say there are still companies that are still wrestling with what their eventual office situations are going to look like, particularly the pure white collar kinds of locations. And I would say that the -- there's a range of viewpoints. We have many customers who are basically saying, we're coming back. We're committed to our space. We're committed to bringing our employees back together, and that's extraordinarily and important for our culture. Therefore, that's what we're going to do. And we have some companies who are evaluating -- having return-to-work strategies that include some return to the office and some work from home. 
So it's just a very broad range. Hard to say that there's any trend yet in terms of what the impact might be for the business. But the good thing is our operating model and our service capabilities, which are flexible, we can adapt to serve whatever the client wants us to do for them, whether that includes just an in-office environment or a combination of service capabilities to serve customers at home and in an office location. 
So we have been busy designing solutions to serve our customers' needs across that range of opportunities and have flexibility to go ahead and do whatever they need us to do for them. So we'll adapt. I'm very confident to that. But we have such a large range of different kinds of customers that really is, at this point, there's really no definitive model, if you will. 
In the blue collar sector, most of those companies are back to work and operating in location because they need to have employees on site in production capacities and the like. So the mixed environment, both white and blue collar operations, most of those operations are returning to work. So it will be a broad spectrum, I think, of course, for several months that evolve in business lining. That's one business where we think we really have a much longer tailwind in terms of a longer recovery period, if you will, to get that business back to some normal levels. But it's still too early to say how it will end up."

Also geographically for us, our concentration of business on the West Coast reacted pretty significantly in December to the shutdowns in California. And then the business mix across the enterprise. As you know, we have a little bit more of a hospitality focused, restaurant focused. And so the shutdowns had affected restaurant operators where they were limited to -- had to serve in limited capacity and then had to shut down during various time periods impacted us more significantly than it would have Cintas and our other competitors. 
So I think it's primarily shutdown related and geographic mix related more than anything else.
than anything else. I think in our core business, we're very comparable.

They were all renegotiated as part of our strategy with respect to responding to the changing needs for our customers during the original days of the pandemic. And they would revert to P&L when populations and facilities are back to more normalized levels, and they can report a profit and loss operation. We're hopeful that we get to the point where we'll be converting them back from management fee to P&L at some point in the future. 
In terms of our other contract types or our other verticals, if you will, they have different contract structures. In Higher Education, those contracts have been modified. We're operating under memos of understanding or letters of understanding with our university customers as they're impacted. 
But I think throughout the organization, we're committed to doing what's right for our clients and our customers. We're committed to doing our right for our shareholders. And so we'll manage through the contract change process in a very disciplined way to be able to meet everybody's needs in that respect. We've been able to do that historically. We responded very rapidly during the initial days of pandemic to change contract structures. And I anticipate we'll be able to evolve and adapt as we come out of this and don't expect any significant long-term impact with respect to the overall margins of the company or the overall profitability of the company."

It will be roughly a 1-month spring training and opening days somewhere around the first of April for teams and those teams are working with their local jurisdictions and the league to go ahead and develop approaches. 
I think the fact that the NFL was able to have a complete season without any missed games with fans in attendance, outdoors, in stadiums gives us a lot of encouragement and major league baseball will find a solution that also allows fans to be in stadiums. And that as higher vaccination rates occur and [indiscernible] some infection and hospitalization rates drop, you'll see an acceleration of the opportunity for fans to be in sports venues. 
So we anticipate that we'll have some recovery in the third and fourth quarter coming through major league baseball and sports and entertainment, and we're excited about those prospects to have fans back in ballparks."

First, I would like to wish all of you a bright year ahead that includes good health and a return to a more conventional way of life for all of us. As we progress through the new year, I'm exceptionally encouraged by the resiliency of our business through this unprecedented period as well as the considerable opportunities emerging for Aramark. 
This morning, I'll highlight our first quarter performance, provide insight into our immediate expectations for the business, ensure our progress in Aramark's accelerated growth strategies. We remain committed to unlocking significant value for our stakeholders. Importantly, we continue to promote an ownership mentality within the organization, having just approved an employee stock purchase program that provides employees an opportunity to participate more broadly as owners of the business. We believe this action will further align our people, values and performance. 
Turning now to the first quarter. Revenue was in line with expectations that we articulated in the last quarter's earnings call and subsequent disclosures with organic revenue down 36% year-over-year, consistent with fourth quarter fiscal '20 organic revenue levels. These results reflected various stages of client reopenings as well as the expected timing shift within Higher Education as the majority of schools we serve intentionally concluded their first quarter early to preserve the ongoing ability to keep students safely on campus. 
Our teams across the business demonstrated unwavering resolve by effectively managing and maintaining extraordinary cost discipline that resulted in an AOI drop-through rate of 20%, at the low end of our stated expectations. This dedication contributed to a free cash flow improvement of $225 million compared to the prior year period, while reflecting seasonal outflow in the [ first ] quarter. We maintained ample cash availability with approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end. As we commenced the new fiscal year, our performance demonstrated continued stability across all business segments as we navigated the effects of COVID-19, while simultaneously working with clients in preparing for a business reemergence. U.S. Food & Facilities reported an organic revenue level in line with the preceding quarter as each business sector managed various stages of client activations. 
We added prominent new clients for our U.S. portfolio, including most recently, Florida State University as well as drove improved retention levels. Education serve clients operating both in-person and hybrid learning models. As noted earlier, Higher Education reflected shortened semester schedules that also resulted in reduced catering and retail activity that typically spike during the holiday season. The second semester is currently underway. We continue to serve approximately 90% of client locations in some manner with our clients experiencing a higher student population on-campus than during the fall semester.
In K-12, the team did a tremendous job navigating through changing client operating models and strategically designing menus and customized services to meet the needs of communities. Where -- and whether the students attended classes in person or joined virtually while participating in our curbside meal pickup, as we continue to offer the [ universities ] government-sponsored meal programs. 
Approximately 70% of the districts we serve are in a hybrid setting with many districts in the process of resuming increase in personal learning. This promising progress gives us considerable optimism for the business.
Sports, Leisure & Corrections improved slightly quarter-over-quarter as we entered the new fiscal year. Sports & Entertainment began to activate as certain NFL teams introduced bans at a limited capacity based on local regulation. The NBA and NHL are implementing various strategies for partial attendance in their upcoming games. Leisure maintained steady performance as the team ramps up for the anticipated increased activity in National Parks as we head into the spring season. Lastly, Corrections remained stable.
We experienced a longer recovery in Business & Industry. We are developing innovative solutions to offer clients that go beyond their traditional office setting. This includes the launch of Munch Mail a few weeks ago, an exclusive home delivery option that provides curated gourmet offerings. The B&I team has already fulfilled tens of thousands of client orders across the country.  
Facilities & Other has essentially returned to historic levels, largely from significant success in offering project-oriented services. The Facilities team is currently deploying educational and digital content to clients that provide new insights related to innovations occurring within the business. We are pursuing numerous cross-selling opportunities in this area, given the heightened demand for safety and hygiene.  
Healthcare remained relatively stable, and the team has worked tirelessly to provide capabilities in telehealth and mobile ordering, in addition to offering post-care meal delivery to patient homes, extending the boundaries Aramark operates to serve clients.  
International performance improvement quarter-over-quarter was driven by the team's ability to effectively leverage our expertise in managing complex and evolving government-mandated restrictions, specifically in Europe. Our healthcare and extractive services businesses exhibited particular resilience across the portfolio, with China once again driving nearly double-digit revenue growth. The international team continued to win broad-based new business, totaling over $100 million in the first quarter, while simultaneously delivering strong retention rates.  
Uniform services offerings remained in high demand with the team committed to implementing additional value-enhancing strategies, including the expansion of our adjacency services that drove double-digit year-over-year growth in this area. And investments in growth resources, which are already demonstrating productivity and recent sales conversions, and the ongoing implementation of our ABS route accounting system integration that provides significant scale efficiencies while offering enhanced service capabilities to clients.  
In supply chain, we are progressing well with our priorities focused on value creation, innovation, culinary collaboration and supplier development. As we pursue this mission, we're ensuring that our operating teams have the right tools to simplify their efforts. We introduced a new system that will serve to improve spend visibility, optimize adherence to programs and uphold Aramark's commitments to sustainability, supplier diversity and local regional suppliers. This approach has proven exceedingly advantageous and represents promising future opportunity as we strategically leverage our spend pools. 
Lastly, as part of Aramark's Be Well. Do Well. ESG commitments, we just released our sustainability impact report that highlights our efforts to further enable equity and well-being for millions related to healthy eating initiatives, employee resource capabilities, diverse owned business partners and tuition support for qualified frontline associates. Our strategies are centered on sourcing responsibly and operating efficiently, while mindful of our ongoing focus on margin progression.  
Before turning it over to Tom, I would like to highlight the recent election of Bridgette Heller to Aramark's Board of Directors. Bridgette is a highly respected business leader with 35 years of experience in food, health and wellness and consumer care with an extremely impressive track record of accelerating growth of several Fortune 100 companies, while simultaneously championing diversity and inclusion. We're thrilled for the opportunity to have Bridgette join the Board and to leverage her extensive value-creating experience.  
I will now turn the call over to Tom for a detailed financial review of the business."

T",1068,"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I want to also commend our teams around the globe on their collective ability to rapidly adapt to the current environment, while maintaining an unwavering commitment to safely serve our clients. Their focus and dedication continue to be reflected in our strong operating and financial performance. 
As John mentioned, while our results remained impacted by COVID-19, the first quarter materialized, as we discussed on the last earnings call, including stable sequential quarterly organic revenue performance across all segments, a favorable AOI drop-through rate of 20% on corresponding revenue decline and continued effective cash flow management resulting in an improvement in free cash flow of $225 million compared to the same quarter last year. These results enabled us to maintain ample cash availability of approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end.  
For the total company, organic revenue was down 36% in the quarter compared to the prior year, in line with the preceding quarter and a considerable improvement since the trough early in the third quarter of last year. U.S. Food & Facilities reported organic revenue decline of 45% versus the prior year, similar to the fourth quarter. All lines of business had stable revenue trends with the exception of Higher Ed, which was unfavorably affected by the early completion of the academic semester and nearly all of our operations. And Facilities, which benefited from higher frequency of services provided for existing clients and increased demand for project work. 
International organic revenue was down 29% compared to the prior year, which reflected a modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The teams continue to effectively navigate the government-imposed restrictions while also benefiting from the impact of delivering strong new business and retention rates. Organic revenue in Uniforms decreased 10% versus the prior year, also a relatively consistent performance compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Growing demand in ancillary, safety and hygiene services was offset by increased government-imposed restrictions, particularly in Canada. The investment in additional growth resources throughout the quarter as well as improved sales productivity continues to establish the foundation for future growth within this segment.  
Company reported adjusted operating loss of $9 million in the quarter. Once again, our operating teams effectively managed in-unit product, labor and other direct costs to appropriately serve clients based on their specific needs, while preparing for an anticipated increase in business activity. This purposeful balance led to a favorable AOI drop-through rate of 20% on corresponding revenue decline. 
Corporate expenses on an adjusted basis were up $7.5 million compared to the prior year, primarily from higher equity-based compensation expense put in place to reward and inspire the organization to drive shareholder value creation. Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.31 in the first quarter, largely due to interest expense, including the relate -- that related to the $1.5 billion bond issuance last April. On a GAAP basis, Aramark reported revenue of $2.7 billion or an operating loss of $20 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.32.  
Now let me turn to cash flow. As is normal due to the seasonal cadence of the business, specifically within Higher Ed, free cash flow was a use of -- during the first quarter. However, through disciplined cash flow management, the outflow of $180 million was $225 million better than prior year. A strong focus on working capital, improved cash flow, more than $200 million, coupled with slightly lower capital expenditures and smaller accrued expense and deferred income payments, more than offset lower net income compared to the same quarter last year. The company's strong cash flow and liquidity position provide a platform to advance our capital allocation priorities. First, we will continue to invest in growth through the disciplined use of capital to facilitate new business wins and invest to drive results in existing client accounts. 
Second, we will continue to be opportunistic with targeted and accretive tuck-in acquisitions. Third, we will look to delever. As previously announced, we repaid $680 million on our U.S. revolving credit facility in October. Later in the quarter, we repaid an additional $416 million on our U.S. revolver and receivables facility. These proactive repayments totaling $1.1 billion are expected to result in an interest expense savings of approximately $12 million over the remainder of the fiscal year. And lastly, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through the Board's approval last week of our upcoming quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share payable on March 3 for shareholders of record on March -- sorry, on February 17.  
We continued to participate in the appropriate country-specific government-assisted programs, including benefits from the CARES Act in the U.S. Through these global programs, we received approximately $38 million of labor credits in the first quarter to offset the cost we incurred globally related to the retention of employees and for absorbing 100% of the benefit cost associated with furloughed employees.  
Under the CARES Act, specifically, we had deferred remittance of federal payroll taxes as well as approximately $6 million of income tax benefits in the quarter related to NOL carryback modifications. We will continue to pursue opportunities to optimize the available stimulus programs as appropriate. Finally, I want to provide an update of our view for the remainder of the fiscal year, appreciating the pace and exact timing of the recovery is evolving. We will continue to leverage our resilient variable cost operating model, while investing in the business with a growth-oriented long term mindset. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate organic revenue improvement over the course of the year with a modest improvement in business activity in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. 
And adjusted operating income drop-through rate of 18% to 22% in the second quarter as a result of improved operating efficiencies while continuing to invest in growth resources and preparing for client reopenings. AOI margins are expected to sharply improve in the second half of the fiscal year as we transition from managing a drop-through rate and driving margin progression. And free cash flow for fiscal 2021 raised to neutral to positive $200 million, depending on the pace of recovery and timing of underlying revenue growth and based on the delivery of strong cash flow management results in the first quarter.  
Thanks for you -- this time this morning. And now I'll turn the call back over to John."

And from a cultural perspective, the people in this organization are extraordinarily committed to doing what's right for the business and just -- and are making heroic efforts around the world to really serve their customers.  
And I think that's resulting in a significant improvement in retention rates, and it's being demonstrated also in our ability to sell new business around the world and have strong results throughout the international sector in the last quarter. In terms of new business growth, we're seeing strong results domestically. With respect to bidding activity, we are seeing very strong pipelines in the business, with significant additions across the enterprise, and we're also seeing significant self-op conversion opportunities begin to appear across a number of different businesses, some of which would not historically have looked at outsourcing as a way of serving their customers.

Firstly, on this revenue to EBIT drop-through, obviously, 18%, 20% or 22%, they're all significantly better than anyone would have assumed a year ago. But if I can be picky, global competitors like Sodexo, I would calculate that they're actually talking about a drop-through below 15% in their new guidance. And that 15% is a level you actually did acknowledge was theoretically achievable in the past. So my question is when you talk about investing in growth resources, is this something you could quantify in dollar terms? And would it be fair to assume you're probably at a 15% drop-through but then you're making those investments into the business?"

I'm not going to specifically identify the dollars to growth investments. They come across a range of different businesses. And for competitive reasons, I really don't want to disclose what I'm doing with respect to adding salespeople and sales resources. We've been very explicit about the number of people we've added in Uniform services. We added 150 last year. We're adding an additional 100 this year on the Uniform side, and that's making significant progress, and the sales productivity is ramping up pretty rapidly.  
On the food service side, we continue to add resources throughout a number of the lines of business, if you will. So we did guide early on that we believe if we were in a long-term cost-cutting environment that we could get drop-through down to the 15% range. But we've been very disciplined about doing what's right in terms of the long-term health of the business. We have not made a single cut to the growth part of the organization or the marketing organization. We've been very disciplined about cost containment and cost management at all levels of the company, but we're still focused on accelerating growth in the future. 
So I would say we're managing the business, we're controlling it very effectively. We're focused on the priorities that we have for the business, and there may be differences in terms of both mix and seasonality between us, Compass and Sodexo that might drive some of that difference as well.

First of all, we are rapidly deploying ABS throughout the business. We anticipate that we'll have somewhere in the range of 75% of our revenues covered by the end of this fiscal year and that will finish deployment probably through the first quarter of next year. So that by January of 2022, we'll have the vast majority, if not all, of the revenue company operating under ABS. We've undertaken this in, obviously, a pretty difficult operating environment, but the team has done extraordinarily well. 
We've got multiple teams doing implementations across the enterprise. And as you are probably aware, there's certainly prework when we go ahead and do these versions in our existing facilities, plus we're converting the former facilities that we're operating on ABS to the new updated versions. So there's multiple conversions taking place. The -- in those locations where we've transitioned to ABS from our old route accounting system, the margin improvements are dramatic and the customer service improvements are dramatic. 
It allows us to spend much more time with our customers to maintain -- to have 100% customer visitation schedules to have our team in the field managing the business as opposed to having managed the accounting aspects of it. So they are significant, and we're seeing progress across all of those operations. Those results that were demonstrated during the pilots are -- we're seeing those results replicated as we move through the organization, and we're very excited about the long-term margin enhancement potential of this conversion. And I think in the past, we've talked about a couple of hundred basis points margin improvement that we can articulate from the impact of ABS."

I would say there are still companies that are still wrestling with what their eventual office situations are going to look like, particularly the pure white-collar kinds of locations. And I would say that there's a range of viewpoints. We have many customers who are basically saying, we're coming back, we're committed to our space, we're committed to bringing our employees back together. And that's extraordinary and important for our culture. Therefore, that's what we're going to do. And we have some companies who are evaluating having return-to-work strategies that include some return to the office and some work from home. 
So it's just a very broad range. Hard to say that there's any trend yet in terms of what the impact might be for the business. But the good thing is our operating model and our service capabilities, which is so flexible, we can adapt to serve whatever the client wants us to do for them, whether that includes just an in-office environment or a combination of service capabilities to serve customers at-home and in-office locations. 
So we have been busy designing solutions to serve our customers' needs across that range of opportunities and have flexibility to go ahead and do whatever they need us to do for them. So we'll adapt. I'm very confident of that. But we have such a large range of different kinds of customers that really is, at this point, there's really no definitive model, if you will. In the blue-collar sector, most of those companies are back to work and operating in-location because they need to have employees on-site in production capacities and the like. 
So the mixed environment, both white and blue-collar operations, most of those operations are returning to work. So it will be a broad spectrum, I think, for several months that evolved in business dining. That's one business where we think we really have a much longer tailwind in terms of for a longer recovery period, if you will, to get that business back to some normal levels. But it's still too early to say how it will end up."

Also, geographically, for us, our concentration of business on the West Coast reacted pretty significantly in December to the shutdowns in California. And then the business mix across the enterprise. As you know, we have a little bit more of a hospitality focus, restaurant focus. 
And so the shutdowns had affected restaurant operators where they were limited to -- had to serve unlimited capacity and then had to shut down during various time periods, impacted us more significantly than it would have Cintas and our other competitors. So I think it's primarily shutdown related and geographic mix related more than anything else. I think in our core business, we're very comparable.

So today, we're operating at very high levels of retention. We've had very good results across the business. And we're very excited about that.  
We're also -- we did also include retention as the element of our incentive compensation programs for the operations team as well as sales and retention specialists.

I can't really tell you what that number is today, but we anticipate that we'll be able to sell our way through that. One of the reasons that we continue to be very bullish about this business is the productivity that our new account sales managers are delivering, both ancillary services like first aid as well as core rental revenues.

They were all renegotiated as part of our strategy with respect to responding to the changing needs for our customers during the original days of the pandemic. And they would revert to P&L when populations and facilities are back to more normalized levels, and they can report a profit and loss operation. We're hopeful that we get to the point where we'll be converting them back from management fee to P&L at some point in the future.  
In terms of our other contract types or our other verticals, if you will, they have different contract structures. For example, in Higher Education, those contracts have been modified. We're operating under memos of understanding or letters of understanding with our university customers as they're impacted.  
But I think throughout the organization, we're committed to doing what's right for our clients and our customers. We're committed to doing what's right for our shareholders. And so we'll manage through the contract change process in a very disciplined way to be able to meet everybody's needs in that respect. We've been able to do that historically. We responded very rapidly during the initial days of the pandemic to change contract structures. And I anticipate we'll be able to evolve and adapt as we come out of this and don't expect any significant long-term impact with respect to the overall margins of the company or the overall profitability of the company."

I think right now, you've got both the NHL and NBA working through crafting solutions for their arenas.

Major League Baseball for us is a significant contributor during the spring and summer months. At the present time, it looks like spring training is planned to start on time. It will be roughly a 1-month spring training and opening days somewhere around the first of April for teams. And those teams are working with their local jurisdictions and the league to go ahead and develop approaches.  
I think the fact that the NFL was able to have a complete season without any missed games with fans in attendance, outdoors, in stadiums, gives us a lot of encouragement that Major League Baseball will find a solution that also allows fans to be in stadiums. And that as higher vaccination rates occur. And instance of infection and hospitalization rates drop, you'll see an acceleration of the opportunity for fans to be in sports venues.  
So we anticipate that we'll have some recovery in the third and fourth quarter coming through Major League Baseball and Sports & Entertainment, and we're excited about those prospects to have fans back in ballparks."

First, I would like to wish all of you a bright year ahead that includes good health and a return to a more conventional way of life for all of us. As we progress through the new year, I'm exceptionally encouraged by the resiliency of our business through this unprecedented period as well as the considerable opportunities emerging for Aramark. 
This morning, I'll highlight our first quarter performance, provide insight into our immediate expectations for the business, ensure our progress in Aramark's accelerated growth strategies. We remain committed to unlocking significant value for our stakeholders. Importantly, we continue to promote an ownership mentality within the organization, having just approved an employee stock purchase program that provides employees an opportunity to participate more broadly as owners of the business. We believe this action will further align our people, values and performance. 
Turning now to the first quarter. Revenue was in line with expectations that we articulated in the last quarter's earnings call and subsequent disclosures with organic revenue down 36% year-over-year, consistent with fourth quarter fiscal '20 organic revenue levels. These results reflected various stages of client reopenings as well as the expected timing shift within Higher Education as the majority of schools we serve intentionally concluded their first quarter early to preserve the ongoing ability to keep students safely on campus. 
Our teams across the business demonstrated unwavering resolve by effectively managing and maintaining extraordinary cost discipline that resulted in an AOI drop-through rate of 20%, at the low end of our stated expectations. This dedication contributed to a free cash flow improvement of $225 million compared to the prior year period, while reflecting seasonal outflow in the [ first ] quarter. We maintained ample cash availability with approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end. As we commenced the new fiscal year, our performance demonstrated continued stability across all business segments as we navigated the effects of COVID-19, while simultaneously working with clients in preparing for a business reemergence. U.S. Food & Facilities reported an organic revenue level in line with the preceding quarter as each business sector managed various stages of client activations. 
We added prominent new clients for our U.S. portfolio, including most recently, Florida State University as well as drove improved retention levels. Education serve clients operating both in-person and hybrid learning models. As noted earlier, Higher Education reflected shortened semester schedules that also resulted in reduced catering and retail activity that typically spike during the holiday season. The second semester is currently underway. We continue to serve approximately 90% of client locations in some manner with our clients experiencing a higher student population on-campus than during the fall semester.
In K-12, the team did a tremendous job navigating through changing client operating models and strategically designing menus and customized services to meet the needs of communities. Where -- and whether the students attended classes in person or joined virtually while participating in our curbside meal pickup, as we continue to offer the [ universities ] government-sponsored meal programs. 
Approximately 70% of the districts we serve are in a hybrid setting with many districts in the process of resuming increase in personal learning. This promising progress gives us considerable optimism for the business.
Sports, Leisure & Corrections improved slightly quarter-over-quarter as we entered the new fiscal year. Sports & Entertainment began to activate as certain NFL teams introduced bans at a limited capacity based on local regulation. The NBA and NHL are implementing various strategies for partial attendance in their upcoming games. Leisure maintained steady performance as the team ramps up for the anticipated increased activity in National Parks as we head into the spring season. Lastly, Corrections remained stable.
We experienced a longer recovery in Business & Industry. We are developing innovative solutions to offer clients that go beyond their traditional office setting. This includes the launch of Munch Mail a few weeks ago, an exclusive home delivery option that provides curated gourmet offerings. The B&I team has already fulfilled tens of thousands of client orders across the country.  
Facilities & Other has essentially returned to historic levels, largely from significant success in offering project-oriented services. The Facilities team is currently deploying educational and digital content to clients that provide new insights related to innovations occurring within the business. We are pursuing numerous cross-selling opportunities in this area, given the heightened demand for safety and hygiene.  
Healthcare remained relatively stable, and the team has worked tirelessly to provide capabilities in telehealth and mobile ordering, in addition to offering post-care meal delivery to patient homes, extending the boundaries Aramark operates to serve clients.  
International performance improvement quarter-over-quarter was driven by the team's ability to effectively leverage our expertise in managing complex and evolving government-mandated restrictions, specifically in Europe. Our healthcare and extractive services businesses exhibited particular resilience across the portfolio, with China once again driving nearly double-digit revenue growth. The international team continued to win broad-based new business, totaling over $100 million in the first quarter, while simultaneously delivering strong retention rates.  
Uniform services offerings remained in high demand with the team committed to implementing additional value-enhancing strategies, including the expansion of our adjacency services that drove double-digit year-over-year growth in this area. And investments in growth resources, which are already demonstrating productivity and recent sales conversions, and the ongoing implementation of our ABS route accounting system integration that provides significant scale efficiencies while offering enhanced service capabilities to clients.  
In supply chain, we are progressing well with our priorities focused on value creation, innovation, culinary collaboration and supplier development. As we pursue this mission, we're ensuring that our operating teams have the right tools to simplify their efforts. We introduced a new system that will serve to improve spend visibility, optimize adherence to programs and uphold Aramark's commitments to sustainability, supplier diversity and local regional suppliers. This approach has proven exceedingly advantageous and represents promising future opportunity as we strategically leverage our spend pools. 
Lastly, as part of Aramark's Be Well. Do Well. ESG commitments, we just released our sustainability impact report that highlights our efforts to further enable equity and well-being for millions related to healthy eating initiatives, employee resource capabilities, diverse owned business partners and tuition support for qualified frontline associates. Our strategies are centered on sourcing responsibly and operating efficiently, while mindful of our ongoing focus on margin progression.  
Before turning it over to Tom, I would like to highlight the recent election of Bridgette Heller to Aramark's Board of Directors. Bridgette is a highly respected business leader with 35 years of experience in food, health and wellness and consumer care with an extremely impressive track record of accelerating growth of several Fortune 100 companies, while simultaneously championing diversity and inclusion. We're thrilled for the opportunity to have Bridgette join the Board and to leverage her extensive value-creating experience.  
I will now turn the call over to Tom for a detailed financial review of the business."

Before we begin, I want to also commend our teams around the globe on their collective ability to rapidly adapt to the current environment, while maintaining an unwavering commitment to safely serve our clients. Their focus and dedication continue to be reflected in our strong operating and financial performance. 
As John mentioned, while our results remained impacted by COVID-19, the first quarter materialized, as we discussed on the last earnings call, including stable sequential quarterly organic revenue performance across all segments, a favorable AOI drop-through rate of 20% on corresponding revenue decline and continued effective cash flow management resulting in an improvement in free cash flow of $225 million compared to the same quarter last year. These results enabled us to maintain ample cash availability of approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end.  
For the total company, organic revenue was down 36% in the quarter compared to the prior year, in line with the preceding quarter and a considerable improvement since the trough early in the third quarter of last year. U.S. Food & Facilities reported organic revenue decline of 45% versus the prior year, similar to the fourth quarter. All lines of business had stable revenue trends with the exception of Higher Ed, which was unfavorably affected by the early completion of the academic semester and nearly all of our operations. And Facilities, which benefited from higher frequency of services provided for existing clients and increased demand for project work. 
International organic revenue was down 29% compared to the prior year, which reflected a modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. The teams continue to effectively navigate the government-imposed restrictions while also benefiting from the impact of delivering strong new business and retention rates. Organic revenue in Uniforms decreased 10% versus the prior year, also a relatively consistent performance compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Growing demand in ancillary, safety and hygiene services was offset by increased government-imposed restrictions, particularly in Canada. The investment in additional growth resources throughout the quarter as well as improved sales productivity continues to establish the foundation for future growth within this segment.  
Company reported adjusted operating loss of $9 million in the quarter. Once again, our operating teams effectively managed in-unit product, labor and other direct costs to appropriately serve clients based on their specific needs, while preparing for an anticipated increase in business activity. This purposeful balance led to a favorable AOI drop-through rate of 20% on corresponding revenue decline. 
Corporate expenses on an adjusted basis were up $7.5 million compared to the prior year, primarily from higher equity-based compensation expense put in place to reward and inspire the organization to drive shareholder value creation. Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.31 in the first quarter, largely due to interest expense, including the relate -- that related to the $1.5 billion bond issuance last April. On a GAAP basis, Aramark reported revenue of $2.7 billion or an operating loss of $20 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.32.  
Now let me turn to cash flow. As is normal due to the seasonal cadence of the business, specifically within Higher Ed, free cash flow was a use of -- during the first quarter. However, through disciplined cash flow management, the outflow of $180 million was $225 million better than prior year. A strong focus on working capital, improved cash flow, more than $200 million, coupled with slightly lower capital expenditures and smaller accrued expense and deferred income payments, more than offset lower net income compared to the same quarter last year. The company's strong cash flow and liquidity position provide a platform to advance our capital allocation priorities. First, we will continue to invest in growth through the disciplined use of capital to facilitate new business wins and invest to drive results in existing client accounts. 
Second, we will continue to be opportunistic with targeted and accretive tuck-in acquisitions. Third, we will look to delever. As previously announced, we repaid $680 million on our U.S. revolving credit facility in October. Later in the quarter, we repaid an additional $416 million on our U.S. revolver and receivables facility. These proactive repayments totaling $1.1 billion are expected to result in an interest expense savings of approximately $12 million over the remainder of the fiscal year. And lastly, we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through the Board's approval last week of our upcoming quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share payable on March 3 for shareholders of record on March -- sorry, on February 17.  
We continued to participate in the appropriate country-specific government-assisted programs, including benefits from the CARES Act in the U.S. Through these global programs, we received approximately $38 million of labor credits in the first quarter to offset the cost we incurred globally related to the retention of employees and for absorbing 100% of the benefit cost associated with furloughed employees.  
Under the CARES Act, specifically, we had deferred remittance of federal payroll taxes as well as approximately $6 million of income tax benefits in the quarter related to NOL carryback modifications. We will continue to pursue opportunities to optimize the available stimulus programs as appropriate. Finally, I want to provide an update of our view for the remainder of the fiscal year, appreciating the pace and exact timing of the recovery is evolving. We will continue to leverage our resilient variable cost operating model, while investing in the business with a growth-oriented long term mindset. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate organic revenue improvement over the course of the year with a modest improvement in business activity in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. 
And adjusted operating income drop-through rate of 18% to 22% in the second quarter as a result of improved operating efficiencies while continuing to invest in growth resources and preparing for client reopenings. AOI margins are expected to sharply improve in the second half of the fiscal year as we transition from managing a drop-through rate and driving margin progression. And free cash flow for fiscal 2021 raised to neutral to positive $200 million, depending on the pace of recovery and timing of underlying revenue growth and based on the delivery of strong cash flow management results in the first quarter.

Wow. Okay. That's a good question. Well, first of all, we think that the messaging is resonating very well with clients and customers, that Aramark's evolution and our recommitment to a hospitality culture and serving our clients and customers has been received very, very well. And from a cultural perspective, the people in this organization are extraordinarily committed to doing what's right for the business and just -- and are making heroic efforts around the world to really serve their customers.  
And I think that's resulting in a significant improvement in retention rates, and it's being demonstrated also in our ability to sell new business around the world and have strong results throughout the international sector in the last quarter. In terms of new business growth, we're seeing strong results domestically. With respect to bidding activity, we are seeing very strong pipelines in the business, with significant additions across the enterprise, and we're also seeing significant self-op conversion opportunities begin to appear across a number of different businesses, some of which would not historically have looked at outsourcing as a way of serving their customers. 
So we see continued opportunity in the bidding sector. The business is -- or in the bidding of the business. I would say that the companies in this industry have been very disciplined about the bid process. Obviously, we're all very focused on operating our individual businesses in cost containment and cost management, but we see significant opportunity for growth going forward. And that's why we continue to invest in growth resources across the enterprise."

Firstly, on this revenue to EBIT drop-through, obviously, 18%, 20% or 22%, they're all significantly better than anyone would have assumed a year ago. But if I can be picky, global competitors like Sodexo, I would calculate that they're actually talking about a drop-through below 15% in their new guidance. And that 15% is a level you actually did acknowledge was theoretically achievable in the past. So my question is when you talk about investing in growth resources, is this something you could quantify in dollar terms? And would it be fair to assume you're probably at a 15% drop-through but then you're making those investments into the business?"

I'm not going to specifically identify the dollars to growth investments. They come across a range of different businesses. And for competitive reasons, I really don't want to disclose what I'm doing with respect to adding salespeople and sales resources. We've been very explicit about the number of people we've added in Uniform services. We added 150 last year. We're adding an additional 100 this year on the Uniform side, and that's making significant progress, and the sales productivity is ramping up pretty rapidly.  
On the food service side, we continue to add resources throughout a number of the lines of business, if you will. So we did guide early on that we believe if we were in a long-term cost-cutting environment that we could get drop-through down to the 15% range. But we've been very disciplined about doing what's right in terms of the long-term health of the business. We have not made a single cut to the growth part of the organization or the marketing organization. We've been very disciplined about cost containment and cost management at all levels of the company, but we're still focused on accelerating growth in the future. 
So I would say we're managing the business, we're controlling it very effectively. We're focused on the priorities that we have for the business, and there may be differences in terms of both mix and seasonality between us, Compass and Sodexo that might drive some of that difference as well. So -- but we think we're doing the right things for the business, and we're focused on our strategy, not theirs."

First of all, we are rapidly deploying ABS throughout the business. We anticipate that we'll have somewhere in the range of 75% of our revenues covered by the end of this fiscal year and that will finish deployment probably through the first quarter of next year. So that by January of 2022, we'll have the vast majority, if not all, of the revenue company operating under ABS. We've undertaken this in, obviously, a pretty difficult operating environment, but the team has done extraordinarily well. 
We've got multiple teams doing implementations across the enterprise. And as you are probably aware, there's certainly prework when we go ahead and do these versions in our existing facilities, plus we're converting the former facilities that we're operating on ABS to the new updated versions. So there's multiple conversions taking place. The -- in those locations where we've transitioned to ABS from our old route accounting system, the margin improvements are dramatic and the customer service improvements are dramatic. 
It allows us to spend much more time with our customers to maintain -- to have 100% customer visitation schedules to have our team in the field managing the business as opposed to having managed the accounting aspects of it. So they are significant, and we're seeing progress across all of those operations. Those results that were demonstrated during the pilots are -- we're seeing those results replicated as we move through the organization, and we're very excited about the long-term margin enhancement potential of this conversion. And I think in the past, we've talked about a couple of hundred basis points margin improvement that we can articulate from the impact of ABS."

I would say there are still companies that are still wrestling with what their eventual office situations are going to look like, particularly the pure white-collar kinds of locations. And I would say that there's a range of viewpoints. We have many customers who are basically saying, we're coming back, we're committed to our space, we're committed to bringing our employees back together. And that's extraordinary and important for our culture. Therefore, that's what we're going to do. And we have some companies who are evaluating having return-to-work strategies that include some return to the office and some work from home. 
So it's just a very broad range. Hard to say that there's any trend yet in terms of what the impact might be for the business. But the good thing is our operating model and our service capabilities, which is so flexible, we can adapt to serve whatever the client wants us to do for them, whether that includes just an in-office environment or a combination of service capabilities to serve customers at-home and in-office locations. 
So we have been busy designing solutions to serve our customers' needs across that range of opportunities and have flexibility to go ahead and do whatever they need us to do for them. So we'll adapt. I'm very confident of that. But we have such a large range of different kinds of customers that really is, at this point, there's really no definitive model, if you will. In the blue-collar sector, most of those companies are back to work and operating in-location because they need to have employees on-site in production capacities and the like. 
So the mixed environment, both white and blue-collar operations, most of those operations are returning to work. So it will be a broad spectrum, I think, for several months that evolved in business dining. That's one business where we think we really have a much longer tailwind in terms of for a longer recovery period, if you will, to get that business back to some normal levels. But it's still too early to say how it will end up."

And so frankly, we're very -- I think they're very excited about their prospects. And we've got a very good team. We're growing it. We're adding people throughout the business. 
We're adding resources to almost all of the lines of business. And so I think that's exciting for our organization to really be focused on growth, be engaged. Our entire team has incentives for growth built into their incentive compensation for this year, including the senior management of this company. So it's a singular focus and one that's got the entire company engaged, not just sales force."

And whether that's on-campus, whether it's in B&I locations or whether it's patient at-home services, we're prepared to go ahead and offer that service and have that capability designed and developed and ready to be implemented where necessary. So I think there are some parts of the business where it will become permanent, particularly in-patient delivery of meals, that in-patient at-home support is very important for the health of patients when they return from hospital setting, and that's an area that our hospital clients have really begun to focus on and find to be a very effective service offering.  
So I think it will have some more permanent implications in B&I, and we'll have solutions develop and/or we have solutions developed to go ahead and serve that need. And we'll continue to try to take advantage of that marketplace in both partnership ventures as well as direct offerings."

Does that have to do with like the geographic impact like was there more shutdowns in Canada or something like that? I'm just trying to kind of contrast that with some of the consistent growth I've seen with you beforehand. And what I'm seeing in like with Cintas, where they made more progress in the last quarter in terms of year-over-year improvements on a sequential basis.

The -- thanks for the question, Shlomo. There's really 2 differences. I think the geographic difference is one. Obviously, the restrictions in Canada have been very dramatic. So that's impacted the Canadian results much more than the U.S. results. And that -- so that is definitely a factor. Also, geographically, for us, our concentration of business on the West Coast reacted pretty significantly in December to the shutdowns in California. And then the business mix across the enterprise. As you know, we have a little bit more of a hospitality focus, restaurant focus. 
And so the shutdowns had affected restaurant operators where they were limited to -- had to serve unlimited capacity and then had to shut down during various time periods, impacted us more significantly than it would have Cintas and our other competitors. So I think it's primarily shutdown related and geographic mix related more than anything else. I think in our core business, we're very comparable. When we disaggregate the business and look at all of our competitors, we think our year-over-year growth rates are very, very similar with exception to that -- with the exception of those geographic differences and the mix difference."

I can't really tell you what that number is today, but we anticipate that we'll be able to sell our way through that. One of the reasons that we continue to be very bullish about this business is the productivity that our new account sales managers are delivering, both ancillary services like first aid as well as core rental revenues.

Obviously, in the B&I sector, those contracts are all management fee now, various few P&Ls left than that business. They were all renegotiated as part of our strategy with respect to responding to the changing needs for our customers during the original days of the pandemic. And they would revert to P&L when populations and facilities are back to more normalized levels, and they can report a profit and loss operation. We're hopeful that we get to the point where we'll be converting them back from management fee to P&L at some point in the future.  
In terms of our other contract types or our other verticals, if you will, they have different contract structures. For example, in Higher Education, those contracts have been modified. We're operating under memos of understanding or letters of understanding with our university customers as they're impacted.  
But I think throughout the organization, we're committed to doing what's right for our clients and our customers. We're committed to doing what's right for our shareholders. And so we'll manage through the contract change process in a very disciplined way to be able to meet everybody's needs in that respect. We've been able to do that historically. We responded very rapidly during the initial days of the pandemic to change contract structures. And I anticipate we'll be able to evolve and adapt as we come out of this and don't expect any significant long-term impact with respect to the overall margins of the company or the overall profitability of the company."

I think right now, you've got both the NHL and NBA working through crafting solutions for their arenas.

Major League Baseball for us is a significant contributor during the spring and summer months. At the present time, it looks like spring training is planned to start on time. It will be roughly a 1-month spring training and opening days somewhere around the first of April for teams. And those teams are working with their local jurisdictions and the league to go ahead and develop approaches.  
I think the fact that the NFL was able to have a complete season without any missed games with fans in attendance, outdoors, in stadiums, gives us a lot of encouragement that Major League Baseball will find a solution that also allows fans to be in stadiums. And that as higher vaccination rates occur. And instance of infection and hospitalization rates drop, you'll see an acceleration of the opportunity for fans to be in sports venues.  
So we anticipate that we'll have some recovery in the third and fourth quarter coming through Major League Baseball and Sports & Entertainment, and we're excited about those prospects to have fans back in ballparks."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The strategic actions we recently executed, combined with our financial results released this morning, reflect our ongoing commitment to drive the business to new heights of success. In a matter of weeks, we've announced an upsized revolving credit facility and debt refinancing, a proactive $500 million debt repayment and an acquisition that creates an additional revenue channel in the rapidly growing senior living industry. This morning, I look forward to reviewing our second quarter performance and discussing the current state of the business as we advance strategies that align with our commitment to deliver value for stakeholders.
The transformation occurring has resulted in newly awarded clients, including Northeast Georgia Hospital and a self-op conversion in the B&I sector, with the addition of Corning Inc, a Fortune 500 company and leading innovator in material science. We also expanded our role at the University of Hartford, where we earned the facilities business, another self-op conversion. With the higher ed selling season underway, we are extremely pleased to be entering into new agreements with 9 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, the largest provider of higher education in the Commonwealth. With these new agreements, we will be serving 11 state-owned colleges and universities within the state system. We're excited by these recent wins and remain highly optimistic about the extensive pipeline of opportunities.
Turning now to the second quarter. Revenue was in line with our expectations articulated in last quarter's earnings call and subsequent disclosures with organic revenue down 26% year-over-year, improving compared to the first quarter and lapping when we began to experience a significant impact from COVID in the prior year. The team's unwavering efforts to thoughtfully reopen client sites throughout the organization led to sequential quarterly revenue improvement across all segments. 
As sales volumes in the business began to reemerge more meaningfully, we maintained extraordinary cost discipline, effectively managing the AOI drop-through rate to 15%, better than our outlook of 18% to 22% and returning to positive operating margins. While we continue to invest in growth-oriented resources, AOI performance was driven by improved operating efficiencies. This disciplined approach contributed to strong free cash flow generation of nearly $260 million in the quarter, representing an improvement over -- of over $150 million compared to the prior year. Cash availability totaled $2.6 billion at quarter end, providing the financial flexibility to execute the strategic actions I just articulated, such as enhancing our capital structure and pursuing opportunistic mergers and acquisitions.
I'd now like to review the performance by business segment in the quarter. U.S. Food and Facilities reported solid sequential quarterly improvement with key drivers in each business sector. Education gained momentum as more students entered in-person learning environments compared to the fall. In higher education, we're enhancing the on-campus experience to offer university communities added stability, flexibility, connection, light-mindedness and innovation. Our unique approach to creating a hospitality ecosystem was recently highlighted in Food Management Magazine.
In the K-12 sector, approximately 70% of school districts across the U.S. offer greater in-person or hybrid learning with the USDA continuing its universal meal program just extended through June of 2022. Sports, Leisure and Corrections improved modestly with the anticipated spring season just underway. In the second quarter, the NBA and NHL introduced fans at partial capacity based on local regulation. Leisure maintained steady performance with solid early attendance at National Parks and Corrections reported year-over-year growth.
In recent weeks, we've seen an encouraging opening of Major League Baseball with our portfolio collectively operating at approximately 1/3 of attendance capacity at this time, and we expect increasing fan counts over the course of the season. We've implemented innovative technology, including self-ordering kiosks, mobile ordering, grab-and-go markets, just to name a few.
In Leisure, we are experiencing record reservation demand for the upcoming recreational season. In Business & Industry, additional client locations opened throughout the quarter, while companies adopt evolving return-to-work strategies. We are experiencing early signs of success in solutions that extend the traditional office setting, including Munch Mail, our home delivery offering, launched last quarter that has already experienced increased online ordering traffic with conversion rates doubling.
Quick Eats, our award-winning walk-in, walkout digital concept utilizing Artificial Intelligence, is another business offering that is strongly resonating with our clients and has applicability to other areas of the business. Facilities and Other demonstrated success in selling more frequent and comprehensive services as clients remain heavily focused on safety and hygiene, particularly as locations began to increase in-person activity. We continue to anticipate particularly heightened demand in this business.
Health care continued to report gradual improvement as visitor restrictions eased and elective procedures increased. The team has worked tirelessly to create unique automated patient care experiences from the time of admission through discharge that include customized post-care emulation to best serve ongoing dietary needs.
International demonstrated modest improvement quarter-over-quarter, balancing strong performance from health care in China and extractive services in Chile, with government-imposed restrictions in other geographies, particularly in Europe and Canada. The team continues to impressively pursue growth, now having won over $150 million in broad-based new business since the start of the fiscal year, while simultaneously delivering record retention rates.
I'm also extraordinarily pleased to announce the addition of Chris [indiscernible], a seasoned foodservice industry executive, who many of you likely know. Chris joins us next week to lead our international growth strategies.
Uniform reported improved quarter -- improvement quarter-over-quarter, while aggressively managing areas of the business that were affected by government-imposed restrictions, particularly in Canada. We continue to focus on value-enhancing initiatives, including adjacency services expansion, which once again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, strong productivity from investments and growth resources that have resulted in improved retention rates and improved closure rates, and ongoing progress in our ABS integration with this capability-enhancing system on track to reach nearly 75% of revenues by year-end, with the remaining market centers shortly to follow. These efforts collectively contributed to record high customer satisfaction scores.
In supply chain, we continue to optimize our spend pools and refine our relationships with the right suppliers to provide the best economics and access to innovative products. We are also focused on our commitments to diversed suppliers, local and regional suppliers and sustainability are leveraged.
In addition, our simplification efforts with field procurement technology and process optimization are making considerable progress. We launched our employee stock purchase plan to all eligible U.S. employees in early April, with the goal of expanding globally. The program delivered very strong participation in its first enrollment period with over 85% of those enrolled set to become first-time Aramark shareholders. This initiative aligns our people, values and performance while reinforcing an ownership mindset within the organization.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to take a moment to review our recent agreement to acquire Next Level Hospitality announced 2 weeks ago. Next Level will strategically expand our presence in health care within the high-growth senior living industry, specializing in skilled nursing and rehabilitation facilities. This provides an opportunity to immediately participate in a largely unpenetrated, highly self-operated category with significant untapped potential to best serve this growing demographic. The business commands comparable margins to us, driven by culinary innovation, quality service offerings and client excellence. We know the team extremely well and are excited to work together in driving our combined capabilities and expertise.
Lastly, I would like to share that Jeff Gilliam, who leads our health care division, will retire at the end of this calendar year. I want to thank Jeff for his many contributions to the company. I'm also pleased to welcome Bart Carreker as our President and CEO for Healthcare. Bart is a health care veteran with over 20 years of industry experience. Throughout his career, Bart has played an instrumental role in driving significant growth, improving closure rates and building a culture focused on growth. We look forward to Bart's meaningful contributions.
And Tom will now provide a detailed financial review of the business."

As John mentioned, during the quarter and specifically over the past few weeks, we continue to execute strategies that strengthen the business, whether it's bringing in new talent, acquiring new businesses, driving operating efficiencies or repaying debt. We are committed to positioning the company for profitable growth and to provide exceptional service to our clients and customers. 
While our performance remains affected by COVID-19, revenue in the quarter reached over 70% of fiscal '19 levels. Increased business activity throughout the portfolio and strong client retention rates contributed to improved revenue performance across all segments. U.S. Food and Facilities reported an organic revenue decline of 31% in the quarter compared to a 45% decline in the first quarter, with all sectors contributing to the improvement, a solid quarter-over-quarter result even as we begin to overlap the effect of COVID that, as a reminder, started towards the end of the second quarter last year.
Progress was led by the education sector, which benefited from greater in-person learning and the heightened demand in Facilities & Other from higher frequency of services as well as increased project-oriented activity. International organic revenue was down 26% compared to the prior year, reflecting a modest improvement from the previous quarter.
The team continues to tactically navigate government-imposed restrictions, particularly in Europe and Canada, while simultaneously driving growth initiatives. We're extremely excited about the addition of Chris [indiscernible], as John mentioned, with extensive background in the industry, who further complement the strong and experienced international team. Organic revenue in Uniforms decreased 9% versus the prior year, a slight improvement over the first quarter. Early signs of accelerated client reopenings from areas of the business that have been heavily impacted by COVID-19 as well as continued growth in revenues from adjacency services were offset by continued lockdowns in Canada and the U.S. West Coast operations.
Adjusted operating income was $30 million in the quarter. Increased sales volume, combined with unit operating efficiencies and above-unit cost discipline, led to a positive adjusted operating margin of 1.1% and an AOI drop-through of 15% of the corresponding revenue decline. Bottom line performance was better than the previously articulated expectation of an 18% to 22% drop-through for the quarter and included continued investment in growth resources and the ABS route system rollout in the Uniform segment.
Corporate expenses increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher personnel and benefit costs, including the impact of equity-based compensation awards made late last fiscal year, expense related to the rollout of the new employee stock purchase plan, 401(k) company match cost and bonus accrual compared to the same quarter last year.
Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.24. Due to our proactive $1.1 billion debt repayment of our U.S. revolver and receivables facility, interest expense in the second quarter was $4 million less than in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, Aramark reported revenue of $2.8 billion, operating income of $5 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.30.
Now let me turn to cash flow. Through positive operating income performance as well as effective management of working capital and capital expenditures, the company generated $259 million in free cash flow during the quarter, reflecting $151 million improvement compared to the prior year period. Note that the quarter included a $94 million federal income tax refund due to NOL carrybacks in fiscal 2020 associated with the CARES Act. Smaller crude expenses within the SME business and lower deferred income payments within Higher Ed also contributed to the favorable year-over-year free cash flow result.
In addition, we continue to participate in the appropriate country-specific government assistance programs, including benefits from the CARES Act in the U.S. Through these global programs, we received approximately $42 million of labor credits in the second quarter to offset the costs we incurred globally related to the retention of employees and for absorbing 100% of the benefit costs associated with furloughed employees. We will continue to pursue opportunities to optimize the available stimulus programs as appropriate.
Strong free cash flow performance resulted in cash availability of $2.6 billion at quarter end. Consequently, we made strategic use of capital to advance our priorities and included debt repayment as well as refinancing to extend maturities and executing an upsized revolver. Collectively, the actions taken on capital structure will reduce net annual interest expense by over $14 million, of which approximately $4 million of that savings will benefit the remainder of the year.
Going forward, we will continue to look at additional deleveraging opportunities, but balance that with the disciplined use of capital investment to facilitate new business wins and drive results in existing client accounts as well as pursue selective accretive M&A.
On the topic of mergers and acquisitions, I want to share additional insight regarding our recent announcement of an agreement to acquire Next Level Hospitality. Founded less than 5 years ago, this business has quickly grown to over $160 million in annual revenues, highlighting the growth potential in the $16 billion highly underpenetrated senior living industry. New contracts require minimal start-up costs and have a strong profitability ramp. The business has generated high single-digit operating margins and is focused on providing a premier culinary experience and high-quality environmental services. Next Level will continue to be run separately under its own brand, but we will leverage the full scale of Aramark's resources where appropriate to help the accelerate the business' growth. We expect Next Level to be accretive to Aramark's earnings by early fiscal '22, and the deal is expected to close later this quarter, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.
We continued our commitment to return value to shareholders with the announcement this morning of our quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share payable on June 9 to shareholders of record on May 26. 
And finally, let me wrap up with an update of our view of the second half of the fiscal year, appreciating the pace and exact timing of recovery is evolving. We are encouraged by the current momentum of the business, and we'll continue to leverage our resilient variable cost operating model, while maintaining a growth-oriented long-term mindset. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate continued organic revenue improvement over the course of the fiscal year, adjusted operating income margin of 4% to 4.5% in the second half of the fiscal year with incremental quarterly progression and free cash flow of neutral to $250 million for fiscal 2021 depending on the timing of underlying revenue recovery raised by $50 million on the top end of the range. This will include efficiently managing working capital and CapEx investments associated with reemerging business activity and the pipeline of the new opportunities we have in front of us.
Thanks for your time this morning. Now I'll turn the call back over to John."

So really just a timing issue.

Contractually, in many cases, we're able to pass that on, particularly in this environment, more of a cost loss-based environment. Same thing on labor, probably a little bit more pressure. But as I've said before, it's the one certainty, in my 20-plus years in the industry, is there's labor inflation, labor pressure. So it's not anything we haven't dealt with. But we do see opportunity or opportunities to mitigate those costs, but also we'll feel the labor pressures over the next couple of quarters as things settle down.

And so I think the long-term payback for those investments is quickly becoming evident, and we're continuing to be disciplined from a cost management perspective, but we're focused on the long-term growth of this enterprise as being the real driver of long-term shareholder value creation. And so we're disciplined but focused, and we'll continue to be."

It's an area where we haven't participated for many years. We were not focused on that segment. And frankly, the -- our larger competitors haven't really been focused on this segment either. They have relatively small positions in it as well.
Next Level was very attractive because of the quality of the management team, the organization that they have been able to build in a very short period of time and their focus on a high-end culinary solution in a segment that traditionally didn't have that as a solution. So they've been able to grow the business very, very rapidly by offering a great combination of management talent as well as culinary capability. And that's why we've selected to operate that brand independently.
Next Level management team will continue that growth focus. And we're excited about those prospects. Really, it's an area that we believe we compete -- we can compete very aggressively in and grow very rapidly, and that it does have significant self-op conversion potential. And the business is much more oriented towards systems kind of sales now than it has been historically. Instead of one-off facility sales, there are system sales with large chunky opportunities. So that's what attracted us not only to the sector but to max level as a company, mostly the quality of the management team and the significant growth potential that's there in that segment."

We bring procurement opportunities for them, of course. So those are the 2 basic sort of blocking and tackling benefits. But I think there's also a culinary innovation and level of resource that we bring that we can add to what they've already brought to the industry.
And then facility technology We've got a very advanced group and advanced set of technologies in our cleaning and environmental services, and we'll pair that up with theirs and hopefully make both better and advance those.

No, I would say we're definitely not losing share. In fact, I would say, based on the level of new closures and the very high retention rates that we are maintaining or improving share in large part, I think there are 2 phenomenon that are occurring that caused that variation, one of which is the geographic presence in Canada. In our orientation in terms of the West Coast, as you know, the restrictions in California have been very strict. And so that business has been slower to respond. So I think our geographic orientation has been part of the issue in terms of the comp as well as our focus on hospitality and linen in the hospitality sector, both domestically and in Canada. So are those 2 issues really account for the vast majority of the difference. 
And as we see the business, as we see restrictions ease, we can see the rate of sales and the rate of average weekly rental volumes tick up almost instantaneously. So as the state of California normalizes, we'll see significant improvement there. And Canada is the same way. It's been very restrictive in Canada. So our business operations there are working very, very hard just to maintain the level of service and the sales that they have. So I would say those are the 2 reasons. And we do a very deep dive operating review in the business literally every month. And as we walk through the data, as we look through the data, those are the 2 areas that are evident to us."

If you think back to our previous discussions, that -- the mix of cost-plus contracts changed dramatically as a result of the implementation in -- particularly in the B&I sector, to that type of contract. And we haven't seen a significant shift back towards P&L. We do anticipate that as companies come back and reach and have their employees back in operations, that we will transition those contracts over time. But today, I would say there hasn't really been a significant shift. We're still operating at very high levels of management fee agreements or cost-plus agreements in the B&I sector.
In the other businesses, higher education, we've transitioned back to our normal agreements under most circumstances. So it's really more of a B&I phenomenon than anything else. And that will take time to convert as employees come back into their work environments."

I would say, well, certainly, COVID has masked the impact of the work that's been done. We continue to invest in people and in resources in order to accelerate the organic growth rate across all the businesses. And so each of the business units has developed a 3-year plan with respect to growth expectations. They're working through those 3-year plans. There is phased investment in each of the years. And we're working very aggressively to go ahead and achieve those individualized plans that the business units have put together.
So we won't quantify the dollar amount, but I would tell you, it is a significant investment on the part of the company. You'll see it in the earnings over the course of time as we continue to grow the business and accelerate the growth rate. And the return, every time we add resources, we have a high expectation for those to return to profitability and to improve the ROIC in the businesses.
So it's a disciplined approach. It's a measured approach. It's a multiyear approach, and we're very happy with what we've been able to achieve so far. And it will become more and more evident as COVID recedes and you see the new account wins and the retention rates continue to rise."

Just going back to the margin guidance, and I appreciate the comments that you're moving more towards thinking of the absolute margin. But I mean if we just look at where consensus sits in revenues for the second half of at $6.4 billion. It's going to imply a drop-through to get that margin of between 6% and 9%, which is a pretty meaningful step change there. And so given that it's already pretty strong at 15%, is either that or you're beginning to see a reason to believe that the recovery comes much, much faster than it's currently anticipated by the market. So just wondering if you could give us some color on that? And whether there's any other moving parts in the second half that's going to make that drop through looks so much better to give you the 4% to 4.5% margin?"

We feel comfortable with the 4% to 4.5%. Again, slightly revenue dependent. But as we talked about before, as long as we continue to progress at the rate we have seen over the last 2 or 3 quarters, again, April is in line with that expectation, we feel good about hitting that range. We don't need -- we don't expect to need an accelerated recovery in the second half of the year to achieve it. So I think that's probably the best color I can give you at the moment.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The strategic actions we recently executed, combined with our financial results released this morning, reflect our ongoing commitment to drive the business to new heights of success. In a matter of weeks, we've announced an upsized revolving credit facility and debt refinancing, a proactive $500 million debt repayment and an acquisition that creates an additional revenue channel in the rapidly growing senior living industry. 
This morning, I look forward to reviewing our second quarter performance and discussing the current state of the business as we advance strategies that align with our commitment to deliver value for stakeholders. 
The transformation occurring has resulted in newly awarded clients, including Northeast Georgia Hospital and a self-op conversion in the B&I sector, with the addition of Corning Inc, a Fortune 500 company and leading innovator in material science. We also expanded our role at the University of Hartford, where we earned the facilities business, another self-op conversion. With the higher ed selling season underway, we are extremely pleased to be entering into new agreements with 9 universities of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, the largest provider of higher education in the Commonwealth. With these new agreements, we will be serving 11 state-owned colleges and universities within the state system. We're excited by these recent wins and remain highly optimistic about the extensive pipeline of opportunities. 
Turning now to the second quarter. Revenue was in line with our expectations articulated in last quarter's earnings call and subsequent disclosures with organic revenue down 26% year-over-year, improving compared to the first quarter and lapping when we began to experience a significant impact from COVID in the prior year. The team's unwavering efforts to thoughtfully reopen client sites throughout the organization led to sequential quarterly revenue improvement across all segments.  
As sales volumes in the business began to reemerge more meaningfully, we maintained extraordinary cost discipline, effectively managing the AOI drop-through rate to 15%, better than our outlook of 18% to 22% and returning to positive operating margins. While we continue to invest in growth-oriented resources, AOI performance was driven by improved operating efficiencies. This disciplined approach contributed to strong free cash flow generation of nearly $260 million in the quarter, representing an improvement over -- of over $150 million compared to the prior year. Cash availability totaled $2.6 billion at quarter end, providing the financial flexibility to execute the strategic actions I just articulated, such as enhancing our capital structure and pursuing opportunistic mergers and acquisitions.  
I'd now like to review the performance by business segment in the quarter. U.S. Food and Facilities reported solid sequential quarterly improvement with key drivers in each business sector. Education gained momentum as more students entered in-person learning environments compared to the fall. In higher education, we're enhancing the on-campus experience to offer university communities added stability, flexibility, connection, light-mindedness and innovation. Our unique approach to creating a hospitality ecosystem was recently highlighted in Food Management Magazine.  
In the K-12 sector, approximately 70% of school districts across the U.S. offer greater in-person or hybrid learning with the USDA continuing its universal meal program just extended through June of 2022. Sports, Leisure & Corrections improved modestly with the anticipated spring season just underway. In the second quarter, the NBA and NHL introduced fans at partial capacity based on local regulation. Leisure maintained steady performance with solid early attendance at National Parks and Corrections reported year-over-year growth.  
In recent weeks, we've seen an encouraging opening of Major League Baseball with our portfolio collectively operating at approximately 1/3 of attendance capacity at this time, and we expect increasing fan counts over the course of the season. We've implemented innovative technology, including self-ordering kiosks, mobile ordering, grab-and-go markets, just to name a few.  
In Leisure, we are experiencing record reservation demand for the upcoming recreational season. In Business & Industry, additional client locations opened throughout the quarter, while companies adopt evolving return-to-work strategies. We are experiencing early signs of success in solutions that extend the traditional office setting, including Munch Mail, our home delivery offering, launched last quarter that has already experienced increased online ordering traffic with conversion rates doubling.  
QuickEats, our award-winning walk-in, walkout digital concept utilizing Artificial Intelligence, is another business offering that is strongly resonating with our clients and has applicability to other areas of the business. Facilities and Other demonstrated success in selling more frequent and comprehensive services as clients remained heavily focused on safety and hygiene, particularly as locations began to increase in-person activity. We continue to anticipate particularly heightened demand in this business.  
Health care continue to report gradual improvement as visitor restrictions eased and elective procedures increased. The team has worked tirelessly to create unique automated patient care experiences from the time of admission through discharge that include customized post-care meal delivery to best serve ongoing dietary needs.  
International demonstrated modest improvement quarter-over-quarter, balancing strong performance from health care in China and extractive services in Chile, with government-imposed restrictions in other geographies, particularly in Europe and Canada. The team continues to impressively pursue growth, now having won over $150 million in broad-based new business since the start of the fiscal year, while simultaneously delivering record retention rates.  
I'm also extraordinarily pleased to announce the addition of Chris Garside, a seasoned foodservice industry executive, who many of you likely know. Chris joins us next week to lead our international growth strategies.  
Uniform reported improved quarter -- improvement quarter-over-quarter, while aggressively managing areas of the business that were affected by government-imposed restrictions, particularly in Canada. We continue to focus on value-enhancing initiatives, including adjacency services expansion, which once again delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, strong productivity from investments and growth resources that have resulted in improved retention rates and improved closure rates, and ongoing progress in our ABS integration with this capability-enhancing system on track to reach nearly 75% of revenues by year-end, with the remaining market centers shortly to follow. These efforts collectively contributed to record high customer satisfaction scores.  
In supply chain, we continue to optimize our spend pools and refine our relationships with the right suppliers to provide the best economics and access to innovative products. We are also focused on our commitments to diversed suppliers, local and regional suppliers and sustainability are leveraged.  
In addition, our simplification efforts with field procurement technology and process optimization are making considerable progress. We launched our employee stock purchase plan to all eligible U.S. employees in early April, with the goal of expanding globally. The program delivered very strong participation in its first enrollment period with over 85% of those enrolled set to become first-time Aramark shareholders. This initiative aligns our people, values and performance while reinforcing an ownership mindset within the organization.  
Before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to take a moment to review our recent agreement to acquire Next Level Hospitality announced 2 weeks ago. Next Level will strategically expand our presence in health care within the high-growth senior living industry, specializing in skilled nursing and rehabilitation facilities. This provides an opportunity to immediately participate in a largely unpenetrated, highly self-operated category with significant untapped potential to best serve this growing demographic. The business commands comparable margins to us, driven by culinary innovation, quality service offerings and client excellence. We know the team extremely well and are excited to work together in driving our combined capabilities and expertise.  
Lastly, I would like to share that Jeff Gilliam, who leads our health care division, will retire at the end of this calendar year. I want to thank Jeff for his many contributions to the company. I'm also pleased to welcome Bart Kaericher as our President and CEO for Healthcare. Bart is a health care veteran with over 20 years of industry experience. Throughout his career, Bart has played an instrumental role in driving significant growth, improving closure rates and building a culture focused on growth. We look forward to Bart's meaningful contributions.  
And Tom will now provide a detailed financial review of the business."

As John mentioned, during the quarter and specifically over the past few weeks, we continue to execute strategies that strengthen the business, whether it's bringing in new talent, acquiring new businesses, driving operating efficiencies or repaying debt. We are committed to positioning the company for profitable growth and to provide exceptional service to our clients and customers.  
While our performance remains affected by COVID-19, revenue in the quarter reached over 70% of fiscal '19 levels. Increased business activity throughout the portfolio and strong client retention rates contributed to improved revenue performance across all segments. U.S. Food and Facilities reported an organic revenue decline of 31% in the quarter compared to a 45% decline in the first quarter, with all sectors contributing to the improvement, a solid quarter-over-quarter result even as we begin to overlap the effect of COVID that, as a reminder, started towards the end of the second quarter last year.  
Progress was led by the education sector, which benefited from greater in-person learning and the heightened demand in Facilities & Other from higher frequency of services as well as increased project-oriented activity. International organic revenue was down 26% compared to the prior year, reflecting a modest improvement from the previous quarter.  
The team continues to tactically navigate government-imposed restrictions, particularly in Europe and Canada, while simultaneously driving growth initiatives. We're extremely excited about the addition of Chris Garside, as John mentioned, with extensive background in the industry, who further complement the strong and experienced international team. Organic revenue in Uniforms decreased 9% versus the prior year, a slight improvement over the first quarter. Early signs of accelerated client reopenings from areas of the business that have been heavily impacted by COVID-19 as well as continued growth in revenues from adjacency services were offset by continued lockdowns in Canada and the U.S. West Coast operations.  
Adjusted operating income was $30 million in the quarter. Increased sales volume, combined with unit operating efficiencies and above-unit cost discipline, led to a positive adjusted operating margin of 1.1% and an AOI drop-through of 15% of the corresponding revenue decline. Bottom line performance was better than the previously articulated expectation of an 18% to 22% drop-through for the quarter and included continued investment in growth resources and the ABS route system rollout in the Uniform segment.  
Corporate expenses increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher personnel and benefit costs, including the impact of equity-based compensation awards made late last fiscal year, expense related to the rollout of the new employee stock purchase plan, 401(k) company match cost and bonus accrual compared to the same quarter last year.  
Adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.24. Due to our proactive $1.1 billion debt repayment of our U.S. revolver and receivables facility, interest expense in the second quarter was $4 million less than in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, Aramark reported revenue of $2.8 billion, operating income of $5 million and a diluted loss per share of $0.30.  
Now let me turn to cash flow. Through positive operating income performance as well as effective management of working capital and capital expenditures, the company generated $259 million in free cash flow during the quarter, reflecting $151 million improvement compared to the prior year period. Note that the quarter included a $94 million federal income tax refund due to NOL carrybacks in fiscal 2020 associated with the CARES Act. Smaller crude expenses within the SME business and lower deferred income payments within Higher Ed also contributed to the favorable year-over-year free cash flow result.  
In addition, we continue to participate in the appropriate country-specific government assistance programs, including benefits from the CARES Act in the U.S. Through these global programs, we received approximately $42 million of labor credits in the second quarter to offset the costs we incurred globally related to the retention of employees and for absorbing 100% of the benefit costs associated with furloughed employees. We will continue to pursue opportunities to optimize the available stimulus programs as appropriate.  
Strong free cash flow performance resulted in cash availability of $2.6 billion at quarter end. Consequently, we made strategic use of capital to advance our priorities and included debt repayment as well as refinancing to extend maturities and executing an upsized revolver. Collectively, the actions taken on capital structure will reduce net annual interest expense by over $14 million, of which approximately $4 million of that savings will benefit the remainder of the year.  
Going forward, we will continue to look at additional deleveraging opportunities, but balance that with the disciplined use of capital investment to facilitate new business wins and drive results in existing client accounts as well as pursue selective accretive M&A.  
On the topic of mergers and acquisitions, I want to share additional insight regarding our recent announcement of an agreement to acquire Next Level Hospitality. Founded less than 5 years ago, this business has quickly grown to over $160 million in annual revenues, highlighting the growth potential in the $16 billion highly underpenetrated senior living industry. New contracts require minimal start-up costs and have a strong profitability ramp. The business has generated high single-digit operating margins and is focused on providing a premier culinary experience and high-quality environmental services. Next Level will continue to be run separately under its own brand, but we will leverage the full scale of Aramark's resources where appropriate to help the accelerate the business' growth. We expect Next Level to be accretive to Aramark's earnings by early fiscal '22, and the deal is expected to close later this quarter, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.  
We continued our commitment to return value to shareholders with the announcement this morning of our quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share payable on June 9 to shareholders of record on May 26.  
And finally, let me wrap up with an update of our view of the second half of the fiscal year, appreciating the pace and exact timing of recovery is evolving. We are encouraged by the current momentum of the business, and we'll continue to leverage our resilient variable cost operating model, while maintaining a growth-oriented long-term mindset. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate continued organic revenue improvement over the course of the fiscal year, adjusted operating income margin of 4% to 4.5% in the second half of the fiscal year with incremental quarterly progression and free cash flow of neutral to $250 million for fiscal 2021 depending on the timing of underlying revenue recovery raised by $50 million on the top end of the range. This will include efficiently managing working capital and CapEx investments associated with reemerging business activity and the pipeline of the new opportunities we have in front of us.  
Thanks for your time this morning. Now I'll turn the call back over to John."

As I've always thought about Aramark part of our really encouraging thesis was the potential to accelerate the organic growth, given some of the balance sheet actions, obviously, coupled with next level, things like that, how should we think about the potential to accelerate the organic growth and even coming out of COVID, it seems like clearly you're going to be a share gainer.

That particular business has performed very well during the pandemic throughout, and we expect it to continue to have very strong growth prospects going forward.

So there would be a working capital outlay to really reopen the NFL stadiums coming back full, higher ed coming back full and sort of that push right there at the end of the fiscal that would create a work capital outflow to prep but not have him the benefit of the revenues and profitability in the year. So really just a timing issue.

And so if the pace of recovery accelerates, we'll be well positioned to take advantage of that. It really will be driven by our clients' interactions and decision-making with respect to how fast they bring back employees or associates and it will also be driven by rates of vaccination and rates of improvement in the Sports & Entertainment sector. 
So we're well positioned. We see -- as many do, we see some light at the end of the tunnel. A little bit early yet to make the call in terms of how that will unfold over the course of the next few months, but we're excited by the opportunity in front of us."

That particular win, I think all of our -- all of the business success that we typically enjoy across the range of businesses is because we have developed a proposal and a customized solution that fits the needs of that particular customer.
And so in the case of the patchy win, I think our team demonstrated to the Pennsylvania system that we understood their needs and very effectively, that we've had a strong partnership in the past and some of the universities that we had already served. And so the result of that, both very good performance as well as, I think, an extraordinary proposal resulted in their selecting Aramark for that win.
So we're always focused on the quality of the solution, the customization and the solution set that best fits that customer's needs. And that's what typically drives our wins, not only in higher education, but across our various businesses.
And so yes, we are out there in the market. We strongly believe that we're going to have a very strong selling season and a very strong fall as businesses continue to reopen and higher education reopens fully. And so we are out there hiring people very, very rapidly."

Contractually, in many cases, we're able to pass that on, particularly in this environment, more of a cost loss-based environment. Same thing on labor, probably a little bit more pressure. But as I've said before, it's the one certainty, in my 20-plus years in the industry, is there's labor inflation, labor pressure. So it's not anything we haven't dealt with. But we do see opportunity or opportunities to mitigate those costs, but also we'll feel the labor pressures over the next couple of quarters as things settle down.

Next Level was very attractive because of the quality of the management team, the organization that they have been able to build in a very short period of time and their focus on a high-end culinary solution in a segment that traditionally didn't have that as a solution. So they've been able to grow the business very, very rapidly by offering a great combination of management talent as well as culinary capability. And that's why we've selected to operate that brand independently.
Next Level management team will continue that growth focus. And we're excited about those prospects. Really, it's an area that we believe we compete -- we can compete very aggressively in and grow very rapidly, and that it does have significant self-op conversion potential. And the business is much more oriented towards systems kind of sales now than it has been historically. And instead of one-off facility sales, there are system sales with large chunky opportunities.

We bring procurement opportunities for them, of course. So those are the 2 basic sort of blocking and tackling benefits. But I think there's also a culinary innovation and level of resource that we bring that we can add to what they've already brought to the industry.

And we're seeing a lot of proactive renewals of contracts in the organization. So I would say it's a combination of 2 things: improved retention has come as a result of that proactive effort as well as the recognition of many organizations of the quality of the job that Aramark had done during both pre and during the pandemic. So I think that's driving retention more than anything else. But we are seeing increased activity across the various business units in terms of bid processes.

So we did look at some opportunities. I would say that, that has been relatively quiet. The kinds of opportunities we're looking for are really strategic extensions into markets that represent both new opportunities from a self-op conversion perspective as well as kind of capability and service extension opportunities in our core business. So we do have a very active pipeline of opportunities that we're always considering, but we will be very disciplined. M&A is not our primary growth strategy, organic growth is our primary strategy.

No, I would say we're definitely not losing share. In fact, I would say, based on the level of new closures and the very high retention rates that we are maintaining or improving share in large part, I think there are 2 phenomenon that are occurring that caused that variation, one of which is the geographic presence in Canada. In our orientation in terms of the West Coast, as you know, the restrictions in California have been very strict. And so that business has been slower to respond. So I think our geographic orientation has been part of the issue in terms of the comp as well as our focus on hospitality and linen in the hospitality sector, both domestically and in Canada. So are those 2 issues really account for the vast majority of the difference. 
And as we see the business, as we see restrictions ease, we can see the rate of sales and the rate of average weekly rental volumes tick up almost instantaneously. So as the state of California normalizes, we'll see significant improvement there. And Canada is the same way. It's been very restrictive in Canada. So our business operations there are working very, very hard just to maintain the level of service and the sales that they have. So I would say those are the 2 reasons. And we do a very deep dive operating review in the business literally every month. And as we walk through the data, as we look through the data, those are the 2 areas that are evident to us."

But if we just take a step back and look at the last year of wins, of which there have been many you've called out. How does this compare to at least selling season to date to a pre-pandemic year? Are you ahead? Is it in line? And is that a win given the environment? Or just how would you think about that?
And then the second part of the question, given the success with the self-op conversions, is there any risk that the whole industry, which is talking about that being a very positive trend today, is sort of pulling forward some of the future demand potential as a difficult environment led more than the normal level of people to make that decision? Any thoughts on either would be helpful."

This morning, I'll provide a strategic review of the business as well as highlight the significant opportunities ahead that we believe will contribute to Aramark's strong and profitable growth trajectory. 
In the third quarter, revenues improved as the quarter progressed, led by an accelerated pace of client reopenings in the United States, particularly with our Sports & Entertainment and Leisure portfolios. This upward momentum continues, largely due to our team's dedication to serving clients and focusing on our growth agenda. Our ongoing commitment to be a trusted partner has led to significant new year-to-date business and high levels of client retention that exceed 96%. The selling season and higher education just finished, and we achieved a record number of new account wins driven by historically high closure rates, a testament to our investment in leadership, sales resources and training. 
In the past few months alone, we've added numerous higher ed institutions to the client portfolio, including the University of South Carolina beaufort and St. Peter's University. And we are in the process of finalizing additional contracts that are preparing to begin operations for the fall semester. 
We are also extremely proud to announce we've added 5 historically black college and university clients this year, including North Carolina Central University and Elizabeth City State University. We continue to expand and extend our current partnerships and are pleased to announce that we have finalized a 10-year contract with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, extending a 20-year partnership. 
Beyond higher education, new business wins occurred throughout the organization, including our B&I sector, adding Walmart's headquarters and our Sports & Entertainment business gaining the athletics programs for the University of Arizona and Virginia Tech, just to name a few. And in K-12, we now provide food service to the Fort Worth Independent School District, a significant sellback conversion. 
We are seeing greater first-time outsourcing activity with nearly half of our wins in the U.S. segment coming from self-op conversions this fiscal year, up from historical levels of approximately 1/3. 
In our International segment, we proceeded to win broad-based new business across all geographies that most recently includes the addition of the University of Toronto, Mississauga. We're pleased with our overall sale of progress to date, and there are additional significant opportunities in our pipeline that we expect to close in the coming months as well as into our new fiscal year. 
Turning now to Aramark's performance in the third quarter. Organic revenue increased 34% year-over-year and reflected ongoing sequential quarterly improvement. AOI margins grew to 3.6% in the quarter, driven by cost discipline and scalable operating efficiencies. 
In reviewing the quarter by business segment, U.S. Food and Facilities drove an organic revenue increase of 52% year-over-year, resulting in solid sequential quarterly revenue improvement. Education began notably recovering before the final bill of the academic year. The team is aggressively preparing for the upcoming fall semester when we expect essentially all clients to return to in-person learning. K-12 continues to benefit from universal government-sponsored meal programs that are extended through June of 2022. 
In higher ed, we're providing additional meal flexibility, new offerings and digital innovation. This includes the launch of Food Lab that features rotational menu concepts, unique product introductions and seasonal events, in addition to premiering Restaurant Row in partnership with local restaurant entrepreneurs. 
In Sports, Leisure and Corrections demonstrated significant improvement, especially at the end of the quarter. The NBA steadily increased fan counts throughout the playoffs, and all of our major league baseball clients moved to full capacity by July 1, aside from the Toronto Blue Jays who just returned home last week, permitting partial fan attendance. Leisure kicked off the recreational season that typically begins in late May with strong visitor frequency following a record reservation demand. Corrections has already returned to pre-COVID levels. 
The sector has experienced highly encouraging trends as many return to typical summer activities, attending baseball games, concerts and the national parks. In the coming months, we are also gearing up for full capacity expected throughout our NFL portfolio. 
Business & Industry experienced an uptick in activity throughout the quarter as companies execute return-to-work strategies. We expect a greater proportion of clients to be in person post Labor Day. Many clients are offering food services as an added incentive to further attract employees back to the workplace that includes adopting subsidized pricing or offering complementary meals. And we've recently implemented artificial intelligence and touchless payment technologies in many of our client locations to create speed of service and compelling grab-and-go options. 
Facilities and Other has outperformed pre-COVID levels driven by more frequent and comprehensive services. The facilities business had great success in vertical sales, extensively expanding its offerings to existing client locations. Healthcare steadily improved, largely reflecting increased retail activity as visitor restrictions eased. The business is expected to greatly benefit from heightened demand and elective procedures that had been delayed due to COVID. 
Our acquisition of Next Level Hospitality officially closed on June 4 and has already contributed over $23 million in revenue, which we believe is indicative of the growth opportunities for it ahead. 
International continues to effectively manage through various stages of geographic recovery as the team exhibits ongoing agility and responsiveness in addressing real-time client needs. Organic revenue increased 28% year-over-year, with areas such as China already surpassing pre-COVID levels and Chile operating at high capacity, driven by mining services given the very high demand for copper. From serving world leaders and delegations at the NATO Summit in June to the athletes at the Olympic and Paralympic villages, it is a privilege to provide clients the support that they need. 
Uniforms continues to make progress in its strategies to optimize new sales resources in addition to implementing the ABS rollout currently underway. Organic revenue increased 5% in the third quarter compared to last year as most base volumes rebound. We have seen a slower recovery in our hospitality business, approximately 20% of pre-COVID revenues, and the Canadian market, where government-imposed restrictions were still in place throughout the quarter. 
Adjacency services, including First Aid and the Restroom management, once again drove double-digit growth, and we continue to see a significant opportunity to expand these offerings. Retention rates have improved 300 basis points, and customer satisfaction scores increased to 10% higher than pre-COVID levels, a reflection of the transformative actions underway. 
In supply chain, our team has been effectively managing through market and category needs working in close collaboration with our clients and supplier partners. This includes leveraging our significant purchasing scale and a broad bench of cross-channel partners. We're also deliberate in our menu design given the inflationary environment and apply flexibility on menu alternatives as appropriate. While it's not our preference, we are able contractually to pass on increases in supply chain pricing. Supply chain's overall focus remains to optimize spend and through availability of innovative products, honor our commitments around local and diverse suppliers and stay true to our sustainability efforts. 
On the labor side, we're confident in our ability to appropriately navigate the current marketplace. We have a strong talent acquisition team and compelling programs in place designed to attract top-tier talent, including our newly instituted employee stock purchase program, all featured in our recently launched Aramark Careers website designed to create an optimal candidate experience. 
Aramark is consistently recognized as an Employer of Choice and highlighted as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune. We've been successfully implementing strategies to mitigate labor costs, led by disciplined scheduling protocols and efficient resource management aligned with demand as well as differentiation through innovative technology. We're also able to benefit from our scale by utilizing our full employee base and leveraging client locations in adjacent geographies. 
Lastly, I'm extremely proud of our Be Well, Do Well. commitment that continues to make important strides to reduce in equity and improve the health of those across the globe. Through our Healthy for Life initiative, we were honored to have recently been recognized by the American Heart Association with the reward for meritorious achievement based on our efforts to promote better nutrition and lifestyle. 
We are also appreciative to just be named as one of the best companies from multicultural women by seramount as well as one of the Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion with a score of 100% on the Disability Equity Index for the fifth consecutive year, a reflection of our dedication to create equity and increase access to opportunities for our team. 
Before turning it over to Tom, I want to take a moment to thank our Board member, Calvin Darden, for his many contributions to Aramark following his retirement announced a few weeks ago. Cal closely partnered with me to create an Executive Diversity Council that is focused on leveraging diversity, equity and inclusion to elevate our culture, drive business outcomes and advance positive social impact. We wish Cal the best. 
Now Tom will provide a detailed financial review of the business."

Over the next few minutes, I will discuss our financial results in the quarter as well as provide our outlook for the remainder of the year. As John mentioned, we are encouraged by the continued base revenue recovery",1101,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I will discuss our financial results in the quarter as well as provide our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
As John mentioned, we are encouraged by the continued base revenue recovery in the quarter tied to improved levels of business activity throughout the portfolio as well as increasing contributions from net new business. The accelerated pace of client reopenings, driven primarily by the Sports & Entertainment and Leisure businesses, contributed to the organic revenue reaching 73% of pre-COVID levels compared to just 55% during the third quarter last year. These improving trends have extended into the fourth quarter. 
New business wins continue to build within all segments, and the pipeline is robust as we approach the new fiscal year. With the education selling season just finishing, the K-12 and Higher Education businesses should deliver their highest level of annualized new business revenue since Aramark's IPO in 2013. And the Uniform segment, fueled by the sales investments made over the past 18 months, along with our International segment, are on pace to approach record levels of new business revenue as well. We will provide annualized components of revenue growth and summary of wins detail on the year-end earnings call. 
Adjusted operating income was $106 million in the quarter, resulting in a constant currency AOI margin of 3.6%, up over 250 basis points from the second quarter. Higher profitability across all segments was driven by rebounding sales volumes combined with effective cost management, partially offset by ongoing investment in growth resources and inventory write-downs for certain PPE in Uniforms. Corporate expenses increased, primarily due to higher equity-based compensation associated with the company's incentive strategies to align the organization with shareholders. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.03 compared to a loss of $0.69 in the same period last year. This significant improvement was led by the profitability drivers just discussed as well as a partial quarter interest expense benefit from the $500 million debt repayment completed in early June. 
In the third quarter, Aramark generated net cash provided by operating activities of $12 million and spent $101 million on capital expenditures, resulting in a use of $89 million in free cash flow, typical based on the historical cadence of the fiscal quarter. Net cash from operating activities benefited from increased operating income as well as strong working capital management. Capital expenditures continue to be managed with purpose to drive performance in existing accounts associated with client reopenings and support growing new business activity. 
Through 9 months, the company has driven a $309 million year-over-year improvement in net cash provided by operating activities combined with a favorable $15 million variance in capital expenditures to produce a $324 million improvement in free cash flow. This strong year-to-date result was led by improved operating income and effective working capital management as well as the benefit of deferred payroll taxes and a $94 million federal tax refund that occurred in the second quarter related to the CARES Act. Note that we continue to participate in the appropriate country-specific government-assisted programs from which we received approximately $130 million fiscal year-to-date in labor credits. These credits offset the costs we incurred globally related to the retention of employees and for absorbing 100% of the benefit cost associated with furloughed employees. 
As a result of our solid performance and free cash flow, we had over $1.9 billion in cash availability at quarter end, allowing us to advance our capital allocation priorities, including our acquisition of Next Level and dividend payment in the quarter. We remain well positioned to evaluate additional deleveraging opportunities while balancing our disciplined use of capital investment to facilitate new business wins and drive results in existing client accounts as well as pursue select accretive M&A. 
As previewed last earnings call, we took further actions this quarter that strengthened our balance sheet in addition to debt repayment, including refinanced $833 million of the 2024 Term Loan B credit facility to extend maturity to 2028; closed a 3-year extension on substantially all of our revolving credit facility as well as term loans A&C to 2026, reflecting approximately $400 million; upsized our revolving credit facility to $1.2 billion, increasing cash availability by over $200 million; and most recently, finalized an extension of our existing receivables facility by 2 years through June 2024 to provide additional financial flexibility. These refinancing actions, together with the $500 million debt repayment mentioned earlier, are expected to result in a quarterly interest expense savings of approximately $3 million going forward. 
I will now briefly review our GAAP results. Consolidated revenue was $3 billion, operating income was $74 million and diluting earnings per share -- diluted earnings per share was $0.13. Results for diluted earnings per share included the benefit of a noncash gain on an equity investment in the San Antonio Spurs of $138 million, partially offset by a noncash loss of $61 million from the termination of certain defined benefit pension plans in Canada. Exiting the pension plans was a proactive action to eliminate uncertain future liabilities. 
Before moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter, I want to quickly review a few key modeling assumptions. As you can see in our third quarter results, the performance of Next Level hospitality will be excluded from our organic revenue and adjusted operating income metrics until we lap the acquisition date in Q3 of fiscal '22. And beginning in the fourth quarter, our share count is expected to be approximately 258 million, with the increase driven by the timing of equity-based compensation as well as the cumulative participation in the employee stock purchase program. 
So let me wrap up by sharing our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. We are extremely encouraged by the upward trends of the business while appreciating the exact pace and timing of recovery is evolving as we continue to monitor the broader environment. While developing and executing a wide array of client reopening plans, we will leverage our resilient variable cost in-unit business model, continue to implement our supply chain strategies and drive above-unit operating efficiencies. Based on our current expectations for the fourth quarter, we anticipate continued organic revenue recovery reaching 80% to 85% of 2019 levels, adjusted operating income margin in a range of 4.5% to 5% and free cash flow outlook raised to generating $150 million to $250 million for fiscal 2021, driven by an expected strong seasonal cash inflow in the fourth quarter associated with the Higher Education business. 
Thanks for your time this morning. And now I'll turn the call back over to John."

Yes, we are seeing some customers defer the reopening dates by 30 to 60 days, and we're seeing that in the B&I sector. But I think people are still taking a wait-and-see attitude based on the timing of the Delta variant and what impact it might have on their businesses. So I think we've been able to show in the last 1.5 years that we can adapt and pivot to whatever the circumstances are to manage the expectations for the client. And so we're poised and ready for when they come back, and that will -- it will result in some cost incursion in the fourth quarter as we get ready for those customers to return so that we have adequate staffing in terms of management and people. So that -- there -- we believe there will be a slight delay in the recovery in B&I as a result of the Delta variant. We don't believe that, that will have an impact on Higher Education, Sports & Entertainment. It's really limited mostly to companies and their return-to-work strategies."

And then on the really positive new business commentary you provided, is there any way to tease a part out of that how much of the improved performance this fiscal year results from the many strategies you've put in place to really prioritize growth and winning business versus just a positive environment where the self-op guys want to get the heck out of running it themselves given the complexity of doing so in a pandemic? And to the extent that not easy to tell, I guess if we just think more longer term, how are you thinking about pipelines of business looking even beyond this fiscal year and the positioning to continue to deliver strong new business going forward?"

And absolutely, I think our strategy -- the changes we've made to leadership, the additional sales resources, the sales training development activities that we've engaged in over the course of the last 1.5 years have really paid significant dividends, and it's resulting in very significant win rates, higher closure rates than we've had historically. And I think that's a testimony to the quality of the leadership team and the quality of the sales team. 
And so even though we are seeing more self-op conversions, you still have to win those conversions. You still have to compete for those wins. And nobody hands you the business. So I think it's a result of those improved capabilities and the improved focus and frankly, the incentive compensation approaches that the company has taken and that the Board has adopted towards incenting net new sales growth or net growth for the leadership team. So I think those are all components of it, but I think it's primarily due to the improvement in the quality of the people and the improvement in the quality of the offerings that we're putting in front of customers."

I mean, we're expecting the U.S. in the fourth quarter to be sort of in the 3.5% range on product cost. Europe, well below that. It's remained actually below expectations at the moment. So there's a bit of an offset there. Asia being pretty steady and as about as expected. 
So the impact is really just coming through the U.S. business on product cost. And as you well know, the business model is set, and we're pretty adept at being able to manage those costs. As always, we are trying not to lean completely on passing that through as our contracts primarily allow us to do and manage in other ways to provide that value to customers. So it's not really a driver too much for us in the Q4 guidance. We feel we can manage through it both on the product cost and the labor side."

So we do have significant linen operations that have not fully recovered. That is probably the biggest source of the shortfall. Restaurant operations have not returned to using table claws and napkins, even though they may be very robust businesses at this point. So linen still continues to be soft. And the Canadian operations had significant restrictions still through the end of the third quarter. 
So we like what we're seeing in Uniform Services. We're seeing a solid pace of recovery in the core business. And ex linen and Canada, the business has largely recovered to pre-COVID level. We continue to see opportunities on the growth side. Retention rates are significantly higher than historical averages, and we're seeing very high closure rates in new business wins. As you know, we've added significant numbers of sales resources over the course of the last year and actually the last 2 years. So we're encouraged, and we think the pace of recovery will continue in Uniforms.

That significantly add to the Facilities component of the business in food manufacturing and other areas of the company. 
We've enjoyed good success in health care as well, both on a retention side  as well as new account wins. So I would say it's very broad-based. We're enjoying very significant success in terms of new account wins, and we'll be very excited to talk about it in its totality at year-end. This is a point-in-time kind of business. We have retention that we started 100%, and we work towards year-end. And when we finish, we can report the number for total retention. Right now, it's trending at 96% and above, and we're very pleased with that. The new account wins are at a record pace, and we'll be very happy to disclose them by name when we have the contract signed in, in our hands.

We've all seen it this past year and been very proud of the business and its ability to execute what the teams have brought. And so the cash flow generation, I think, hasn't been surprising. It's got its normal seasonal cadence quarter-to-quarter, but by and large is a relatively working capital neutral business, which is very attractive. We've been able to manage CapEx appropriately without sacrificing any of the needs of the clients.

Those are mostly technological kinds of implementations like touchless payment technology, grab-and-go kinds of opportunities, convenience opportunities. So not significant capital investment required to make those kinds of changes in existing operations. And even in those organizations that are going to have remote working kinds of -- or hybrid working experiences, we don't see structural changes to the serveries as being necessary or required. We do see many companies adopting more aggressive subsidized payment plans or subsidized approaches to food service to -- as an inducement to get employees to return to work. We've seen many companies considering going back to free meals, which we think will certainly drive participation significantly. And then the whole safety and security protocol environment, we see taking some time before that really evolves to pre-COVID activity. So we think participation will rise naturally just because it will be easier for people to take advantage of the serving environment in their existing facility rather than leaving the building and coming back.

This morning, I'll provide a strategic review of the business as well as highlight the significant opportunities ahead that we believe will contribute to Aramark's strong and profitable growth trajectory.  
In the third quarter, revenues improved as the quarter progressed, led by an accelerated pace of client reopenings in the United States, particularly with our Sports & Entertainment and Leisure portfolios. This upward momentum continues, largely due to our team's dedication to serving clients and focusing on our growth agenda. Our ongoing commitment to be a trusted partner has led to significant new year-to-date business and high levels of client retention that exceed 96%. 
The selling season and higher education just finished, and we achieved a record number of new account wins driven by historically high closure rates, a testament to our investment in leadership, sales resources and training. In the past few months alone, we've added numerous higher ed institutions to the client portfolio, including the University of South Carolina Beaufort and St. Peter's University. And we are in the process of finalizing additional contracts that are preparing to begin operations for the fall semester.  
We are also extremely proud to announce we've added 5 historically black college and university clients this year, including North Carolina Central University and Elizabeth City State University. We continue to expand and extend our current partnerships and are pleased to announce that we have finalized a 10-year contract with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, extending a 20-year partnership.  
Beyond higher education, new business wins occurred throughout the organization, including our B&I sector, adding Walmart's headquarters, and our Sports & Entertainment business gaining the athletics programs for the University of Arizona and Virginia Tech, just to name a few. And in K-12, we now provide food service to the Fort Worth Independent School District, a significant self-op conversion.  
We are seeing greater first-time outsourcing activity with nearly half of our wins in the U.S. segment coming from self-op conversions this fiscal year, up from historical levels of approximately 1/3.  
In our International segment, we proceeded to win broad-based new business across all geographies that most recently includes the addition of the University of Toronto, Mississauga. We're pleased with our overall sale of progress to date, and there are additional significant opportunities in our pipeline that we expect to close in the coming months as well as into our new fiscal year.  
Turning now to Aramark's performance in the third quarter. Organic revenue increased 34% year-over-year and reflected ongoing sequential quarterly improvement. AOI margins grew to 3.6% in the quarter, driven by cost discipline and scalable operating efficiencies.  
In reviewing the quarter by business segment, U.S. Food and Facilities drove an organic revenue increase of 52% year-over-year, resulting in solid sequential quarterly revenue improvement. Education began notably recovering before the final bell of the academic year. The team is aggressively preparing for the upcoming fall semester when we expect essentially all clients to return to in-person learning.  
K-12 continues to benefit from universal government-sponsored meal programs that are extended through June of 2022.  
In higher ed, we're providing additional meal flexibility, new offerings and digital innovation. This includes the launch of Food Lab that features rotational menu concepts, unique product introductions and seasonal events, in addition to premiering Restaurant Row in partnership with local restaurant entrepreneurs.  
In Sports, Leisure & Corrections demonstrated significant improvement, especially at the end of the quarter. The NBA steadily increased fan counts throughout the playoffs, and all of our major league baseball clients moved to full capacity by July 1, aside from the Toronto Blue Jays who just returned home last week, permitting partial fan attendance. Leisure kicked off the recreational season that typically begins in late May with strong visitor frequency following a record reservation demand. Corrections has already returned to pre-COVID levels. The sector has experienced highly encouraging trends as many return to typical summer activities, attending baseball games, concerts and the national parks. In the coming months, we are also gearing up for full capacity expected throughout our NFL portfolio.  
Business & Industry experienced an uptick in activity throughout the quarter as companies execute return-to-work strategies. We expect a greater proportion of clients to be in person post Labor Day. Many clients are offering food services as an added incentive to further attract employees back to the workplace that includes adopting subsidized pricing or offering complementary meals. And we've recently implemented artificial intelligence and touchless payment technologies in many of our client locations to create speed of service and compelling grab-and-go options.  
Facilities and Other has outperformed pre-COVID levels driven by more frequent and comprehensive services. The facilities business had great success in vertical sales, extensively expanding its offerings to existing client locations. 
Healthcare steadily improved, largely reflecting increased retail activity as visitor restrictions eased. The business is expected to greatly benefit from heightened demand in elective procedures that had been delayed due to COVID. Our acquisition of Next Level Hospitality officially closed on June 4 and has already contributed over $23 million in revenue, which we believe is indicative of the growth opportunities for it ahead.  
International continues to effectively manage through various stages of geographic recovery as the team exhibits ongoing agility and responsiveness in addressing real-time client needs. Organic revenue increased 28% year-over-year, with areas such as China already surpassing pre-COVID levels and Chile operating at high capacity, driven by mining services given the very high demand for copper. From serving world leaders and delegations at the NATO Summit in June to the athletes at the Olympic and Paralympic villages, it is a privilege to provide clients the support that they need.  
Uniforms continues to make progress in its strategies to optimize new sales resources in addition to implementing the ABS rollout currently underway. Organic revenue increased 5% in the third quarter compared to last year as most base volumes rebound. We have seen a slower recovery in our hospitality business, approximately 20% of pre-COVID revenues, and the Canadian market, where government-imposed restrictions were still in place throughout the quarter.  
Adjacency services, including First Aid and the Restroom management, once again drove double-digit growth, and we continue to see a significant opportunity to expand these offerings. Retention rates have improved 300 basis points, and customer satisfaction scores increased to 10% higher than pre-COVID levels, a reflection of the transformative actions underway.  
In supply chain, our team has been effectively managing through market and category needs working in close collaboration with our clients and supplier partners. This includes leveraging our significant purchasing scale and a broad bench of cross-channel partners. We're also deliberate in our menu design given the inflationary environment and apply flexibility on menu alternatives as appropriate. While it's not our preference, we are able contractually to pass on increases in supply chain pricing. Supply chain's overall focus remains to optimize spend and through availability of innovative products, honor our commitments around local and diverse suppliers and stay true to our sustainability efforts.  
On the labor side, we're confident in our ability to appropriately navigate the current marketplace. We have a strong talent acquisition team and compelling programs in place designed to attract top-tier talent, including our newly instituted employee stock purchase program, all featured in our recently launched Aramark Careers website designed to create an optimal candidate experience.  
Aramark is consistently recognized as an employer of choice and highlighted as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune. We've been successfully implementing strategies to mitigate labor costs, led by disciplined scheduling protocols and efficient resource management aligned with demand as well as differentiation through innovative technology. We're also able to benefit from our scale by utilizing our full employee base and leveraging client locations in adjacent geographies.  
Lastly, I'm extremely proud of our Be Well. Do Well. commitment that continues to make important strides to reduce inequity and improve the health of those across the globe. Through our Healthy for Life initiative, we were honored to have recently been recognized by the American Heart Association with their Award for Meritorious Achievement based on our efforts to promote better nutrition and lifestyle.  
We are also appreciative to just be named as one of the Best Companies for Multicultural Women by Seramount as well as one of the Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion with a score of 100% on the Disability Equity Index (sic) [ Disability Equality Index ] for the fifth consecutive year, a reflection of our dedication to create equity and increase access to opportunities for our team.  
Before turning it over to Tom, I want to take a moment to thank our Board member, Calvin Darden, for his many contributions to Aramark following his retirement announced a few weeks ago. Cal closely partnered with me to create an Executive Diversity Council that is focused on leveraging diversity, equity and inclusion to elevate our culture, drive business outcomes and advance positive social impact. We wish Cal the best.  
Now Tom will provide a detailed financial review of the business."

Over the next few minutes, I will discuss our financial results in the quarter as well as provide our outlook for the remainder of the year.  
As John mentioned, we are encouraged by the continued base revenue recovery in the quarter tied to improved levels of business activity throughout the portfolio as well as increasing contributions from net new business. The accelerated pace of client reopenings, driven primarily by the Sports & Entertainment and Leisure businesses, contributed to the organic revenue reaching 73% of pre-COVID levels compared to just 55% during the third quarter last year. These improving trends have extended into the fourth quarter.  
New business wins continue to build within all segments, and the pipeline is robust as we approach the new fiscal year. With the education selling season just finishing, the K-12 and Higher Education businesses should deliver their highest level of annualized new business revenue since Aramark's IPO in 2013. And the Uniform segment, fueled by the sales investments made over the past 18 months, along with our International segment, are on pace to approach record levels of new business revenue as well. We will provide annualized components of revenue growth and summary of wins detail on the year-end earnings call.  
Adjusted operating income was $106 million in the quarter, resulting in a constant currency AOI margin of 3.6%, up over 250 basis points from the second quarter. Higher profitability across all segments was driven by rebounding sales volumes combined with effective cost management, partially offset by ongoing investment in growth resources and inventory write-downs for certain PPE in Uniforms. Corporate expenses increased, primarily due to higher equity-based compensation associated with the company's incentive strategies to align the organization with shareholders.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.03 compared to a loss of $0.69 in the same period last year. This significant improvement was led by the profitability drivers just discussed as well as a partial quarter interest expense benefit from the $500 million debt repayment completed in early June.  
In the third quarter, Aramark generated net cash provided by operating activities of $12 million and spent $101 million on capital expenditures, resulting in a use of $89 million in free cash flow, typical based on the historical cadence of the fiscal quarter. Net cash from operating activities benefited from increased operating income as well as strong working capital management. Capital expenditures continue to be managed with purpose to drive performance in existing accounts associated with client reopenings and support growing new business activity.  
Through 9 months, the company has driven a $309 million year-over-year improvement in net cash provided by operating activities combined with a favorable $15 million variance in capital expenditures to produce a $324 million improvement in free cash flow. This strong year-to-date result was led by improved operating income and effective working capital management as well as the benefit of deferred payroll taxes and a $94 million federal tax refund that occurred in the second quarter related to the CARES Act. 
Note that we continue to participate in the appropriate country-specific government-assisted programs from which we received approximately $130 million fiscal year-to-date in labor credits. These credits offset the costs we incurred globally related to the retention of employees and for absorbing 100% of the benefit cost associated with furloughed employees.  
As a result of our solid performance and free cash flow, we had over $1.9 billion in cash availability at quarter end, allowing us to advance our capital allocation priorities, including our acquisition of Next Level and dividend payment in the quarter. We remain well positioned to evaluate additional deleveraging opportunities while balancing our disciplined use of capital investment to facilitate new business wins and drive results in existing client accounts as well as pursue select accretive M&A.  
As previewed last earnings call, we took further actions this quarter that strengthened our balance sheet in addition to debt repayment, including: refinanced $833 million of the 2024 Term Loan B credit facility to extend maturity to 2028; closed a 3-year extension on substantially all of our revolving credit facility as well as Term Loans A and C to 2026, reflecting approximately $400 million; upsized our revolving credit facility to $1.2 billion, increasing cash availability by over $200 million; and most recently, finalized an extension of our existing receivables facility by 2 years through June 2024 to provide additional financial flexibility. These refinancing actions, together with the $500 million debt repayment mentioned earlier, are expected to result in a quarterly interest expense savings of approximately $3 million going forward.  
I will now briefly review our GAAP results. Consolidated revenue was $3 billion, operating income was $74 million and diluting earnings per share -- diluted earnings per share was $0.13. Results for diluted earnings per share included the benefit of a noncash gain on an equity investment in the San Antonio Spurs of $138 million, partially offset by a noncash loss of $61 million from the termination of certain defined benefit pension plans in Canada. Exiting the pension plans was a proactive action to eliminate uncertain future liabilities.  
Before moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter, I want to quickly review a few key modeling assumptions. As you can see in our third quarter results, the performance of Next Level Hospitality will be excluded from our organic revenue and adjusted operating income metrics until we lap the acquisition date in Q3 of fiscal '22. And beginning in the fourth quarter, our share count is expected to be approximately 258 million, with the increase driven by the timing of equity-based compensation as well as the cumulative participation in the employee stock purchase program.  
So let me wrap up by sharing our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. We are extremely encouraged by the upward trends of the business while appreciating the exact pace and timing of recovery is evolving as we continue to monitor the broader environment. While developing and executing a wide array of client reopening plans, we will leverage our resilient variable cost in-unit business model, continue to implement our supply chain strategies and drive above-unit operating efficiencies. Based on our current expectations for the fourth quarter, we anticipate continued organic revenue recovery reaching 80% to 85% of 2019 levels, adjusted operating income margin in a range of 4.5% to 5% and free cash flow outlook raised to generating $150 million to $250 million for fiscal 2021, driven by an expected strong seasonal cash inflow in the fourth quarter associated with the Higher Education business.  
Thanks for your time this morning. And now I'll turn the call back over to John."

It looks like you have solid visibility now on which clients want to be back and at which level, et cetera. You're guiding on revenue. You've also tweaked the cash flow guidance to reflect the working capital that comes with those reopenings. So I'm curious whether this September reopening also has an impact on margins? And in particular, if there have been any reopening costs in your Q3 operating profits or if there will be reopening costs in Q4 that are included in your margin guidance? And effectively if they're one-off and does that provide upside into next year? 
And then just briefly, I couldn't help but notice that you've almost discussed procurement as a division. You've promised some more disclosure on net new business, gross new business, retention, all those components. So, so far, you've refrained from making any reporting changes or disclosure changes.

And so we're poised and ready for when they come back, and that will -- it will result in some cost incursion in the fourth quarter as we get ready for those customers to return so that we have adequate staffing in terms of management and people. So that -- there -- we believe there will be a slight delay in the recovery in B&I as a result of the Delta variant.

And absolutely, I think our strategy -- the changes we've made to leadership, the additional sales resources, the sales training and development activities that we've engaged in over the course of the last 1.5 years have really paid significant dividends, and it's resulting in very significant win rates, higher closure rates than we've had historically. And I think that's a testimony to the quality of the leadership team and the quality of the sales team. 
And so even though we are seeing more self-op conversions, you still have to win those conversions. You still have to compete for those wins. And nobody hands you the business. So I think it's a result of those improved capabilities and the improved focus and frankly, the incentive compensation approaches that the company has taken and that the Board has adopted towards incenting net new sales growth or net growth for the leadership team. So I think those are all components of it, but I think it's primarily due to the improvement in the quality of the people and the improvement in the quality of the offerings that we're putting in front of customers."

So there's a bit of an offset there. Asia, being pretty steady and as about as expected. 
So the impact is really just coming through the U.S. business on product cost. And as you well know, the business model is set, and we're pretty adept at being able to manage those costs. As always, we are trying not to lean completely on passing that through as our contracts primarily allow us to do and manage it in other ways to provide that value to customers.

So we like what we're seeing in Uniform Services. We're seeing a solid pace of recovery in the core business. And ex linen and Canada, the business has largely recovered to pre-COVID level. 
We continue to see opportunities on the growth side. Retention rates are significantly higher than historical averages, and we're seeing very high closure rates in new business wins. As you know, we've added significant numbers of sales resources over the course of the last year and actually the last 2 years.

We're enjoying very significant success in terms of new account wins, and we'll be very excited to talk about it in its totality at year-end. This is a point-in-time kind of business. We have retention that we started 100%, and we work towards year-end. And when we finish, we can report the number for total retention.

We've been able to manage CapEx appropriately without sacrificing any of the needs of the clients.

And they are planning for full enrollment and full participation in in-class learning. There is an expectation that throughout the higher education community, that classes will largely be in-person, and they may make some modifications, but they'll be relatively small. And their expectations are that enrollments are going to be at very high levels, given the fact that you had many students defer from prior years -- from prior year into this year to start their campus -- their on-campus experience. 
So the commentary inside of higher education is all very strong, and we're planning for a very robust reopening. In fact, some of the universities are going to be starting up here in just a very short period of time. And our people are working full time day and night to be ready for those students to get back to campus."

I'm not expecting a number, but I just want to make sure that's what you're saying. And then on the other part of that equation, the 96% client retention that you shared with us today, which is obviously an awesome number, my question is, do you feel like that rate might be benefiting right now from renewal decision deferrals during COVID?

First of all, your math is 100% correct that absolutely net new business significantly improved over prior years and as a result of those significant new business wins and high customer retention. 
So the -- it's our expectation that we will maintain this retention rate going forward. There may have been early in the year some slowness in terms of the activity level with respect to new client -- I'm sorry, to client contract changes. But I would say that pace has accelerated throughout the year. We've been -- we have a very active pipeline of new account wins. We've been very aggressive in terms of renewals and retention. And so it's our expectation that we'll maintain this number moving forward. That's always been our goal, to be there in this 96% range. And so we're very pleased that we're there. 
I don't believe it's COVID-affected. I think it's the result of performance and delivering on our client expectation and the very proactive retention efforts that we've undergone."

I was just curious as to the nature of those cross-selling new work that you experienced in the quarter. Are those related to like deep cleaning services or other things that could be tied directly to COVID? Or are they -- I don't know how you'd call it, other services that will be provided during the long term even if COVID were to go away tomorrow? 
And then my second question, I guess this is probably for Tom. It has to do with Uniforms and the installation of ABS, which is obviously progressing along nicely there. Any way you could quantify the costs incurred for those transition costs installing that? And just want to make sure that those are not excluded from the adjusted EPS number.

We're still operating most of our B&I locations on management fee contracts. And we don't have -- there is not an expectation of an accelerated pace of shifting back. We think that will take some time as companies ramp up their strategies and return-to-work environments. 
Some companies are considering changing the configuration in terms of the way they -- that customers will be served. Those are mostly technological kinds of implementations like touchless payment technology, grab-and-go kinds of opportunities, convenience opportunities. So not significant capital investment required to make those kinds of changes in existing operations. 
And even in those organizations that are going to have remote working kinds of -- or hybrid working experiences, we don't see structural changes to the serveries as being necessary or required. We do see many companies adopting more aggressive subsidized payment plans or subsidized approaches to food service to -- as an inducement to get employees to return to work. We've seen many companies considering going back to free meals, which we think will certainly drive participation significantly. And then the whole safety and security protocol environment, we see taking some time before that really evolves to pre-COVID activity. So we think participation will rise naturally just because it will be easier for people to take advantage of the serving environment in their existing facility rather than leaving the building and coming back. So we do see higher participation as a result of this moving forward in the B&I sector and think that, that will be very beneficial."

Today, I'll provide a strategic overview of our fourth quarter performance, recap our progress throughout fiscal '21 that included record levels of net new business and share an initial view of the year",1469,"Thanks, Felise, and it's good to be with all of you. Today, I'll provide a strategic overview of our fourth quarter performance, recap our progress throughout fiscal '21 that included record levels of net new business and share an initial view of the year ahead that we expect will build on the strong foundation for growth we've experienced this year. Our teams across the globe are committed to reaching for remarkable for our stakeholders, driven by service, innovation and growth. 
Over the course of the year, we executed on our strategic initiatives despite a challenging and complex operating environment. The cultural transformation in the business, combined with our renewed close partnerships with clients and suppliers, not only allowed us to navigate this unprecedented period, but also put us in a position to win and further increase performance levels across the business. In every 1 of our segments, we have made great progress. 
Among the highlights I'm most proud of, this year, we meaningfully accelerated Aramark's growth trajectory by adding senior leadership talent and making organizational changes that significantly bolstered our industry and line of business expertise, including sales leadership in many key roles by investing in growth-oriented areas of the business; by enhancing sales training and development programs; by further aligning our compensation approach with Aramark's strategic objectives, including net new business, which now represents 40% of the company's bonus incentive plan across the organization; by strengthening client and supplier relationships and enhancing our operating infrastructure. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss our strong fiscal '21 net new business performance, which we attribute to the ownership mindset we've been cultivating, our ongoing focus on innovation and the scale of our platform. Our annualized gross new business wins totaled nearly $1.25 billion, the highest in company history, representing 7.7% of pre-COVID revenue. This performance was broad-based across segments with particularly strong contribution from the education and facilities in other sectors within FSS U.S. 
In Higher Education business, specifically, we added a record number of new clients that further strengthens the portfolio of our largest business. Our new business wins extended across lines of business, geographies and client size. In the United States, average annualized revenue for our new business wins was $3.4 million, emphasizing the breadth and depth of our ability to source clients large to small. 
Our International segment continued to experience a broad-based steady growth trajectory across all countries, specifically led by industries such as mining, education, health care and B&I. Uniforms added to this performance, reflective of the investments we've made in growing this business. Our teams across the company are hard at work onboarding these new clients. 
We continue to benefit from greater first-time outsourcing activity, representing approximately 40% of wins globally and nearly half of all wins within the FSS U.S. segment derived from self-op conversions. Our strength and talent and new capabilities provide further differentiation in the marketplace and reflect how well we've adapted to the new normal. 
In fiscal '21, we also improved retention rates to 95.5%, 150 basis points better than our historical [ 5-year ] average. We are targeting retention rates to ultimately reach 97%. Accordingly, the magnitude of new business wins, combined with significant improved retention rates, allowed us to achieve record annualized net new business performance. As examples of our progress, the annualized revenue of our net new business was over $500 million, 5x higher than the average of the previous 5 years. 
The FSS U.S. segment reported a notable improvement with record high net new business of nearly $300 million, following negative net new results in 3 of the prior 5 years. And international increased net new business to approximately $150 million, over 30% higher than its historical average. Each segment reached important milestones by increasing retention rates more than 100 basis points, led by Uniforms with an improvement of 180 basis points. Collectively, this level of annualized net new business represents 3.1% of our pre-COVID level of revenue. Together, with our typical base business growth typically 1% to 2%, we are well on our way to our mid-single-digit growth goals. 
I'd now like to review Aramark's organic revenue performance by reportable segment in the fourth quarter then in total, increased 37% year-over-year and reached 87% of pre-COVID levels. FSS U.S. reported an organic revenue increase of 58% compared to the fourth quarter last year, as we implemented many of our newly-created programs across sectors. We welcome students and educators back to in-person learning at the start of the school year in both K-12 and in Higher Education. Fans largely returned to stadiums at full capacity for Major League Baseball, and the National Football League season is underway. Our Leisure business benefited from ongoing activity at National Parks and corrections that already returned to pre-COVID levels. 
B&I clients began to implement greater in-person return to work activity, although at a measured pace. At Aramark, we are fully back in our offices here in Philadelphia as of October 18. Facilities continued serving clients with in-demand services, ensuring locations were ready and safe for increased in-person activity. And health care gradually improved as patient care began to normalize with a higher level of voluntary procedures, routine medical appointments and hospital visitation. 
International organic revenue grew 21% year-over-year, driven by stronger performance in Canada and Europe. Sports & entertainment and Education in our international geographies reported improved business activity with the pace of reopenings behind the U.S. 
Organic revenue in the Uniform segment grew 5% in the quarter, driven by rentals and adjacency services, with hospitality clients experiencing increased levels of activity. Key areas of focus in Uniforms include higher growth rates in recurring business, customer-route density optimization, merchandise management and enhanced back-office utilization. 
As you saw from our announcement a few weeks ago, we're extremely excited to have Kim Scott join as President and CEO of Aramark Uniform Services. I am confident that Kim's leadership and extensive commercial experience positions her well to accelerate profitable growth in this segment while simultaneously enhancing our employee and customer experiences. I look forward to Kim's meaningful contributions to the business as a member of our executive leadership team reporting to me. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Brad Drummond for his many years of service as he retires from Aramark. 
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on a few relevant and broader topics important to our business that have been top of mind in capturing the headlines for what seems like months, namely navigating a dynamic global supply chain and tight labor market. While we have seen supply chain disruption in the food service industry, our scale, proactive management, deep bench of suppliers and menu flexibility has helped us mitigate much of this for our clients. Our overall focus remains on leveraging spend, optimizing supplier relationships and ensuring availability of in-demand products and honoring our commitments to sustainability and local diverse suppliers, all of which will position us to continue to effectively weather this storm. 
We are also actively monitoring the markets for inflationary pressures and buying opportunities, relying on our use of fixed contract pricing and the ability to pass on market-driven pricing to moderate any near-term impact on the business. We are currently in active deployment of our new field ordering technology for our managed services business, which will streamline our operators' buying activities and ensure alignment with optimized supply chain programs. 
On the labor side, we continue to effectively adapt to the environment. We've been implementing strategies to mitigate labor costs, led by disciplined scheduling protocols and efficient resource management aligned with demand as well as leveraging technology in this area. We're also able to benefit from our scale by utilizing our flexible operating model, full employee base and leveraging client locations in adjacent geographies. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that we've taken a big step in our goal of reducing our environmental impact and carbon footprint by committing to establish a definitive target for our greenhouse gas emissions. When we finalize our goal, it will be a science-based target submitted through the Science-Based Targets Initiative or SBTI. As you likely know, SBTI is a joint effort between the UN Global Compact, the World Widelife Federation and other international environmental auditing groups. This is important news for Aramark as we deepen our commitment to transparency in our environmental stewardship. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the community service and passion exhibited by the Aramark teams globally. Our most recent building, Community Day, consisted of thousands of team members leading nearly 80 virtual and in-person projects taking place in 6 different countries. I am extremely proud of our commitment to making a positive impact on people and planet. 
And now Tom will provide a detailed financial review of the business. Tom?"

Over the next few minutes, I will discuss our financial results in the quarter, including detailed insight into the business as we frame the ongoing recovery and share our outlook as we enter fi",1201,"Thanks, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Over the next few minutes, I will discuss our financial results in the quarter, including detailed insight into the business as we frame the ongoing recovery and share our outlook as we enter fiscal '22. In the fourth quarter and really since the start of COVID's impact on the business, we've continued to control what we could control, whether that was effectively leveraging our variable cost-based operating model at the onset of the pandemic, implementing disciplined strategies to strengthen our balance sheet or taking action to invest and transform the culture of the organization. We are extremely proud of the progress we've made and recognize that this is just the beginning. 
Our performance in the quarter reflected our team's focus and resolve. Adjusted operating income was $165 million, resulting in a constant currency AOI margin of 4.8%, improving 120 basis points from the third quarter. Improved profitability was driven by strong unit-based cost management and the ability to leverage above-unit operating costs in SG&A across higher sales volumes. These drivers resulted in adjusted EPS that was $0.21 compared to an adjusted loss per share of $0.35 in the fourth quarter last year. 
We also took action over the course of the year to manage our balance sheet, resulting in interest expense savings of over $10 million versus fourth quarter fiscal '20, which also contributed to the adjusted EPS improvement. In fiscal '21, the company delivered $480 million of year-over-year improvement in net cash provided by operating activities. This strong result was achieved through an improved unit profitability and better-than-expected working capital management as well as from federal tax refunds and deferred payroll taxes related to the CARES Act. 
Note that we continue to participate in the appropriate country-specific government assistant programs from which we received approximately $159 million in labor credits that were mentioned previously throughout the year. The improved net cash provided by operating activities, combined with the measured use of capital expenditures, helped the company generate $282 million in free cash flow, better than our previously stated outlook. At year-end, we maintained strong liquidity with over $2 billion in cash availability. 
Now let me briefly review our GAAP results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $3.6 billion, operating income was $132 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.14. These results include $86 million in revenue from Next Level Hospitality at continues to be excluded from our organic revenue metric until we lap the acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal '22. As John mentioned, we are encouraged by the rebounding base revenues with organic revenue reaching 87% of pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter, slightly better than anticipated due to the acceleration of new account openings and higher-than-expected pricing pass-through. The performance in the quarter was driven by many areas of the business that have already approached or exceeded pre-COVID organic revenue levels through the result of initial contributions from fiscal '21 net new business, pricing and base volume recovery. 
In other selected areas, we are seeing some revenue streams within our portfolio continue to be impacted by COVID-19, such as retail and catering in the U.S. higher education and health care sectors; conference and convention centers, concerts and certain events in U.S. sports, leisure and correction sector; higher education in Canada and Continental Europe; sports & Entertainment in Continental Europe; as well as hospitality clients and Canadian operations in our Uniform segment. 
In addition, White Tower B&I, both in the U.S. and international, have had a longer recovery as companies have delayed the return -- full return to the office. Collectively, we anticipate these revenue streams that we've grouped into a COVID index will show continued improvement in fiscal '22. 
As you can see on the slide, the non-COVID-impacted areas of certain sectors, particularly within facilities and other health care and education as well as the Uniform segment are operating at or above pre-COVID revenue levels. 
Finally, let me share our fiscal '22 outlook. Based on our current expectations for fiscal '22, we project the following full year performance: organic revenue growth between 23% and 27% over prior year, with revenue expected to approach pre-COVID levels by year-end. The revenue outlook reflects a continued impact from COVID-19 in fiscal '22 of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion or 10% to 12% of pre-COVID revenue, partially offset by net new business wins and pricing pass-through. Adjusted operating income margin in a range of 5% to 5.5%, with the second half of the year reaching 6% to 6.5%. AOI margin outlook considers the $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion revenue impact of COVID-19. In many cases, the company has brought back operating and above-unit cost in advance of full revenue recovery. As COVID impacted volumes recovery, we expect this transitional impact on AOI margin to unwind, allowing us to leverage the existing cost in the business, resulting in an incremental margin on the remaining COVID-19 volume recovery of 15% to 20%. 
AOI margin will be temporarily affected by the start-up of new accounts, which typically have lower margins in the first year of operation, with an acceleration thereafter. The magnitude of new account start-ups in fiscal '22 has grown meaningfully following recent new business wins. As we continue to deliver on our net new results in future years, those start-up costs will be absorbed by the accelerating margin cadence of new client wins from prior years. At the moment, net new business is translating to approximately a 10 to 15 basis point headwind of fiscal '22 margins. 
Lastly, with global supply chain shortages that we're all managing through, we have been providing exceptional solutions for our clients to meet their needs. In some cases, this has resulted in utilizing secondary suppliers where our negotiated pricing is not always as favorable as with our preferred partners. While we are diligently managing this dynamic period, these off-program supply chain actions have resulted in what we believe is a temporary cost increase in certain areas of the business as we work with clients to help them innovatively address. Through pricing, supply chain initiatives and operating efficiencies, we expect to offset inflation. Free cash flow between $300 million and $400 million, which includes the upcoming December repayment of approximately $65 million of deferred payroll taxes associated with the CARES Act. An annualized net new business in the range of $550 million to $650 million, which would represent 3.5% to 4% of pre-COVID revenue and an increase relative to the record performance achieved in fiscal '21 when we had over $500 million of net new business or 3.1% of pre-COVID revenue. 
Together with the typical price and volume-based business growth of 1% to 2% that is currently shrouded by the impact of COVID, as John mentioned, we are well on our way to our mid-single-digit growth goal. Ultimately, we expect to achieve mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with ongoing margin progression that reaches pre-COVID levels and beyond. 
We look forward to sharing more on our operational and financial framework that we expect to deliver new levels of performing success at Aramark's upcoming Analyst Day in a few weeks. Thanks for your time this morning. John?"

John or Tom, just really exceptional new business bookings. Could we maybe talk about that a little bit? How much of it was competitive takeaways or new logos?

So that is a significant tick up over the historical average. 
I would say the marketplace is still very competitive, and we are working very hard in every sales situation to not only retain our existing customers but to sell our competitors' customers when they come to market. So really, the industry hasn't changed, but there is an accelerated level of outsourcing activity that I think all the organizations will benefit from. And I think it bodes well for certainly the next 12 months and possibly well beyond. We're seeing customers, both in our traditional marketplaces as well as some nontraditional opportunities come to us to consider it. So we're excited about our prospects. But all in all, we're just really excited about all the businesses and the results they've been able to achieve really reenergizing the growth culture of the company and really installing leadership that understands the lines of business and really are focused on that growth narrative, if you will.

I'll start with the second piece with the new business that we're winning because it's fundamental to the algorithm, if you will, over the coming years. We've got a very robust pro forma process from the ground up, regardless of the size of the contract. And John mentioned the average contract win this year was about $3.5 million. So that ranges from quite a bit smaller to bigger. And there's a lot of bread-and-butter accounts in there that may not rise to the level and usually don't rise to the level of, say, John and I reviewing it because the investment is very small and whatnot. 
So we need this rigorous process because all these little wins accumulate to a lot. And so the operators, sales folks, finance folks with HO lines of business and countries work through these pro formas together. It's not just the sales team or just the operators doing it. It's reviewed. It does progress up to change if there is certain levels of capital investment or the annual revenues get large. So again, very rigorous process to ensure that we're getting a return, that we're getting a margin that will be up at least around the company average over time. The bigger in accounts, we've talked about the longer ramp up. And then obviously, the cost plus versus P&L dictates sort of that margin progression over the lifespan of the contract. 
So a long way of saying that we feel confident that this startup, because we're coming off really at a 0 growth base, as we start to get into years 2 and 3 of this year and start to lap what we're going to be winning going forward, this headwind disappears and starts to build on itself. So hopefully, that will make sense. But again, we feel good about the type of business we're winning and that will ultimately be margin enhancing for us as we go forward. 
In terms of the build, the schedule and what you referred to, it is roughly the COVID index headwind that, I think your math's right, around $300 million, really trying to show on the 1 schedule in the deck how you would build back to pre-COVID level margins and how that factors in to it based on what our current outlook is. So if you take that $300 million and added on top of this fiscal '22 outlook, plus factor in some of the supply chain and new business headwinds we're dealing with at the moment, you work yourself back to that high 6%-plus margin, just to show that we're progressing as we have. And there's a lot of noise in the system, but that we're managing through it. And ultimately, we think back to and beyond those '19 margin levels."

And then we see pricing really as an offset to inflation to keep the margins moving upward as we're able to accelerate the growth. Because there's so much margin opportunity and so much leverage opportunity as we build scale and get that growth engine running, but that's what we're really trying to focus the team on. We'll get our cost recovery through pricing.

First off, we had very broad-based success across the enterprise. So almost all businesses had significant net new sales activity with the exception of a couple that were impacted by -- significantly by COVID. Think national parks, for example. The National Park Service did not have any bid processes over the course of the last, call it, 24 months. So that business did not have significant net new performance as we would hope. We're always bidding on new opportunities, but that business is essentially just operating its current business and doing it -- and doing very effectively, but -- so not a lot of growth coming from them. 
But other businesses like Facilities had fantastic sales years, significant self-op conversions of activity on the facility side, which is very encouraging, and we continue to see increased demand from that business. As I said, Higher Ed had record wins; very strong performance in K-12; big, good performance in B&I, both domestically and internationally. So it was a very broad-based successful year from a new account sales activity and from a retention perspective. So we're very pleased about that. This isn't 1 account that we sold in 1 business that's driving those results. It's a very broad-based level of activity from all the lines of business."

So I think we saw a pretty normalized activity in our fiscal '21 from a rebid perspective. Part of our retention, and we'll talk about this at the Analyst Day, but there were businesses that closed down. There were universities that shut down. There were businesses that shut down and just never came back. So some of that gap between the -- what my expectation is that 97% and 95.5% is the fact that some of those businesses just shuttered. But we count those. When they don't reopen, we count those as lost. So there is a little bit of that impact, and we'll get into that on December 9 and make sure that we have a full disclosure on what that impact was in both '20 and '21, so it's very clear to you. But no, I would expect '21 was a normal year. I think 2022 will be a normal year.

We're getting, as John said, broadbrush positive results across the piece year-to-year. It could vary a bit, but we feel very good about the progress that each of the segments are making in their growth journey and expect good results from all 3 over time. 
In terms of the bridge in the cash flow, we -- it's a strong -- very strong quarter. It's a very strong year for cash flow, certainly was helped with the -- by the federal tax refunds, very strong working capital management and, of course, the underlying operating results. Probably a bit higher if you look at it as a conversion or a percentage of AOI, higher certainly than we've done before because of a couple of those CARES Act items. But we do expect as we get into next year through the guidance to be back around that sort of 45%, 50% AOI conversion, which we historically have been to. I personally -- and we'll talk about it again in a few weeks. I personally like to see that continue to push a little higher. 
CapEx, I think pulling this back to the new business wins this year, I think the market remains very rational. As John mentioned, we're not lowering our return expectations or investing a lot more to win these contracts. So I think proportionally, I don't feel a lot of pressure on CapEx and therefore, free cash flow. So I think trying to get into that near 50% AOI conversion rate for free cash flow is a realistic target for us."

Today, I'll provide a strategic overview of our fourth quarter performance, recap our progress throughout fiscal '21 that included record levels of net new business and share an initial view of the year ahead that we expect will build on the strong foundation for growth we've experienced this year. Our teams across the globe are committed to reaching for remarkable [indiscernible] for our stakeholders, driven by service, innovation and growth. 
Over the course of the year, we executed on our strategic initiatives despite a challenging and complex operating environment. The cultural transformation in the business, combined with our renewed close partnerships with clients and suppliers, not only allowed us to navigate this unprecedented period, but also put us in a position to win and further increase performance levels across the business. In every one of our segments, we have made great progress. 
Among the highlights I'm most proud of, this year, we meaningfully accelerated Aramark's growth trajectory by adding senior leadership talent and making organizational changes that significantly bolstered our industry and line of business expertise, including sales leadership in many key roles by investing in growth-oriented areas of the business; by enhancing sales training and development programs; by further aligning our compensation approach with Aramark's strategic objectives, including net new business, which now represents 40% of the company's bonus incentive plan across the organization; by strengthening client and supplier relationships and enhancing our operating infrastructure. 
I'd like to take a moment to discuss our strong fiscal '21 net new business performance, which we attribute to the ownership mindset we've been cultivating, our ongoing focus on innovation and the scale of our platform. Our annualized gross new business wins totaled nearly $1.25 billion, the highest in company history, representing 7.7% of pre-COVID revenue. This performance was broad-based across segments with particularly strong contribution from the education and facilities in other sectors within FSS U.S. 
In Higher Education business, specifically, we added a record number of new clients that further strengthens the portfolio of our largest business. Our new business wins extended across lines of business, geographies and client size. In the United States, average annualized revenue for our new business wins was $3.4 million, emphasizing the breadth and depth of our ability to source clients, large to small. 
Our International segment continued to experience a broad-based steady growth trajectory across all countries, specifically led by industries such as mining, education, health care and B&I. Uniforms added to this performance, reflective of the investments we've made in growing this business. Our teams across the company are hard at work onboarding these new clients. 
We continue to benefit from greater first-time outsourcing activity, representing approximately 40% of wins globally and nearly half of all wins within the FSS U.S. segment derived from self-op conversions. Our strength and talent and new capabilities provide further differentiation in the marketplace and reflect how well we've adapted to the new normal. 
In fiscal '21, we also improved retention rates to 95.5%, 150 basis points better than our historical [ 5-year ] average. We are targeting retention rates to ultimately reach 97%. Accordingly, the magnitude of new business wins, combined with significant improved retention rates, allowed us to achieve record annualized net new business performance. As examples of our progress, the annualized revenue of our net new business was over $500 million, 5x higher than the average of the previous 5 years. 
The FSS U.S. segment reported a notable improvement with record high net new business of nearly $300 million, following negative net new results in 3 of the prior 5 years. And international increased net new business to approximately $150 million, over 30% higher than its historical average. Each segment reached important milestones by increasing retention rates more than 100 basis points, led by Uniforms with an improvement of 180 basis points. Collectively, this level of annualized net new business represents 3.1% of our pre-COVID level of revenue. Together, with our typical base business growth typically 1% to 2%, we are well on our way to our mid-single-digit growth goals. 
I'd now like to review Aramark's organic revenue performance by reportable segment in the fourth quarter then in total, increased 37% year-over-year and reached 87% of pre-COVID levels. FSS U.S. reported an organic revenue increase of 58% compared to the fourth quarter last year, as we implemented many of our newly-created programs across sectors. We welcome students and educators back to in-person learning at the start of the school year in both K-12 and Higher Education. Fans largely returned to stadiums at full capacity for Major League Baseball, and the National Football League season is underway. Our Leisure business benefited from ongoing activity at National Parks and corrections that already returned to pre-COVID levels. 
B&I clients began to implement greater in-person return to work activity, although at a measured pace. At Aramark, we are fully back in our offices here in Philadelphia as of October 18. Facilities continued serving clients with in-demand services, ensuring locations were ready and safe for increased in-person activity. And health care gradually improved as patient care began to normalize with a higher level of voluntary procedures, routine medical appointments and hospital visitation. International organic revenue grew 21% year-over-year, driven by stronger performance in Canada and Europe. Sports & Entertainment and Education in our international geographies reported improved business activity with the pace of reopenings behind the U.S. 
Organic revenue in the Uniform segment grew 5% in the quarter, driven by rentals and adjacency services, with hospitality clients experiencing increased levels of activity. Key areas of focus in Uniforms include higher growth rates in recurring business, customer-route density optimization, merchandise management and enhanced back-office utilization. 
As you saw from our announcement a few weeks ago, we're extremely excited to have Kim Scott join as President and CEO of Aramark Uniform Services. I am confident that Kim's leadership and extensive commercial experience positions her well to accelerate profitable growth in this segment while simultaneously enhancing our employee and customer experiences. I look forward to Kim's meaningful contributions to the business as a member of our executive leadership team reporting to me. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Brad Drummond for his many years of service as he retires from Aramark. 
Now I'd like to provide some perspective on a few relevant and broader topics important to our business that have been top of mind in capturing the headlines for what seems like months, namely navigating a dynamic global supply chain and tight labor market. While we have seen supply chain disruption in the food service industry, our scale, proactive management, deep bench of suppliers and menu flexibility has helped us mitigate much of this for our clients. Our overall focus remains on leveraging spend, optimizing supplier relationships and ensuring availability of in-demand products and honoring our commitments to sustainability and local diverse suppliers, all of which will position us to continue to effectively weather this storm. 
We are also actively monitoring the markets for inflationary pressures and buying opportunities, relying on our use of fixed contract pricing and the ability to pass on market-driven pricing to moderate any near-term impact on the business. We are currently in active deployment of our new field ordering technology for our managed services business, which will streamline our operators' buying activities and ensure alignment with optimized supply chain programs. 
On the labor side, we continue to effectively adapt to the environment. We've been implementing strategies to mitigate labor costs, led by disciplined scheduling protocols and efficient resource management aligned with demand as well as leveraging technology in this area. We're also able to benefit from our scale by utilizing our flexible operating model, full employee base and leveraging client locations in adjacent geographies. 
Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that we've taken a big step in our goal of reducing our environmental impact and carbon footprint by committing to establish a definitive target for our greenhouse gas emissions. When we finalize our goal, it will be a science-based target submitted through the Science-Based Targets Initiative or SBTI. As you likely know, SBTI is a joint effort between the UN Global Compact, the World Widelife Federation and other international environmental auditing groups. This is important news for Aramark as we deepen our commitment to transparency in our environmental stewardship. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the community service and passion exhibited by the Aramark teams globally. Our most recent Building Community Day, consisted of thousands of team members leading nearly 80 virtual and in-person projects taking place at 6 different countries. I am extremely proud of our commitment to making a positive impact on people and planet. 
And now Tom will provide a detailed financial review of the business. Tom?"

Over the next few minutes, I will discuss our financial results in the quarter, including detailed insight into the business as we frame the ongoing recovery and share our outlook as we enter fiscal '22. 
In the fourth quarter and really since the start of COVID's impact on the business, we've continued to control what we could control, whether that was effectively leveraging our variable cost-based operating model at the onset of the pandemic, implementing disciplined strategies to strengthen our balance sheet or taking action to invest and transform the culture of the organization. We are extremely proud of the progress we've made and recognize that this is just the beginning. 
Our performance in the quarter reflected our team's focus and resolve. Adjusted operating income was $165 million, resulting in a constant currency AOI margin of 4.8%, improving 120 basis points from the third quarter. Improved profitability was driven by strong unit-based cost management and the ability to leverage above-unit operating costs in SG&A across higher sales volumes. These drivers resulted in adjusted EPS that was $0.21 compared to an adjusted loss per share of $0.35 in the fourth quarter last year. 
We also took action over the course of the year to manage our balance sheet, resulting in interest expense savings of over $10 million versus fourth quarter fiscal '20, which also contributed to the adjusted EPS improvement. In fiscal '21, the company delivered $480 million of year-over-year improvement in net cash provided by operating activities. This strong result was achieved through an improved unit profitability and better-than-expected working capital management as well as from federal tax refunds and deferred payroll taxes related to the CARES Act. 
Note that we continue to participate in the appropriate country-specific government assistant programs from which we received approximately $159 million in labor credits that were mentioned previously throughout the year. The improved net cash provided by operating activities, combined with the measured use of capital expenditures, helped the company generate $282 million in free cash flow, better than our previously stated outlook. At year-end, we maintained strong liquidity with over $2 billion in cash availability. 
Now let me briefly review our GAAP results. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $3.6 billion, operating income was $132 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.14. These results include $86 million in revenue from Next Level Hospitality and continues to be excluded from our organic revenue metric until we lap the acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal '22. As John mentioned, we are encouraged by the rebounding base revenues with organic revenue reaching 87% of pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter, slightly better than anticipated due to the acceleration of new account openings and higher-than-expected pricing pass-through. The performance in the quarter was driven by many areas of the business that have already approached or exceeded pre-COVID organic revenue levels through the result of initial contributions from fiscal '21 net new business, pricing and base volume recovery. 
In other selected areas, we are seeing some revenue streams within our portfolio continue to be impacted by COVID-19, such as retail and catering in the U.S. Higher Education and health care sectors; conference and convention centers, concerts and certain events in U.S. sports, leisure and -- correction sector; higher education in Canada and Continental Europe; Sports & Entertainment in Continental Europe; as well as hospitality clients and Canadian operations in our Uniform segment. 
In addition, White Tower B&I, both in the U.S. and international, have had a longer recovery as companies have delayed the return -- full return to the office. Collectively, we anticipate these revenue streams that we've grouped into a COVID Index will show continued improvement in fiscal '22. As you can see on the slide, the non-COVID-impacted areas of certain sectors, particularly within facilities and other health care and education as well as the Uniform segment are operating at or above pre-COVID revenue levels. 
Finally, let me share our fiscal '22 outlook. Based on our current expectations for fiscal '22, we project the following full year performance, organic revenue growth between 23% and 27% over prior year, with revenue expected to approach pre-COVID levels by year-end. The revenue outlook reflects a continued impact from COVID-19 in fiscal '22 of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion or 10% to 12% of pre-COVID revenue, partially offset by net new business wins and pricing pass-through. Adjusted operating income margin in a range of 5% to 5.5%, with the second half of the year reaching 6% to 6.5%. AOI margin outlook considers the $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion revenue impact of COVID-19. 
In many cases, the company has brought back operating and above-unit cost in advance of full revenue recovery. As COVID impacted volumes recovery, we expect this transitional impact on AOI margin to unwind, allowing us to leverage the existing cost in the business, resulting in an incremental margin on the remaining COVID-19 volume recovery of 15% to 20%. 
AOI margin will be temporarily affected by the start-up of new accounts, which typically have lower margins in the first year of operation, with an acceleration thereafter. The magnitude of new account start-ups in fiscal '22 has grown meaningfully following recent new business wins. As we continue to deliver on our net new results in future years, those start-up costs will be absorbed by the accelerating margin cadence of new client wins from prior years. At the moment, net new business is translating to approximately a 10 to 15 basis point headwind of fiscal '22 margins. 
Lastly, with global supply chain shortages that we're all managing through, we have been providing exceptional solutions for our clients to meet their needs. In some cases, this has resulted in utilizing secondary suppliers where our negotiated pricing is not always as favorable as with our preferred partners. While we are diligently managing this dynamic period, these off-program supply chain actions have resulted in what we believe is a temporary cost increase in certain areas of the business as we work with clients to help them innovatively address. Through pricing, supply chain initiatives and operating efficiencies, we expect to offset inflation: free cash flow between $300 million and $400 million, which includes the upcoming December repayment of approximately $65 million of deferred payroll taxes associated with the CARES Act; an annualized net new business in the range of $550 million to $650 million, which would represent 3.5% to 4% of pre-COVID revenue and an increase relative to the record performance achieved in fiscal '21 when we had over $500 million of net new business or 3.1% of pre-COVID revenue. 
Together with the typical price and volume-based business growth of 1% to 2% that is currently shrouded by the impact of COVID, as John mentioned, we are well on our way to our mid-single-digit growth goal. Ultimately, we expect to achieve mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with ongoing margin progression that reaches pre-COVID levels and beyond. 
We look forward to sharing more on our operational and financial framework that we expect to deliver new levels of performing success at Aramark's upcoming Analyst Day in a few weeks. Thanks for your time this morning. John?"

So that is a significant tick up over the historical average. 
I would say the marketplace is still very competitive, and we are working very hard in every sales situation to not only retain our existing customers but to sell our competitors' customers when they come to market. So really, the industry hasn't changed, but there is an accelerated level of outsourcing activity that I think all the organizations will benefit from. And I think it bodes well for certainly the next 12 months and possibly well beyond. We're seeing customers, both in our traditional marketplaces as well as some nontraditional opportunities come to us to consider it. So we're excited about our prospects. But all in all, we're just really excited about all the businesses and the results they've been able to achieve, really reenergizing the growth culture of the company and really installing leadership that understands the lines of business and really are focused on that growth narrative, if you will.

I'll start with the second piece with the new business that we're winning because it's fundamental to the algorithm, if you will, over the coming years. We've got a very robust pro forma process from the ground up, regardless of the size of the contract. And John mentioned the average contract win this year was about $3.5 million. So that ranges from quite a bit smaller to bigger. And there's a lot of bread-and-butter accounts in there that may not rise to the level and usually don't rise to the level of, say, John and I reviewing it because the investment is very small and whatnot. 
So we need this rigorous process because all these little wins accumulate to a lot. And so the operators, sales folks, finance folks with each [indiscernible] lines of business and countries work through these pro formas together. It's not just the sales team or just the operators doing it. It's reviewed. It does progress up to change if there is certain levels of capital investment or the annual revenues get large. So again, very rigorous process to ensure that we're getting a return, that we're getting a margin that will be up at least around the company average over time. The bigger the accounts we've talked about, the longer ramp up. And then obviously, the cost plus versus P&L dictates sort of that margin progression over the lifespan of the contract. 
So a long way of saying that we feel confident that this startup, because we're coming off really at a 0 growth base, as we start to get into years 2 and 3 of this year and start to lap what we're going to be winning going forward, this headwind disappears and starts to build on itself. So hopefully, that will make sense. But again, we feel good about the type of business we're winning and that will ultimately be margin enhancing for us as we go forward. 
In terms of the build, the schedule and what you referred to, it is roughly the COVID Index headwind that, I think your math's right, around $300 million, really trying to show on the 1 schedule in the deck, how you would build back to pre-COVID level margins, and how that factors in to it based on what our current outlook is. So if you take that $300 million and add it on top of this fiscal '22 outlook, plus factor in some of the supply chain and new business headwinds we're dealing with at the moment, you work yourself back to the high 6%-plus margin, just to show that we're progressing as we have. And there's a lot of noise in the system, but that we're managing through it. And ultimately, we think back to and beyond those '19 margin levels."

We'll get our cost recovery through pricing. We'll mitigate costs through various other kinds of initiatives, but we'll really drive growth by selling new accounts, retaining our existing business and then growing volumes in our base business."

First off, we had very broad-based success across the enterprise. So almost all businesses had significant net new sales activity with the exception of a couple that were impacted by -- significantly by COVID. Think national parks, for example. The National Park Service did not have any bid processes over the course of the last, call it, 24 months. So that business did not have significant net new performance as we would hope. We're always bidding on new opportunities, but that business is essentially just operating its current business and doing it -- and doing very effectively, but -- so not a lot of growth coming from them. 
But other businesses like Facilities had fantastic sales years, significant self-op conversions of activity on the facility side, which is very encouraging, and we continue to see increased demand from that business. As I said, Higher Ed had record wins; very strong performance in K-12; big, good performance in B&I, both domestically and internationally. So it was a very broad-based successful year from a new account sales activity and from a retention perspective. So we're very pleased about that. This isn't 1 account that we sold in 1 business that's driving those results. It's a very broad-based level of activity from all the lines of business."

But the campus administrations are not having big meetings and big conferences and those kinds of things. So that's that extraordinary catering that typically add significant revenue growth to us.

Part of our retention, and we'll talk about this at the Analyst Day, but there were businesses that closed down. There were universities that shut down. There were businesses that shut down and just never came back. So some of that gap between the -- what my expectation is that 97% and 95.5% is the fact that some of those businesses just shuttered. But we count those. When they don't reopen, we count those as lost. So there is a little bit of that impact, and we'll get into that on December 9 and make sure that we have a full disclosure on what that impact was in both '20 and '21, so it's very clear to you. But no, I would expect '21 was a normal year. I think 2022 will be a normal year.

In terms of the bridge in the cash flow, we -- it's a strong -- very strong quarter. It's a very strong year for cash flow, certainly was helped with the -- by the federal tax refunds, very strong working capital management and, of course, the underlying operating results. Probably a bit higher if you look at it as a conversion or a percentage of AOI, higher certainly than we've done before because of a couple of those CARES Act items. But we do expect as we get into next year through the guidance to be back around that sort of 45%, 50% AOI conversion, which we historically have been to. I personally -- and we'll talk about it again in a few weeks. I personally like to see that continue to push a little higher. 
CapEx, I think pulling this back to the new business wins this year, I think the market remains very rational. As John mentioned, we're not lowering our return expectations or investing a lot more to win these contracts. So I think proportionally, I don't feel a lot of pressure on CapEx and therefore, free cash flow.
