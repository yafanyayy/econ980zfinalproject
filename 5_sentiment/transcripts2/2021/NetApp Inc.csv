I hope that you and your loved ones have stayed safe and healthy since the last time we spoke. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter with our third consecutive quarter of revenue and billings growth despite the challenging environment. In the third quarter, our team delivered revenues at the top of our guidance range and operating margin and EPS above the high end of our expectations. 
Our performance in Q3 was broad-based, with notable strength in Americas enterprise. The incremental sales capacity we added in FY '20 continues to pay off. Additionally, our Run to NetApp competitive takeout program is delivering continued success as we gain share and displace competitors' installed bases. Most importantly, this quarter, we once again demonstrated our ability to grow in both of our key markets: cloud and all-flash arrays. As we have said many times, cloud is additive to our business, that what we do in the cloud helps expand our on-premises business and that our enterprise hardened software and experience provide a solid foundation for our work in the cloud. 
Cloud services ARR grew to $237 million, an increase of 186% year-over-year. We saw good momentum across the portfolio, with Azure NetApp Files and Spot being the standout services, both delivering significant growth. We continue to expand with existing customers while adding new enterprise and cloud-native customers. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention rate is a healthy 227%. 
Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications and invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business. We had a significant presence at both AWS re:Invent and at Google Sales kickoff meeting. This engagement helps us stay top of mind with their sellers and reach customers with our cloud value proposition. 
We are benefiting as customers move more Tier 1 workloads such as SAP to the cloud. Our cloud volume service delivers the performance and availability required by mission-critical applications. To address the substantial cloud opportunity ahead, we are pulling forward investments with our public cloud partners, adding dedicated sales capacity and expanding our presence in additional regions. As we look ahead, we have a strong pipeline to support our Q4 target. Our cloud partner engagement and expanding product road map reinforce our confidence in our long-term goal of achieving $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal year '25. 
Our all-flash business grew 11% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.6 billion. For the third consecutive quarter, we believe we outpaced the market, gaining share from competitors and converting our installed base from hybrid arrays to all-flash. At the end of Q3, 27% of installed systems were all-flash, giving us plenty of headroom for continued growth. Our all-flash arrays received accolades from industry analysts and customers alike. They integrate cloud connectivity with the speed and efficiency of flash to deliver a smart, powerful and trusted solution for the most demanding enterprise workloads. 
In Q3, we expanded the breadth of our flash offerings with the introduction of the FAS500f, our first all-flash array leveraging QLC technology. The FAS500f is a highly scalable solution for deployments that support huge volumes of unstructured data such as medical imaging, electronic design automation and computer-aided design and manufacturing. 
Our cloud services and flash systems are built on the same primary software foundation, ONTAP. This shared R&D foundation gives us significant leverage in our R&D investment. We are able to innovate and test at cloud speed while bringing new functionality to the enterprise data center at a pace IT can absorb. This shared innovation also benefits customers, giving them a similar operating environment and consistent data management tools on-premises and in the cloud. It also enables them to move their data seamlessly to the right location at the right price at the right time. 
As I noted on our last call, NetApp is helping customers accelerate their digital transformations and put their data to work to elevate their businesses. Digital transformation is now a necessity, requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future. 
Having an integrated flexible data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this, data is growing in scale and importance. We believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend. We are uniquely positioned to address customers' requirements for workloads that move to the cloud as well as those that maintain and modernize on premises. 
Let me share a few wins from the third quarter to illustrate why customers choose NetApp to manage their data in the hybrid cloud. A global pharmaceutical manufacturer needed to overcome the compliance challenges of regulatory mandates while minimizing security risks in moving to the public cloud. They selected NetApp all-flash FAS to underpin their AI-driven health care because of our cloud connectivity and the ability to achieve petabyte scale, along with our unique data protection and data management capabilities. 
At a leading global clinical trial laboratory, NetApp displaced Dell to host workloads for the company's AI labs. We won because of our performance, cloud connectivity and data management and security capabilities. The ability to leverage NetApp cloud services when necessary was critical to the customer's decision. 
Calendar 2020 was a difficult year for all of us and I'm glad to have it behind us. I want to express my gratitude to the NetApp team for quickly coming together to deliver solid results by helping our customers thrive while working remotely. We see reasons for optimism for calendar 2021 with expanding vaccine availability and improving public health conditions. However, uncertainty about the new normal as well as the tax and regulatory environments remain. In uncertain markets, data is even more critical as organizations look to drive competitive advantage, and we are confident in our strategy and the strength of our business going forward. 
Cloud and All Flash FAS fuel the momentum in our high margin software, cloud services and recurring maintenance revenue streams. This growth, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach to investing in the business and sustained capital returns will create significant long-term shareholder value. 
The new NetApp is a cloud-led software company and it's built on a solid foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world's leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships with the world's leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a strong business model with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage. As the recovery gradually unfolds, we believe we will be in an even stronger position as customers continue to turn to NetApp to help them solve the challenge of managing data in the hybrid cloud. I'll now turn it over to Mike for more details on our results. Mike?"
32052,703350927,2222394,"NetApp, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue at the high end of our guide and operating margin and",850,"Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue at the high end of our guide and operating margin and EPS above expectations. Importantly, solid execution yielded Q3 billings of $1.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This is our third straight quarter of year-over-year billings growth. In Q3, net revenue of $1.47 billion increased 5% year-over-year, including 2 points of currency tailwind. 
We believe our 2 key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and public cloud services, both continued to outperform the market. When combined, software revenue, recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $3.8 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. 
As we highlighted at our Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher software and maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $652 million was up 11% year-over-year, positioning us for share gains for the third consecutive quarter. Only 27% of our installed systems were all-flash at the end of Q3, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business. 
Public cloud services delivered a solid $237 million in ARR, growing 186% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. We continue to see strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q3 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 227%. Given the strong sales pipeline heading into Q4, we expect to exit fiscal '21 with cloud ARR of $260 million to $290 million. We remain excited about our expanding cloud product road map, which includes continued co-development and deep R&D partnerships with the public cloud partners. 
As we head into fiscal '22, we are investing in additional cloud sales capacity to support our expanding product road map and our partners' go-to-market motion. We remain confident in our ability to deliver $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal '25. 
Total product revenue of $775 million decreased approximately 2% year-over-year. As George noted, in the quarter, we saw good engagement from enterprise accounts, particularly in the Americas, where the sales capacity added last year is paying dividends. Consistent with the growth we delivered in Q2, software product revenue of $428 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. 
Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $627 million was an all-time company high and was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. To help with your modeling of maintenance, please note Q3 includes a $7 million year-to-date adjustment from hardware maintenance revenue to software maintenance revenue. To be clear, this adjustment did not impact total maintenance revenue in the quarter. 
Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53.4% and consistent with our expectations. Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us with gross margin of 82.9%. 
Q3 operating expenses of $668 million were in line with our expectations. Operating margin of 21.9% and EPS of $1.10 were both nicely ahead of our guidance, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from operations was $373 million and free cash flow was $341 million, representing 23% of revenue. Year-to-date free cash flow of $650 million is up 13% year-over-year. We expect operating cash flow to grow double digits for the full fiscal year. 
During Q3, we reinitiated our share repurchase program, buying back $50 million in stock. During the quarter, we also paid out $107 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $157 million to shareholders in Q3, representing 46% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
Now to guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.44 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes 3 points of currency tailwind. Given our growing confidence in the business, we narrowed the revenue range to $100 million. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 21% and 22% in Q4. Assumed in this guidance, our operating expenses of $675 million to $685 million. 
Given the magnitude of our cloud opportunity, we plan to pull forward investments in both sales capacity and our product road map, positioning our cloud services for continued rapid growth heading into fiscal '22. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%. And we expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.06 and $1.14 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for continued execution and commitment in delivering another outstanding quarter.  We remain incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

Q4, the early signs are very constructive. The pipeline's strong. Our competitive position, I would not trade for anyone else in the market. So I feel really, really good about the opportunity ahead not only in Q4 but going forward. 
I think what you see in our guidance is a bit of prudence, given that there's still a COVID environment. That while the vaccine availability provides incremental confidence, there are many other elements that need to come together to really give total line of sight to the new normal. That includes tax, regulation, new policy decision frameworks from the government, the stimulus package and other things. 
So we feel very good about the year. We feel really good about the pipeline heading into Q4.

But overall, sort of the bigger picture, there's no question that '21 calendar year will be a better year than '20. 
I think within that, then we have gained share in the market. And within our overall portfolio, we see all-flash continuing to be a greater part of the mix, especially as newer technologies that make flash more cost-effective comes to market. So things like QLC, where we are in the early innings of. So as I said, we don't think flash will be 100% of the storage market. We think it will be a substantial percentage.

The other is expanding deployments. So we've covered -- with some of the cloud providers, we've covered the large markets. Now we are starting to pursue parts of the world, for example, in Asia Pacific or Latin America that we didn't cover before. And so this is the ongoing build-out. 
I think with regard to the sets of customer types that we see, we are really excited at the progress that we've achieved this year. We are acquiring customers at an accelerating pace in our cloud business. And once they join NetApp's cloud portfolio, our dollar-based retention rate shows up really strongly. They really like our offerings and they expand deployment substantially with us. 
They are across a broad range of verticals, more in the less regulated than in the regulated industries where we are still going through certifications. The second is they cover a broad range of customer types, whether they are digital natives that never bought from NetApp, enterprises that were primarily competitors, customers or customers that use NetApp. 
As our all-flash array business and our cloud business have demonstrated for multiple quarters in a row, cloud is additive to our overall business. And there are customers who start with us in the cloud, who then come back and buy stuff in the data center. So very pleased with the progress. The work that we are doing with the cloud providers will continue to expand in scale and scope and which is why, again, I feel really good about our long-term opportunity and the ability to reach the $1 billion ARR target in fiscal year '25."

And when we gave our guidance for Q3, we talked about, hey, we thought that would normalize a little bit and that's exactly what happened. So we had another very strong quarter in all-flash systems. 
But there's a little bit more, I'll call it, normally distributed between low, mid and high, and that's what we saw. And I think you can see that in the product margin. And then, again, they were helped a little bit by lower NAND costs. So it came in pretty much what we expected, much more normal distribution. And that's also what we're expecting going into Q4. Again, it's tough for us to do demand shaping of those because of the great flexibility in our products, our customers can do different configurations to still achieve that performance. So we expect it to be pretty normal and similar to Q3."

We drew out the Americas because of the fact that the performance was particularly strong in the Americas. As you know, our business is preponderantly enterprise, meaning small, medium business is a small percentage of our total business. It didn't perform badly. It performed well but it's a small percentage of our total business. 
On the enterprise, I think what we saw was a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is stabilization of demand, normal linearity through the quarter, the sort of COVID strong segments, meaning the ones that were -- had business models that were less impacted by COVID like financial services or health care, continue to be strong demand sources for us, and we have really good offerings in that part of the market. 
I think with regard to the outlook, again, I think as we said, many, many customers are starting to prioritize the new normal, what business looks like going forward. Digital transformation becomes a key part of any business's go-forward plans, and we are a big part of enabling a modern data foundation for digital transformation. So those projects continue to move forward. NetApp has really good technology to also help in hybrid cloud and cybersecurity projects, for example, protection against ransomware and other types of malicious data threats. And we saw a good pickup across the portfolio for that as well."

We would expect to see it grow slightly; cloud continue to grow; and then product revenue likely growing or similar levels to what we've seen in Q1, 2 and 3. 
And this goes back to Katy's question because again, I just want to keep talking about this is, keep in mind that billings growth has been 6%, 10% and 6% in the first 3 quarters. Product growth over that time when you back out the 14th week as an average about 3%. So mix matters here a lot. And so to that point and to the earlier question on maintenance, we do expect to see continued growth in maintenance as we do more off-line systems, continued growth in cloud and product revenue will be a result really of the mix in all-flash. Hopefully, that helps."

I think in Q3, we saw normal linearity. So you can see from our DSO and from our inventory turns that we did not have a back-end loaded quarter. It was pretty steady linearity throughout the quarter and we feel good about that. That's a good sign heading into the rest of the calendar year for us. And so we feel -- we've done well.

In addition, when you look at the dollar-based net retention, but obviously, our existing customers, we're seeing great growth there as well. One of the nice things about the cloud business is from a margin perspective, it's not going to vary that much in terms of new versus existing. Certainly, existing customers that have more than 1 product, you'll start to see some margin expansion there as well. 
But as we look across new versus existing, I don't think there's a material difference there. However, I think that will help expand those margins as we go forward. We've talked about our driver in terms of driving gross margins in the cloud business. Especially as they take on more than 1 product, more data services and more solutions, that will certainly help us scale that business at a higher margin."

We have a broad range of purchasing agreements with customers. I think for some, there are preferred pricing agreements or master purchasing agreements where they are locked into pricing schedules where we don't have the ability to move pricing up or down depending on what happens to NAND prices. In the transactional environment, where there's no long-term pricing agreements, we are -- we take a look at the impact of commodity prices. We typically pass that through either beneficially or to disadvantage to customers. We're not trying to hedge it. 
I think we are cognizant this time in the COVID environment of the particular challenge that our customers face so we try to be a good partner to them. As Mike and I both said at Financial Analyst Day, post COVID, given the continued progress of our all-flash array business, we see the ability to return to the mid-50s product gross margins."

I think we have every confidence that we have a multiyear game plan of achieving the $1 billion ARR number. I think we will give you the ability to sustain growth rates beyond that when we get to it. 
What I'll give you a sense of is, cloud is a gigantic market, and the growth of cloud over the next 5 years will be much bigger than the growth of cloud over the past 5 years. So if you think that there is constraints to overall TAM, I just think that even the $1 billion ARR will be a small part of the overall cloud market in that time frame. So we're not TAM-constrained. I think our position in the market is unique, and we are continuing to execute on product road map expansions and go-to-market investments, as Mike and I have talked about in prepared remarks. 
With regard to dollar-based net retention, I think it reflects the strength of our offerings. When a customer signs up and is activated and starts to work with us, they grow substantially in terms of their usage of our products, which is really good. I think both Mike and I see that over time, it should trend back towards more industry norms. I think 227%, which we had this quarter, is well above industry norms, reflecting the early phase of our cloud journey. Mike, feel free to add."

I think with regard to what Spot brings to the table is they bring 2 assets to the table. One is that they are able to solve a large and growing customer problem, which is the problem of unused or unspent cloud dollars, and that is a topic that is near and dear to every CFO and CIO that I talk to, including Mike at NetApp. We're a customer of Spot and they save us a substantial amount of money. 
We are able to use Spot not only to go after cloud-native digital native customers that never bought from NetApp, as well as to now find ways into new parts of large enterprises that didn't know NetApp and now get pleasantly surprised by the whole cloud portfolio. So I'm super excited. 
They also have a really good offering for container-based workloads that, in combination with some of our storage offerings, gives us a really expanded set of differentiated capabilities for truly cloud-native applications."

I hope that you and your loved ones have stayed safe and healthy since the last time we spoke. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter with our third consecutive quarter of revenue and billings growth despite the challenging environment. In the third quarter, our team delivered revenues at the top of our guidance range and operating margin and EPS above the high end of our expectations. 
Our performance in Q3 was broad-based, with notable strength in Americas enterprise. The incremental sales capacity we added in FY '20 continues to pay off. Additionally, our Run to NetApp competitive takeout program is delivering continued success as we gain share and displace competitors' installed bases. Most importantly, this quarter, we once again demonstrated our ability to grow in both of our key markets: cloud and all-flash arrays. As we have said many times, cloud is additive to our business that what we do in the cloud helps expand our on-premises business and that our enterprise hardened software and experience provide a solid foundation for our work in the cloud.
Cloud services ARR grew to $237 million, an increase of 186% year-over-year. We saw good momentum across the portfolio, with Azure NetApp Files and Spot being the standout services, both delivering significant growth. We continue to expand with existing customers while adding new enterprise and cloud-native customers. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention rate is a healthy 227%. 
Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications and invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business. We had a significant presence at both AWS re:Invent and at Google sales kickoff meeting. This engagement helps us stay top of mind with their sellers and reach customers with our cloud value proposition.
We are benefiting as customers move more Tier 1 workloads, such as SAP to the cloud. Our cloud volume service delivers the performance and availability required by mission-critical applications. To address the substantial cloud opportunity ahead, we are pulling forward investments with our public cloud partners, adding dedicated sales capacity and expanding our presence in additional regions. As we look ahead, we have a strong pipeline to support our Q4 target. Our cloud partner engagement and expanding product road map reinforce our confidence in our long-term goal of achieving $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal year '25.
Our all-flash business grew 11% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.6 billion. For the third consecutive quarter, we believe we outpaced the market, gaining share from competitors and converting our installed base from hybrid arrays to all-flash. At the end of Q3, 27% of installed systems were all-flash, giving us plenty of headroom for continued growth. Our all-flash arrays received accolades from industry analysts and customers alike. They integrate cloud connectivity with the speed and efficiency of flash to deliver a smart, powerful and trusted solution for the most demanding enterprise workloads.
In Q3, we expanded the breadth of our flash offerings with the introduction of the FAS500f, our first all-flash array leveraging QLC technology. The FAS500f is a highly scalable solution for deployments that support huge volumes of unstructured data such as medical imaging, electronic design automation and computer-aided design and manufacturing. 
Our cloud services and flash systems are built on the same primary software foundation, ONTAP. This shared R&D foundation gives us significant leverage in our R&D investment. We are able to innovate and test at cloud speed while bringing new functionality to the enterprise data center at a pace IT can absorb. This shared innovation also benefits customers, giving them a similar operating environment and consistent data management tools on premises and in the cloud. It also enables them to move their data seamlessly to the right location at the right price at the right time. 
As I noted on our last call, NetApp is helping customers accelerate their digital transformations and put their data to work to elevate their businesses. Digital transformation is now a necessity, requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future.
Having an integrated, flexible data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this, data is growing in scale and importance. We believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend. We are uniquely positioned to address customers' requirements for workloads that move to the cloud as well as those that maintain and modernize on premises.
Let me share a few wins from the third quarter to illustrate why customers choose NetApp to manage their data in the hybrid cloud. A global pharmaceutical manufacturer needed to overcome the compliance challenges of regulatory mandates while minimizing security risks in moving to the public cloud. They selected NetApp all-flash FAS to underpin their AI-driven health care because of our cloud connectivity and the ability to achieve petabyte scale, along with our unique data protection and data management capabilities.
At a leading global clinical trial laboratory, NetApp displaced Dell to host workloads for the company's AI labs. We won because of our performance, cloud connectivity and data management and security capabilities. The ability to leverage NetApp cloud services when necessary was critical to the customer's decision. 
Calendar 2020 was a difficult year for all of us, and I'm glad to have it behind us. I want to express my gratitude to the NetApp team for quickly coming together to deliver solid results by helping our customers thrive while working remotely. We see reasons for optimism for calendar 2021 with expanding vaccine availability and improving public health conditions. However, uncertainty about the new normal as well as the tax and regulatory environments remain. In uncertain markets, data is even more critical as organizations look to drive competitive advantage, and we are confident in our strategy and the strength of our business going forward.
Cloud and All Flash FAS fuel the momentum in our high margin software, cloud services and recurring maintenance revenue streams. This growth, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach to investing in the business and sustained capital returns will create significant long-term shareholder value. 
The new NetApp is a cloud-led software company, and it's built on a solid foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world's leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships with the world's leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a strong business model with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage. As the recovery gradually unfolds, we believe we will be in an even stronger position as customers continue to turn to NetApp to help them solve the challenge of managing data in the hybrid cloud. 
I'll now turn it over to Mike for more details on our results. Mike?"

As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue at the high end of our guide and operating margin and EPS above expectations. Importantly, solid execution yielded Q3 billings of $1.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This is our third straight quarter of year-over-year billings growth. 
In Q3, net revenue of $1.47 billion increased 5% year-over-year, including 2 points of currency tailwind. We believe our 2 key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and public cloud services, both continued to outperform the market. When combined, software revenue, recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $3.8 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher software and maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio. 
As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $652 million was up 11% year-over-year, positioning us for share gains for the third consecutive quarter. Only 27% of our installed systems were all-flash at the end of Q3, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business. 
Public cloud services delivered a solid $237 million in ARR, growing 186% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. We continue to see strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q3 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 227%. Given the strong sales pipeline heading into Q4, we expect to exit fiscal '21 with cloud ARR of $260 million to $290 million. We remain excited about our expanding cloud product road map, which includes continued co-development and deep R&D partnerships with the public cloud partners. As we head into fiscal '22, we are investing in additional cloud sales capacity to support our expanding product road map and our partners' go-to-market motion. We remain confident in our ability to deliver $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal '25.
Total product revenue of $775 million decreased approximately 2% year-over-year. As George noted, in the quarter, we saw good engagement from enterprise accounts, particularly in the Americas, where the sales capacity added last year is paying dividends. Consistent with the growth we delivered in Q2, software product revenue of $428 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio.
Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $627 million was an all-time company high and was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. To help with your modeling of maintenance, please note Q3 includes a $7 million year-to-date adjustment from hardware maintenance revenue to software maintenance revenue. To be clear, this adjustment did not impact total maintenance revenue in the quarter.
Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53.4% and consistent with our expectations. Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us with gross margin of 82.9%.
Q3 operating expenses of $668 million were in line with our expectations. Operating margin of 21.9% and EPS of $1.10 were both nicely ahead of our guidance, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from operations was $373 million and free cash flow was $341 million, representing 23% of revenue. Year-to-date free cash flow of $650 million is up 13% year-over-year. We expect operating cash flow to grow double digits for the full fiscal year.
During Q3, we reinitiated our share repurchase program, buying back $50 million in stock. During the quarter, we also paid out $107 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $157 million to shareholders in Q3, representing 46% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Now to guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.44 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes 3 points of currency tailwind. Given our growing confidence in the business, we narrowed the revenue range to $100 million. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 21% and 22% in Q4. Assumed in this guidance, our operating expenses of $675 million to $685 million. 
Given the magnitude of our cloud opportunity, we plan to pull forward investments in both sales capacity and our product road map, positioning our cloud services for continued rapid growth heading into fiscal '22. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%, and we expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.06 and $1.14 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for continued execution and commitment in delivering another outstanding quarter.  We remain incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead.

So I feel really, really good about the opportunity ahead not only in Q4 but going forward. 
I think what you see in our guidance is a bit of prudence, given that there's still a COVID environment. That while the vaccine availability provides incremental confidence, there are many other elements that need to come together to really give total line of sight to the new normal. That includes tax, regulation, new policy decision frameworks from the government, the stimulus package and other things.
So we feel very good about the year. We feel really good about the pipeline heading into Q4. Our competitive position is strong and differentiated as we have demonstrated with share gains for 3 successive quarters.

I think within that, then we have gained share in the market.

So things like QLC, where we are in the early innings of. So as I said, we don't think flash will be 100% of the storage market. We think it will be a substantial percentage.

Looking into '22, I think you'll see that continue. We are starting to see some of the demand pick up, especially in the second half of next year, especially around mobile and hyperscalers as well. As you all know, mobile is 30%, 40% of that business. So we expect in the second half of next year for that to kind of reverse itself. Also, keep in mind, DRAM prices are up quite a bit for us. It's not nearly the percentage of component cost, but that offsets a little bit. And for us, QLC, look, we're just getting started with that so there's not much of an impact, I'll call it, in the near term."

The first was, listen, we are certified for a broad range of workloads with Microsoft and Google, and they are -- we are pursuing additional workloads with them as customers deploy on our platforms. This could be software vendors that are deploying Software as a Service environments in the public clouds. This could be new types of applications, containerized applications, cloud-native applications. There are a whole new set of opportunities for NetApp.
And it is also certifications and deployments in parts of the world where we haven't deployed yet. So we completed the FedRAMP certification, which opens up the public sector market for our Azure NetApp Files. There's opportunity to do that with other cloud providers and other services. For example, our monitoring services in the portfolio. That's one set of things that we're going to keep doing. 
The other is expanding deployments. So we've covered -- with some of the cloud providers, we've covered the large markets. Now we are starting to pursue parts of the world, for example, in Asia Pacific or Latin America that we didn't cover before. And so this is the ongoing build-out.
I think with regard to the sets of customer types that we see, we are really excited at the progress that we've achieved this year. We are acquiring customers at an accelerating pace in our cloud business. And once they join NetApp's cloud portfolio, our dollar-based retention rate shows up really strongly. They really like our offerings, and they expand deployment substantially with us. They are across a broad range of verticals, more in the less regulated than in the regulated industries where we are still going through certifications. The second is they cover a broad range of customer types, whether they are digital natives that never bought from NetApp, enterprises that were primarily competitors, customers or customers that use NetApp.
As our all-flash array business and our cloud business have demonstrated for multiple quarters in a row, cloud is additive to our overall business. And there are customers who start with us in the cloud, who then come back and buy stuff in the data center. So very pleased with the progress. The work that we are doing with the cloud providers will continue to expand in scale and scope and which is why, again, I feel really good about our long-term opportunity and the ability to reach the $1 billion ARR target in fiscal year '25."

On the enterprise, I think what we saw was a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is stabilization of demand, normal linearity through the quarter, the sort of COVID strong segments, meaning the ones that were -- had business models that were less impacted by COVID like financial services or health care, continue to be strong demand sources for us, and we have really good offerings in that part of the market.
I think with regard to the outlook, again, I think as we said, many, many customers are starting to prioritize the new normal, what business looks like going forward. Digital transformation becomes a key part of any business's go-forward plans, and we are a big part of enabling a modern data foundation for digital transformation.

And this goes back to Katy's question because again, I just want to keep talking about this is, keep in mind that billings growth has been 6%, 10% and 6% in the first 3 quarters. Product growth over that time when you back out the 14th week as an average about 3%. So mix matters here a lot.

I think we -- the primary part of our business is in the data center. And I think as I mentioned earlier, we saw a good pickup in -- throughout the year, people have been prioritizing big transformational projects, which they cannot defer because they don't want to fall behind their competitors. We saw priorities in hybrid cloud and modernizing data center environments using flash technologies. Those are our key bets, and they've played out really well for us throughout the year. 
I think in Q3, we saw normal linearity. So you can see from our DSO and from our inventory turns that we did not have a back-end loaded quarter. It was pretty steady linearity throughout the quarter, and we feel good about that. That's a good sign heading into the rest of the calendar year for us. And so we feel -- we've done well. We've controlled what we can control really well. The macro environment is still uncertain, but it's getting better. And so we'll take those and we'll continue to execute."

In addition, when you look at the dollar-based net retention but obviously our existing customers, we're seeing great growth there as well. 
One of the nice things about the cloud business is, from a margin perspective, it's not going to vary that much in terms of new versus existing. Certainly, existing customers that have more than 1 product, you'll start to see some margin expansion there as well. But as we look across new versus existing, I don't think there's a material difference there. However, I think that will help expand those margins as we go forward. We've talked about our driver, Karl, in terms of driving gross margins in the cloud business, especially as they take on more than 1 product, more data services and more solutions, that will certainly help us scale that business at a higher margin."

I think we have every confidence that we have a multiyear game plan of achieving the $1 billion ARR number.

What I'll give you a sense of is, cloud is a gigantic market, and the growth of cloud over the next 5 years will be much bigger than the growth of cloud over the past 5 years. So if you think that there is constraints to overall TAM, I just think that even the $1 billion ARR will be a small part of the overall cloud market in that time frame. So we're not TAM-constrained. I think our position in the market is unique, and we are continuing to execute on product road map expansions and go-to-market investments, as Mike and I have talked about in prepared remarks.

I think with regard to what Spot brings to the table is they bring 2 assets to the table. One is that they are able to solve a large and growing customer problem, which is the problem of unused or unspent cloud dollars, and that is a topic that is near and dear to every CFO and CIO that I talk to, including Mike at NetApp. We're a customer of Spot, and they save us a substantial amount of money. 
We are able to use Spot not only to go after cloud-native digital native customers that never bought from NetApp as well as to now find ways into new parts of large enterprises that didn't know NetApp, and now get pleasantly surprised by the whole cloud portfolio.

Q3 was the strongest of the 3 quarters that we've had the program running, and it is a broad mix of customers. Given the mix of our business, they're mostly enterprise accounts. And we are winning new footprint, meaning new workloads displacing the larger legacy incumbents. So whether it's an HP or a Hitachi with their products, or whether it's Dell going through a transition of its midrange, we are winning against those players. 
The strength of NetApp is our software differentiation. The fact that we can simplify a customer's data center quite substantially with a single unified architecture and be able to give them a good road map to cloud in a way that nobody else can do. And the mid-range is the sweet spot, right? That's the place where it's the largest market segment and it is where we are most differentiated. So we feel really good. We've got to just keep executing. We've got the game plan in place. We're focused. We're driving good results. We just got to keep on it.

Before we get started, I want to take a minute to acknowledge that it's been over a year that we have all been working remotely. I'm encouraged by the public health and economic improvements in many parts of the world, but the recovery is uneven. As you know, we have a large team in India. Our thoughts are with them as they deal with a distressing surge in COVID cases. Thank you to the entire NetApp team for your dedication, focus and execution throughout this challenging year. 
Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter results, capping off a solid year of growth. Our results were all above our Q4 guidance ranges. I am most excited by the return of product revenue to growth, the strength of our public cloud ARR and an all-time high free cash flow. 
Our performance was broad-based as certain verticals, the U.S. and parts of Europe and Asia are recovering faster than many expected. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives have been accelerated by the pandemic and companies look to NetApp to support these key initiatives. 
Going into FY '21, we had 2 clear priorities: returning to growth in our storage business, powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software; and scaling our highly differentiated public cloud services business. As I reflect on the past year, I'm proud of what we've achieved during a globally challenging period. We remain focused in executing our strategy and extending our innovation. 
In Q4, product revenue grew 6%, and our all-flash array business grew 11% year-over-year. Based on our growth, I am confident that we have gained share in the storage and all-flash markets. We advanced our hybrid cloud portfolio with the introduction of ONTAP 9.9 and Astra. This innovation will support continued product revenue growth and share gains through fiscal year '22. 
Additionally, we continue to make good progress with Keystone with many new wins, including our largest ever Keystone deal. We are reaching more customers than ever before with our public cloud business. Over the course of fiscal year '21, we added approximately 1,500 new to NetApp customers with public cloud services and grew our total cloud customer count by 137% from Q4 fiscal year '20. In addition to adding new cloud customers, existing cloud customers are expanding their spend with us. 
Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate increased to 252% in the fourth quarter. Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot all performed well in the quarter, driving our public cloud services ARR to $301 million exiting fiscal year '21, an increase of 171% year-over-year. 
As we have said repeatedly, our cloud strategy strongly advantages NetApp. I'll use a customer example to illustrate how cloud helps us to acquire new customers and drive growth in our on-premises solutions. As a part of its digital transformation strategy, a leading car manufacturer decided to migrate workloads from its on-premises data centers to the Azure cloud. Despite never having used NetApp previously, the customer chose NetApp Cloud Volumes to host its file-based data and NetApp Cloud Sync to rapidly move data from its Dell EMC systems to the cloud. In addition to delivering a high-performance data store in the cloud, cloud volumes provides out-of-the-box cross-region replication of production data to a secondary cloud environment, high availability to meet the service level requirements of critical applications and cost savings through automatic tiering to Azure Blob Storage. Because of the breadth and depth of the value NetApp delivered, the customer is now looking to deploy a hybrid cloud environment and plans to use NetApp on-premises as well as increases NetApp usage in the public cloud. 
As I noted earlier, the pandemic accelerated and elevated the importance of customers cloud and digital transformation initiatives. We expect that this trend will be ongoing and that NetApp will continue to benefit from it. Customers appreciate the value we bring as a cloud-led, data-centric software company to simplify and modernize existing data centers to quickly and confidently deploy applications and to securely manage data on the public cloud. 
We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise data management technology. Our cloud solutions drive further differentiation expand our addressable market and enable us to reach new customers. We began our cloud journey 7 years ago with the introduction of Cloud ONTAP, now Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Our initial focus was to leverage the cloud to deliver backup and disaster recovery services to our installed base. 
We saw that enterprises wanted to move workloads to the cloud. To address that need, we began working with the leading cloud providers to deliver cloud volume service, a fully managed service with the application certifications required to support mission-critical production workloads in the cloud. We then recognize the opportunity to expand beyond storage management and optimization to infrastructure monitoring and compute management and optimization services, which led to the development of Cloud Insights and the acquisition of Spot. These services, Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot, are now the primary growth engines of our public cloud services business. They are well established for enterprise applications, and we are taking each of them into the cloud-native world, further expanding our market opportunity. NetApp Astra offers application-aware data management that protects, moves and manages data-rich Kubernetes workloads. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability while minimizing costs. 
Cloud Insights for Kubernetes provides simplified infrastructure monitoring to quickly identify performance issues and resource constraints. Together, our public cloud services give our customers and especially their cloud ops and DevOps teams, a robust suite of multi-cloud infrastructure management services. We plan to press our advantage here by focusing our efforts on enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovations. We intend to leverage our deep infrastructure expertise and our credibility with the cloud providers to expand our multi-cloud infrastructure management services. 
My confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year '25 is further enhanced by the strength and uniqueness of our cloud services position. Our focused execution last year has set us up well for fiscal year '22. We have returned to growth, we're gaining share in key storage markets and our public cloud services are at a scale where they are positively impacting total company billings and revenue growth. Our momentum underscores our value to customers in a hybrid multi-cloud world. 
In fiscal year '22, we plan to accelerate our public cloud services and continue to grow our hybrid cloud business. I am excited about the year ahead and confident in our ability to deliver top line growth by supporting our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. 
Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through our financial results, I want to take a moment to thank Brad Anderson who let us know that he intends to retire at the end of fiscal year '22. Brad has been instrumental in leading the maturation of our hybrid cloud group. And we will continue to leverage his leadership and expertise this year. We are actively engaged in identifying a successor to ensure a smooth transition. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on what was an unprecedented year I cannot help but be incredibly proud of the focus, execution and commitment of the entire NetApp team. 
We delivered billings of $5.9 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year while revenue of $5.7 billion grew 6%. We delivered free cash flow of $1.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year while continuing to aggressively invest in our public cloud franchise. We finished the year strong with Q4 billings of $1.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. While revenue of $1.6 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Both were solidly ahead of our expectations, driven by accelerating enterprise demand throughout the quarter. 
Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high end of guidance. Q4 free cash flow of $521 million was an all-time high for NetApp. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR of $301 million was up 171% year-over-year and an impressive 27% sequentially. 
In fiscal '21, the scale of our cloud franchise really started to impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 9 points in billings growth and 3 of the 6 points in revenue growth. In addition to the strong cloud ARR performance, we are excited that we exited the year with cloud gross margins near our overall corporate average. 
Given the growing impact on our total company performance, we anticipate sharing more detail on our public cloud business in fiscal '22. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 18% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. 
For the first time in company history, we ended Q4 with over $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. 
Product revenue returned to growth in Q4. Importantly, we expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $840 million increased 6% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we have seen throughout fiscal '21, software product revenue of $480 million increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. 
Recurring support and cloud revenue of $641 million was also at all-time company high and was up 17% year-over-year, constituting 41% of total revenue. Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 54.3% and benefited from the higher all-flash system mix. Our recurring support, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us with gross margin of 82%. 
Operating margin of 23% was nicely ahead of our expectations, while EPS of $1.17 came in above the high end of guidance, despite a $0.05 headwind from a higher-than-forecasted tax rate. Cash flow from operations was $559 million and free cash flow was $521 million, representing 34% of revenue. Cash flow came in higher than expected in part due to strong collections as evidenced by the DSO metric of 55 days. 
Full year fiscal '21 free cash flow of $1.2 billion was up 25% year-over-year and represented 20%. We closed Q4 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Given recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, I want to reiterate our confidence in our ability to meet end demand as we head into Q1. We have an excellent supply chain team, and they have been working closely with our partner ecosystem to ensure backlog and customer lead times remain at normal levels throughout fiscal '22. Towards this goal, we will be investing incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate risk of supply shortages. Given our strong balance sheet and low cost of capital, we feel good about this investment. 
Now to guidance. In fiscal '22, we expect revenues to grow 6% to 7% year-over-year with billings expected to outpace revenue given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and cloud services. 
In fiscal '22, we expect continued momentum and share gains in our cloud-connected, all-flash portfolio. We will also continue to grow and invest in our diversified public cloud services portfolio. We are raising the low end of our fiscal '22 guide and now expect to exit fiscal '22 with public cloud ARR of $425 million to $500 million driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. 
Similar to the seasonal pattern we experienced in fiscal '21, we anticipate Q2 and Q4 to be our strongest quarters for net new public cloud ARR. This seasonal cadence is driven mainly by our semiannual sales compensation plans. As George noted, we have increased confidence in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal '25. 
In fiscal '22, we expect gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year at 67% to 68% as improving cloud margins are balanced with strong demand for our hybrid cloud products. We anticipate operating margin to range between 21% and 22% as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives while delivering strong operating leverage. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be between $2.75 billion and $2.8 billion. 
The year-over-year increase in our expense base is being driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our cloud portfolio, targeted investments in sales resources and continued investment in our customer success sales team. 
Moving down the P&L. We expect interest expense to be $65 million to $70 million and our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. While we get a bit of delevering below the operating income line, as a result of the higher interest expense and tax rate, we are committed to delivering $4.45 to $4.65 in fiscal '22 EPS, representing 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect to again generate over $1.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our cloud services franchise. 
Factored into the year-over-year free cash flow generation is a step-up in CapEx to $225 million to $235 million. Our public cloud partners, in particular Azure, are driving us hard to build out additional global capacity for our cloud offerings. Even with this add-in investment, we expect cloud gross margins to become accretive to our corporate average as we move through fiscal '22. 
Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation commitments while also investing in our key strategic areas. The dividend will remain the first call on capital. As you saw today, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. Share repurchases will also continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. Towards this goal, our Board approved an additional $500 million in buyback authorization. 
In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, We expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal '22. Consistent with NetApp's long history of disciplined M&A, the remaining 30% of free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic cloud services road map. 
Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.37 billion and $1.47 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase in revenues year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to range between 19% and 20%. 
Assumed in this guidance, our Q1 operating expenses of $680 million to $690 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.89 and $0.97 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million. 
In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their unwavering support this past year and most importantly, a huge shout out to the entire NetApp employee base for redefining what it means to work as a team during what was a challenging year in so many ways. We are more confident than ever in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Chris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

We saw customers spending against their digital transformation and their cloud programs throughout the quarter. So it was a smooth trajectory through the quarter. And I think that sets us up well for next year. 
I think if you look at our dollar-based net retention rate, you can see that our organic business grew strongly this year, and we had about $60 million of this year being inorganic from acquisitions of Spot, Talon and CloudJumper. So when you back that out, We expect next year's growth rate to also continue the acceleration of our organic portfolio and continued strength of our inorganic portfolio.

With regard to what's it going to take to further accelerate the course of the business, it's all the things that we're doing, right? We're expanding the number of sellers and revenue-generating teams facing customers. We've seen really good success with Microsoft in terms of their route to market. We're working with the other hyperscalers to also train and expand the range of ways we take our products to market with them. And we're building our customer service and customer success teams.

And we continue to do a lot of hard work on the services margin. As we talked about, cloud margins should continue to improve as we go through the year as well as you'll see the benefits of the consumption of the deployed system and more increase in our Software as a Service.

Next year, for instance, in fiscal '22, we would expect to see how the cash flow growth be a little bit lower than earnings just because of the working capital impact of some of the expenses in '21, and we put that in the script. 
From a free cash flow perspective, we really look at next year CapEx as hopefully the high watermark. A couple of pieces there. One is the -- we are certainly continuing to install hardware and some of the data centers to support the cloud business. As George talked about, we're super excited about some of the software options there as well. And as we have more software defined, that will help. Also next year in that number, there's about $50 million in CapEx related to 2 facilities projects, related to our Wichita site and to a lesser extent, our new building in San Jose. 
We obviously have a little bit of facilities CapEx, but that's a big number next year. That's why we feel comfortable, going forward, that we can have CapEx below the $200 million that I discussed in the script. So I just want to walk you through those puts and takes.

I think what you see from this coming year from our guidance to the coming year is that revenue outpaces the growth in operating expense, leading to additional leverage in our business model. That reflects our disciplined approach to investing where we see the opportunities."

So we're doing everything that we can to make sure that we have enough inventory. I would expect, in Q1, you should see those turns probably go back to the 12% to 14% number. And again, given the all cost of capital, our goal to make sure that we always have product and we could be customer requirements, we think that's a very good investment. So thanks for the question. Yes, you should see those inventories increase. And the inventory turns go down in Q1 and likely through the rest of fiscal '22."

And that trade-off between investing to continue to expand the business with the growth in ARR the balance we walk. I think as I also mentioned, we have several other avenues to continue to drive gross margins in cloud. The software mix in the portfolio is growing with solutions like Spot and Cloud Insights and some versions of our cloud volumes products being software-only. 
The second is we continue to drive efficiency in the software, in ONTAP operating system software. So there are lots of avenues to continue to accelerate cloud gross margins.

Before we get started, I want to take a minute to acknowledge that it's been over a year that we have all been working remotely. I'm encouraged by the public health and economic improvements in many parts of the world, but the recovery is uneven. As you know, we have a large team in India. Our thoughts are with them as they deal with a distressing surge in COVID cases.  Thank you to the entire NetApp team for your dedication, focus and execution throughout this challenging year.  
Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter results, capping off a solid year of growth. Our results were all above our Q4 guidance ranges. I am most excited by the return of product revenue to growth, the strength of our public cloud ARR and an all-time high free cash flow.  
Our performance was broad-based as certain verticals, the U.S. and parts of Europe and Asia are recovering faster than many expected. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives have been accelerated by the pandemic and companies look to NetApp to support these key initiatives.  
Going into FY '21, we had 2 clear priorities: returning to growth in our storage business, powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software; and scaling our highly differentiated public cloud services business. As I reflect on the past year, I'm proud of what we've achieved during a globally challenging period. We remain focused in executing our strategy and extending our innovation.  
In Q4, product revenue grew 6%, and our all-flash array business grew 11% year-over-year. Based on our growth, I am confident that we have gained share in the storage and all-flash markets. We advanced our hybrid cloud portfolio with the introduction of ONTAP 9.9 and Astra. This innovation will support continued product revenue growth and share gains through fiscal year '22.
Additionally, we continue to make good progress with Keystone with many new wins, including our largest ever Keystone deal. We are reaching more customers than ever before with our public cloud business. Over the course of fiscal year '21, we added approximately 1,500 new to NetApp customers with public cloud services and grew our total cloud customer count by 137% from Q4 fiscal year '20. In addition to adding new cloud customers, existing cloud customers are expanding their spend with us.  
Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate increased to 252% in the fourth quarter. Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot all performed well in the quarter, driving our public cloud services' ARR to $301 million exiting fiscal year '21, an increase of 171% year-over-year.  
As we have said repeatedly, our cloud strategy strongly advantages NetApp. I'll use a customer example to illustrate how cloud helps us to acquire new customers and drive growth in our on-premises solutions. As a part of its digital transformation strategy, a leading car manufacturer decided to migrate workloads from its on-premises data centers to the Azure cloud. Despite never having used NetApp previously, the customer chose NetApp Cloud Volumes to host its file-based data and NetApp Cloud Sync to rapidly move data from its Dell EMC systems to the cloud. 
In addition to delivering a high-performance data store in the cloud, Cloud Volumes provides out-of-the-box cross-region replication of production data to a secondary cloud environment, high availability to meet the service level requirements of critical applications and cost savings through automatic tiering to Azure Blob Storage. Because of the breadth and depth of the value NetApp delivered, the customer is now looking to deploy a hybrid cloud environment and plans to use NetApp on premises as well as increases NetApp usage in the public cloud.  
As I noted earlier, the pandemic accelerated and elevated the importance of customers cloud and digital transformation initiatives. We expect that this trend will be ongoing and that NetApp will continue to benefit from it. Customers appreciate the value we bring as a cloud-led, data-centric software company to simplify and modernize existing data centers to quickly and confidently deploy applications and to securely manage data on the public cloud.  
We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise data management technology. Our cloud solutions drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach new customers. We began our cloud journey 7 years ago with the introduction of Cloud ONTAP, now Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Our initial focus was to leverage the cloud to deliver backup and disaster recovery services to our installed base.  
We saw that enterprises wanted to move workloads to the cloud. To address that need, we began working with the leading cloud providers to deliver Cloud Volumes service, a fully managed service with the application certifications required to support mission-critical production workloads in the cloud. We then recognize the opportunity to expand beyond storage management and optimization to infrastructure monitoring and compute management and optimization services, which led to the development of Cloud Insights and the acquisition of Spot. These services, Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot, are now the primary growth engines of our public cloud services business. They are well established for enterprise applications, and we are taking each of them into the cloud-native world, further expanding our market opportunity. 
NetApp Astra offers application-aware data management that protects, moves and manages data-rich Kubernetes workloads. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability while minimizing costs.  
Cloud Insights for Kubernetes provides simplified infrastructure monitoring to quickly identify performance issues and resource constraints. Together, our public cloud services give our customers and especially their cloud ops and DevOps teams, a robust suite of multi-cloud infrastructure management services. We plan to press our advantage here by focusing our efforts on enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovations. We intend to leverage our deep infrastructure expertise and our credibility with the cloud providers to expand our multi-cloud infrastructure management services.
My confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year '25 is further enhanced by the strength and uniqueness of our cloud services position. Our focused execution last year has set us up well for fiscal year '22. We have returned to growth, we're gaining share in key storage markets and our public cloud services are at a scale where they are positively impacting total company billings and revenue growth. Our momentum underscores our value to customers in a hybrid multi-cloud world.  
In fiscal year '22, we plan to accelerate our public cloud services and continue to grow our hybrid cloud business. I am excited about the year ahead and confident in our ability to deliver top line growth by supporting our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys.  
Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through our financial results, I want to take a moment to thank Brad Anderson who let us know that he intends to retire at the end of fiscal year '22. Brad has been instrumental in leading the maturation of our hybrid cloud group, and we will continue to leverage his leadership and expertise this year. We are actively engaged in identifying a successor to ensure a smooth transition.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on what was an unprecedented year, I cannot help but be incredibly proud of the focus, execution and commitment of the entire NetApp team.  
We delivered billings of $5.9 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year while revenue of $5.7 billion grew 6%. We delivered free cash flow of $1.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year while continuing to aggressively invest in our public cloud franchise. We finished the year strong with Q4 billings of $1.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. While revenue of $1.6 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Both were solidly ahead of our expectations, driven by accelerating enterprise demand throughout the quarter.  
Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high end of guidance. Q4 free cash flow of $521 million was an all-time high for NetApp. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR of $301 million was up 171% year-over-year and an impressive 27% sequentially.
In fiscal '21, the scale of our cloud franchise really started to impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 9 points in billings growth and 3 of the 6 points in revenue growth. In addition to the strong cloud ARR performance, we are excited that we exited the year with cloud gross margins near our overall corporate average.  
Given the growing impact on our total company performance, we anticipate sharing more detail on our public cloud business in fiscal '22. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 18% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue.  
For the first time in company history, we ended Q4 with over $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth.  
Product revenue returned to growth in Q4. Importantly, we expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $840 million increased 6% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we have seen throughout fiscal '21, software product revenue of $480 million increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio.  
Recurring support and cloud revenue of $641 million was also at all-time company high and was up 17% year-over-year, constituting 41% of total revenue. Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 54.3% and benefited from the higher all-flash system mix. Our recurring support, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us with gross margin of 82%. 
Operating margin of 23% was nicely ahead of our expectations, while EPS of $1.17 came in above the high end of guidance, despite a $0.05 headwind from a higher-than-forecasted tax rate. Cash flow from operations was $559 million and free cash flow was $521 million, representing 34% of revenue. Cash flow came in higher than expected in part due to strong collections as evidenced by the DSO metric of 55 days.  
Full year fiscal '21 free cash flow of $1.2 billion was up 25% year-over-year and represented 20% of revenue. We closed Q4 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Given recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, I want to reiterate our confidence in our ability to meet end demand as we head into Q1. We have an excellent supply chain team, and they have been working closely with our partner ecosystem to ensure backlog and customer lead times remain at normal levels throughout fiscal '22. Towards this goal, we will be investing incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate risk of supply shortages. Given our strong balance sheet and low cost of capital, we feel good about this investment.  
Now to guidance. In fiscal '22, we expect revenues to grow 6% to 7% year-over-year with billings expected to outpace revenue given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and cloud services.  In fiscal '22, we expect continued momentum and share gains in our cloud-connected all-flash portfolio. We will also continue to grow and invest in our diversified public cloud services portfolio. We are raising the low end of our fiscal '22 guide and now expect to exit fiscal '22 with public cloud ARR of $425 million to $500 million driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and continued product innovation.  
Similar to the seasonal pattern we experienced in fiscal '21, we anticipate Q2 and Q4 to be our strongest quarters for net new public cloud ARR. This seasonal cadence is driven mainly by our semiannual sales compensation plans. As George noted, we have increased confidence in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal '25.  
In fiscal '22, we expect gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year at 67% to 68% as improving cloud margins are balanced with strong demand for our hybrid cloud products. We anticipate operating margin to range between 21% and 22% as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives while delivering strong operating leverage. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be between $2.75 billion and $2.8 billion.  
The year-over-year increase in our expense base is being driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our cloud portfolio, targeted investments in sales resources and continued investment in our customer success sales team. 
Moving down the P&L. We expect interest expense to be $65 million to $70 million and our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. While we get a bit of delevering below the operating income line, as a result of the higher interest expense and tax rate, we are committed to delivering $4.45 to $4.65 in fiscal '22 EPS, representing 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect to again generate over $1.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our cloud services franchise. 
Factored into the year-over-year free cash flow generation is a step-up in CapEx to $225 million to $235 million. Our public cloud partners, in particular Azure, are driving us hard to build out additional global capacity for our cloud offerings. Even with this added investment, we expect cloud gross margins to become accretive to our corporate average as we move through fiscal '22.  
Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation commitments while also investing in our key strategic areas. The dividend will remain the first call on capital. As you saw today, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. Share repurchases will also continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. Towards this goal, our Board approved an additional $500 million in buyback authorization.  
In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal '22. Consistent with NetApp's long history of disciplined M&A, the remaining 30% of free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic cloud services roadmap.  
Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.37 billion and $1.47 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase in revenues year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to range between 19% and 20%.  
Assumed in this guidance are Q1 operating expenses of $680 million to $690 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.89 and $0.97 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million.  
In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their unwavering support this past year and most importantly, a huge shout out to the entire NetApp employee base for redefining what it means to work as a team during what was a challenging year in so many ways. We are more confident than ever in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

We have been working on multiple innovation parts of our portfolio, all of which performed extremely strongly. Cloud Volumes for storage, Cloud Insights for monitoring, Spot for compute management, all had really strong Q4s and overall, really strong years.  
We saw good expansion in the number of customers and strong growth in the number of new to NetApp customers. We saw customers spending against their digital transformation and their cloud programs throughout the quarter. So it was a smooth trajectory through the quarter. And I think that sets us up well for next year. 
I think if you look at our dollar-based net retention rate, you can see that our organic business grew strongly this year, and we had about $60 million of this year being inorganic from acquisitions of Spot, Talon and CloudJumper. So when you back that out, We expect next year's growth rate to also continue the acceleration of our organic portfolio and continued strength of our inorganic portfolio. 
We have a really good and differentiated portfolio of services. We have deep partnerships and are expanding the range of things we do with the hyperscalers. And we are growing our customer base of people who are doing many business-critical projects on the public clouds with us. So I'm really excited with every confidence.

We are making investments, as we indicated last quarter, to accelerate and expand the range of things we're doing in the cloud portfolio.  
With regard to what's it going to take to further accelerate the course of the business, it's all the things that we're doing, right? We're expanding the number of sellers and revenue-generating teams facing customers. We've seen really good success with Microsoft in terms of their route to market. We're working with the other hyperscalers to also train and expand the range of ways we take our products to market with them. And we're building our customer service and customer success teams. I feel even more confident that we have the range of capabilities to achieve the $1 billion target in ARR that we indicated.

Now there's -- it's going to bump around a little bit, and I'm going to do operating and then I'll take you to free cash flow. Next year, for instance, in fiscal '22, we would expect to see operating cash flow growth be a little bit lower than earnings just because of the working capital impact of some of the expenses in '21, and we put that in the script. 
From a free cash flow perspective, we really look at next year CapEx as hopefully the high watermark. A couple of pieces there. One is the -- we are certainly continuing to install hardware and some of the data centers to support the cloud business. As George talked about, we're super excited about some of the software options there as well. And as we have more software defined, that will help. Also next year in that number, there's about $50 million in CapEx related to 2 facilities projects, related to our Wichita site and to a lesser extent, our new building in San Jose. 
We obviously have a little bit of facilities CapEx, but that's a big number next year. That's why we feel comfortable, going forward, that we can have CapEx below the $200 million that I discussed in the script. So I just want to walk you through those puts and takes. But over time, yes, I do expect operating cash flow to pretty much near operating income with some bumping around every year largely due to working capital."

And that trade-off between investing to continue to expand the business with the growth in ARR is the balance we walk. I think as I also mentioned, we have several other avenues to continue to drive gross margins in cloud. The software mix in the portfolio is growing with solutions like Spot and Cloud Insights and some versions of our Cloud Volumes products being software-only. 
The second is we continue to drive efficiency in the software, in ONTAP operating system software. So there are lots of avenues to continue to accelerate cloud gross margins.

In fiscal year '22, we expect to grow the top line, deliver operating leverage and generate significant free cash flow, all while investing in growth initiatives. I am excited by and confident in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and the market opportunities ahead. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Before we get started, I want to take a minute to acknowledge that it's been over a year that we have all been working remotely. I'm encouraged by the public health and economic improvements in many parts of the world, but the recovery is uneven. As you know, we have a large team in India. Our thoughts are with them as they deal with a distressing surge in COVID cases.  Thank you to the entire NetApp team for your dedication, focus and execution throughout this challenging year.  
Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter results, capping off a solid year of growth. Our results were all above our Q4 guidance ranges. I am most excited by the return of product revenue to growth, the strength of our public cloud ARR and an all-time high free cash flow.  
Our performance was broad-based as certain verticals, the U.S. and parts of Europe and Asia are recovering faster than many expected. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives have been accelerated by the pandemic and companies look to NetApp to support these key initiatives.  
Going into FY '21, we had 2 clear priorities: returning to growth in our storage business, powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software; and scaling our highly differentiated public cloud services business. As I reflect on the past year, I'm proud of what we've achieved during a globally challenging period. We remain focused in executing our strategy and extending our innovation.  
In Q4, product revenue grew 6%, and our all-flash array business grew 11% year-over-year. Based on our growth, I am confident that we have gained share in the storage and all-flash markets. We advanced our hybrid cloud portfolio with the introduction of ONTAP 9.9 and Astra. This innovation will support continued product revenue growth and share gains through fiscal year '22.
Additionally, we continue to make good progress with Keystone with many new wins, including our largest ever Keystone deal. We are reaching more customers than ever before with our public cloud business. Over the course of fiscal year '21, we added approximately 1,500 new to NetApp customers with public cloud services and grew our total cloud customer count by 137% from Q4 fiscal year '20. In addition to adding new cloud customers, existing cloud customers are expanding their spend with us.  
Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate increased to 252% in the fourth quarter. Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot all performed well in the quarter, driving our public cloud services' ARR to $301 million exiting fiscal year '21, an increase of 171% year-over-year.  
As we have said repeatedly, our cloud strategy strongly advantages NetApp. I'll use a customer example to illustrate how cloud helps us to acquire new customers and drive growth in our on-premises solutions. As a part of its digital transformation strategy, a leading car manufacturer decided to migrate workloads from its on-premises data centers to the Azure cloud. Despite never having used NetApp previously, the customer chose NetApp Cloud Volumes to host its file-based data and NetApp Cloud Sync to rapidly move data from its Dell EMC systems to the cloud. 
In addition to delivering a high-performance data store in the cloud, Cloud Volumes provides out-of-the-box cross-region replication of production data to a secondary cloud environment, high availability to meet the service level requirements of critical applications and cost savings through automatic tiering to Azure Blob Storage. Because of the breadth and depth of the value NetApp delivered, the customer is now looking to deploy a hybrid cloud environment and plans to use NetApp on premises as well as increases NetApp usage in the public cloud.  
As I noted earlier, the pandemic accelerated and elevated the importance of customers cloud and digital transformation initiatives. We expect that this trend will be ongoing and that NetApp will continue to benefit from it. Customers appreciate the value we bring as a cloud-led, data-centric software company to simplify and modernize existing data centers to quickly and confidently deploy applications and to securely manage data on the public cloud.  
We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise data management technology. Our cloud solutions drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach new customers. We began our cloud journey 7 years ago with the introduction of Cloud ONTAP, now Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Our initial focus was to leverage the cloud to deliver backup and disaster recovery services to our installed base.  
We saw that enterprises wanted to move workloads to the cloud. To address that need, we began working with the leading cloud providers to deliver Cloud Volumes service, a fully managed service with the application certifications required to support mission-critical production workloads in the cloud. We then recognize the opportunity to expand beyond storage management and optimization to infrastructure monitoring and compute management and optimization services, which led to the development of Cloud Insights and the acquisition of Spot. These services, Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot, are now the primary growth engines of our public cloud services business. They are well established for enterprise applications, and we are taking each of them into the cloud-native world, further expanding our market opportunity. 
NetApp Astra offers application-aware data management that protects, moves and manages data-rich Kubernetes workloads. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability while minimizing costs.  
Cloud Insights for Kubernetes provides simplified infrastructure monitoring to quickly identify performance issues and resource constraints. Together, our public cloud services give our customers and especially their cloud ops and DevOps teams, a robust suite of multi-cloud infrastructure management services. We plan to press our advantage here by focusing our efforts on enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovations. We intend to leverage our deep infrastructure expertise and our credibility with the cloud providers to expand our multi-cloud infrastructure management services.
My confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year '25 is further enhanced by the strength and uniqueness of our cloud services position. Our focused execution last year has set us up well for fiscal year '22. We have returned to growth, we're gaining share in key storage markets and our public cloud services are at a scale where they are positively impacting total company billings and revenue growth. Our momentum underscores our value to customers in a hybrid multi-cloud world.  
In fiscal year '22, we plan to accelerate our public cloud services and continue to grow our hybrid cloud business. I am excited about the year ahead and confident in our ability to deliver top line growth by supporting our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys.  
Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through our financial results, I want to take a moment to thank Brad Anderson who let us know that he intends to retire at the end of fiscal year '22. Brad has been instrumental in leading the maturation of our hybrid cloud group, and we will continue to leverage his leadership and expertise this year. We are actively engaged in identifying a successor to ensure a smooth transition.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted.

As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on what was an unprecedented year, I cannot help but be incredibly proud of the focus, execution and commitment of the entire NetApp team.  
We delivered billings of $5.9 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year while revenue of $5.7 billion grew 6%. We delivered free cash flow of $1.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year while continuing to aggressively invest in our public cloud franchise. We finished the year strong with Q4 billings of $1.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. While revenue of $1.6 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Both were solidly ahead of our expectations, driven by accelerating enterprise demand throughout the quarter.  
Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high end of guidance. Q4 free cash flow of $521 million was an all-time high for NetApp. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR of $301 million was up 171% year-over-year and an impressive 27% sequentially.
In fiscal '21, the scale of our cloud franchise really started to impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 9 points in billings growth and 3 of the 6 points in revenue growth. In addition to the strong cloud ARR performance, we are excited that we exited the year with cloud gross margins near our overall corporate average.  
Given the growing impact on our total company performance, we anticipate sharing more detail on our public cloud business in fiscal '22. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 18% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue.  
For the first time in company history, we ended Q4 with over $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth.  
Product revenue returned to growth in Q4. Importantly, we expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $840 million increased 6% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we have seen throughout fiscal '21, software product revenue of $480 million increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio.  
Recurring support and cloud revenue of $641 million was also at all-time company high and was up 17% year-over-year, constituting 41% of total revenue. Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 54.3% and benefited from the higher all-flash system mix. Our recurring support, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us with gross margin of 82%. 
Operating margin of 23% was nicely ahead of our expectations, while EPS of $1.17 came in above the high end of guidance, despite a $0.05 headwind from a higher-than-forecasted tax rate. Cash flow from operations was $559 million and free cash flow was $521 million, representing 34% of revenue. Cash flow came in higher than expected in part due to strong collections as evidenced by the DSO metric of 55 days.  
Full year fiscal '21 free cash flow of $1.2 billion was up 25% year-over-year and represented 20% of revenue. We closed Q4 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Given recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, I want to reiterate our confidence in our ability to meet end demand as we head into Q1. We have an excellent supply chain team, and they have been working closely with our partner ecosystem to ensure backlog and customer lead times remain at normal levels throughout fiscal '22. Towards this goal, we will be investing incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate risk of supply shortages. Given our strong balance sheet and low cost of capital, we feel good about this investment.  
Now to guidance. In fiscal '22, we expect revenues to grow 6% to 7% year-over-year with billings expected to outpace revenue given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and cloud services.  In fiscal '22, we expect continued momentum and share gains in our cloud-connected all-flash portfolio. We will also continue to grow and invest in our diversified public cloud services portfolio. We are raising the low end of our fiscal '22 guide and now expect to exit fiscal '22 with public cloud ARR of $425 million to $500 million driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and continued product innovation.  
Similar to the seasonal pattern we experienced in fiscal '21, we anticipate Q2 and Q4 to be our strongest quarters for net new public cloud ARR. This seasonal cadence is driven mainly by our semiannual sales compensation plans. As George noted, we have increased confidence in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal '25.  
In fiscal '22, we expect gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year at 67% to 68% as improving cloud margins are balanced with strong demand for our hybrid cloud products. We anticipate operating margin to range between 21% and 22% as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives while delivering strong operating leverage. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be between $2.75 billion and $2.8 billion.  
The year-over-year increase in our expense base is being driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our cloud portfolio, targeted investments in sales resources and continued investment in our customer success sales team. 
Moving down the P&L. We expect interest expense to be $65 million to $70 million and our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. While we get a bit of delevering below the operating income line, as a result of the higher interest expense and tax rate, we are committed to delivering $4.45 to $4.65 in fiscal '22 EPS, representing 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect to again generate over $1.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our cloud services franchise. 
Factored into the year-over-year free cash flow generation is a step-up in CapEx to $225 million to $235 million. Our public cloud partners, in particular Azure, are driving us hard to build out additional global capacity for our cloud offerings. Even with this added investment, we expect cloud gross margins to become accretive to our corporate average as we move through fiscal '22.  
Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation commitments while also investing in our key strategic areas. The dividend will remain the first call on capital. As you saw today, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. Share repurchases will also continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. Towards this goal, our Board approved an additional $500 million in buyback authorization.  
In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal '22. Consistent with NetApp's long history of disciplined M&A, the remaining 30% of free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic cloud services roadmap.  
Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.37 billion and $1.47 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase in revenues year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to range between 19% and 20%.  
Assumed in this guidance are Q1 operating expenses of $680 million to $690 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.89 and $0.97 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million.  
In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their unwavering support this past year and most importantly, a huge shout out to the entire NetApp employee base for redefining what it means to work as a team during what was a challenging year in so many ways. We are more confident than ever in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

We saw good expansion in the number of customers and strong growth in the number of new to NetApp customers. We saw customers spending against their digital transformation and their cloud programs throughout the quarter. So it was a smooth trajectory through the quarter. And I think that sets us up well for next year. 
I think if you look at our dollar-based net retention rate, you can see that our organic business grew strongly this year, and we had about $60 million of this year being inorganic from acquisitions of Spot, Talon and CloudJumper. So when you back that out, We expect next year's growth rate to also continue the acceleration of our organic portfolio and continued strength of our inorganic portfolio. 
We have a really good and differentiated portfolio of services. We have deep partnerships and are expanding the range of things we do with the hyperscalers. And we are growing our customer base of people who are doing many business-critical projects on the public clouds with us. So I'm really excited with every confidence.

We are making investments, as we indicated last quarter, to accelerate and expand the range of things we're doing in the cloud portfolio.  
With regard to what's it going to take to further accelerate the course of the business, it's all the things that we're doing, right? We're expanding the number of sellers and revenue-generating teams facing customers. We've seen really good success with Microsoft in terms of their route to market. We're working with the other hyperscalers to also train and expand the range of ways we take our products to market with them. And we're building our customer service and customer success teams. I feel even more confident that we have the range of capabilities to achieve the $1 billion target in ARR that we indicated.

We see more countries, especially the U.S. and parts of Western Europe come online in a more significant way through the course of our fiscal year. The U.S. more likely in the first part of the fiscal year. Europe coming online more strongly in the second half of our fiscal year.  
We have every confidence that our product portfolio is differentiated and we'll continue to see product revenue grow faster than services revenue and the strength of our cloud portfolio.

Next year, for instance, in fiscal '22, we would expect to see operating cash flow growth be a little bit lower than earnings just because of the working capital impact of some of the expenses in '21, and we put that in the script. 
From a free cash flow perspective, we really look at next year CapEx as hopefully the high watermark. A couple of pieces there. One is the -- we are certainly continuing to install hardware and some of the data centers to support the cloud business. As George talked about, we're super excited about some of the software options there as well. And as we have more software defined, that will help. Also next year in that number, there's about $50 million in CapEx related to 2 facilities projects, related to our Wichita site and to a lesser extent, our new building in San Jose. 
We obviously have a little bit of facilities CapEx, but that's a big number next year.

I would expect, in Q1, you should see those turns probably go back to the 12 to 14 number. And again, given the all cost of capital, our goal to make sure that we always have product and we could meet customer requirements, we think that's a very good investment. So thanks for the question. Yes, you should see those inventories increase. And the inventory turns go down in Q1 and likely through the rest of fiscal '22."

I think that with regard to cloud gross margins, it's really reflecting the balance of certain regions getting more heavily utilized and seeing customer consumption of the installed footprint while we make investments in other regions to continue to expand our business. 
And that trade-off between investing to continue to expand the business with the growth in ARR is the balance we walk. I think as I also mentioned, we have several other avenues to continue to drive gross margins in cloud. The software mix in the portfolio is growing with solutions like Spot and Cloud Insights and some versions of our Cloud Volumes products being software-only. 
The second is we continue to drive efficiency in the software, in ONTAP operating system software. So there are lots of avenues to continue to accelerate cloud gross margins. Team has done a good job this year, and we expect it to be accretive to company gross margins as we go through next fiscal year."

Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining our Q1 fiscal year '22 earnings call. Building on our accelerating momentum through fiscal year '21, we delivered a strong start to fiscal year '22 with results at the high end or above our guidance for Q1. Broad-based strength drove 12% revenue growth and 16% product revenue growth year-over-year. Public cloud revenue grew triple digits again this quarter, up 155% from Q1 a year ago. Our results reflect solid customer demand and strong execution by our team in the quarter. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives remain top customer priorities, and we continue to benefit from these sizable long-term trends. 
Customers need to simplify and modernize existing data centers and deploy traditional applications quickly and confidently. At the same time, customers are also accelerating their use of cloud, adopting modern application architectures like Kubernetes and microservices for new workloads, and deploying data-rich applications like machine and deep learning. 
With our Data Fabric strategy, we are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments. As I've said many times, our public cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our hybrid cloud business. 
In Q1, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for hybrid cloud and public cloud, corresponding with how I look at our business. We've provided financial information for both segments in our earnings materials to give you better insight into the dynamics of the 2 segments. We will maintain our focus on driving growth with our hybrid cloud portfolio while scaling our public cloud services in fiscal year '22. 
In Q1, hybrid cloud revenue grew 8% year-over-year, led by outstanding growth in our all-flash array business, which increased 23% to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Based on our strong revenue growth, I am confident that we again gained share in the storage and all-flash markets. 
In the quarter, we delivered significant innovation that advances our flexible foundation for hybrid cloud, unified data management across on-premises and cloud environments, and simplified consumption and operation of hybrid cloud services. We further enhanced the industry's leading and only cloud-ready storage operating system by introducing ONTAP 9.9 with security enhancements, new integrated data protection capabilities and improved SAM performance. 
We also released Storage Grid 11.5 which supports for data encryption using external key management, ransomware protection with S3 object blocks and increased performance with intelligent load balancing. And we announced a broad range of enhancements to Keystone Flex subscription with new features for service providers, additional cloud support, our partner-delivered FlexPod as a service and integration with Equinix colocation services. 
Public cloud revenue grew 155% year-over-year driven by Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot by NetApp. It's been a year since we acquired Spot, and we are excited by the innovation we brought to market under the Spot by NetApp brand and the momentum we have with the spot offerings. Public cloud ARR grew to $337 million, an increase of 89% year-over-year, and public cloud dollar-based net retention rate remains healthy at 192%. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and growing. I am honored that we were recognized by Microsoft as the winner of their Global Customer Experience Partner of the Year and of their U.S. SAP on Azure Partner of the Year Awards. 
We continue to broaden our public cloud services beyond storage and data management services. Today, we help customers extend, migrate, automate and optimize the infrastructure and data management capabilities for enterprise and cloud native applications. Customers use NetApp Public Cloud services because we enable them to use more cloud at less cost. In Q1, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secure and cost-effective cloud desktop as a service for Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365. Additionally, we acquired Data Mechanics to accelerate the road map for Spot Wave, an infrastructure and application automation and optimization platform for high growth, big data and machine learning workloads in the cloud. We also continue to deliver on our vision and strategy around application aware, infrastructure and data management for containers. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability with the optimal blend of spot, reserved and on-demand compute instances, reducing costs by up to 90%. In Q1, we [ brought ] Spot Ocean into a suite of DevOp solutions with Ocean Continuous Delivery and Ocean Insights. Ocean Continuous Delivery, focuses on the most painful aspects of modern application delivery by automating mission-critical deployment and verification processes. Ocean Insights is an analytical tool that gives users a full view of their application clusters and then produce the potential savings from Motion. Last year, we introduced Astra Control, a rich set of storage and application-aware data management services for cloud-based Kubernetes workloads. Astra extends the data fabric to the cloud native world, and in Q1, we extended Astra to be a deployable, on-premise software solution, Astra Control Center. Wherever a customer chooses to deploy Kubernetes applications, we can accelerate the deployment, operation and protection of these critical environments. 
Let me share with you our customer story to highlight the value Astra Control Center brings to enterprise customers. As a part of its transformation strategy, a leading telecommunications provider is using a modern IT architecture based on container-native applications. These workloads are mission-critical, and the customer turn to NetApp and Astra Control Center to address the challenges of data protection and disaster recovery that don't exist in Kubernetes natively. Additionally, Astra helped them realize their vision of application portability across multiple Kubernetes distributions and data sharing across multiple clusters. We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise storage and data management technology. Our public cloud services drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market and enable us to reach new customers. We deliver not only industry-leading storage services in the cloud, but also cloud automation and optimization services and cloud infrastructure monitoring services. You should expect us to capitalize on our advantage by enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovation. Our strong customer momentum and the uniqueness of our public cloud services position furthers my confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year '25. 
Our strong first quarter results underscore our value to customers in a hybrid multi-cloud data-driven digital world. We are confident that we are well positioned with the right portfolio and strategy to solve our customers' most pressing challenges. With focused execution and demonstrated leadership in hybrid multi-cloud, we are reshaping the industry. We made a number of innovation announcements this quarter, and we will continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in cloud and software. 
I am excited for what this year will bring, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver top line growth as we support our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike to walk through our financial results and expectations, I want to thank the NetApp team, our customers and our partners for an outstanding quarter. I also want to remind you that we'll be hosting our fully digital Insight Customer event in October. I hope you'll be able to join us. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Fiscal '22 is off to a great start with strong revenue, gross margin and operating leverage across the entire business. Excellent execution by the whole NetApp team yielded Q1 billings of $1.38 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.46 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Our solid Q1 results were driven by healthy demand across both our hybrid cloud and public cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high end of guidance. 
As George noted in our earnings materials today, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for both hybrid cloud and public cloud. Hybrid Cloud captures all the revenue streams from our enterprise data center business, which include product, support and professional services. Our public cloud segment provides incremental visibility into the revenue and gross margin profile of our rapidly growing cloud business. Total hybrid cloud revenue of $1.38 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within hybrid cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter and expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $730 million increased 16% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we saw throughout fiscal '21, software product revenue of $414 million increased 33% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q1 recurring support revenue was $578 million, flat year-over-year. Excluding the 14th week from last year's compare, recurring support revenue was up 8% year-over-year. 
As George highlighted, public cloud ARR exited Q1 at $337 million, up 89% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Public cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $79 million, up 155% year-over-year. The growing scale of our public cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 12 points in revenue growth. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and public cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 17% year-over-year, representing 73% of total revenue versus 71% in Q1 '21. Recurring support and public cloud revenue of $657 million was up 8% year-over-year, constituting 45% of total revenue. Excluding last year's 14th week from the compare, recurring support and public cloud revenue was up a healthy 16% year-over-year. 
We ended Q1 with over $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Q1 marks the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth which continues to be the best indicator of the health of our recurring revenue. Total gross margin of 69% was an all-time company high, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and public cloud platform. Total hybrid cloud gross margin was also 69% in Q1. 
Within our hybrid cloud segment, product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich all-flash systems. Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. This is a major milestone for the public cloud business as we continue to build out a diversified portfolio of cloud-based software offerings. We expect this trend to continue as an increasing percentage of our public cloud business is built on software-only solutions. 
Q1 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with operating margin of 23%, an all-time high for our Q1. EPS of $1.15 came in above the high end of guidance and was up 58% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $242 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. During Q1, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out $112 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $212 million to shareholders, representing 111% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
As you all know, the supply chain situation remains fluid. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem with the goal of keeping backlog and customer lead times at normal levels. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate any potential supply risk. Aiding this effort is the fact that we have a singular software platform that powers all of our key storage products, which provides us added flexibility to work with our contract manufacturers and customers to meet end demand. 
With our strong execution in Q1 and our expectation of continued growth for the remainder of the year, we are raising our fiscal '22 guidance across the board. We now expect revenues to grow 8% to 9% year-over-year, with billings growth expected to outpace revenue growth given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and our public cloud platform. We also have growing confidence in our public cloud opportunity and are raising the low end of our fiscal '22 guide. We now expect to exit fiscal '22 with public cloud ARR of $450 million to $500 million, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. 
As George noted, we are solidly on track to deliver on our commitment to eclipse $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal '25. In fiscal '22, we expect total gross margin to be approximately 68% with product margin of approximately 55% for the full year. We anticipate operating margin to range between 23% to 24%. Operating expense expectations remain unchanged at $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our public cloud portfolio, targeted investments in go-to-market resources and continued investment in our customer success sales team. 
As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we continue to grow revenue faster than operating expenses. We are committed to delivering $4.85 to $5.05 in fiscal '22 EPS, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $60 million to $65 million and our effective tax rate will remain at 19%. We now expect to generate more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our public cloud platform. 
We are committed to the capital allocation framework we outlined during our Q4 call. The dividend will remain the first call on capital, while share repurchases will continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal '22. 
Consistent with NetApp's long history of disciplined M&A, the remaining free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic public cloud road map. 
Now on to Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.49 billion and $1.59 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Assumed in this guidance, our Q2 operating expenses of $690 million to $700 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.14 and $1.24 per share. Assumed in our Q2 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million to $20 million. 
As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. This is further compounded by the onetime tax payment associated with the sale of our Sunnyvale campus. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for working tirelessly throughout Q1 to maintain the momentum we had exiting last year. We are at a unique inflection point in the company's history as we continue to build out a truly differentiated public cloud platform while maintaining an unwavering focus on the hybrid cloud business. As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, customers and partners as we execute against both opportunities. 
I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

Our belief has been that other than a small number of customers who were directly impacted by COVID, the vast majority of the customers that we work with had a steady demand pattern for several quarters now. Certainly, we are seeing strengthening in demand as the economies reopen, but this is a reflection of more long-term trends, transformational work that customers are doing to digitize or hybridize their business, the work that they're doing to build cloud environments and so on. So I don't think that we see this as a pent-up demand kind of model. 
I think with regard to the sustainability of our business, we feel really good about product revenue. We -- as we said, we think that we can sustain product revenue growth each of the quarters of this year and particularly, our flash segment is very, very strong. And so we see really good momentum there and no reason to feel anything but real good confidence about where we are. 
Listen, we just finished a phenomenal quarter. In Q1, we grew our all-flash business by 23%, overall product revenue by 16% and cloud by 155% year-on-year. We raised our fiscal year to 8% to 9% growth and anticipate delivering close to $5 in earnings per share.

Both of those elements, top line as well as gross margin, should allow us to be kind of create leverage in the operating margin model of the company. Mike, do you want to add anything?"

I think we are in the early innings of enterprise use of cloud for big mission-critical, business-critical applications. I think we see that over the next few years, as businesses deploy more of their core operations on public clouds, the opportunities we have around compute automation management through Spot, storage and data protection and management through cloud volumes and monitoring through Cloud Insights will be a very, very strong business. And all of the hyperscaler partners that we work with see it much the same way, which is why they're building more and more capabilities with us. 
We also see a new growth engine in the public cloud segment with all of the cloud native work we are doing around containers and serverless. So Spot Ocean, we mentioned, is the same value proposition that Spot brings for enterprise applications to containerized applications that has seen very strong adoption. We've worked with some of the hyperscalers around Astra Control, and we are starting to see that get to ramp, especially with new cloud-native Kubernetes applications. And then we have started work on Cloud Insights for Kubernetes to bring monitoring and management. So I feel very good about the portfolio. There's a lot of organic innovation, and Spot has proven to be a really stellar acquisition for the company."

Keep in mind that the 2 largest operating expense line, sales and marketing and R&D, there's a lot of shared resources across there. 
Let's do R&D first. We've talked about it. We get a lot of efficiencies from the ONTAP group in terms of the work they do, both on-prem and in the cloud. We would expect to continue that where they're focused on both of those, and we got a lot of efficiencies there. Clearly, most of the growth in that line has been focused around cloud, and it probably still will be. That doesn't -- and that excludes any acquisitions. It could certainly play into that as well. And then from a sales and marketing perspective, we now have it where our core sales team is selling both. And so that will continue to be a focus. But we will also add like our customer success team that we've talked about, that's largely focused on the cloud business in terms of expansion and upsell and cross-sell to that team. So I think over time, you'll continue to see that investment there. 
From a cash flow perspective, I think that probably largely follows where operating income would. If you're down to free cash flow, you get a little bit of difference in terms of the hardware. But we've also talked about, a, the next couple of years, we'll continue to see a good bit of hardware, especially as it relates to Azure; but over the next couple of years, that it will flatten out, it's much more of a anywhere heading in a certain location versus seeding it. Once you get to almost 100%, then it's more of a replacement motion. So those are the puts and takes around OpEx and cash flow, I think, for those 2 segments."

So we're able to forecast that. More and more, it's also renewal rates, being able to forecast renewals. And then really the big driver of all cloud software business is upsell, cross-sell. That's obviously difficult for you folks to see those details, but we look at all of those. Certainly, sales capacity is part of that. 
On the hybrid cloud business, keep in mind, I think it's now $2.3 billion of support revenue every year. So that's much more of a renewal rate.

And as we look at businesses that are, call it, $250 million in ARR, as they grow to $1 billion, there -- you see not only a slight uptick in gross margin, but then obviously, you see the dynamics of operating income. So I would encourage you to take a look at some of those compares. We look at that a lot in terms of benchmarking our business largely what ends up happening as they turn cash flow positive before they turn operating income because of, again, the way they recognize revenue ratable. So I would encourage you to take a look at those. And there's really no reason to believe, as we said today, that we wouldn't follow that comparable group as we march to $1 billion in ARR."

Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining our Q1 fiscal year '22 earnings call.

Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining our Q1 fiscal year '22 earnings call. 
Building on our accelerating momentum through fiscal year '21, we delivered a strong start to fiscal year '22 with results at the high end or above our guidance for Q1. Broad-based strength drove 12% revenue growth and 16% product revenue growth year-over-year. Public cloud revenue grew triple digits again this quarter, up 155% from Q1 a year ago. Our results reflect solid customer demand and strong execution by our team in the quarter. 
Cloud and digital transformation initiatives remain top customer priorities, and we continue to benefit from these sizable long-term trends. Customers need to simplify and modernize existing data centers and deploy traditional applications quickly and confidently. At the same time, customers are also accelerating their use of cloud, adopting modern application architectures like Kubernetes and microservices for new workloads, and deploying data-rich applications like machine and deep learning.  
With our Data Fabric strategy, we are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications on-premises and in hybrid, multi-cloud environments. As I've said many times, our public cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our Hybrid Cloud business.  
In Q1, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud, corresponding with how I look at our business. We've provided financial information for both segments in our earnings materials to give you better insight into the dynamics of the 2 segments. We will maintain our focus on driving growth with our Hybrid Cloud portfolio while scaling our Public Cloud services in fiscal year '22.  
In Q1, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 8% year-over-year, led by outstanding growth in our all-flash array business, which increased 23% to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Based on our strong revenue growth, I am confident that we again gained share in the storage and all-flash markets.  
In the quarter, we delivered significant innovation that advances our flexible foundation for hybrid cloud, unifies data management across on-premises and cloud environments, and simplified consumption and operation of hybrid cloud services. We further enhanced the industry's leading and only cloud-ready storage operating system by introducing ONTAP 9.9 with security enhancements, new integrated data protection capabilities and improved SAN performance.  
We also released StorageGRID 11.5 with support for data encryption using external key management, ransomware protection with S3 object locks and increased performance with intelligent load balancing. And we announced a broad range of enhancements to Keystone Flex Subscription with new features for service providers, additional cloud support, a partner-delivered FlexPod as-a-service and integration with Equinix colocation services.  
Public Cloud revenue grew 155% year-over-year driven by Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights and Spot by NetApp. It's been a year since we acquired Spot, and we are excited by the innovation we brought to market under the Spot by NetApp brand and the momentum we have with the spot offerings. Public Cloud ARR grew to $337 million, an increase of 89% year-over-year, and Public Cloud dollar-based net retention rate remains healthy at 192%. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and growing. I am honored that we were recognized by Microsoft as the winner of their Global Customer Experience Partner of the Year and of their U.S. SAP on Azure Partner of the Year awards.  
We continue to broaden our Public Cloud services beyond storage and data management services. Today, we help customers extend, migrate, automate and optimize the infrastructure and data management capabilities for enterprise and cloud-native applications. Customers use NetApp Public Cloud services because we enable them to use more cloud at less cost. In Q1, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secure and cost-effective cloud desktop as a service for Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365. Additionally, we acquired Data Mechanics to accelerate the road map for Spot Wave, an infrastructure and application automation and optimization platform for high-growth big data and machine learning workloads in the cloud. 
We also continue to deliver on our vision and strategy around application-aware infrastructure and data management for containers. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability with the optimal blend of spot, reserved and on-demand compute instances, reducing costs by up to 90%. In Q1, we evolved Spot Ocean into a suite of DevOp solutions with Ocean Continuous Delivery and Ocean Insights. Ocean Continuous Delivery, focuses on the most painful aspects of modern application delivery by automating mission-critical deployment and verification processes. Ocean Insights is an analytical tool that gives users a full view of their application clusters and then produce the potential savings from Ocean. 
Last year, we introduced Astra Control, a rich set of storage and application-aware data management services for cloud-based Kubernetes workloads. Astra extends the data fabric to the cloud-native world, and in Q1, we extended Astra to be a deployable, on-premises software solution, Astra Control Center. Wherever a customer chooses to deploy Kubernetes applications, we can accelerate the deployment, operation and protection of these critical environments.  
Let me share with you a customer story to highlight the value Astra Control Center brings to enterprise customers. As a part of its transformation strategy, a leading telecommunications provider is using a modern IT architecture based on container-native applications. These workloads are mission-critical, and the customer turn to NetApp and Astra Control Center to address the challenges of data protection and disaster recovery that don't exist in Kubernetes natively. Additionally, Astra helped them realize their vision of application portability across multiple Kubernetes distributions and data sharing across multiple clusters. 
We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise storage and data management technology. Our Public Cloud services drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market and enable us to reach new customers. We deliver not only industry-leading storage services in the cloud, but also cloud automation and optimization services and cloud infrastructure monitoring services. You should expect us to capitalize on our advantage by enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovation. Our strong customer momentum and the uniqueness of our Public Cloud services position furthers my confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in Public Cloud ARR in fiscal year '25.  
Our strong first quarter results underscore our value to customers in a hybrid, multi-cloud, data-driven digital world. We are confident that we are well positioned with the right portfolio and strategy to solve our customers' most pressing challenges. With focused execution and demonstrated leadership in hybrid, multi-cloud, we are reshaping the industry. We made a number of innovation announcements this quarter, and we will continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in cloud and software.  
I am excited for what this year will bring, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver top line growth as we support our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys.  
Before I turn the call over to Mike to walk through our financial results and expectations, I want to thank the NetApp team, our customers and our partners for an outstanding quarter. I also want to remind you that we'll be hosting our fully digital INSIGHT customer event in October. I hope you'll be able to join us.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."
32052,1676301822,2386217,"NetApp, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2021",2021-08-25,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted.

As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. 
Fiscal '22 is off to a great start with strong revenue, gross margin and operating leverage across the entire business. Excellent execution by the whole NetApp team yielded Q1 billings of $1.38 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.46 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Our solid Q1 results were driven by healthy demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high end of guidance.  
As George noted in our earnings materials today, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for both Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud. Hybrid Cloud captures all the revenue streams from our enterprise data center business, which include product, support and professional services. Our Public Cloud segment provides incremental visibility into the revenue and gross margin profile of our rapidly growing cloud business. 
Total Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.38 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter and expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $730 million increased 16% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we saw throughout fiscal '21, software product revenue of $414 million increased 33% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q1 recurring support revenue was $578 million, flat year-over-year. Excluding the 14th week from last year's compare, recurring support revenue was up 8% year-over-year. 
As George highlighted, Public Cloud ARR exited Q1 at $337 million, up 89% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $79 million, up 155% year-over-year. The growing scale of our Public Cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 12 points in revenue growth. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 17% year-over-year, representing 73% of total revenue versus 71% in Q1 '21. 
Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $657 million was up 8% year-over-year, constituting 45% of total revenue. Excluding last year's 14th week from the compare, recurring support and public cloud revenue was up a healthy 16% year-over-year.  
We ended Q1 with over $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Q1 marks the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth which continues to be the best indicator of the health of our recurring revenue. 
Total gross margin of 69% was an all-time company high, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and Public Cloud platform. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 69% in Q1. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich all-flash systems. Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable with gross margin of 92%. 
Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. This is a major milestone for the Public Cloud business as we continue to build out a diversified portfolio of cloud-based software offerings. We expect this trend to continue as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business is built on software-only solutions.  
Q1 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with operating margin of 23%, an all-time high for our Q1. EPS of $1.15 came in above the high end of guidance and was up 58% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $242 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. During Q1, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out $112 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $212 million to shareholders, representing 111% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.  
As you all know, the supply chain situation remains fluid. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem with the goal of keeping backlog and customer lead times at normal levels. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate any potential supply risk. Aiding this effort is the fact that we have a singular software platform that powers all of our key storage products, which provides us added flexibility to work with our contract manufacturers and customers to meet end demand.  
With our strong execution in Q1 and our expectation of continued growth for the remainder of the year, we are raising our fiscal '22 guidance across the board. We now expect revenues to grow 8% to 9% year-over-year, with billings growth expected to outpace revenue growth given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and our Public Cloud platform. We also have growing confidence in our Public Cloud opportunity and are raising the low end of our fiscal '22 guide. We now expect to exit fiscal '22 with Public Cloud ARR of $450 million to $500 million, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As George noted, we are solidly on track to deliver on our commitment to eclipse $1 billion in Public Cloud ARR in fiscal '25. 
In fiscal '22, we expect total gross margin to be approximately 68% with product margin of approximately 55% for the full year. We anticipate operating margin to range between 23% to 24%. Operating expense expectations remain unchanged at $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio, targeted investments in go-to-market resources and continued investment in our customer success sales team. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we continue to grow revenue faster than operating expenses. 
We are committed to delivering $4.85 to $5.05 in fiscal '22 EPS, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $60 million to $65 million and our effective tax rate will remain at 19%. We now expect to generate more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our Hybrid Cloud business continues to fund the growth in our Public Cloud platform. 
We are committed to the capital allocation framework we outlined during our Q4 call. The dividend will remain the first call on capital, while share repurchases will continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal '22. Consistent with NetApp's long history of disciplined M&A, the remaining free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic Public Cloud road map.  
Now on to Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.49 billion and $1.59 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Assumed in this guidance, our Q2 operating expenses of $690 million to $700 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.14 and $1.24 per share. Assumed in our Q2 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million to $20 million.  
As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. This is further compounded by the onetime tax payment associated with the sale of our Sunnyvale campus. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for working tirelessly throughout Q1 to maintain the momentum we had exiting last year. We are at a unique inflection point in the company's history as we continue to build out a truly differentiated public cloud platform while maintaining an unwavering focus on the Hybrid Cloud business. As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, customers and partners as we execute against both opportunities.

Our belief has been that other than a small number of customers who were directly impacted by COVID, the vast majority of the customers that we work with had a steady demand pattern for several quarters now. Certainly, we are seeing strengthening in demand as the economies reopen, but this is a reflection of more long-term trends, transformational work that customers are doing to digitize or hybridize their business, the work that they're doing to build cloud environments and so on. So I don't think that we see this as a pent-up demand kind of model. 
I think with regard to the sustainability of our business, we feel really good about product revenue. We -- as we said, we think that we can sustain product revenue growth each of the quarters of this year and particularly, our flash segment is very, very strong. And so we see really good momentum there and no reason to feel anything but real good confidence about where we are. 
Listen, we just finished a phenomenal quarter. In Q1, we grew our all-flash business by 23%, overall product revenue by 16% and cloud by 155% year-on-year. We raised our fiscal year to 8% to 9% growth and anticipate delivering close to $5 in earnings per share. These are all record numbers, right, operating margins, full year and earnings per share for the company. So I feel very, very, very good about where we are."

We've worked with some of the hyperscalers around Astra Control, and we are starting to see that get to ramp, especially with new cloud-native Kubernetes applications. And then we have started work on Cloud Insights for Kubernetes to bring monitoring and management. So I feel very good about the portfolio. There's a lot of organic innovation, and Spot has proven to be a really stellar acquisition for the company."

Keep in mind that the 2 largest operating expense line, sales and marketing and R&D, there's a lot of shared resources across there. 
Let's do R&D first. We've talked about it. We get a lot of efficiencies from the ONTAP group in terms of the work they do, both on-prem and in the cloud. We would expect to continue that where they're focused on both of those, and we got a lot of efficiencies there. Clearly, most of the growth in that line has been focused around cloud, and it probably still will be. That doesn't -- and that excludes any acquisitions. It could certainly play into that as well. And then from a sales and marketing perspective, we now have it where our core sales team is selling both. And so that will continue to be a focus. But we will also add like our customer success team that we've talked about, that's largely focused on the cloud business in terms of expansion and upsell and cross-sell to that team. So I think over time, you'll continue to see that investment there. 
From a cash flow perspective, I think that probably largely follows where operating income would. If you're down to free cash flow, you get a little bit of difference in terms of the hardware. But we've also talked about, hey, the next couple of years, we'll continue to see a good bit of hardware, especially as it relates to Azure; but over the next couple of years, that it will flatten out, it's much more of a anywhere heading in a certain location versus seeding it. Once you get to almost 100%, then it's more of a replacement motion. So those are the puts and takes around OpEx and cash flow, I think, for those 2 segments."

So we're able to forecast that. More and more, it's also renewal rates, being able to forecast renewals. And then really the big driver of all cloud software business is upsell, cross-sell. That's obviously difficult for you folks to see those details, but we look at all of those. Certainly, sales capacity is part of that. 
On the Hybrid Cloud business, keep in mind, I think it's now $2.3 billion of support revenue every year. So that's much more of a renewal rate.

We delivered another strong quarter, with results all at the high end or above our guidance. Building on the momentum of last year and the previous quarter, revenue grew 11% year-over-year, with Public Cloud segment revenue growth of 85% and Hybrid Cloud segment revenue growth of 8%. Product revenue grew 9% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share are all at record highs for the first half of the fiscal year.
Our performance reflects continued broad-based customer demand created by the sizable and long-term trends of cloud and data-driven digital transformation, where NetApp is playing an increasingly important role in helping customers achieve their business and hybrid cloud transformation goals. NetApp is uniquely positioned to solve organizations' most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications, on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments. 
As I've said many times, our public cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, but they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our hybrid cloud business. We are seeing this play out in the strong results from both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud segments. In Q2, we had a number of announcements that further solidify our leadership position as we continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment, while scaling our Public Cloud segment.
Public Cloud revenue grew 85% year-over-year, driven by Azure NetApp files, Cloud Insights and Spot by NetApp. Public Cloud ARR grew to $388 million, an increase of 80% year-over-year and Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 179%. During Q2, we advanced our cloud agenda significantly and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of reaching $1 billion ARR in fiscal year '25, with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the corporate average.
In Q2, Amazon Web Services, AWS, announced the general availability of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, a native, fully managed AWS storage service powered by ONTAP. This new first-party product is fully integrated into the AWS console, and it's sold, supported run and built by AWS, making it easy and cost-effective for customers to take advantage of NetApp's suite of enterprise-grade data services, while running in an AWS native experience. As we saw with Azure NetApp Files, it will take time for FSX for NetApp ONTAP to ramp, but we are extraordinarily pleased with the early indicators and the number of customers piloting this service.
Additionally, Google Cloud announced that NetApp will provide storage infrastructure for its Google distributed cloud hosted, where data resides in customer-owned data centers and colocation facilities. Google is previewing the integration of Google Cloud VMware engine with NetApp Cloud Volumes Service, a fully managed service that helps organizations meet their needs for storage and disaster recovery. We also expanded availability of Cloud Volumes Service in the Google Cloud, much like any other Google Cloud native service, Cloud Volumes Service can be provisioned and consumed against existing Google Cloud agreements, making it easier for customers to expand their cloud engagements with both Google and NetApp.
Finally, Microsoft announced that whitelisting has been removed from Azure NetApp Files. Azure NetApp Files has been generally available since May 2019, with customers around the world relying on it to run their most demanding enterprise workloads in the Azure Cloud. Now customers can instantaneously leverage Azure NetApp Files to accelerate the deployment of mission-critical applications to Azure. Additionally, we expanded the backup restore service and cross-region replication capabilities for Azure NetApp Files.
We now have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers to give organizations the benefits of our storage and data management expertise and experience, no matter which cloud they choose. We have deepened each partnership and co-engineered services directly with the cloud providers, enabling their customers to buy directly from them. This level of integration streamlines purchasing, billing operations and support, and eliminates the complexity of additional contracts, product installations or patching. 
Importantly, for NetApp, these partnerships create a new and massive go-to-market growth engine as 3 of the largest and most innovative companies in the world are reselling our technology. Each of these announcements represent years of hard work, partnership and continuous innovation, bringing ONTAP to the cloud at cloud speed and represents the opportunity for continued expansion. We're now the first and only storage environment that's natively integrated into each of the major public cloud providers. 
We also made significant enhancements to the Spot portfolio, We introduced Spot Security, a new product designed to keep cloud infrastructure secure. Delivering continuous, automated AI-based security, Spot Security analyzes, detects and prioritizes threats to surface the most critical vulnerabilities and provides actionable compliance, remediation and prevention. 
We also released Intelligent Traffic Flow, a new functionality to Spot Elastigroup, which further enhances our customers' ability to optimize their applications by intelligently managing and controlling incoming network traffic for optimal instance utilization and high performance. Additionally, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secured and continuously optimized desktop service built together with Microsoft to provide a complete solution for Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop.
At the beginning of Q3, we closed the acquisition of CloudCheckr, whose industry-leading cloud billing analytics and cloud configuration management, monitoring and assessment solutions will augment the full suite of Spot Services. In addition to being a solid technology acquisition, CloudCheckr will enhance our partner strategy for cloud, and we will leverage the CloudCheckr platform to build and extend distributor and partner businesses in both the private and public sectors.
Also in Q2, we held our annual flagship customer event, Insight, with more than 10,000 attendees and we introduced NetApp TV to stay engaged with customers throughout the year. At Insight, we announced enhancements to our hybrid cloud portfolio with the latest version of ONTAP that delivers even better performance for SAN and modern workloads like AI and analytics, expanded capabilities for object storage, increasingly automated storage system management and autonomous ransomware protection based on machine learning.
The strength of our storage offerings was recognized by Gartner, which named NetApp once again as a leader in the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage. Gartner called out our robust product and cloud service portfolio as well as Keystone Flex Subscription, our comprehensive and flexible storage as a service offering. We were also recognized among this year's top vendor solutions evaluated in the 2021 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Primary Storage across all use cases.
Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by strength in object storage for the rapidly growing unstructured data and analytics use cases, and our all-flash array portfolio. In Q2, our all-flash array business reached a record-high annualized run rate of $3.1 billion, an increase of 22% year-on-year. All-flash arrays now compose 30% of our installed base systems. We see substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize their storage environments. Based on our continued strong revenue growth, I am confident that we once again gained share in the enterprise storage and all-flash array markets. 
Like everyone in our industry, we are faced with a challenging supply environment. While the situation is dynamic and continues to evolve, we are doing everything we can to mitigate the supply chain headwinds. We believe that we can continue to manage through them and address the substantial customer demand. As Mike will explain, we have factored the ongoing supply chain uncertainty into our guidance for Q3 and the full year. I am pleased with how we have navigated these challenges and want to thank our suppliers for their support and the NetApp team for their hard work in this environment.
In summary, our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision and exceptional execution across our business. As we close the first half of fiscal year '22, I'm proud of our team and what we have accomplished. We continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in cloud and software. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are well positioned to capture the sizable opportunity ahead.
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to invite you all to join us for our Investor Day on March 22, 2022. Please mark your calendars and stay tuned for more information. I'll now turn it over to Mike."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion.
Number one, Q2 was another strong quarter with results at the high end or above our guidance; number two, our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins; number three, our cloud business had another outstanding quarter as we march towards the $1 billion ARR target; and number four, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and public cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year.
Now to the details. In fiscal Q2, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q2 billings of $1.55 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.57 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Our solid Q2 results were driven by healthy demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high end of guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.48 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue throughout fiscal '22. 
Product revenue of $814 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we've seen over the last year, Software product revenue of $475 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 7% year-over-year. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3 billion for the first time in the company's history and was up 22% year-over-year.
Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $388 million, up 80% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $87 million, up 85% year-over-year. The growing scale of our Public Cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3 of the 11 points in revenue growth. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $677 million was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, Software Product revenue, Recurring Support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 74% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q2 '21.
We ended Q2 with $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q2 marks the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 68%, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and public cloud platform. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 68% in Q2. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, Product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich all-flash systems. Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%.
Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. We expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80% as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software-only solutions. We recently introduced a new FSx for ONTAP product with AWS and also closed the CloudCheckr acquisition, both are software-only offerings and support our long-term margin goal. 
Q2 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 24%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.28 was up 22% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $298 million, and free cash flow was $252 million. DSO in Q2 was an impressive 38 days, highlighting a strong collections process and healthy linearity throughout the quarter. Year-to-date free cash flow of $443 million is up 43% year-over-year. During Q2, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $112 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $237 million to shareholders, representing 94% of free cash flow. We closed Q2 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.
As you all know, the dynamic supply chain headwinds have intensified recently. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem, with the goal of meeting as much customer demand as possible. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments. That said, we do anticipate the supply chain challenges facing the overall technology industry to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in the second half of fiscal '22. These supply chain headwinds and our ongoing actions to mitigate them have been factored into our Q3 and updated full year guidance.
With our strong execution in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance. We now expect revenues to grow 9% to 10% year-over-year, even with the challenging supply chain environment. We also have growing confidence in our expanding public cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our organic Public Cloud ARR with a new range of $475 million to $500 million.
As you know, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. We anticipate CloudCheckr to contribute an additional $35 million to $40 million in Public Cloud ARR exiting the year. In total, our new guidance for exit fiscal '22 Public Cloud ARR is $510 million to $540 million, which at the midpoint, implies a 74% increase year-over-year.
For fiscal '22, we continue to forecast total gross margin to be approximately 68%. However, the current supply chain challenges with temporarily higher freight and expedite charges, will pressure product margins in Q3 and Q4. We now anticipate product margins to be approximately 54% for the full year. We are reaffirming our full year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. 
We are forecasting operating expenses to range between $2.795 billion and $2.815 billion, driven by investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our public cloud portfolio and investments in both our cloud and customer success sales teams. Our new OpEx guidance also includes $10 million per quarter from CloudCheckr. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we remain committed to growing revenue faster than operating expenses. 
We are raising our fiscal '22 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $4.90 and $5.10 representing 23% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $60 million, and our effective tax rate will remain at 19%. We remain committed to delivering more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our Hybrid Cloud business continues to fund the growth in our Public Cloud platform.
Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Assumed in this guidance, our Q3 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, which includes CloudCheckr. We expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million, and our tax rate will be approximately 19%. 
In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in the first half of our fiscal year. The team stayed focused on our core priorities and we're not distracted by external events out of their control. We are excited to build on that momentum as we continue to scale a truly differentiated public cloud platform, while maintaining an unwavering focus on the Hybrid Cloud business.

All of them had really strong quarters, and we're really pleased.
In terms of FSx for ONTAP, I will just say that it's very early days, but we are extraordinarily pleased. Listen, if you look at the cloud file storage market, the public data suggests that Amazon Web Services is the dominant player in that market and having a needed first-party ONTAP enterprise file storage service in the Amazon Cloud is an enormous opportunity. We are doing the innovation and the enablement work to scale that business. We're really pleased with the early results, but we have a long kind of -- we'll see that play out over the next several quarters, right?

I think they don't exist solely in the public cloud. I think you could see, for example, the -- in my prepared remarks, the commentary on working with Google around a distributed cloud platform. And so you'll see us continue to broaden the range of innovation opportunities that we deliver with the hyperscalers, so that we can truly build a hybrid multi-cloud data management and infrastructure services management platform with them.
I think within the public cloud, there are going to be continued opportunities for substantial growth. I think, as I said, we feel really, really good about the progress towards the $1 billion ARR targets that we had laid out. We will share more about the specific updates to our long-term plans at our analyst conference, right? But let me just say cloud storage is a massive opportunity. Cloud file storage alone is a very rapidly growing multibillion-dollar opportunity, and we are positioned at the sweet spot of that, alongside the biggest 3 cloud providers in the world.
Second, cloud compute management and cloud cost management is another massively important customer priority, and Spot plus CloudCheckr gives us a differentiated platform to go after that set of use cases. And we see more and more types of workloads collapsing onto these 2 important elements of Infrastructure as a Service. And Cloud Insights, our monitoring platform helps customers not only deploy those infrastructure services but also monitor them. So I feel really, really, really good about our cloud progress."

So we address about 70% of the customer spend using the Spot technology. 
What CloudCheckr allows customers to do is to first be able to analyze and prioritize which of those environments they should move to Spot first and most quickly, so that they can get the best savings. And then subsequently, also gives them an integrated bill for their entire environment, now optimized with Spot. So we're excited about what CloudCheckr brings from a technology perspective. 
From a route-to-market perspective, it has a strong footprint in public sector and in managed service providers, who use it as an integrated billing and analytics platform for all of their downstream customers. And so it expands our reach into the marketplace.
With regard to cloud operating margin, today, we don't break out operating margins. I would just tell you that we are a highly leveraged operating model for the company. If you look at the first half of this year, more than 50% of total revenue growth fell to the bottom line. We see the opportunity in cloud to be a fast-growing, high gross margin opportunity, and we are going to invest to capture that, but we are doing so while continuing to drive the operating margin profile of the total company. So I'm excited about the possibilities ahead and the continued increase in margin-rich software and cloud services in our portfolio. Mike, do you have anything else?"

The other thing we've talked about is yes, the route-to-market and the hyperscaler sales channel certainly helps. We also have our own sales team as well. They will get more and more efficient, especially as we build up that customer success team. So as we look at that $1 billion target, as we've talked about, you look at the comps that have about $1 billion of ARR.

The first is technology certification and workload expansion. So we work with the cloud providers to qualify more and more and more workloads that can be best served using our technology. An example that I cited recently is the VMware cloud in Google now being certified to use NetApp Cloud Volumes as a primary data store, which has enormous benefits to VMware customers of NetApp and VMware to be able to now expand to the cloud as well as new customers that want to deploy mission-critical environments on the VMware cloud, right? So that's one, workload certifications and expansions.
The second is additional regions and enablement for the go-to-market engines. You've seen us grow the Azure NetApp Files business steadily and very successfully over a period of time. Amazon and Google are behind that, but we know the recipe, and we're working to scale that. And then finally, cross-selling and upselling a customer once they get on our service, dollar-based net retention rate is a very healthy 179%. It's early days in our customer base. So over time, that should come down, but it shows that once a customer uses one of our services, they expand dramatically, and then we get to sell them a portfolio of more services. 
So lots of ways to grow our cloud business ahead. We're super excited. And we worked really, really hard to get here, and we're going to capitalize on the opportunity."

I think we have said for a long time that mid-range systems with clustering software will cannibalize the high-end frame array business of some of our competitors. And you are seeing that play out. The mid-range systems offer the sweet spot from a price performance standpoint for customers. And with clustering, you can build enormously large environment to consolidate a range of different workloads, and we expect that trend to continue going forward. The days of the frame array are over, to be completely transparent. And so we'll continue to see that trend going on over time. 
With regard to how these -- within our business, all-flash arrays will have an important and growing part of the customer's data center. Hybrid flash arrays will continue to have a long-term position in the data center. So today, in our installed base, for example, all-flash is about 30% of the installed base. We expect, as more flash technologies come to play, that number to grow to about 70% over time. I think, however, we do not subscribe to the theory that hard disk drives no longer have value. They will have enduring value for certain sets of workloads that they are built for, capacity-oriented workloads, backup and archival media retention, images, things like that. So we feel good about our position in the market. We're going to stay focused and continue to execute against our all-flash array business and our object storage business as priorities for the enterprise storage environment."

Those have been our long-term perspective on how business architectures and technology architectures evolve. That has certainly come sharper into focus with COVID, but they have always been part of the long-term road map of our customers. We have seen the acceleration of cloud-based environments for certain workloads, especially workloads like virtual desktops or in schools for the ability for teachers to be able to use cloud-based environments to conduct classrooms, and we think those will continue and endure going forward as the future of work remains hybrid.
Within the enterprise storage environment, we've always believed that flash will have a growing part of the customer data center as the economics of flash and the ability to consolidate and simplify your data center environment grows. That being said, there are workloads like I've mentioned earlier in the call that we'll continue to stay on hard drives. And I think the big only draft to flash is now sort of stabilizing and people understand what flash is going to be used for and understand what HDDs are going to be used for.

We're doing a lot of work, not only in supply chain, but in engineering and other things to make sure that we can deliver as much as we can in Q4 and then certainly, the price increase, it will take a little bit of time to work its way through the system. So add all those together, and that's what added up into our guidance, our implied guide for Q3 and Q4."

Just anything in terms of number of pilots or the workloads that you're doing with AWS right now, we're switching with Azure. 
And then really, when I think about this $1 billion road map that you'd given us a while back, did you envision a AWS partnership, especially how fully integrated NetApp is on the console and the fact that AWS is proactively selling that out. Did you envision all this in the $1 billion road map? Or is this incremental to that narrative?"

These are $1 trillion corporations with enormous impact on the IT market, and we are honored to work with both of them. They have different approaches to the customer base and different ways and different strengths. And so we're excited to work with Amazon and Microsoft.
I think the overall opportunity set reflects their scale in the market, right? So Amazon has massive market presence and market share. 
I think in the file space, they are a very large part of the files market. So the fact that we have a play with them, gives us enormous scale into the file storage market. I think we are -- from an execution standpoint, listen, we've learned a lot over the last few years. We know what it takes to scale a business. And we've done that in partnership with Microsoft. We continue to scale that with innovation and co-engineering and go-to-market. But we are also taking some of those lessons learned into how we can scale other services more quickly. 
With regard to the $1 billion plan, listen, we always believed that we would be working with multiple hyperscalers. I don't think you should assume that we were carving enough to say that we have that in the bag, but we had that as part of our road map, and we're honored to have the partnership with AWS. I think as I said, I feel very, very good about where we are in our road map to $1 billion. We'll tell you more about the timing and the mix and all of that when we get to Analyst Day, right?

So we're continuing to drive really good scale while investing in the business. We will continue to do that going forward, very much focused not only on where we need to invest, but what is that return. That's why we're so focused on cloud as well as incremental sales and product development. So you should expect to see us continue to invest going forward.
Now outside of OpEx, we've talked about it before. We will continue to be active in M&A, and we're still allocating at least 30% of our free cash flow, plus we have a very nice cash balance and a lot of flexibility on the balance sheet to fund acquisitions.

We delivered another strong quarter, with results all at the high end or above our guidance. Building on the momentum of last year and the previous quarter, revenue grew 11% year-over-year, with Public Cloud segment revenue growth of 85% and Hybrid Cloud segment revenue growth of 8%. Product revenue grew 9% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share are all at record highs for the first half of the fiscal year. 
Our performance reflects continued broad-based customer demand created by the sizable and long-term trends of cloud and data-driven digital transformation, where NetApp is playing an increasingly important role in helping customers achieve their business and hybrid cloud transformation goals. NetApp is uniquely positioned to solve organizations' most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications, on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments.  
As I've said many times, our Public Cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market but they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our Hybrid Cloud business. We are seeing this play out in the strong results from both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud segments. In Q2, we had a number of announcements that further solidify our leadership position as we continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment, while scaling our Public Cloud segment. 
Public Cloud revenue grew 85% year-over-year, driven by Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Insights and Spot by NetApp. Public Cloud ARR grew to $388 million, an increase of 80% year-over-year and Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 179%. During Q2, we advanced our cloud agenda significantly, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of reaching $1 billion ARR in fiscal year '25, with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the corporate average. 
In Q2, Amazon Web Services, AWS, announced the general availability of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, a native, fully managed AWS storage service powered by ONTAP. This new first-party product is fully integrated into the AWS console, and it's sold, supported run and built by AWS, making it easy and cost-effective for customers to take advantage of NetApp's suite of enterprise-grade data services, while running in an AWS native experience. As we saw with Azure NetApp Files, it will take time for FSX for NetApp ONTAP to ramp, but we are extraordinarily pleased with the early indicators and the number of customers piloting this service. 
Additionally, Google Cloud announced that NetApp will provide storage infrastructure for its Google Distributed Cloud Hosted, where data resides in customer-owned data centers and colocation facilities. Google is previewing the integration of Google Cloud VMware Engine with NetApp Cloud Volumes Service, a fully managed service that helps organizations meet their needs for storage and disaster recovery. We also expanded availability of Cloud Volumes Service in the Google Cloud, much like any other Google Cloud native service, Cloud Volumes Service can be provisioned and consumed against existing Google Cloud agreements, making it easier for customers to expand their cloud engagements with both Google and NetApp. 
Finally, Microsoft announced that whitelisting has been removed from Azure NetApp Files. Azure NetApp Files has been generally available since May 2019, with customers around the world relying on it to run their most demanding enterprise workloads in the Azure Cloud. Now customers can instantaneously leverage Azure NetApp Files to accelerate the deployment of mission-critical applications to Azure. Additionally, we expanded the backup restore service and cross-region replication capabilities for Azure NetApp Files. 
We now have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers to give organizations the benefits of our storage and data management expertise and experience, no matter which cloud they choose. We have deepened each partnership and co-engineered services directly with the cloud providers, enabling their customers to buy directly from them. This level of integration streamlines purchasing, billing operations and support, and eliminates the complexity of additional contracts, product installations or patching. Importantly, for NetApp, these partnerships create a new and massive go-to-market growth engine as 3 of the largest and most innovative companies in the world are reselling our technology. 
Each of these announcements represent years of hard work, partnership and continuous innovation, bringing ONTAP to the cloud at cloud speed and represents the opportunity for continued expansion. We're now the first and only storage environment that's natively integrated into each of the major public cloud providers.  
We also made significant enhancements to the Spot portfolio. We introduced Spot Security, a new product designed to keep cloud infrastructure secure. Delivering continuous, automated AI-based security, Spot Security analyzes, detects and prioritizes threats to surface the most critical vulnerabilities and provides actionable compliance, remediation and prevention. We also released intelligent traffic flow, a new functionality to Spot Elastigroup, which further enhances our customers' ability to optimize their applications by intelligently managing and controlling incoming network traffic for optimal instance utilization and high performance. Additionally, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secured and continuously optimized desktop service built together with Microsoft to provide a complete solution for Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop. 
At the beginning of Q3, we closed the acquisition of CloudCheckr, whose industry-leading cloud billing analytics and cloud configuration management, monitoring and assessment solutions will augment the full suite of Spot services. In addition to being a solid technology acquisition, CloudCheckr will enhance our partner strategy for cloud, and we will leverage the CloudCheckr platform to build and extend distributor and partner businesses in both the private and public sectors. 
Also in Q2, we held our annual flagship customer event, Insight, with more than 10,000 attendees and we introduced NetApp TV to stay engaged with customers throughout the year. At Insight, we announced enhancements to our hybrid cloud portfolio with the latest version of ONTAP that delivers even better performance for SAN and modern workloads like AI and analytics, expanded capabilities for object storage, increasingly automated storage system management and autonomous ransomware protection based on machine learning. 
The strength of our storage offerings was recognized by Gartner, which named NetApp once again as a leader in the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage. Gartner called out our robust product and cloud service portfolio as well as Keystone Flex subscription, our comprehensive and flexible storage as a service offering. We were also recognized among this year's top vendor solutions evaluated in the 2021 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Primary Storage across all use cases. 
Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by strength in object storage for the rapidly growing unstructured data and analytics use cases, and our all-flash array portfolio. In Q2, our all-flash array business reached a record-high annualized run rate of $3.1 billion, an increase of 22% year-on-year. All-flash arrays now compose 30% of our installed base systems. We see substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize their storage environments. 
Based on our continued strong revenue growth, I am confident that we once again gained share in the enterprise storage and all-flash array markets. Like everyone in our industry, we are faced with a challenging supply environment. While the situation is dynamic and continues to evolve, we are doing everything we can to mitigate the supply chain headwinds. We believe that we can continue to manage through them and address the substantial customer demand. 
As Mike will explain, we have factored the ongoing supply chain uncertainty into our guidance for Q3 and the full year. I am pleased with how we have navigated these challenges and want to thank our suppliers for their support and the NetApp team for their hard work in this environment. 
In summary, our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision and exceptional execution across our business. As we close the first half of fiscal year '22, I'm proud of our team and what we have accomplished. We continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in cloud and software. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are well positioned to capture the sizable opportunity ahead. 
Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to invite you all to join us for our Investor Day on March 22, 2022. Please mark your calendars and stay tuned for more information. I'll now turn it over to Mike."

As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. 
Number one, Q2 was another strong quarter with results at the high end or above our guidance. Number two, our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins. Number three, our cloud business had another outstanding quarter as we march towards the $1 billion ARR target; and number four, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year. 
Now to the details. In fiscal Q2, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q2 billings of $1.55 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.57 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Our solid Q2 results were driven by healthy demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high end of guidance. 
Total Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.48 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue throughout fiscal '22.  
Product revenue of $814 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we've seen over the last year, software product revenue of $475 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 7% year-over-year. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3 billion for the first time in the company's history and was up 22% year-over-year. 
Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $388 million, up 80% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $87 million, up 85% year-over-year. The growing scale of our Public Cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3 of the 11 points in revenue growth. 
Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $677 million was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, Software Product revenue, Recurring Support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 74% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q2 '21. 
We ended Q2 with $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q2 marks the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth. 
Total gross margin was 68%, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and Public Cloud platform. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 68% in Q2. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich all-flash systems. Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%. 
Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. We expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80% as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software-only solutions. We recently introduced a new FSx for ONTAP product with AWS and also closed the CloudCheckr acquisition, both are software-only offerings and support our long-term margin goal.  
Q2 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 24%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.28 was up 22% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $298 million, and free cash flow was $252 million. DSO in Q2 was an impressive 38 days, highlighting a strong collections process and healthy linearity throughout the quarter. Year-to-date free cash flow of $443 million is up 43% year-over-year. 
During Q2, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $112 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $237 million to shareholders, representing 94% of free cash flow. We closed Q2 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. 
As you all know, the dynamic supply chain headwinds have intensified recently. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem, with the goal of meeting as much customer demand as possible. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments. That said, we do anticipate the supply chain challenges facing the overall technology industry to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in the second half of fiscal '22. These supply chain headwinds and our ongoing actions to mitigate them have been factored into our Q3 and updated full year guidance. 
With our strong execution in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance. We now expect revenues to grow 9% to 10% year-over-year, even with the challenging supply chain environment. We also have growing confidence in our expanding Public Cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our organic Public Cloud ARR with a new range of $475 million to $500 million. 
As you know, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. We anticipate CloudCheckr to contribute an additional $35 million to $40 million in Public Cloud ARR exiting the year. In total, our new guidance for exit fiscal '22 Public Cloud ARR is $510 million to $540 million, which at the midpoint, implies a 74% increase year-over-year. 
For fiscal '22, we continue to forecast total gross margin to be approximately 68%. However, the current supply chain challenges with temporarily higher freight and expedite charges, will pressure product margins in Q3 and Q4. We now anticipate product margins to be approximately 54% for the full year. We are reaffirming our full year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. We are forecasting operating expenses to range between $2.795 billion and $2.815 billion, driven by investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio and investments in both our cloud and customer success sales teams. 
Our new OpEx guidance also includes $10 million per quarter from CloudCheckr. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we remain committed to growing revenue faster than operating expenses. We are raising our fiscal '22 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $4.90 and $5.10, representing 23% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $60 million, and our effective tax rate will remain at 19%. We remain committed to delivering more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our Hybrid Cloud business continues to fund the growth in our Public Cloud platform. 
Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Assumed in this guidance, our Q3 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, which includes CloudCheckr. We expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. 
Assumed in our Q3 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million and our tax rate will be approximately 19%.  
In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in the first half of our fiscal year. The team stayed focused on our core priorities and we're not distracted by external events out of their control. We are excited to build on that momentum as we continue to scale a truly differentiated Public Cloud platform, while maintaining an unwavering focus on the Hybrid Cloud business. 
As George mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in the spring, where we will further discuss the long-term value drivers for our shareholders, customers and partners.

All of them had really strong quarters, and we're really pleased.
In terms of FSx for ONTAP, I will just say that it's very early days, but we are extraordinarily pleased. Listen, if you look at the cloud file storage market, the public data suggests that Amazon Web Services is the dominant player in that market and having a needed first-party ONTAP enterprise file storage service in the Amazon Cloud is an enormous opportunity. We are doing the innovation and the enablement work to scale that business. We're really pleased with the early results, but we have a long kind of -- we'll see that play out over the next several quarters, right?

And so you'll see us continue to broaden the range of innovation opportunities that we deliver with the hyperscalers, so that we can truly build a hybrid multi-cloud data management and infrastructure services management platform with them.
I think within the public cloud, there are going to be continued opportunities for substantial growth. I think, as I said, we feel really, really good about the progress towards the $1 billion ARR targets that we had laid out. We will share more about the specific updates to our long-term plans at our analyst conference, right? But let me just say cloud storage is a massive opportunity. Cloud file storage alone is a very rapidly growing multibillion-dollar opportunity, and we are positioned at the sweet spot of that, alongside the biggest 3 cloud providers in the world.
Second, cloud compute management and cloud cost management is another massively important customer priority, and Spot plus CloudCheckr gives us a differentiated platform to go after that set of use cases. And we see more and more types of workloads collapsing onto these 2 important elements of Infrastructure as a Service. And Cloud Insights, our monitoring platform helps customers not only deploy those infrastructure services but also monitor them. So I feel really, really, really good about our cloud progress."

So we address about 70% of the customer spend using the Spot technology. 
What CloudCheckr allows customers to do is to first be able to analyze and prioritize which of those environments they should move to Spot first and most quickly, so that they can get the best savings. And then subsequently, also gives them an integrated bill for their entire environment, now optimized with Spot. So we're excited about what CloudCheckr brings from a technology perspective. 
From a route-to-market perspective, it has a strong footprint in public sector and in managed service providers, who use it as an integrated billing and analytics platform for all of their downstream customers. And so it expands our reach into the marketplace.
With regard to cloud operating margin, today, we don't break out operating margins. I would just tell you that we are a highly leveraged operating model for the company. If you look at the first half of this year, more than 50% of total revenue growth fell to the bottom line. We see the opportunity in cloud to be a fast-growing, high gross margin opportunity, and we are going to invest to capture that, but we are doing so while continuing to drive the operating margin profile of the total company. So I'm excited about the possibilities ahead and the continued increase in margin-rich software and cloud services in our portfolio. Mike, do you have anything else?"

The other thing we've talked about is yes, the route-to-market and the hyperscaler sales channel certainly helps. We also have our own sales team as well. They will get more and more efficient, especially as we build up that customer success team.

The first is technology certification and workload expansion. So we work with the cloud providers to qualify more and more and more workloads that can be best served using our technology. An example that I cited recently is the VMware cloud in Google now being certified to use NetApp Cloud Volumes as a primary data store, which has enormous benefits to VMware customers of NetApp and VMware to be able to now expand to the cloud as well as new customers that want to deploy mission-critical environments on the VMware cloud, right? So that's one, workload certifications and expansions.
The second is additional regions and enablement for the go-to-market engines. You've seen us grow the Azure NetApp Files business steadily and very successfully over a period of time. Amazon and Google are behind that, but we know the recipe, and we're working to scale that. And then finally, cross-selling and upselling a customer once they get on our service, dollar-based net retention rate is a very healthy 179%. It's early days in our customer base. So over time, that should come down, but it shows that once a customer uses one of our services, they expand dramatically, and then we get to sell them a portfolio of more services. 
So lots of ways to grow our cloud business ahead. We're super excited. And we worked really, really hard to get here, and we're going to capitalize on the opportunity."

I think we have said for a long time that mid-range systems with clustering software will cannibalize the high-end frame array business of some of our competitors. And you are seeing that play out. The mid-range systems offer the sweet spot from a price performance standpoint for customers. And with clustering, you can build enormously large environment to consolidate a range of different workloads, and we expect that trend to continue going forward. The days of the frame array are over, to be completely transparent. And so we'll continue to see that trend going on over time. 
With regard to how these -- within our business, all-flash arrays will have an important and growing part of the customer's data center. Hybrid flash arrays will continue to have a long-term position in the data center. So today, in our installed base, for example, all-flash is about 30% of the installed base. We expect, as more flash technologies come to play, that number to grow to about 70% over time. I think, however, we do not subscribe to the theory that hard disk drives no longer have value. They will have enduring value for certain sets of workloads that they are built for, capacity-oriented workloads, backup and archival media retention, images, things like that. So we feel good about our position in the market.

Those have been our long-term perspective on how business architectures and technology architectures evolve. That has certainly come sharper into focus with COVID, but they have always been part of the long-term road map of our customers.

Within the enterprise storage environment, we've always believed that flash will have a growing part of the customer data center as the economics of flash and the ability to consolidate and simplify your data center environment grows. That being said, there are workloads like I've mentioned earlier in the call that we'll continue to stay on hard drives.

We're all dealing with that. So I do expect that you'll continue to hear folks talk about doing price increases. I think a lot of this depends on how long we're in this situation. Again, from a NetApp perspective, we've looked at that. We have implemented a price increase, and we do expect that to start to have an impact later in our fiscal year. I would expect to continue to see that across our competitors. But again, I don't want to speak for them. I think a lot of this depends on how long this short supply chain shortage last and as well our component manufacturers, how they approach the market as well."

We did guide for free cash flow, $1.2 billion or greater. So let's do operating cash first. That would imply full year operating cash of, call it, $1.425 billion. To your point, we've already generated $540 million. So what you saw in Q2 was a record for us, low DSOs. 
We had a great collections quarter in Q2, that did pull forward some collections into Q2. So as we look at the second half of '22, you should expect to see the seasonality, as you called it, be a little bit lower in the second half because of the really strong Q2, still getting to at least that $1.4 billion operating cash number.
As on your question about supply chain, we have baked in an assumption that we'll continue to invest in inventory. You saw that our inventory turns went from 17 in Q1 to 13 in Q2. That was planned. We talked about that with you folks as well for the last couple of quarters. So -- and we have baked that into our assumption. Going forward, I think you should expect to see kind of the seasonal averages return. Again, it was just in a very, very good Q2 from a collections perspective, and I wouldn't expect that to continue into the future. So again, thanks for that question. Hopefully, that answers your question."

Keep in mind that on a year-to-date basis, right around 12% to 13% growth. That number is going to jump around a little bit each quarter based on the dynamics of deferred revenue as well as FX as well. So we calculate billings as net revenue in the quarter and then quarter-over-quarter change in deferred, excluding the impact of FX in deferred. So that's going to move the numbers a little bit. There's a little bit of seasonality to that.
So looking forward, we would expect to continue to see billings overall, grow at or above the revenue number. And again, I would encourage you, take a look at the year-to-date number or the trailing 12 months. Billings will jump around a little bit based on the components of our billings. Mix matters as well as seasonality."

As you might know, we run a semiannual plan. And so we had a strong Q2, and we'll have a strong Q4. So that reflects the seasonality in our business, driven by our compensation planning as well as customer buying through the year.
I think with regard to margins, I'll have Mike cover that in terms of the supply chain and the margin profile. I would just tell you we do not expect a near-term resolution of the supply situation. What we have seen through excellent execution with our teams and our partners is that component costs for the full year are largely flat year-on-year. There are some elements of the components that are up year-on-year and others that are down year-on-year. But as we have said before, component costs are largely flat on a year-on-year basis.
I think what we see is really the expedite and freight costs that are at a premium now. And that is reflected in the pricing lift that we have implemented at the start of November and which will take some time to flow through our systems. I'll let Mike characterize."

As we look at Q4 versus Q3, to George's point, always our seasonally high quarter. We're doing a lot of work, not only in supply chain, but in engineering and other things to make sure that we can deliver as much as we can in Q4 and then certainly, the price increase, it will take a little bit of time to work its way through the system.

These are $1 trillion corporations with enormous impact on the IT market, and we are honored to work with both of them.

I think the overall opportunity set reflects their scale in the market, right? So Amazon has massive market presence and market share. 
I think in the file space, they are a very large part of the files market. So the fact that we have a play with them, gives us enormous scale into the file storage market. I think we are -- from an execution standpoint, listen, we've learned a lot over the last few years. We know what it takes to scale a business. And we've done that in partnership with Microsoft. We continue to scale that with innovation and co-engineering and go-to-market. But we are also taking some of those lessons learned into how we can scale other services more quickly. 
With regard to the $1 billion plan, listen, we always believed that we would be working with multiple hyperscalers.

We will continue to do that going forward, very much focused not only on where we need to invest, but what is that return. That's why we're so focused on cloud as well as incremental sales and product development. So you should expect to see us continue to invest going forward.
Now outside of OpEx, we've talked about it before.
