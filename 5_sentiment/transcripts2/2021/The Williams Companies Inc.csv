And thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to share the results of a very strong fourth quarter, rounding out a year of record business performance for Williams but yet again, illustrates the stability and predictability of our business. So starting here with Slide 1.
First of all, I'm thrilled to announce that our EBITDA once again exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance range for the fourth consecutive year and resulted in a 4% CAGR for the same 4-year period. And that also during the same period, we dramatically improved our credit metrics through our asset sale program. So really a nice, steady period here of very predictable growth and balance sheet improvement.
This unmatched predictability is important to our value proposition and is further reinforced by this being the 20th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding Street expectations. We also met or exceeded all of our other key financial metrics, allowing us to once again produce positive free cash flow even after buying the outstanding interest in Cayman 2 that controls Blue Racer Midstream in the fourth quarter.
Our focus on continuously improving our project execution, our operating margin ratio, reliability metrics and safety performance delivered strong financial performance again in 2020 and allowed us to yet again achieve record gas gathering volumes and contracted gas transmission capacity. And all of these steady improvements and accomplishments build off of a clear foundational strategy that allows us to stay focused and aligned across the organization.
We demonstrated incredible business resiliency in a year of unprecedented challenges for our industry and our country. Our strong results in 2020 show just how durable this business can be against several headwinds such as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated oil price collapse, major customer bankruptcies and an active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico that exceeded anything from an outage standpoint that we had on record. This tumultuous 2020 market environment allowed us to truly distinguish ourselves. In fact, we were one of the few Midstream companies to maintain and, in fact, deliver on our pre-COVID guidance ranges that we provided to you in 2019. And I'm excited to see what this organization can produce without the large number of headwinds that we navigated through this past year in '21.
Moving on here. In addition to executing on our business in 2020, we accelerated our ESG performance. Last summer, Williams became the first U.S. Midstream company to announce a climate commitment. Setting an emissions reduction goal for 2030 that is based on real achievable targets and that imposes accountability on management team that's setting these goals. We believe that focusing on the right here and right now opportunity sets us on a positive trajectory to achieving net 0 target by 2050.
In addition, we co-led an industry effort to standardize ESG metrics with the Energy Infrastructure Council. And in January, we hosted the industry's first ever ESG event specifically devoted to sharing the company's direction, goals, aspirations and tangible accomplishments related to ESG performance.
In summary, in 2020, we once again, demonstrated the stability and predictability of our business and importantly, we've also shown the ability to focus and execute our plan without being distracted by the challenging macro backdrop.
And with that, I'll turn it over to John to go through the details."

At a very high-level summary for the quarter, our cost reduction efforts, new transco projects brought into service, incredibly strong results out of our Northeast G&P segment, and a catch-up of minimum volume commitment EBITDA from a favorable warm center south and bankruptcy settlement, helped to offset a decline in profits from deferred revenue step-downs at our Gulfstar deepwater platform, along with shut-ins from hurricane activities early during the fourth quarter of 2020.
As you can see, the strong performance in our statistics on this page, in fact, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics, both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $52 million or 4% for all of the reasons I just mentioned. The same played out in our year-to-date results. Adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was up $90 million or 2%. However, I think it's interesting to point out that if you adjust for noncash to deferred revenue step-downs at our Gulfstar platform and at our Barnett gathering system, both of which were known and expected, as well as a few other smaller noncash items, our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA without these noncash comparability items is actually up 4%, again, much like it was during the fourth quarter. We'll discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 29%, largely due to increased EBITDA and reduced income tax as we're during the fourth quarter of '19, there were -- there was a larger-than-normal state tax adjustment. And also to a certain extent, lesser interest expense this year. Our year-to-date EPS is also up 11%, again, due to increased EBITDA, lower allocations of income to noncontrolling interest owners, and again, to a lesser extent, due to lower interest expense.
This quarter, we're presenting a new cash flow metric, and we'll continue to present this going forward. The measure is available funds from operations. This measure will replace distributable cash flow, and is similar to DCF, except it's derived from cash from operations and is before all capital spending, including before maintenance capital. Or said differently, AFFO is simply cash from operations adjusting out working capital fluctuations and also adjusting for cash flows from or 2, our noncontrolling interest owners that shows up in the financing section of our cash flow statement. A reconciliation of this measure of the cash from operations can be found in the appendix of this presentation and also in our analyst package. You can see the ASFO grew for both the fourth quarter and year-to-date, similar to the growth in adjusted EBITDA, except some of the EBITDA growth is from our consolidated JVs. And so some of that growth as belong and does flow to our JV owners.
Distributable cash flow increased for the quarter due to higher EBITDA and also due to a $42 million alternative minimum tax refund we received during the quarter that was not present in the 2019 period. DCF for the year is also up again due to higher EBITDA and lower maintenance capital offset somewhat by increased EBITDA paid to our noncontrolling interest owners and due to lower alternative minimum tax cash refunds that we received for overall in 2020 versus 2019.
On the capital spending front, our intentional capital discipline drove capital spending down this year and free cash flow up. And to that point, our total capital spending for the year was 40% less than last year. And that our spending this year included the acquisition of most of the remaining interest in the Cayman 2 Blue Racer ownership for about $160 million in mid-November. As a result of that acquisition, we are now a 50% owner of blue racer with first reserve owning the other 50% interest, and we're excited to see what synergies we can bring to that business now that we have a larger stake and we're the operator.
Included in this capital spending number is also maintenance capital, which for the year was $393 million, about $107 million less than it was in 2019. Finally, if you put our AFFO in 2020 of $3.6 billion, up against our total capital spending, including maintenance of $1.5 billion and our dividend of $1.9 billion, you can see that we were free cash flow positive in 2020. This strong cash generation and capital discipline has helped move us towards our goal to improve our leverage metrics for the year. And this year, our debt-to-EBITDA metrics ended at 4.35x, down from 4.39x at the end of 2019.
So now let's go to the next slide and dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. As you'll hear throughout each segment, cost control has been a big benefit this year. Before we dive in each segment, we believe it's important to isolate a few unusual items to make the numbers more comparable and reflective of the ongoing performance of the business. We've identified those unusual items, which are shown on this chart as noncash comparability items. Interestingly, for the quarter, they net to only $2 million, and they consist primarily of 2 things. The first is a $24 million reduction in noncash deferred revenue step down in our Transmission and Gulf of Mexico segment, on our deepwater Gulfstar platform. As a reminder, our deferred revenue, we received significant upfront cash payments several years ago from the deepwater producer but did not recognize revenue at that time. We have been amortizing the payments we previously received in the income over the last several years, and that amortization has been shrinking.
The second unusual item is a $20 million minimum volume commitment true-up entry that we made in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to our settlement with South and who agreed to pay us the MVCs they owed us for the year. This adjustment is for the first through the third quarter that we recorded in the fourth quarter. We had stopped recording those MVCs at the beginning of 2020 when South when originally filed bankruptcy.
So with or without those noncash items, our EBITDA was up over 4%. And our Transmission and Gulf of Mexico segment produced results that were $25 million better than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $17 million in revenues for the quarter, including the gateway project that came into service in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Hillabee Phase 2 project that came into service in the second quarter of 2020 and the Southeastern Trail project that we need to service during the fourth quarter of 2020. We also did have a little over $20 million in lower cost during the fourth quarter of '20 due to lower maintenance and lower labor expenses. Offsetting these positives was $10 million in lower Gulf of Mexico profit due to shut-ins resulting from hurricane activity occurring in October, which is unusual for hurricane activity this late in the year. The impact of the shed ins can be further seen in reduced deepwater gathering volumes, which were down about 13% quarter-over-quarter.
The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on very strong, producing record results and contributing $29 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 7% in the quarter, and processing volumes were up 9%. The volume growth was predominantly at our joint ventures in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019. And at our Marcellus South Supply Basin, where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads. As a result, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by a little over $20 million in the Northeast, which also includes the additional benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer, again, due to our increased ownership, which again was acquired in mid-November.
The Northeast also benefited from cost reduction efforts of about $9 million, much of which came from reduced labor costs. And then finally, on the West, our West segment was down about $8 million compared to 2019. But within that, revenues overall improved a little less than $2 million in the West. With increases coming from higher rates and net MVCs in the Eagle Ford Supply Basin due to the contract renegotiations that have been completed with Chesapeake in late 2019. And due to special payments received from our partner on OPPL for allowing them to pull volumes off of the system. These revenue increases were offset somewhat by lower deferred revenues in the Barnett shale, lower Haynesville revenues due to lower volumes and rate and slightly lower volumes in the Midcontinent and Rockies.
Despite revenues being up in total, gathered volumes for the West were down 8%. Interestingly, though, roughly 90% of that volume decline occurred in the Haynesville Eagle Ford and WAM center. And of note, each of these basins were impacted by a customer bankruptcy. And with the South and filing a reemergence filing a couple of weeks ago, all those bankruptcy should be resolved soon. Also of note, in 2 of those 3 basins where we saw a majority of our volumes decline, specifically in the Wamsutter and Eagle Ford, our revenues are protected by MVCs. So overall, the reduced volumes only had a small impact on revenues. And just as with our other segments, the West experienced lower cost of about $3 million as we keep a relentless focus on efficiencies and cost controls.
Now offsetting the higher revenues and lower costs in the West were commodity margins, which declined about $8 million, due in part to lower volumes and due to a contract commitment there. We also had the absence of a favorable property tax reimbursement that we received in the fourth quarter of 2019, that was $6 million, something that we'd received from a third-party compression provider. And we also had lower JV EBITDA in the fourth quarter of '20 of about $4 million, with most of that coming from lower OPPL profits. And again, though, our partner on OPPL Capes whole, as I mentioned a minute ago, reflected in our revenues.
Now moving to year-to-date results. Our year-to-date results showed growth of 1.8% in adjusted EBITDA, driven by many of the same factors affecting our fourth quarter growth. The Barnett and Gulfstar noncash deferred revenue step-downs totaled $109 million in 2020 versus 2019. While the net impact of commodity price fluctuations on our inventory line fill position, created an $8 million noncash reduction in EBITDA. So without those noncash comparability items, full year adjusted EBITDA results were actually up more like 4%, much like our fourth quarter results. And then looking at that by segment, the transmission of Gulf of Mexico assets delivered $41 million of growth with an uplift coming from expansion projects and expense reductions being offset somewhat by lower Gulf of Mexico volumes and the impact that has had on commodity margins in the T zone area. In the Gulf of Mexico, the total impact of shut-ins from COVID, hurricanes and the price collapse earlier in 2020 had about a negative $49 million impact to our EBITDA.
The Northeast is obviously a huge part of our growth this year, adding $194 million in EBITDA in 2020 versus the prior year. With the overall gathering volumes up 7% and incremental revenues being realized from processing, transportation and fractionation of gas and NGLS, while at the same time, we have been reducing costs.
And finally, in the West, it's off by $33 million, largely because of the Barnett MBC payments that ended in June of 2019 and lower Haynesville profits due to lower realized rates and being offset somewhat by reduced operating expenses in the West. Otherwise in the West, our gathered volumes were down about 4%, but they were largely offset by higher rates and the MVCs in the Eagle Ford due to the renegotiated contract with Chesapeake in December of 2019.
So again, all in all, despite a tough market and a tough hurricane season, we've had a really good year on the back of cost reductions, Northeast performance and new pipeline projects coming into service on Transco.
I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to discuss our 2021 guidance. Alan?"

Well, thanks, John, and now we're going to turn to our '21 EBITDA guidance metric. So I want to emphasize that we continue to expect the same level of supportive fundamentals underpinning our base business for '21. However, we do have more upside potential than we had in 2020 in this plan, due in part to upstream transactions that have the potential to drive incremental cash flows across our midstream assets in '21 and beyond, plus an emerging gas storage imbalance caused by the recent higher demand that will likely put a call on gas directed drilling here in '21 as well.
So we're providing our initial EBITDA guidance range of $5.05 billion to $5.35 billion, with the midpoint up 2% over last year, and we'll get to EBITDA drivers here in the second on what those specifics are, but let's go through the rest of the guidance here.
Our available funds from operations, or AFFO, as John described, which will now replace the DCF are expected to be within a range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, which translates to a per share range of $2.92 up to $3.16 per share. And importantly, even with a 2.5% increase in the dividend announced earlier in the year, we are still maintaining similar coverage on our dividend, whether looking at the DCF metric or AFFO metric, and this continues to really underscore the continued safety of our dividend.
Our growth CapEx of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion is expected to remain in line with 2020, and this includes known opportunistic upstream acquisitions in the Wamsutter Basin that will be immediately accretive to both credit metrics and earnings. And notably, we still expect to generate free cash flow after CapEx and dividend, which provide us financial flexibility.
And speaking of financial flexibility, we estimate ending the year with a leverage ratio of 4.25 but with the line of sight that we have currently to a targeted 4.2 objective as we have consistently overachieved on this metric, and I know a lot of you all follow that very closely. We continue to perform very well on that. And we think we've got a lot of things that could help drive us towards that 4.2 -- or getting to that 4.2 here in '21.
So looking at drivers of our '21 EBITDA guidance, we expect continued Northeast G&P growth from the base business and to a lesser extent, the bolt-on Blue Racer acquisition. In our Transmission and Gulf of Mexico business, we see Transco growth continuing to add stable EBITDA via the Southeastern Trails project that was just placed in service ahead of schedule at the end of the year. And we expect late year contributions to come from our Leidy South expansion, which is now under construction. And additionally, we expect a nice recovery in our Gulf of Mexico earnings this year due to less production outages from hurricane and the COVID-19 pandemic impacts.
Offsets to our EBITDA growth are driven primarily from lower NGL throughput on the jointly owned Overland Pass pipeline, lower earnings on our jointly owned Rocky Mountain Midstream business in the DJ Basin and lower gathering rates from our global resolution in the Haynesville with Chesapeake Energy. So these are partial offsets that we do already have built into our guidance. And of course, on that last note, a lot of potential upside to us coming in the Haynesville, both from a much healthier Chesapeake, well positioned to develop the Haynesville, which is very well positioned in this gas market as well as our ability to drive volumes on the upstream properties that we now control.
Our takeaway here is that our EBITDA is primarily driven by growth in the base business with upstream EBITDA accounting for less than 1% of this forecast. We purposely did not include a full year of the upstream EBITDA from these existing producing reserves because we fully intend to transact during the year in a way that allows us to enjoy midstream cash flow growth in '22 and beyond as we find the right partner to fully exploit the growth available in these high-value properties that we were able to pick up this past year. So we are in a very strong position now to ensure that this acreage is developed quickly and gets turned into fee-based growth on our existing midstream capacity. So we really are excited about the upside potential that we've positioned ourselves for around that business.
So in closing, I'll reiterate that intense focus on our natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued moderate growth, improving returns and free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes are in the right place, and our formidable gathering assets are in low-cost basis that will be called on to meet gas demands that continue to grow. We remain bullish on natural gas because we recognize the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon since fuels around the world.
Williams is focused on sustainable operations, including Ready Now solutions to address climate change and by setting a near-term goal for 2030, we will leverage our natural gas focused strategy and today's technologies to focus on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions in and around our business.
We also are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy network deliver on this next phase of energy transition. I also think it is important in light of last week's severe cold weather event to talk about the resiliency and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure. Despite historic cold that enveloped much of the country, Williams did not have -- we did not have to curtail any services to our gas transmission customers. And, in fact, operate above design capacity on our Northwest Pipeline system for a period and delivered flawlessly on a new record 3-day peak on the Northwest Pipeline system. Our customers expect this from us based on our long history of performance, and we are certainly glad that they do.
However, last week's weather demonstrated the importance of a comprehensive energy strategy of the need for a comprehensive energy strategy for the U.S. one that doesn't demonize 1 energy source over the other, but that includes the mix of energy that does not drive towards singular dependency because of labels imposed by the environmental opposition. And there are important and complex decisions that need to be balanced to address the things that we all want from our energy sources, reliability, affordability and balancing the issues of carbon intensity.
And when we think about carbon intensity, we really have to consider that from a global perspective. And we believe that when all of these factors are accurately weighed and balanced, natural gas will be a very critical part of the energy mix for many more decades to come.
So finally, I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of our entire workforce in ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to America cities and communities not only this last week in the face of severe weather challenges but amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those who benefit from our services may never realize the work needed to ensure the continued access to safe and reliable energy. Our employees are critical infrastructure workers on the front lines of keeping our country's natural gas system operating and flowing. Doing so while also enduring power outages and lack of water with their own home.
I am extremely proud of our employees for their efforts to keep our operations running smoothly during these extreme circumstances while also going the extra mile to keep themselves and their coworkers safe and healthy.
And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Well, first of all, I would say, we -- in our base business, we have about $900 million of capital in what would be our normal base business. So it is a little bit lower than what we've had historically. And that is about half of that is in Tigo. So that includes Haile. It includes building out light South kind of the final dollars on Southeastern Trails and cleanup and so forth on the Southeastern Trails. And some money on the front end of the REA project. So that's kind of the primary drivers there in Tom, that's about half of that 900.
And then on the balance of that, about 2/3 of that is into Northeast, both finishing up projects. As well as getting some new projects started that are driving higher margins for us in the Northeast and some of that growth. A lot of that investment actually will drive growth in '22 there in the Northeast as well.
And then finally, the balance of that is in the West, some of that is in the Permian, pretty good expansion going on in the Permian as well as in the Haynesville area as we're really going to be having to work hard to keep out front of a lot of drilling activity that's emerging there in the Haynesville. So that pretty well rounds that up.
The second part of your question around the opportunistic upstream involves us taking advantage of the strong position we had with our Midstream assets out there, particularly around the Southland bankruptcy. And we will be in the position of acquiring both the BP acreage out there that's adjacent and intermingled with that as well as Southland acreage and we're able, given our position in the bankruptcy there, we were able to pick that up for some very attractive pricing. And as a result now, we're going to be working to gain the right person, the right party to rapidly develop those reserves and take advantage of the latent Midstream capacity that we have out there. So we are really excited about that both in the Wamsutter because there's a tremendous amount of value to be driven across our Midstream assets by using the PDP cash flows to drive that. As well as in the Haynesville, where we're already seeing Chesapeake get very focused on developing the remaining -- the northern part of the Haynesville, to pay Hanono and as well some very attractive interest coming from parties that we're in a process to find the right party to develop the Haynesville acreage.
So I want to make it clear, we have no intention of hanging on to that. We're not going to become an E&P business. There is no if, ands or buts on that front. But this does allow us to put the right parties in place and assure ourselves that we have the right parties in place to take the cash flows off of these assets and put it back into the drill bit to drive Midstream cash flow. So really has turned into something actually a lot more positive than we were expecting. And we really feel like there's a lot of upside from this, both in '21 and as well to into '22 and beyond, as we attract the capital to develop those reserves. So really, what is normally an area that might have been a problem for us with all these bankruptcies, we really were able to find a way to really turn some lemons into lemonade there, and we're really excited about the kind of value that's going to be driven out there over the next several years."

So I'll touch on Chesapeake a second, but just know that they're very active up in the Springer, where they remain the owner-operator with 2 rigs, and we can likely go into 3 rigs. So that was good to see it in South Mansfield. We view that as an additional opportunity where we have 350 million to 550 million a day of capacity available from Midstream perspective for development in that area. We closed on that transaction prior to '21. And we've been out now talking to potential partners, and we've seen incredibly robust interest in this asset. It is a contiguous blocked up position in some really top-tier both Haynesville and mid Bossier area. And again, has available Midstream capacity. I would say that we're likely to finalize our partnership strategy over the next couple of months. I expect that we will have a very strong, well capitalized partner that will operate that asset and we'll dedicate 1 to 2 rigs at any given time to really fill up and utilize that capacity.

We really developed that plan before we've seen this recent call. And I think this week, we're going to see a huge pull on natural gas from storage this week. And likely take us down below the 5-year average. And meanwhile, production, we really haven't seen the activity in production to stabilize that decline in storage and the places that are going to be able to respond to that quickly are going to be Haynesville and the Marcellus and Utica. And so we didn't have any of that in our plans when we laid this plan out. So certainly, that is upside to this. In fact, most of the growth in the Northeast was really just margin expansion. It wasn't really a lot of volume -- expected volume growth. The growth that we've had there has really just been margin expansion. So that is certainly an attractive upside for us there. It is not based on the upstream at all. In fact, we basically assumed -- we just got the PDPs flowing in here for Haynesville and Wamsutter, assuming a July kind of finality to finding the right owners. So we only have cash flows in here on the Wamsutter area through about July.
And in the Haynesville, we do have the PDPs in there, but we also have development capital that likely would be coming out of there if that gets done. So I wouldn't be the first to admit that we've been very conservative on our -- on the upstream side of this because we really want to leave ourselves full flexibility, and we didn't -- to be able to either fully dispose of the asset if the right price was there. But at the end of the day, we just wanted to have full flexibility. So we were very conservative in how we included the value of those upstream positions. And you're right, I think the upsides are probably mostly related to volumes in the Northeast. But I would also say we remain pretty conservative in the forecast that we have for the deepwater and any other area, frankly, that can contribute from a gas side. So -- and then I would say the other area that we've included, we have assumed rising cost versus 2020, we did a great job in 2020 on cost and our '21 does assume that we've got some come back on costs that, frankly, the team has just been doing a terrific job in managing and so that's another area of opportunity for us as well."

We had all that hurricane activity in 2020 and our team reversed most of that in the forecast, but not all of that. We do expect that to be a little bit more active in '21. And so if that doesn't happen, I think there's upside of some additional EBITDA, just some additional EBITDA we didn't put in that was left and that's just conservative for hurricane activity.

And obviously, Transco is designed to flow from that area designed to flow to the North and East, not back in Texas.
In terms of the impact to us, I would say it was pretty small in terms of the impact of our gathering volumes just because we have such a dispersed business and the vast majority of our gathering out is either Northeast or in the Rockies, which were not directly impacted. The -- but I would just say as well, our team did a great job of doing things like selling, fuel and Trent that we had bought at first of the month, turning down our processing recoveries and then selling that fuel and think back into the market. And so I would tell you that, I think net-net, it's going to be a little bit of a positive for us in terms of the way we manage things.

And to the degree that we have a line of sight for how that's going to happen, that's how we see it. And so far, they've been pretty accurate, consistently, pretty accurate in the way that they've been forecasting that. They know their reserves and they know the market. I will say that, obviously, excited about South coming on and opening up additional capacity, that's about 580 million a day of additional takeaway capacity out of the Northeast, and our team has got a really good head start on wide South on the projects there.

But I think you have to be careful about drawing that kind of conclusion. Most of the projects that we've been doing have been 6%. We still were rolling off a lot of deferred revenues this last year and a little bit into '21. So I think you have to be careful about making those kind of broad assumptions. So for instance, when the deepwater business comes on, that's going to be a very high-growth rate on a fairly low amount of capital and in the Northeast, sometimes, we get nice surges of margin based on very high incremental return opportunities as they come to us. And on the other hand, we have a decline built, that's just part of the gathering business. If there's an area that's not growing, there's a client that's working against it all time. But I would tell you that it's more complex than taking $1 billion in saying that, that produces 2%.
On the other thing, I would say, I think we feel very comfortable with a 2% growth rate. If we are investing $1 billion, we feel very comfortable with achieving 2% growth rate. But given some of the upside that we've got in some of these areas, I think that probably would be kind of considered a floor from my perspective on that. So we might talk about potential problems."

We look at that backlog, and it's really dynamic because we have a lot of projects that come into that backlog and that we execute on a lot of those projects. And Southeasten Trail's on that came out of the backlog, like South came out of that backlog and became an execution project and regional energy access will be the same once we get that filing underway, they are permitting underway. So you'll continue to see projects come out of our backlog and move it into the execution phase over the next several years. There's a plethora of opportunities along the Transco corridor to take advantage of coal-fired generation that's going to come offline and ultimately be converted to gas and renewables. And I think from the activities we've seen in Texas and Oklahoma over the last week, there definitely needs to be a mixture of energy generation resources in the mix in order to diversify across fuel sources. And so I'm a true believer of that. Our company is definitely a natural gas focused company now adding in some renewable mix into the play there to take advantage of some opportunities we have. But ultimately, on the Transco system, we're going to be able to drive a lot of new capital investment there on the back to coal fire generation going away.
And then lastly, our emissions reduction program project. We have upwards of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of investment opportunity there on the Transco system and likely replacing a large component of our reciprocating compression to do modern either electric drives or gas turbines to reduce our emissions footprint there along the Transco corridor. So there's definitely a lot of investment opportunity that we envision coming in the future for Transco's asset footprint."

And so that group has been an investor in that for a long time along with some of the management from Cayman 2. And obviously, they had held on to that much longer than a typical private equity shop likes to and we worked with them to liquidate them at the appropriate time. We think we bought it right and at the right time, and particularly given the large amount of synergies that we have available to extract from that business. And so we're excited about the transaction. I can tell you we were super patient. We've been wanting to gain control of that asset and exploit the synergies between both our UEOM system and our Ohio Valley River. We've been wanting to take advantage of those. And it's been hard to not, but we've been patient, and I think our patience paid off, and we're able to pick that up at a very attractive value. So that's kind of high off of that.

So on operating cost, and I want to drag you through some numbers here real, Michael. But if you look in our analyst package, and if you look at the operating costs in each of our segments and you compare 2019 to 2020, you'll see a number of a $223 million reduction in operating expense. But I want to be clear on that. 2019 had incremental expenses because we did a voluntary severance program, and we're cutting costs of 29 cost -- 2019 costs were elevated. 2020 costs were low because we changed the benefits program around days off. And anyway, it resulted in a $40 million benefit 2020 expense. I'm dragging you through all that to say that $223 million reduction in expenses on a normalized adjusted EBITDA basis is only $100 million reduction, $103 million reduction in expenses between 2019 and 2020, and that includes an $11 million increase in property and in operating taxes, taxes. And so we saved about $114 million between '19 and '20. We think about 70% of that will stick going into '21. So 30% of that revert. So we'll see costs go up by about $30 million, just due to operating costs kind of, that's not retaining all that savings. And then operating taxes probably good for another $20 million to $25 million. So you're looking at probably $50 million of total expense increases in '21. So a great job. We're retaining 70% of our cost savings."

And thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to share the results of a very strong fourth quarter, rounding out a year of record business performance for Williams but yet again, illustrates the stability and predictability of our business. So starting here with Slide 1.
First of all, I'm thrilled to announce that our EBITDA once again exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance range for the fourth consecutive year and resulted in a 4% CAGR for the same 4-year period and that also during the same period, we dramatically improved our credit metrics through our asset sale program. So really a nice, steady period here of very predictable growth and balance sheet improvement.
This unmatched predictability is important to our value proposition and is further reinforced by this being the 20th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding Street expectations. We also met or exceeded all of our other key financial metrics, allowing us to once again produce positive free cash flow even after buying the outstanding interest in Caiman II that controls Blue Racer Midstream in the fourth quarter.
Our focus on continuously improving our project execution, our operating margin ratio, reliability metrics and safety performance delivered strong financial performance again in 2020 and allowed us to yet again achieve record gas gathering volumes and contracted gas transmission capacity. And all of these steady improvements and accomplishments build off of a clear foundational strategy that allows us to stay focused and aligned across the organization.
We demonstrated incredible business resiliency in a year of unprecedented challenges for our industry and our country. Our strong results in 2020 show just how durable this business can be against several headwinds such as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated oil price collapse, major customer bankruptcies and an active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico that exceeded anything from an outage standpoint that we had on record.
This tumultuous 2020 market environment allowed us to truly distinguish ourselves. In fact, we were one of the few Midstream companies to maintain and in fact, deliver on our pre-COVID guidance ranges that we provided to you in 2019. And I'm excited to see what this organization can produce without the large number of headwinds that we navigated through this past year in '21.
Moving on here. In addition to executing on our business in 2020, we accelerated our ESG performance. Last summer, Williams became the first U.S. Midstream company to announce a climate commitment, setting an emissions reduction goal for 2030 that is based on real achievable targets and that imposes accountability on the management team that's setting these goals. We believe that focusing on the right here and right now opportunity sets us on a positive trajectory to achieving net zero target by 2050.
In addition, we co-led an industry effort to standardize ESG metrics with the Energy Infrastructure Council. And in January, we hosted the industry's first ever ESG event specifically devoted to sharing the company's direction, goals, aspirations and tangible accomplishments related to ESG performance.
In summary, in 2020, we once again demonstrated the stability and predictability of our business and importantly, we've also shown the ability to focus and execute our plan without being distracted by the challenging macro backdrop.
And with that, I'll turn it over to John to go through the details."

At a very high-level summary for the quarter, our cost reduction efforts, new Transco projects brought into service, incredibly strong results out of our Northeast G&P segment and a catch-up of minimum volume commitment EBITDA from a favorable Wamsutter-Southland bankruptcy settlement helped to offset a decline in profits from deferred revenue step-downs at our Gulfstar deepwater platform, along with shut-ins from hurricane activities early during the fourth quarter of 2020.
As you can see the strong performance in our statistics on this page, in fact, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics, both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $52 million or 4% for all of the reasons I just mentioned. The same played out in our year-to-date results. Adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was up $90 million or 2%.
However, I think it's interesting to point out that if you adjust for noncash to deferred revenue step-downs at our Gulfstar platform and at our Barnett gathering system, both of which were known and expected, as well as a few other smaller noncash items, our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA without these noncash comparability items is actually up 4%, again, much like it was during the fourth quarter. We'll discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 29%, largely due to increased EBITDA and reduced income taxes that were due in the fourth quarter of '19. There were -- there was a larger-than-normal state tax adjustment and also, to a certain extent, lesser interest expense this year. Our year-to-date EPS is also up 11%, again, due to increased EBITDA, lower allocations of income to noncontrolling interest owners, and again, to a lesser extent, due to lower interest expense.
This quarter, we're presenting a new cash flow metric, and we'll continue to present this going forward. The measure is available funds from operations. This measure will replace distributable cash flow and is similar to DCF, except it's derived from cash from operations and is before all capital spending, including before maintenance capital. Or said differently, AFFO is simply cash from operations, adjusting out working capital fluctuations and also adjusting for cash flows from or to our noncontrolling interest owners that shows up in the financing section of our cash flow statement.
A reconciliation of this measure of the cash from operations can be found in the appendix of this presentation and also in our analyst package. You can see the AFFO grew for both the fourth quarter and year-to-date, similar to the growth in adjusted EBITDA, except some of the EBITDA growth is from our consolidated JVs. And so some of that growth does belong and does flow to our JV owners.
Distributable cash flow increased for the quarter due to higher EBITDA and also due to a $42 million alternative minimum tax refund we received during the quarter that was not present in the 2019 period. DCF for the year is also up again due to higher EBITDA and lower maintenance capital offset somewhat by increased EBITDA paid to our noncontrolling interest owners and due to lower alternative minimum tax cash refunds that we received for overall in 2020 versus 2019.
On the capital spending front, our intentional capital discipline drove capital spending down this year and free cash flow up. And to that point, our total capital spending for the year was 40% less than last year and that our spending this year included the acquisition of most of the remaining interest in the Caiman II Blue Racer ownership for about $160 million in mid-November. As a result of that acquisition, we are now a 50% owner of Blue Racer with First Reserve owning the other 50% interest, and we're excited to see what synergies we can bring to that business now that we have a larger stake and we're the operator.
Included in this capital spending number is also maintenance capital, which for the year was $393 million, about $107 million less than it was in 2019. Finally, if you put our AFFO in 2020 of $3.6 billion, up against our total capital spending, including maintenance of $1.5 billion and our dividend of $1.9 billion, you can see that we were free cash flow positive in 2020. This strong cash generation and capital discipline has helped move us towards our goal to improve our leverage metrics for the year. And this year, our debt-to-EBITDA metrics ended at 4.35x, down from 4.39x at the end of 2019.
So now let's go to the next slide and dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. As you'll hear throughout each segment, cost control has been a big benefit this year. Before we dive in each segment, we believe it's important to isolate a few unusual items to make the numbers more comparable and reflective of the ongoing performance of the business.
We've identified those unusual items, which are shown on this chart as noncash comparability items. Interestingly, for the quarter, they net to only $2 million, and they consist primarily of 2 things. The first is a $24 million reduction in noncash deferred revenue step down in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment on our deepwater Gulfstar platform.
As a reminder, our deferred revenue, we received significant upfront cash payments several years ago from the deepwater producer but did not recognize revenue at that time. We have been amortizing the payments we previously received in the income over the last several years and that amortization has been shrinking.
The second unusual item is a $20 million minimum volume commitment true-up entry that we made in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to our settlement with Southland who agreed to pay us the MVCs they owed us for the year. This adjustment is for the first through the third quarter that we recorded in the fourth quarter. We had stopped recording those MVCs at the beginning of 2020 when Southland originally filed for bankruptcy.
So with or without those noncash items, our EBITDA was up over 4%. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment produced results that were $25 million better than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $17 million in revenues for the quarter, including the Gateway project that came into service in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Hillabee Phase 2 project that came into service in the second quarter of 2020 and the Southeastern Trail project that we need to service during the fourth quarter of 2020.
We also did have a little over $20 million in lower cost during the fourth quarter of '20 due to lower maintenance and lower labor expenses. Offsetting these positives was $10 million in lower Gulf of Mexico profit due to shut-ins resulting from hurricane activity occurring in October, which is unusual for hurricane activity this late in the year. The impact of the shut-ins can be further seen in reduced deepwater gathering volumes, which were down about 13% quarter-over-quarter.
The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on very strong, producing record results and contributing $29 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 7% in the quarter and processing volumes were up 9%. The volume growth was predominantly at our joint ventures in the Bradford Supply Hub where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019 and at our Marcellus South supply basin where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads.
As a result, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by a little over $20 million in the Northeast, which also includes the additional benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer, again, due to our increased ownership, which again was acquired in mid-November. The Northeast also benefited from cost reduction efforts of about $9 million, much of which came from reduced labor costs.
And then finally, on the West, our West segment was down about $8 million compared to 2019. But within that, revenues overall improved a little less than $2 million in the West, with increases coming from higher rates and net MVCs in the Eagle Ford supply basin due to the contract renegotiations that have been completed with Chesapeake in late 2019 and due to special payments received from our partner on OPPL for allowing them to pull volumes off of the system. These revenue increases were offset somewhat by lower deferred revenues in the Barnett shale, lower Haynesville revenues due to lower volumes and rate and slightly lower volumes in the Midcontinent and Rockies.
Despite revenues being up in total, gathered volumes for the West were down 8%. Interestingly though, roughly 90% of that volume decline occurred in the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Wamsutter. And of note, each of these basins were impacted by a customer bankruptcy. And with the Southland filing a reemergence filing a couple of weeks ago, all those bankruptcies should be resolved soon.
Also of note, in 2 of those 3 basins where we saw a majority of our volumes decline, specifically in the Wamsutter and Eagle Ford, our revenues are protected by MVCs. So overall, the reduced volumes only had a small impact on revenues. And just as with our other segments, the West experienced lower cost of about $3 million as we keep a relentless focus on efficiencies and cost controls.
Now offsetting the higher revenues and lower costs in the West were commodity margins, which declined about $8 million due in part to lower volumes and due to a contract commitment there. We also had the absence of a favorable property tax reimbursement that we received in the fourth quarter of 2019 that was $6 million and was something that we had received from a third-party compression provider. And we also had lower JV EBITDA in the fourth quarter of '20 of about $4 million with most of that coming from lower OPPL profits. And again, though, our partner on OPPL [ kept us whole ], as I mentioned a minute ago, reflected in our revenues.
Now moving to year-to-date results. Our year-to-date results showed growth of 1.8% in adjusted EBITDA, driven by many of the same factors affecting our fourth quarter growth. The Barnett and Gulfstar noncash deferred revenue step-downs totaled $109 million in 2020 versus 2019. While the net impact of commodity price fluctuations on our inventory line fill position created an $8 million noncash reduction in EBITDA.
So without those noncash comparability items, full year adjusted EBITDA results were actually up more like 4%, much like our fourth quarter results. And then looking at that by segment, the Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets delivered $41 million of growth with an uplift coming from expansion projects and expense reductions being offset somewhat by lower Gulf of Mexico volumes and the impact that has had on commodity margins in the TGOM area. In the Gulf of Mexico, the total impact of shut-ins from COVID, hurricanes and the price collapse earlier in 2020 had about a negative $49 million impact to our EBITDA.
The Northeast is obviously a huge part of our growth this year adding $194 million in EBITDA in 2020 versus the prior year with the overall gathering volumes up 7% and incremental revenues being realized from processing, transportation and fractionation of gas and NGLS, while at the same time, we have been reducing costs.
And finally, in the West, it's off by $33 million, largely because of the Barnett MVC payments that ended in June of 2019 and lower Haynesville profits due to lower realized rates being offset somewhat by reduced operating expenses in the West. Otherwise, in the West, our gathered volumes were down about 4%, but they were largely offset by higher rates and the MVCs in the Eagle Ford due to the renegotiated contract with Chesapeake in December of 2019.
So again, all in all, despite a tough market and a tough hurricane season, we've had a really good year on the back of cost reductions, Northeast performance and new pipeline projects coming into service on Transco. I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to discuss our 2021 guidance. Alan?"

Well, thanks, John, and now we're going to turn to our '21 EBITDA guidance metric. So I want to emphasize that we continue to expect the same level of supportive fundamentals underpinning our base business for '21. However, we do have more upside potential than we had in 2020 in this plan due in part to upstream transactions that have the potential to drive incremental cash flows across our Midstream assets in '21 and beyond plus an emerging gas storage imbalance caused by the recent higher demand that will likely put a call on gas-directed drilling here in '21 as well.
So we're providing our initial EBITDA guidance range of $5.05 billion to $5.35 billion with the midpoint up 2% over last year. And we'll get to EBITDA drivers here in just a second on what those specifics are, but let's go through the rest of the guidance here.
Our available funds from operations or AFFO, as John described, which will now replace the DCF, are expected to be within a range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, which translates to a per share range of $2.92 up to $3.16 per share. And importantly, even with a 2.5% increase in the dividend announced earlier in the year, we are still maintaining similar coverage on our dividend, whether looking at the DCF metric or AFFO metric, and this continues to really underscore the continued safety of our dividend.
Our growth CapEx of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion is expected to remain in line with 2020, and this includes known opportunistic upstream acquisitions in the Wamsutter basin that will be immediately accretive to both credit metrics and earnings. And notably, we still expect to generate free cash flow after CapEx and dividend, which provide us financial flexibility.
And speaking of financial flexibility, we estimate ending the year with a leverage ratio of 4.25, but with the line of sight that we have currently, to a targeted 4.2 objective as we have consistently overachieved on this metric, and I know a lot of you all follow that very closely. We continue to perform very well on that. And we think we've got a lot of things that could help drive us towards that 4.2 -- or getting to that 4.2 here in '21.
So looking at drivers of our '21 EBITDA guidance, we expect continued Northeast G&P growth from the base business and to a lesser extent, the bolt-on Blue Racer acquisition. In our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business, we see Transco growth continuing to add stable EBITDA via the Southeastern Trails project that was just placed in service ahead of schedule at the end of the year. And we expect late year contributions to come from our Leidy South expansion, which is now under construction. And additionally, we expect a nice recovery in our Gulf of Mexico earnings this year due to less production outages from hurricane and the COVID-19 pandemic impacts.
Offsets to our EBITDA growth are driven primarily from lower NGL throughput on the jointly owned Overland Pass Pipeline, lower earnings on our jointly owned Rocky Mountain Midstream business in the DJ Basin and lower gathering rates from our global resolution in the Haynesville with Chesapeake Energy. So these are partial offsets that we do already have built into our guidance. And of course, on that last note, a lot of potential upside to us coming in the Haynesville, both from a much healthier Chesapeake, well positioned to develop the Haynesville, which is very well positioned in this gas market as well as our ability to drive volumes on the upstream properties that we now control.
Our takeaway here is that our EBITDA is primarily driven by growth in the base business with upstream EBITDA accounting for less than 1% of this forecast. We purposely did not include a full year of the upstream EBITDA from these existing producing reserves because we fully intend to transact during the year in a way that allows us to enjoy midstream cash flow growth in '22 and beyond as we find the right partner to fully exploit the growth available in these high-value properties that we were able to pick up this past year.
So we are in a very strong position now to ensure that this acreage is developed quickly and gets turned into fee-based growth on our existing Midstream capacity. So we really are excited about the upside potential that we've positioned ourselves for around that business.
So in closing, I'll reiterate that intense focus on our natural gas based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued moderate growth, improving returns and free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes are in the right place, and our formidable gathering assets are in low-cost basis that will be called on to meet gas demands that continue to grow.
We remain bullish on natural gas because we recognize the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world.
Williams is focused on sustainable operations, including ready-now solutions to address climate change. And by setting a near-term goal for 2030, we will leverage our natural gas focused strategy and today's technologies to focus on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions in and around our business. We also are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy network to deliver on this next phase of energy transition.
I also think it is important in light of last week's severe cold weather event to talk about the resiliency and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure. Despite historic cold that enveloped much of the country, Williams did not have -- we did not have to curtail any services to our gas transmission customers. And in fact, operate above design capacity on our Northwest Pipeline system for a period and delivered flawlessly on a new record 3-day peak on the Northwest Pipeline system. Our customers expect this from us based on our long history of performance, and we are certainly glad that they do.
However, last week's weather demonstrated the importance of a comprehensive energy strategy of -- the need for a comprehensive energy strategy for the U.S., one that doesn't demonize one energy source over the other but that includes the mix of energy that does not drive towards singular dependency because of labels imposed by the environmental opposition. And there are important and complex decisions that need to be [ balanced ] to address the things that we all want from our energy sources, reliability, affordability and balancing the issues of carbon intensity.
And when we think about carbon intensity, we really have to consider that from a global perspective. And we believe that when all of these factors are accurately weighed and balanced, natural gas will be a very critical part of the energy mix for many more decades to come.
So finally, I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of our entire workforce in ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to America's cities and communities not only this last week in the face of severe weather challenges but amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those who benefit from our services may never realize the work needed to ensure the continued access to safe and reliable energy. Our employees are critical infrastructure workers on the front lines of keeping our country's natural gas system operating and flowing, doing so while also enduring power outages and lack of water with their own homes.
I am extremely proud of our employees for their efforts to keep our operations running smoothly during these extreme circumstances while also going the extra mile to keep themselves and their coworkers safe and healthy.
And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Well, first of all, I would say, we -- in our base business, we have about $900 million of capital in what would be our normal base business. So it is a little bit lower than what we've had historically. And that is -- about half of that is in TGOM. So that includes Whale. It includes building out Leidy South, kind of the final dollars on Southeastern Trails and cleanup and so forth on the Southeastern Trails and some money on the front end of the REA project. So that's kind of the primary drivers there in TGOM, that's about half of that $900 million.
And then on the balance of that, about 2/3 of that is into Northeast, both finishing up projects as well as getting some new projects started that are driving higher margins for us in the Northeast and some of that growth. A lot of that investment actually will drive growth in '22 there in the Northeast as well.
And then finally, the balance of that is in the West, some of that is in the Permian, pretty good expansion going on in the Permian as well as in the Haynesville area as we're really going to be having to work hard to keep out [ front of a lot ] the drilling activity that's emerging there in the Haynesville. So that pretty well rounds that up.
The second part of your question around the opportunistic upstream involves us taking advantage of the strong position we had with our Midstream assets out there, particularly around the Southland bankruptcy. And we will be in the position of acquiring both the BP acreage out there that's adjacent and intermingled with that as well as the Southland acreage.
And we're able, given our position in the bankruptcy there, we were able to pick that up for some very attractive pricing. And as a result now, we're going to be working to gain the right person, the right party to rapidly develop those reserves and take advantage of the latent Midstream capacity that we have out there.
So we are really excited about that both in the Wamsutter because there's a tremendous amount of value to be driven across our Midstream assets by using the PDP cash flows to drive that as well as in the Haynesville, where we're already seeing Chesapeake get very focused on developing the remaining -- the northern part of the Haynesville [indiscernible] to -- and as well some very attractive interest coming from parties that we're in a process to find the right party to develop the Haynesville acreage.
So I want to make it clear, we have no intention of hanging on to that. We're not going to become an E&P business. There is no if, ands or buts on that front. But this does allow us to put the right parties in place and assure ourselves that we have the right parties in place to take the cash flows off of these assets and put it back into the drill bit to drive Midstream cash flow.
So really has turned into something actually a lot more positive than we were expecting. And we really feel like there's a lot of upside from this, both in '21 and as well though into '22 and beyond as we attract the capital to develop those reserves. So really, what is normally an area that might have been a problem for us with all these bankruptcies, we really were able to find a way to really turn some lemons into lemonade there, and we're really excited about the kind of value that's going to be driven out there over the next several years."

And so Alan mentioned a run rate for everything other than that of $900 million, maybe a little bit more than $900 million.
So we paid less than $200 million for those assets, actually significantly less than $200 million, more to the tune of 150 to 160-point for that acreage. Then we have very little EBITDA in our guidance for that because we're not sure exactly what kind of partnership structure we'll have. Or somebody will just buy us out of that acreage, will we partner and so EBITDA uplift. So there's a lot of big upside, I think, that we can see out of that."

So I'll touch on South Mansfield in a second, but just know that they're very active up in the Springridge area, where they remain the owner-operator with 2 rigs and we can likely go into 3 rigs. So that was good to see.
In South Mansfield, we view that as an additional opportunity where we have 350 million to 550 million a day of capacity available from a Midstream perspective for development in that area. We closed on that transaction prior to '21. And we've been out now talking to potential partners, and we've seen incredibly robust interest in this asset. It is a contiguous blocked up position in some really top-tier both Haynesville and Mid-Bossier area and again, has available Midstream capacity.
I would say that we're likely to finalize our partnership strategy over the next couple of months. I expect that we will have a very strong, well-capitalized partner that will operate that asset, and we'll dedicate 1 to 2 rigs at any given time to really fill up and utilize that capacity.

We really developed that plan before we've seen this recent call. And I think this week, we're going to see a huge pull on natural gas from storage this week and likely take us down below the 5-year average.
And meanwhile, production, we really haven't seen the activity in production to stabilize that decline in storage. And the places that are going to be able to respond to that quickly are going to be Haynesville and the Marcellus and Utica. And so we didn't have any of that in our plans when we laid this plan out. So certainly, that is upside to this.
In fact, most of the growth in the Northeast was really just margin expansion. It wasn't really a lot of volume -- expected volume growth. The growth that we've had there has really just been margin expansion.
So that is certainly an attractive upside for us there. It is not based on the Upstream at all. In fact, we basically assumed -- we just got the PDPs flowing in here for Haynesville and Wamsutter, assuming a July kind of finality to finding the right owners. So we only have cash flows in here on the Wamsutter area through about July.
And in the Haynesville, we do have the PDPs in there, but we also have development capital that likely would be coming out of there if that gets done. So I wouldn't be the first to admit that we've been very conservative on our -- on the Upstream side of this because we really want to leave ourselves full flexibility, and we didn't -- to be able to either fully dispose of the asset if the right price was there. But at the end of the day, we just wanted to have full flexibility. So we were very conservative in how we included the value of those Upstream positions.
And you're right, I think the upsides are probably mostly related to volumes in the Northeast. But I would also say we remain pretty conservative in the forecast that we have for the deepwater and any other area, frankly, that can contribute from a gas side.
So -- and then I would say the other area that we've included, we have assumed rising cost versus 2020. We did a great job in 2020 on cost and our '21 does assume that we've got some come back on costs that, frankly, the team has just been doing a terrific job in managing.

We're seeing natural gas prices stronger than they were a year ago.
We do think that there will be basis that we'll continue to represent the value of our existing infrastructure. We're going to see some more LNG demand to come online this year, and we're going to continue to see the need for growth of supply out of the Northeast.
So I'm not sure we'll see basis that will drive shut in activity, but I think it will continue to reinforce the value having infrastructure to move -- broaden Appalachia to growing markets, but we'll certainly keep an eye on it."

I think we were -- as to the RMM impairment that we took, that's been an equity-level investment. So obviously, it's very different than along the way you value a consolidated asset, where you take the total cash flows on the asset over time. But in those, we actually have [ to mark it ] to market effectively. And we've given some of the sales that we've seen in the space, we've seen some lower markings on the value of assets, and that's what drives those kind of considerations.
And in fact, as a result of that, it would probably drive us in the other direction because it's basically saying there's a weak market right now for GDP assets. And if that's true, then this probably wouldn't be the right time to be liquidating assets.
So not to say we don't constantly have our eyes open to structure and things that can add value from that. But I think we're in a position of getting to our leverage metrics in a pretty straightforward manner, and particularly these upstream assets could be a really nice tool for that as well. And so right now, I can tell you, I'm not sure it's the very best time to be trying to liquidate those assets."

And there were a lot of question marks at the time around Chesapeake. What was going to happen with Chesapeake? What was going to happen in the West in general?
And I think now a lot of those questions are cleared up and you can see through our performance. I think we demonstrated the resiliency. And through diversification, not that we didn't have issues in certain basins, but we had good performance in other basins, and it kind of washes itself out.
And so what I would say is while the market is probably a little bit weaker, I think our demonstrated performance front of the business is a little bit stronger, a little bit clearer now a year later. So I'm not sure what all that means, but I think there's still opportunity still out there, and I think we've demonstrated a strong performance, which should help any -- if we ever wanted to pursue that."

You guys once again highlighted about a $12 billion backlog on transmission projects. And so simplistically, the way I thought about it was -- kind of reflects about 10 years of growth at current CapEx levels, which, I guess, was enough to grow EBITDA about 2% this year in 2021. So just curious, if based on that backlog of projects in front of you, you think sustaining 2% annual growth, call it, for the next decade or so is maybe a floor or something you deem sort of easily achievable."

But I think you have to be careful about drawing that kind of conclusion. Most of the projects that we've been doing have been 6%. We still were rolling off a lot of deferred revenue this last year and a little bit into '21. So I think you have to be careful about making those kind of broad assumptions.
So for instance, when the deepwater business comes on, that's going to be a very high-growth rate on a fairly low amount of capital. And in the Northeast, sometimes we get nice surges of margin based on very high incremental return opportunities as they come to us.
And on the other hand, we have a decline built that's just part of the gathering business. If there's an area that's not growing, there's a decline that's working against it all the time. But I would tell you that it's more complex than taking $1 billion in saying that, that produces 2%.
On the other thing, and I would say I think we feel very comfortable with a 2% growth rate. If we are investing $1 billion, we feel very comfortable with achieving a 2% growth rate. But given some of the upside that we've got in some of these areas, I think that probably would be kind of considered a floor from my perspective on that. So we might talk about potential problems on this."

We look at that backlog, and it's really dynamic because we have a lot of projects that come into that backlog and that we execute on a lot of those projects. And Southeastern Trail is one that came out of the backlog like South came out of that backlog and became an execution project. And Regional Energy Access will be the same once we get that filing underway and their permitting underway.
So you'll continue to see projects come out of our backlog and move it into the execution phase over the next several years. There's a plethora of opportunities along the Transco corridor to take advantage of coal-fired generation that's going to come off-line and ultimately be converted to gas and renewables.
And I think from the activities we've seen in Texas and Oklahoma over the last week, there definitely needs to be a mixture of energy generation resources in the mix in order to diversify across fuel sources. And so I'm a true believer of that.
Our company is definitely a natural gas focused company now adding in some renewable mix into the play there to take advantage of some opportunities we have. But ultimately, on the Transco system, we're going to be able to drive a lot of new capital investment there on the back of coal-fired generation going away.
And then lastly, our emissions reduction program projects, we have upwards of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of investment opportunity there on the Transco system and likely replacing a large component of our reciprocating compression to do modern either electric drives or gas turbines to reduce our emissions footprint there along the Transco corridor. So there's definitely a lot of investment opportunity that we envision coming in the future for Transco's asset footprint."

And so that group has been an investor in that for a long time along with some of the management from Caiman II. And obviously, they had held on to that much longer than a typical private equity shop likes to, and we worked with them to liquidate them at the appropriate time. We think we bought it right and at the right time, and particularly given the large amount of synergies that we have available to extract from that business.
And so we're excited about the transaction. I can tell you, we were super patient. We've been wanting to gain control of that asset and exploit the synergies between both our UEOM system and our Ohio Valley River. We've been wanting to take advantage of those. And it's been hard to not, but we've been patient, and I think our patience paid off and we're able to pick that up at a very attractive value.

But it's an attractive place because you don't have a lot of the basis risk that you have to manage in the long-haul capacity risk that you have to manage coming out of the Marcellus. So it's an easy place to go in, in a fairly derisked manner. And that's what's attracting -- as Chad mentioned, that's also what's attracting a lot of capital to our opportunity there in the Haynesville.
So that's -- definitely, the money that can come in and get out pretty quickly by turning a bit and turning it into cash up against the -- the current forward strip, which is what a lot of the private parties are doing is what we're seeing.

Once we get beyond that, things like investing in our rate base on Transco on things like the emission reduction project will be put up against other alternatives for that capital reduction, whether that's further debt reduction or share buyback. And those are the things that would be in competition for that further capital allocation as we get into that year.
But it's an interesting dilemma because not very many people -- in fact, I don't know if I could describe to you too many other pipelines that are in the position of being able to invest in the rate base. And for us, the cost of capital, it just hasn't met that return hurdle internally.
So in the past, it really hadn't been thought of as an opportunity. But as we think about the emission reduction project, that's a very sizable capital investment opportunity that will make a decision on that versus other alternatives from a cost to capital standpoint.

So on operating cost, and I want to drag you through some numbers here real quick. But if you look in our analyst package and if you look at the operating costs in each of our segments and you compare 2019 to 2020, you'll see a number of a $223 million reduction in operating expense. But I want to be clear on that.
2019 had incremental expenses because we did a voluntary severance program and we're cutting costs of -- 2019 costs were elevated. 2020 costs were low because we've changed the benefits program around days off. And anyway, it resulted in a $40 million benefit to 2020 expense. I'm dragging you through all that to say that $223 million reduction in expenses on a normalized adjusted EBITDA basis is only a $100 million reduction, $103 million reduction in expenses between 2019 and 2020, and that includes an $11 million increase in property -- in operating taxes, [indiscernible] taxes.
And so we saved about $114 million between '19 and '20. We think about 70% of that will stick going into '21. So 30% of that revert. So we'll see costs go up by about $30 million just due to operating costs kind of not -- that's not retaining all that savings. And then operating taxes, probably for another $20 million to $25 million. So you're looking at probably $50 million of total expense increases in '21. So a great job. We're retaining 70% of our cost savings."

Our natural gas focused strategy continues to deliver solid financial results, and this past quarter was no different. Our base business performance was remarkably strong in the first quarter, and the severe winter weather in February boosted marketing margins. But even without these weather benefit or those benefits, as John will detail later, our adjusted EBITDA was up, reflecting strength in our base business. 
Once again, well positioned assets and reliable operations came through as we delivered another quarter of growth in almost all of our key operating metrics despite severe weather. In fact, average daily firm contracts of transmission capacity, average daily transported volumes, average daily gathering volumes and average daily plant inlet volumes all increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Extreme weather experience in the first quarter really underscores the importance of having a resilient and reliable energy network. Williams also stood out on this front as no firm service was cut on any of our gas transmission systems during Uri. And in fact, our Northwest pipeline hit another record peak day for throughput during the storm. It demonstrates that affordable and dependable natural gas will be a very critical part of the energy mix as we work to support growing economies and meet the key challenges we face around climate change, both in the U.S. and abroad. We truly believe Williams existing infrastructure is key to tomorrow's clean energy economy. 
I'll talk more about how we're planning for the future when we get to the key focus areas. But in the meantime, John is going to go through our financial results. John?"
390225,711080362,2268238,"The Williams Companies, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","The Williams Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. At a very high level summary, the quarter benefited from the impact of Winter Storm Uri. And to be clear, we have collected all receivables relative to that event.

And to be clear, we have collected all receivables relative to that event. But even beyond the winter storm impact, we saw nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year and higher profits from our NGL marketing activity in our West segment. These positives were offset somewhat by higher bonus expense accruals, reflecting the solid year that is unfolding and lower Gulf of Mexico revenues due to some downtime issues during the first quarter of this year. 
And you can see the strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $153 million or 12%. But even after excluding the impact of Winter Storm Uri, our adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. We will discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 35%, simply reflecting the after-tax impact of the higher EBITDA. AFFO grew for the quarter similarly to our growth in EBITDA. And again, AFFO is essentially cash from operations, including JV cash flows, but excluding working capital fluctuations. If you put AFFO up against our capital investments for the quarter of $277 million, of which we consider roughly $47 million of that to be maintenance cap. Put it up against our dividend is [ $498 ] million, you can see that we generated over $250 million in excess cash for the quarter. 
Also, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO divided by dividends set at a very strong 2.07x. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter, along with continued capital discipline, has helped move us towards our leverage metric goal of 4.20x. You'll see later in our guidance update in this deck, we've moved our guidance now for the year from around 4.25x at the end of the year now to around 4.20x at the end of the year. I'm really proud of our success on this front. 
So now let's go to the next slide. Let's dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. But before we dive into each segment, we believe it's important to isolate a few items that are not part of our core business. The first item is the net impact of Winter Storm Uri on our operations in the West. That impact produced a $55 million net benefit and included the positive impact on our marketing operations, offset somewhat by reduced revenues at our Piceance processing facility, whose rates are impacted by net liquid margins. We also had slightly lower volumes in the Mid-Continent at Haynesville. And collectively, we estimate Winter Storm Uri impacted our West volumes by about 70 MCF a day during the quarter. In addition, we also realized a $22 million storm Uri uplift in profits from the Wamsutter upstream assets that we acquired from BP in February, and that is on top of the $8 million from normal operations from these upstream assets. So the total winter storm impact was about -- was a $77 million benefit. Again, with that benefit, EBITDA was up 12%. And even without the impact of Winter Storm Uri, EBITDA was up 6%. 
So digging into our core operations. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets produced results that are about $9 million less than the same period last year. However, new transmission pipeline projects added $29 million in incremental revenues for the quarter, including the Hillabee phase 2 project that came into service in the second quarter of last year, the Southeastern Trail's project that went into service during the fourth quarter of last year and a portion of the Leidy South project that went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. You can see this evidenced in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 5% from the first quarter of 2020. These revenue increases were almost entirely offset by lower Gulf of Mexico revenues due to some production and downtime issues, lower revenues from lower rates in just a few Transco markets that went into effect upon closing the rate case last year and one less billing day this year than last year given last year was a Leap Year, which, believe it or not, has a $6 million impact on our transmission revenues. So the reduced EBITDA results for this segment really have nothing to do with revenues and are largely due to higher operating expenses, which, interesting enough, are being impacted by higher bonus accruals and equity compensation accruals given that we are off to such a strong start to the year. We traditionally do not increase those accruals until later in the year. In addition, we did see slightly higher compression expenses for this segment. 
Now moving to the Northeast. The G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $32 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 920 MCF a day or about 11% this quarter versus the first quarter of last year, while processing volumes grew 15%. The volume growth was predominantly at our JVs in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019, and at our Marcellus South Supply Basin, where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads. 
As a result, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by a little over $33 million, which also includes the benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer due to our increased ownership, which we acquired in mid-November last year. Now moving to the West G&P segment. It was up $44 million compared to the prior year. And remember again that this excludes the $55 million net benefit from Winter Storm Uri. So of this $44 million improvement, commodity margins from our marketing activities contributed a big part of that improvement, and they were up $52 million versus the first quarter of 2020. And again, this excludes the $74 million benefit from Winter Storm Uri related just only to commodities. These increased commodity margins were the result of a few things, all driven by higher NGL prices during the quarter. The first and most significant is related to inventory in transit. 
Last year, we saw prices decline and had a small loss. While this year, we saw prices increasing during the quarter and realized a gain on that inventory. The second relates to transfers of propane and other NGLs to higher netback markets where we saw some real market differentials during the quarter, and we're able to take advantage of that. For example, the differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Offsetting the higher commodity margins were lower profits from our JVs. We did see a $5 million JV benefit from Winter Storm Uri on our [indiscernible] JV. So if you exclude that, our JVs were down about $8 million, and that can be mostly attributed to OPPO where One Oak has pulled much of their volume and moved it to their solely owned system. Those items, namely higher commodity margins, offset by lower JV profits, again, mostly explain the variance in the West. Otherwise, lower revenues were offset by lower expenses. Revenues were down $14 million when you exclude a negative $23 million impact tied to Winter Storm Uri on West revenues. And again, mostly, that was in the Piceance related to net liquid margins. 
Volumes in the West were down 250 MCF a day, or if you exclude Winter Storm Uri, about -- they were down about 180 MCF a day, with most of that reduction in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford, which, of course, I'll remind you, in the Eagle Ford, we are protected by [indiscernible], so that doesn't have a revenue impact. So really, the biggest impact on revenues was the rate reduction in the Haynesville and a slight volume reduction at Haynesville. And I'll remind you that we traded that rate reduction in the Haynesville in part for receiving the [indiscernible] acreage from Chesapeake earlier this year. Now again, offsetting the lower revenues were lower cost, including lower compression cost, and no bad debt expense, where during the first quarter of 2020, we did reserve for the Wamsutter MVC that are now realizing those MVCs as part of the settlement with [indiscernible]. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to discuss several important investor focus areas and updates to our 2021 guidance. Alan?"

And here, moving on to the key investor focus areas on Slide 3. We're increasing the midpoint of our '21 EBITDA guidance range to $5.3 billion, which is up $100 million. The increase in our guidance goes beyond the gains reali",1796,"Great. Well, thanks, John. And here, moving on to the key investor focus areas on Slide 3. 
We're increasing the midpoint of our '21 EBITDA guidance range to $5.3 billion, which is up $100 million. The increase in our guidance goes beyond the gains realized during the winter storm as it also reflects confidence in the strength of our base business. Achieving this new midpoint would produce a 3-year CAGR of about 4.5%, even while we have continued to improve our balance sheet and produce free cash flow after CapEx and dividends. 
Regarding the balance sheet, our deleveraging goal is now on an accelerated path as we've hit the target of 4.2 this quarter, which obviously is earlier than we had forecasted earlier. And we're currently on positive watch at Moody's and hope to see a credit upgrade soon. Given the accelerated achievement of key milestones on our balance sheet, we will begin to evaluate various capital allocation alternatives. As you know, debt reduction has been our top capital priority, and now we will begin to evaluate the best use of free cash flow in '22 and beyond. 
So next on the list here is a few thoughts about the Sequent acquisition. As we announced last night, we recently reached an agreement to purchase Sequent Energy Management and Sequent Energy Canada from Southern Company Gas for a purchase price of $50 million, plus working capital at close. And for several years, we have been evaluating the best way to enhance our marketing capabilities at Williams in a way that it could be well integrated, culturally aligned and focused on driving fee-based revenues across our network for several years. So this is something we've had in our strategic capabilities and something we needed to build for several years. And so we're really excited to be taking this step to fulfill what's been a strategic capability gap. 
The addition of Sequent, including its talented workforce and industry-leading platform, complements the current geographic footprint of our core pipeline transportation and storage business. For perspective, we handle 30% of the nation's natural gas, which is approximately 30 BCF per day. This acquisition increases our natural gas transport and storage optimization capabilities up to 8 BCF per day from 1 BCF per day that we were doing previously in -- here within Williams. So certainly bringing it more in line for a natural gas focused business as large as Williams. 
The scale of the combined company will not only allow for optimization of our existing assets, but it will also facilitate expansions into new markets with opportunities to reach incremental gas-fired power generation, liquefy natural gas exports and future RNG opportunities. 
In discussion with both our existing and potential LNG focused customers, we are hearing a clear need to have wellhead to water natural gas supplies that can demonstrate and document responsibly produced low carbon supplies. We see this acquisition as a way to more effectively aggregate, transport and market these in-demand supplies. So we're really excited to welcome the Sequent team to Williams later this summer. And finally, we don't expect the acquisition to have any dramatic impact on our current mix of business nor a material impact for our '21 EBITDA or CapEx guidance. 
So now moving on to project execution here on Slide 3, still. We continued our pace of strong project execution in the first quarter, placing our Southeastern Trail project into full service in early January and making great progress now on the Transco Leidy South project to bring additional gas from Appalachian area, particularly Northeast PA, to growing demand centers along the Atlantic seaboard by next winter. We filed our FERC application for the Regional Energy Access project, a low environmental impact project being designed in a manner that is acceptable to future renewable energy sources like clean hydrogen and blend -- like clean hydrogen blending and RNG. 
So in today's environment, as we're all learning more and more, existing infrastructure is more important and more valuable than ever, and the brownfield nature of regional energy access and Leidy South and Southeastern Trails are all great examples to that. With the largest and most flexible gas transmission system in the nation, Williams can serve new demand primarily through brownfield expansions. This means maximizing the use of established transmission corridors and facilities, and resulting in reduced community and environmental impact while also enabling economic growth and the use of lower carbon fuels in those markets. 
Next on to the Gulf of Mexico opportunities here. We remain on track to executing on the 4 key Gulf of Mexico projects, which is [ Quell ], [ Ballymore ], [ Tiger ] and [ Anchor ]. These projects are progressing very well, and we look forward to these projects coming online here now over the next few years. We also have a number of other smaller projects, but those are the ones that we continue to focus your attention on. 
So next on the Northeast G&P project execution. Certainly, some of the producers in the Northeast remain in production maintenance mode, but our project execution team is busy trying to keep up with the increased demand for processing and fractionation services for the growing rich gas volumes in the Southwest Marcellus area. And as we have stated before, the rich gas volumes provide us with a much higher service fee and margin capture. So we're thrilled to see continued expansion in that area. 
And finally, on sustainability here. We continue to focus on sustainable operations. And I'll remind you that last year, Williams became the first North American midstream company to issue a climate commitment, focusing on ready now solutions to address climate change. And by setting a near-term goal of a 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as a part of our climate commitment, we are well in line with the Biden administration's recently announced nationally determined contribution target of a 50% to 52% reduction by 2030. So we're really excited that we are actually ahead of that here in what's been said as an aggressive goal for the country. 
We will continue to leverage our natural gas focused strategy and today's technology to focus on immediate opportunity to reduce emissions. At the same time, natural gas and our infrastructure are enabling the next generation of clean energy technology. 
There really is not another energy infrastructure system that integrates a reliable delivery network with a massive storage solution on the scale that the natural gas infrastructure across our nation does. We believe our infrastructure can be a critical part of both near- and long-term solutions. 
And on our near-term efforts, we're focused on renewable natural gas, solar energy. And our footprint is ideal for bringing in renewable natural gas to markets and solar projects in a supply mix. On the solar front, we've currently identified 3 additional projects and now have a total of [ 16 ] solar project opportunities that should start operating beginning in 2023. On the emerging fuels front, such as green hydrogen and renewable natural gas, we certainly expect that to play an increasing role in the clean energy future, and both as a storage vehicle for excess renewable energy in the form of green hydrogen and as a net 0 emitting form of natural gas in the renewable natural gas. So we continue to make sure that we are on the front edges of those opportunities. 
We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy network to deliver on this next phase of the energy transition. In fact, in a partnership with the University of Wyoming, we are currently pursuing a grant from the state of Wyoming to fund a feasibility study to pursue a pilot program that would evaluate the creation of green hydrogen hub near our operations in Wyoming. The study will be presented to the Wyoming Energy Authority, and it could be an initial step for Williams to better understand the working of the hydrogen economy. I certainly want to keep that in context for you. That simply is us filing for a study there to determine if we want to pursue a pilot there. So that is perhaps something I don't want to see people getting out over our skis on here. This is a step, and we certainly are going to make sure that we stay in front of these kind of opportunities, but we're a long way from making any kind of big investment decisions on that. 
We also recently joined the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition that was launched for advanced clean hydrogen as a key pathway to achieving global decarbonization and U.S. energy competitiveness. And finally, we are proud to be a founding sponsor of Houston's Greentown Labs, a green technology incubator to support climate tech start-ups. 
So in closing, I'll reiterate that our intense focus on our natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued moderate growth, improving returns and an increasing amount of free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes, Transco, Northwest pipeline and Gulfstream, are in the right place and right markets. And by design, our formable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. As evidence, on a year-over-year basis, the Lower 48 natural gas production here, of course, in the United States has declined by 5% here in the first quarter. At the same time, Williams natural gas gathering volumes were up by 5%, indicating that our strategy of focusing on key low-cost natural gas basins is working. These gathering assets are irreplaceable and critical infrastructure within the natural gas value chain, and the importance of this infrastructure was proven in our recent ability to navigate to substantial customer bankruptcies in a way that actually improve the value proposition in the Wamsutter and the Haynesville basin. This is a crystal clear example that even in the most dire circumstances, our long-term approach and careful contracting allows us to turn negative such as producer bankruptcies into net positives for Williams. 
We remain bullish on natural gas because we've recognized the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world. Our networks are critical to serving both domestic and global energy demand in a lower carbon and economically viable manner. 
So with that, we thank you very much for joining us today, and I'll open it up for your questions."

The production that came on the line behind that processing facility was very robust. The pads were developed by our customers there, primarily [ EQT ] and Southwestern, and very prolific pad developments they have there, exceeding their expectations.

That's now online, and like I said earlier, virtually full. So we are seeing full processing there for the most part. 
And our fractionation facility at [ Harrison ] is also approaching the limits of capacity. And I suspect through the summer months, we will be at capacity on those facilities. And so we are contemplating opportunities with our Blue Racer ownership there and where we can create crossover pipeline systems to be able to transport some of the volumes over to them when they potentially have spare capacity. And that system can be utilized bidirectionally in the future where either one of us potentially have a capacity situation and we can offload to the other. And so that's a longer-term prospect project. It's something we feel like we could have online potentially this year, and it's a very low-cost project in comparison to building it either a new fractionation or processing facility."

First of all, I'd say there are a couple of other items in the first quarter beyond Winter Storm Uri I think you should think about. So let's start with the 1 4 1 5, which is what we made. Winter storm had a $77 million impact. We did make, I would call it, outsized NGL margins during the first quarter relative to some of this inventory valuation. And just to put a number on that, I think we made probably $30 million more than we would normally make in a quarter. 
So if you remember in my commentary, I said we made $52 million more in NGL marketing activity outside of Winter Storm Uri. We usually make $20 million to $30 million a quarter. And so if you back $77 million out, you back $30 million out for some outside NGL margins. And then also, we did book an $11 million MVC accrual relative to Wamsutter. That once we close in the southern properties, we'll be our own customer and we'll be charging ourselves an MVC, and you take that out as well. If you take those 3 numbers out, we're under $1.3 billion for the quarter. And if you normal -- if you take that times 4, add those items back, you'll get really close to our kind of 5.3 midpoint. Now of course, you might say, the upstream will come in a little bit stronger, too. 
We made out -- without Winter Storm Uri, we made $8 million on the upstream; times 4, that's $32 million, and we've guided to around 1% of our EBITDA for the year. So there's certainly some uplift on the upstream, too. So I would say there's probably a little bit of conservatism in our number. I'm not going to try to say there isn't to that. But I think we obviously want to be sensitive to -- if we have a tough hurricane season or other things. But I think you've got to take those 3 things out, you're going to get really close to guidance. Our forecast remains very strong, and our business performance remains really strong for the remainder of the year."

So wondering if you could talk about what this exactly entails, what you're thinking here. And then natural gas marketing was a business that was much bigger pre shale, and it's gotten much smaller over the last decade. But with utility -- I know that you guys mentioned LNG customers. But with the utilities coming out with net 0 requirements as well and maybe more volatility to materialize in natural gas flows on a daily basis rather than what has historically been a seasonal basis, could you talk about what this might mean for pipeline be contracting and how Sequent may or may not play a role?"

We touch a lot of gas, have a lot of customers that could use services like gas marketing, but we have been very limited in our approach to that. And so the Sequent opportunity basically gave us an opportunity to buy a platform and a set of contracts and asset management contract and a great team that really knows this business has controlled risk extremely well. And so really allowed us to fulfill a strategic gap. However -- so I would just say that was out there as the need before the thought of low-carbon fuels and the volatility and the value of volatility that just got exposed in this last quarter even came along. But I will tell you that we entered this with even greater confidence in both the need and the value associated with because we do believe that the benefit of capacity management and risk management as it relate -- for utilities as it relates to what happened during a Winter Storm Uri certainly has -- make sure the space is wide weight relative to the risk around this issue. And we think this -- the team at Sequent has done a great job of managing that risk, by the way, through this. And so we think there's value in managing in -- a new value associated with managing that kind of risk. But we also just think just generally, we have a lot of customers that could really use the service. And as you say, it's really kind of faded away as the capability in a lot of companies, but we think it's really going to be an important tool for us and being able to bring together low carbon supplies all the way from the wellhead and being able to document that and put that value chain together all the way to the water and to our utility on the list right now [indiscernible]. We certainly have the assets, but we really don't have all of those contacts with people. We talk to customers about long-term capacity on a regular basis. We're not out readily talking to them about how we manage the volatility in their business. And so this really gives us a great opportunity to do that and look forward. So thanks for the question, and I would just say we're -- it is -- it's become more and more evident to us that this is something we needed to add to our capabilities at some of the changes that you pointed out has occurred."

So we certainly are doing everything we can to improve our position on those. As we've said many times before, and it kind of proved out in these cases, it's not just the law or -- I mean, certainly, your contracts need to be good and supportive. But importantly, it is the physical nature of the asset, and being all the way back to the wellhead, it gives you a lot of economic protection in that situation. 
Having said all that, the one thing that we are really depending on in these transactions is the fact that the other party is going to invest the dollars to develop the acreage, and we're cutting the bargain on that basis. And so to get right to the point, we're going to retain those interests until that -- until those capital dollars have been invested to prove to ourselves that, that money is going to be spent. If it doesn't get spent, we still own the acreage. And whether [indiscernible] sustain and increase interest in a more developed property. 
So I would say, we certainly don't expect that. We know the partners that we're talking to here pretty well, and they both have a very strong financial position.

At the end of the day, the bankruptcy process really wasn't all that relevant. What was relevant was that our infrastructure is absolutely critical. And without it, the upstream asset can't deliver value. You can't deliver volume. And so we have a very strong position across our footprint. I think we proved it last year, not a single bankruptcy proceeding led to a rejection of one of our contracts because we've invested in critical infrastructure that just, by its nature, protects against that risk. And then on the long-term investment, I think Alan [indiscernible]. We are again very focused on structuring these transactions in a way that brings development back to high-quality acreage, upstream of areas where we have existing available midstream capacity. And so we're going to see in these structures a near-term investment in these properties that will deliver the ownership from a long-term perspective, primarily to our JV partner. 
We may have a small ownership interest that [indiscernible] from a long-term perspective, but we will likely only hold the ownership interest as long as it takes to make sure that development gets back into the properties and drive the volume to our midstream assets. So that's -- we are laser-focused on that as our strategy, not to just own upstream properties forever. It's to own them in a way that drives the development that we think will drive value to our midstream assets."

It is simply to be looking to manage basis differential, manage contracts, reimburse contracts through asset management agreements with utilities. So this is a very low-risk approach, but it does involve a lot of customer contact and a lot of opportunity to serve customers in space. But it's basically basis and time value on storage versus physical inventory. So it's nothing exotic and market-leading or market-making kind of activities."

They have a very high-quality risk control system. And so we picked up the benefits of a very well thought out structure from risk control, accounting systems, trade, marketing systems. We just -- it helps move us forward that much quicker and something that we would have probably spent the next 4 or 5 years trying to build, we get there more quickly."

And I would just say, in addition to that, we look at a lot of different opportunities in this space. And the reason we got so comfortable with this transaction is Southern companies have done a fantastic job of really keeping the screws turn down from a risk control standpoint and really building a culture around that. And so this is a very well controlled business, and we've been very impressed with the time and effort that Southern companies has invested in making this a heavily controlled business. But at the end of the day, Southern companies doesn't have all the big long-term external customers on both the upstream and the downstream the way we do. And so this is a great fit for us. I totally understand where they're coming from in terms of their sale. But for us, this is really an important capability for a company that handles 30% of the nation's natural gas. Really complementary. And I think we've got a lot to offer to that team as well in terms of new opportunities to work around our customers and assets as well off of those services. So it really -- this is really, I think, attractive transaction between 2 companies that know each other well and done a lot of business together, and we're really excited about bringing this team."

But we certainly up until the time that we take a look at those investment opportunities against the whatever price of our stock is and where we think the best value is. But the good news is we're sitting here in '22 with a modest amount of free cash flow that gives us flexibility. But as we get into '22, the -- take rocket science to run math and realize that, that starts to build on us. And so we will have quite a bit of opportunity there. 
And I wouldn't say that we're committed to making those emission reduction projects happen yet until we get down to seeing what stock price is, what returns look like, but that is certainly one of the options. And I think on the further debt reduction, obviously, if we become convinced that further -- debt reduction would add value to our shareholders, then that's a lever we could continue to pull on as well. And so I would just say, it's hard to predict what the markets will look like 9 months from now, but we certainly are, to the point now as we continue to engage with the Board on this discussion, this is becoming a more prevalent topic, if you will, at Board meetings in terms of what's the best use of the extra free cash flow as we get into '22 and beyond."

So yes, if that continues, that will drive activity on those assets and will drive growth. 
So I like our setup for the balance of the year. Obviously, as John said, we're being reserved in how we're putting that into guidance, but that looks good. And I would say, obviously, if you think about really what drives some of those decisions, a lot of times, it is the forward market for a lot of our customers that drives those decisions. And so they will start to look at what the forward strip looks like and start to lay in hedges. And that's going to drive the activity, frankly, in terms of how much -- how many drilling commitments they make in an area. So I would just say, keep your eyes focused on kind of the forward markets for both gas and NGLs, and that'll be a pretty good indicator of what kind of activity we should expect across those areas."

And the other one that's just talking about overall, the volatility there, on average, about maybe $40 million of net income, I think, is what they said. But is there a -- maybe a sense that you may be able to kind of make that more kind of stable and predictable under the kind of the broader platform that you have?"

First on the guarantees, I think you need to understand we guarantee a lot of our subsidiaries, too, and a big part of that number, they were talking about is just simply the guarantees they make for monthly transactions at Sequent. I think if you look at Sequent, their revenues are somewhere in the $7 billion range. And if you divide that by 12 -- I mean, all that's happening is the parent was guaranteeing its subsidiary who was doing purchase transactions under the AMA or just general marketing activities with very low risk. They have a very tight risk control process. So there's not risk on those trades. So there was a guarantee in their subsidiary, just like we guaranteed one of our subsidiaries. That's $400 million to $500 million of guarantees. And so that number was a little bit flashy, but it's not anything of substance. It's not like guaranteeing some risk asset. Hopefully, that makes sense. 
And so beyond that, really, the transport fees, most regulated pipelines have maximum of 90 days requirements if you fall below invest grade. If you're investment grade, you don't have any requirements. But if you fall below investment grade, you have obligations, but they're only 90 days. So that's a much smaller part of that guarantee. 
So again, I would just say, really, $600 million to $700 million of that guarantee number that you may have heard [indiscernible] talk about, we're just simple monthly or quarterly guarantees -- for monthly guarantees of the [indiscernible] with very little risk because there's really no changes to that. That's just the normal course business activity. 
One thing we haven't talked much about EBITDA generation. I mean we see a pretty consistent in their history -- a pretty consistent, I think, Southern talked about this, EBITDA generation of $20 million to $30 million from this business, and we expect it to stay somewhere under our -- there will be an occasional market dislocation like we just saw. But generally, $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA generation. That doesn't mean the earnings will be consistently that way. We will be doing adjustments to our EBITDA, where some quarters, it may be quite a bit bigger; some quarters, less. But over a year, it would average out to that $20 million to $30 million. So hopefully, that answers your question. But there's not huge credit exposure for us as a company other than the just normal ongoing business activities of Sequent."

Our natural gas focused strategy continues to deliver solid financial results, and this past quarter was no different. Our base business performance was remarkably strong in the first quarter, and the severe winter weather in February boosted marketing margins. But even without these weather benefit or those benefits, as John will detail later, our adjusted EBITDA was up, reflecting strength in our base business. 
Once again, well positioned assets and reliable operations came through as we delivered another quarter of growth in almost all of our key operating metrics despite severe weather. In fact, average daily firm contracted transmission capacity, average daily transported volumes, average daily gathering volumes and average daily plant inlet volumes all increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis. 
Extreme weather experienced in the first quarter really underscores the importance of having a resilient and reliable energy network. Williams also stood out on this front as no firm service was cut on any of our gas transmission systems during Uri. And in fact, our Northwest pipeline hit another record peak day for throughput during the storm. It demonstrates that affordable and dependable natural gas will be a very critical part of the energy mix as we work to support growing economies and meet the key challenges we face around climate change, both in the U.S. and abroad. We truly believe Williams existing infrastructure is key to tomorrow's clean energy economy. 
I'll talk more about how we're planning for the future when we get to the key focus areas. But in the meantime, John is going to go through our financial results. John?"

And to be clear, we have collected all receivables relative to that event. But even beyond the winter storm impact, we saw nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year and higher profits from our NGL marketing activity in our West segment. These positives were offset somewhat by higher bonus expense accruals, reflecting the solid year that is unfolding and lower Gulf of Mexico revenues due to some downtime issues during the first quarter of this year. 
And you can see the strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $153 million or 12%. But even after excluding the impact of Winter Storm Uri, our adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. We will discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 35%, simply reflecting the after-tax impact of the higher EBITDA. AFFO grew for the quarter similarly to our growth in EBITDA. And again, AFFO is essentially cash from operations, including JV cash flows, but excluding working capital fluctuations. If you put AFFO up against our capital investments for the quarter of $277 million, of which we consider roughly $47 million of that to be maintenance capital and put it up against our dividend of $498 million, you can see that we generated over $250 million in excess cash for the quarter. 
Also, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO divided by dividends sets at a very strong 2.07x. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter, along with continued capital discipline, has helped move us towards our leverage metric goal of 4.20x. You'll see later in our guidance update in this deck, we've moved our guidance now for the year from around 4.25x at the end of the year now to around 4.20x at the end of the year. I'm really proud of our success on this front. 
So now let's go to the next slide. Let's dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. But before we dive into each segment, we believe it's important to isolate a few items that are not part of our core business. The first item is the net impact of Winter Storm Uri on our operations in the West. That impact produced a $55 million net benefit and included the positive impact on our  marketing operations, offset somewhat by reduced revenues at our Piceance processing facility, whose rates are impacted by net liquid margins. We also had slightly lower volumes in the Mid-Continent at Haynesville. And collectively, we estimate Winter Storm Uri impacted our West volumes by about 70 MCF a day during the quarter. In addition, we also realized a $22 million storm Uri uplift in profits from the Wamsutter upstream assets that we acquired from BP in February, and that is on top of the $8 million from normal operations from these upstream assets. So the total winter storm impact was about -- was a $77 million benefit. Again, with that benefit, EBITDA was up 12%. And even without the impact of Winter Storm Uri, EBITDA was up 6%. 
So digging into our core operations. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets produced results that are about $9 million less than the same period last year. However, new transmission pipeline projects added $29 million in incremental revenues for the quarter, including the Hillabee Phase 2 project that came into service in the second quarter of last year, the Southeastern Trail's project that went into service during the fourth quarter of last year and a portion of the Leidy South project that went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. You can see the evidence in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 5% from the first quarter of 2020. 
These revenue increases were almost entirely offset by lower Gulf of Mexico revenues due to some production and downtime issues, lower revenues from lower rates in just a few Transco markets that went into effect upon closing the rate case last year and one less billing day this year than last year given last year was a Leap Year, which, believe it or not, has a $6 million impact on our transmission revenues. So the reduced EBITDA results for this segment really have nothing to do with revenues and are largely due to higher operating expenses, which, interesting enough, are being impacted by higher bonus accruals and equity compensation accruals given that we are off to such a strong start to the year. We traditionally do not increase those accruals until later in the year. In addition, we did see slightly higher compression expenses for this segment. 
Now moving to the Northeast. The G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $32 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 920 MCF a day or about 11% this quarter versus the first quarter of last year, while processing volumes grew 15%. The volume growth was predominantly at our JVs in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019, and at our Marcellus South Supply Basin, where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads. As a result, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by a little over $33 million, which also includes the benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer due to our increased ownership, which we acquired in mid-November last year. 
Now moving to the West G&P segment, it was up $44 million compared to the prior year. And remember again that this excludes the $55 million net benefit from Winter Storm Uri. So of this $44 million improvement, commodity margins from our marketing activities contributed a big part of that improvement, and they were up $52 million versus the first quarter of 2020. And again, this excludes the $74 million benefit from Winter Storm Uri related just only to commodities. These increased commodity margins were the result of a few things, all driven by higher NGL prices during the quarter. The first and most significant is related to inventory in transit. 
Last year, we saw prices decline and had a small loss. While this year, we saw prices increasing during the quarter and realized a gain on that inventory. The second relates to transfers of propane and other NGLs to higher netback markets where we saw some real market differentials during the quarter, and we're able to take advantage of that. For example, the differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Offsetting the higher commodity margins were lower profits from our JVs. We did see a $5 million JV benefit from Winter Storm Uri on our Bradford JV. So if you exclude that, our JVs were down about $8 million, and that can be mostly attributed to OPPL where One Oak has pulled much of their volume and moved it to their solely owned system. Those items, namely higher commodity margins, offset by lower JV profits, again, mostly explain the variance in the West. Otherwise, lower revenues were offset by lower expenses. Revenues were down $14 million when you exclude a negative $23 million impact tied to Winter Storm Uri on West revenues. And again, mostly, that was in the Piceance related to net liquid margins. 
Volumes in the West were down 250 MCF a day, or if you exclude Winter Storm Uri, about -- they were down about 180 MCF a day, with most of that reduction in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford, which, of course, I'll remind you, in the Eagle Ford, we are protected by MVCs, so that doesn't have a revenue impact. So really, the biggest impact on revenues was the rate reduction in the Haynesville and a slight volume reduction at Haynesville. And I'll remind you that we traded that rate reduction in the Haynesville in part for receiving the South Mansfield acreage from Chesapeake earlier this year. Now again, offsetting the lower revenues were lower costs, including lower compression cost, and no bad debt expense, while during the first quarter of 2020, we did reserve for the Wamsutter MVC that are now realizing those MVCs as part of the settlement with Southland. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to discuss several important investor focus areas and updates to our 2021 guidance. Alan?"
390225,711080362,2268871,"The Williams Companies, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","The Williams Companies, Inc.","Executives","Great. Well, thanks, John.

The increase in our guidance goes beyond the gains reali",1785,"Great. Well, thanks, John. And here, moving on to the key investor focus areas on Slide 3. 
We're increasing the midpoint of our '21 EBITDA guidance range to $5.3 billion, which is up $100 million. The increase in our guidance goes beyond the gains realized during the winter storm as it also reflects confidence in the strength of our base business. Achieving this new midpoint would produce a 3-year CAGR of about 4.5%, even while we have continued to improve our balance sheet and produce free cash flow after CapEx and dividends. 
Regarding the balance sheet, our deleveraging goal is now on an accelerated path as we've hit the target of 4.2 this quarter, which obviously is earlier than we had forecasted earlier. And we're currently on positive watch at Moody's and hope to see a credit upgrade soon. Given the accelerated achievement of key milestones on our balance sheet, we will begin to evaluate various capital allocation alternatives. As you know, debt reduction has been our top capital priority, and now we will begin to evaluate the best use of free cash flow in '22 and beyond. 
So next on the list here is a few thoughts about the Sequent acquisition. As we announced last night, we recently reached an agreement to purchase Sequent Energy Management and Sequent Energy Canada from Southern Company Gas for a purchase price of $50 million, plus working capital at close. And for several years, we have been evaluating the best way to enhance our marketing capabilities at Williams in a way that it could be well integrated, culturally aligned and focused on driving fee-based revenues across our network for several years. So this is something we've had in our strategic capabilities and something we needed to build for several years. And so we're really excited to be taking this step to fulfill what's been a strategic capability gap. 
The addition of Sequent, including its talented workforce and industry-leading platform, complements the current geographic footprint of our core pipeline transportation and storage business. For perspective, we handle 30% of the nation's natural gas, which is approximately 30 BCF per day. This acquisition increases our natural gas transport and storage optimization capabilities up to 8 BCF per day from 1 BCF per day that we were doing previously in -- here within Williams. So certainly bringing it more in line for a natural gas focused business as large as Williams. 
The scale of the combined company will not only allow for optimization of our existing assets, but it will also facilitate expansions into new markets with opportunities to reach incremental gas-fired power generation, liquefy natural gas exports and future RNG opportunities. 
In discussion with both our existing and potential LNG focused customers, we are hearing a clear need to have wellhead to water natural gas supplies that can demonstrate and document responsibly produced low carbon supplies. We see this acquisition as a way to more effectively aggregate, transport and market these in-demand supplies. So we're really excited to welcome the Sequent team to Williams later this summer. And finally, we don't expect the acquisition to have any dramatic impact on our current mix of business nor a material impact for our '21 EBITDA or CapEx guidance. 
So now moving on to project execution here on Slide 3, still. We continued our pace of strong project execution in the first quarter, placing our Southeastern Trail project into full service in early January and making great progress now on the Transco Leidy South project to bring additional gas from Appalachian area, particularly Northeast PA, to growing demand centers along the Atlantic seaboard by next winter. We filed our FERC application for the Regional Energy Access project, a low environmental impact project being designed in a manner that is acceptable to future renewable energy sources like clean hydrogen and blend -- like clean hydrogen blending and RNG. 
So in today's environment, as we're all learning more and more, existing infrastructure is more important and more valuable than ever, and the brownfield nature of regional energy access and Leidy South and Southeastern Trails are all great examples to that. With the largest and most flexible gas transmission system in the nation, Williams can serve new demand primarily through brownfield expansions. This means maximizing the use of established transmission corridors and facilities, and resulting in reduced community and environmental impact while also enabling economic growth and the use of lower carbon fuels in those markets. 
Next on to the Gulf of Mexico opportunities here. We remain on track to executing on the 4 key Gulf of Mexico projects, which is Whale, Ballymore, Taggart and Anchor. These projects are progressing very well, and we look forward to these projects coming online here now over the next few years. We also have a number of other smaller projects, but those are the ones that we continue to focus your attention on. 
So next on the Northeast G&P project execution. Certainly, some of the producers in the Northeast remain in production maintenance mode, but our project execution team is busy trying to keep up with the increased demand for processing and fractionation services for the growing rich gas volumes in the Southwest Marcellus area. And as we have stated before, the rich gas volumes provide us with a much higher service fee and margin capture. So we're thrilled to see continued expansion in that area. 
And finally, on sustainability here. We continue to focus on sustainable operations. And I'll remind you that last year, Williams became the first North American midstream company to issue a climate commitment, focusing on ready now solutions to address climate change. And by setting a near-term goal of 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as a part of our climate commitment, we are well in line with the Biden administration's recently announced Nationally Determined Contribution target of a 50% to 52% reduction by 2030. So we're really excited that we are actually ahead of that here in what's been said as an aggressive goal for the country. 
We will continue to leverage our natural gas focused strategy and today's technology to focus on immediate opportunity to reduce emissions. At the same time, natural gas and our infrastructure are enabling the next generation of clean energy technology. 
There really is not another energy infrastructure system that integrates a reliable delivery network with a massive storage solution on the scale that the natural gas infrastructure across our nation does. We believe our infrastructure can be a critical part of both near- and long-term solutions. 
And on our near-term efforts, we're focused on renewable natural gas, solar energy. And our footprint is ideal for bringing in renewable natural gas to markets and solar projects in a supply mix. On the solar front, we've currently identified 3 additional projects and now have a total of 16 solar project opportunities that should start operating beginning in 2023. On the emerging fuels front, such as green hydrogen and renewable natural gas, we certainly expect that to play an increasing role in the clean energy future, and both as a storage vehicle for excess renewable energy in the form of green hydrogen and as a net 0 emitting form of natural gas in the renewable natural gas. So we continue to make sure that we are on the front edges of those opportunities. 
We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy network to deliver on this next phase of the energy transition. In fact, in a partnership with the University of Wyoming, we are currently pursuing a grant from the state of Wyoming to fund a feasibility study to pursue a pilot program that would evaluate the creation of green hydrogen hub near our operations in Wyoming. The study will be presented to the Wyoming Energy Authority, and it could be an initial step for Williams to better understand the working of the hydrogen economy. I certainly want to keep that in context for you. That simply is us filing for a study there to determine if we want to pursue a pilot there. So that is perhaps something I don't want to see people getting out over our skis on here. This is a step, and we certainly are going to make sure that we stay in front of these kind of opportunities, but we're a long way from making any kind of big investment decisions on that. 
We also recently joined the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition that was launched for advanced clean hydrogen as a key pathway to achieving global decarbonization and U.S. energy competitiveness. And finally, we are proud to be a founding sponsor of Houston's Greentown Labs, a green technology incubator to support climate tech start-ups. 
So in closing, I'll reiterate that our intense focus on our natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued moderate growth, improving returns and an increasing amount of free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes, Transco, Northwest pipeline and Gulfstream, are in the right place and right markets. And by design, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. As evidence, on a year-over-year basis, the Lower 48 natural gas production here, of course, in the United States has declined by 5% here in the first quarter. 
At the same time, Williams natural gas gathering volumes were up by 5%, indicating that our strategy of focusing on key low-cost natural gas basins is working. These gathering assets are irreplaceable and critical infrastructure within the natural gas value chain, and the importance of this infrastructure was proven in our recent ability to navigate 2 substantial customer bankruptcies in a way that actually improve the value proposition in the Wamsutter and the Haynesville basin. This is a crystal clear example that even in the most dire circumstances, our long-term approach and careful contracting allows us to turn negative such as producer bankruptcies into net positives for Williams. 
We remain bullish on natural gas because we've recognized the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world. Our networks are critical to serving both domestic and global energy demand in a lower carbon and economically viable manner. 
So with that, we thank you very much for joining us today, and I'll open it up for your questions."

The production that came online behind that processing facility was very robust. The pads were developed by our customers there, primarily EQT and Southwestern, and very prolific pad developments they have there, exceeding our expectations. And so we did an offload agreement with our customers there to make sure that we didn't impact any of their volumes in the first quarter while we were finishing our TXP III in Oak Grove. That's now online, and like I said earlier, virtually full. So we are seeing full processing there for the most part. 
And our fractionation facility at Harrison is also approaching the limits of capacity. And I suspect through the summer months, we will be at capacity on those facilities. And so we are contemplating opportunities with our Blue Racer ownership there where we can create crossover pipeline systems to be able to transport some of those volumes over to them when they potentially have spare capacity. And that system can be utilized bidirectionally in the future where either one of us potentially have a capacity situation and we can offload to the other. And so that's a longer-term prospect project, but it's something we feel like we could have online potentially this year, and it's a very low-cost project in comparison to building either a new fractionation or processing facility."

First of all, I'd say there are a couple of other items in the first quarter beyond Winter Storm Uri I think you should think about. So let's start with the $1,415 million, which is what we made. Winter storm had a $77 million impact. We did make, I would call it, outsized NGL margins during the first quarter relative to some of this inventory valuation. And just to put a number on that, I think we made probably $30 million more than we would normally make in a quarter. 
So if you remember in my commentary, I said we made $52 million more in NGL marketing activity outside of Winter Storm Uri. We usually make $20 million to $30 million a quarter. And so if you back $77 million out, you back $30 million out for some outside NGL margins. And then also, we did book an $11 million MVC accrual relative to Wamsutter. That once we close in the southern properties, we'll be our own customer and we'll be charging ourselves an MVC, and you take that out as well. If you take those 3 numbers out, we're under $1.3 billion for the quarter. And if you normal -- if you take that times 4, add those items back, you'll get really close to our kind of 5.3 midpoint. Now of course, you might say, the upstream will come in a little bit stronger, too. 
We made out -- without Winter Storm Uri, we made $8 million on the upstream; times 4, that's $32 million, and we've guided to around 1% of our EBITDA for the year. So there's certainly some uplift on the upstream, too. So I would say there's probably a little bit of conservatism in our number. I'm not going to try to say there isn't to that. But I think we obviously want to be sensitive to -- if we have a tough hurricane season or other things. But I think you've got to take those 3 things out, you're going to get really close to guidance. Our forecast remains very strong, and our business performance remains really strong for the remainder of the year."

But with the utilities coming out with net 0 requirements as well and maybe more volatility to materialize in natural gas flows on a daily basis rather than what has historically been a seasonal basis, could you talk about what this might mean for pipeline be contracting and how Sequent may or may not play a role?"

I would just say, first of all, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we have been, for the last couple of years, really and thinking, boy, this is an awesome big business. We touch a lot of gas, have a lot of customers that could use services like gas marketing, but we have been very limited in our approach to that. And so the Sequent opportunity basically gave us an opportunity to buy a platform and a set of contracts and asset management contract and a great team that really knows this business has controlled risk extremely well. And so really allowed us to fulfill a strategic gap. However -- so I would just say that was out there as the need before the thought of low-carbon fuels and the volatility and the value of volatility that just got exposed in this last quarter even came along. But I will tell you that we entered this with even greater confidence in both the need and the value associated with because we do believe that the benefit of capacity management and risk management as it relate for utilities, as it relates to what happened during a Winter Storm Uri certainly has -- make sure the space is wide range relative to the risk around this issue. 
And we think this -- the team at Sequent has done a great job of managing that risk, by the way, through this. And so we think there's value in managing in -- a new value associated with managing that kind of risk. But we also just think just generally, we have a lot of customers that could really use the service. And as you say, it's really kind of faded away as the capability in a lot of companies, but we think it's really going to be an important tool for us and being able to bring together low carbon supplies all the way from the wellhead and being able to document that and put that value chain together all the way to the water and to our utility is clearly on the list right now as a new opportunity for us to market to, and we certainly have the assets, but we really don't have all of those contacts with people. We talk to customers about long-term capacity on a regular basis. We're not out readily talking to them about how we manage the volatility in their business. And so this really gives us a great opportunity to do that and look forward. So thanks for the question, and I would just say we're -- it is -- it's become more and more evident to us that this is something we needed to add to our capabilities at some of the changes that you pointed out has occurred."

Yes, we are in the process of working through -- I would say we're well into negotiations with 2 different parties, one in the Wamsutter, one in the Haynesville. And they're both local producers with adjacent acreage and very skilled operators in the area. And so we're moving along on that. And probably the form of those transactions will be a situation where we retain an interest, and part of that is for credit protection, as you can imagine, to make sure that we haven't handed the keys over to that until the cash has been invested to increase the drilling acreage. So you should think about that as over time, those cash flows being reinvested in the drilling and building up of the business and then a dilution of our interest over time as that converts from upstream cash flows into midstream -- long life midstream cash flows. So that's exactly what we're looking to accomplish. And I'll tell you our team and Chad Zamarin, who's been leading that for us, has just done a fantastic job of really coming up with win-win solutions with parties. And we're really excited about the way that's going to turn out for much -- I would tell you, much bigger value to us than even at very modest conditions, much bigger value coming to us than we had ever kind of expected when we were preparing in the bankruptcy processes for that. 
So Chad, I don't know if you have anything to add anything."

I would tell you that we are looking at every opportunity to leverage our capabilities and infrastructure, and carbon capture is one of those. We do have assets in both pipelines and storage facilities in areas where there may be the opportunity to aggregate significant carbon emissions and provide capture and storage. It's early days. Much like with hydrogen, I would say we're trying to set the table for us to be able to participate in those opportunities as they mature. I wouldn't expect to see something material as Alan mentioned on hydrogen in Wyoming. I wouldn't expect to see something from an investment perspective in the near term. But I would tell you that if it's a viable opportunity, which we think is very well may be, we are looking at some actual projects today, but they are long term in nature. And we require, I'd say, a year plus of just evaluation before we even think about what an investment might look like. But we have multiple different opportunities that we're looking at across the carbon storage -- capture and storage opportunity set."

Great question, and especially with the some of the outcomes from the Delaware bankruptcy courts as it relates to gathering and whether those contracts are on the land or not. So we certainly are doing everything we can to improve our position on those. As we've said many times before, and it kind of proved out in these cases, it's not just the law or -- I mean, certainly, your contracts need to be good and supportive. But importantly, it is the physical nature of the asset, and being all the way back to the wellhead, it gives you a lot of economic protection in that situation. 
Having said all that, the one thing that we are really depending on in these transactions is the fact that the other party is going to invest the dollars to develop the acreage, and we're cutting the bargain on that basis. And so to get right to the point, we're going to retain those interests until that -- until those capital dollars have been invested to prove to ourselves that, that money is going to be spent. If it doesn't get spent, we still own the acreage. And whatever money they spent in developing we retain an increased interest in a more developed property. 
So I would say, we certainly don't expect that. We know the partners that we're talking to here pretty well, and they both have a very strong financial position. So in this case, we feel really good about the situation. But I would say that we've got belt and suspenders on in terms of the form of the structure that we're seeing. That is if effectively bankruptcy proves given our continued holdings until the dollars have been invested to develop the acreage."

I think it's important to emphasize Alan that we didn't have meaningful contract projection through all of the bankruptcies that occurred last year. We have been very deliberate in investing in infrastructure that is absolutely critical to the upstream asset. And so both in Haynesville and Wamsutter, at the end of the day, the bankruptcy process really wasn't all that relevant. What was relevant was that our infrastructure is absolutely critical. And without it, the upstream asset can't deliver value. You can't deliver volume. And so we have a very strong position across our entire footprint. I think we proved it last year, not a single bankruptcy proceeding led to a rejection of one of our contracts because we've invested in critical infrastructure that just, by its nature, protects against that risk. And then on the long-term investment, I think Alan may want to add to it. We are again very focused on structuring these transactions in a way that brings development back to high-quality acreage, upstream of areas where we have existing available midstream capacity. And so we're going to see in these structures a near-term investment in these properties that will deliver the ownership from a long-term perspective, primarily to our JV partner. 
We may have a small ownership interest that we retain from a long-term perspective, but we will likely only hold the ownership interest as long as it takes to make sure that development gets back into the properties and drive the volume to our midstream assets. So that's -- we are laser-focused on that as our strategy, not to just own upstream properties forever. It's to own them in a way that drives the development that we think will drive value to our midstream assets."

And so this is a very well controlled business, and we've been very impressed with the time and effort that Southern companies has invested in making this a heavily controlled business. But at the end of the day, Southern companies doesn't have all the big long-term external customers on both the upstream and the downstream the way we do. And so this is a great fit for us. I totally understand where they're coming from in terms of their sale. But for us, this is really an important capability for a company that handles 30% of the nation's natural gas. Really complementary. And I think we've got a lot to offer to that team as well in terms of new opportunities to work around our customers and assets as well off of those services. So it really -- this is really, I think, attractive transaction between 2 companies that know each other well and done a lot of business together, and we're really excited about bringing this team."

But we certainly up until the time that we take a look at those investment opportunities against the whatever price of our stock is and wherever we think the best value is. But the good news is we're sitting here in '22 with a modest amount of free cash flow that gives us flexibility. But as we get into '22, the -- take rocket science to run math and realize that, that starts to build on us. And so we will have quite a bit of opportunity there. 
And I wouldn't say that we're committed to making those emission reduction projects happen yet until we get down to seeing what stock price is, what returns look like, but that is certainly one of the options. And I think on the further debt reduction, obviously, if we become convinced that further debt reduction would add value to our shareholders, then that's a lever we could continue to pull on as well. And so I would just say, it's hard to predict what the markets will look like 9 months from now, but we certainly are, to the point now as we continue to engage with the Board on this discussion, this is becoming a more prevalent topic, if you will, at Board meetings in terms of what's the best use of the extra free cash flow as we get into '22 and beyond."

So yes, if that continues, that will drive activity on those assets and will drive growth. 
So I like our setup for the balance of the year. Obviously, as John said, we're being reserved in how we're putting that into guidance, but that looks good. And I would say, obviously, if you think about really what drives some of those decisions, a lot of times, it is the forward market for a lot of our customers that drives those decisions. And so they will start to look at what the forward strip looks like and start to lay in hedges. And that's going to drive the activity, frankly, in terms of how much -- how many drilling commitments they make in an area. So I would just say, keep your eyes focused on kind of the forward markets for both gas and NGLs, and that'll be a pretty good indicator of what kind of activity we should expect across those areas."

First on the guarantees, I think you need to understand we guarantee a lot of our subsidiaries, too, and a big part of that number, they were talking about is just simply the guarantees they make for monthly transactions",418,"Well, yes, this is John Chandler. First on the guarantees, I think you need to understand we guarantee a lot of our subsidiaries, too, and a big part of that number, they were talking about is just simply the guarantees they make for monthly transactions at Sequent. I think if you look at Sequent, their revenues are somewhere in the $7 billion range. And if you divide that by 12 -- I mean, all that's happening is the parent was guaranteeing its subsidiary who was doing purchase transactions under the AMA or just general marketing activities with very low risk. They have a very tight risk control process. So there's not risk on those trades. So there was a guarantee in their subsidiary, just like we guaranteed one of our subsidiaries. That's $400 million to $500 million of guarantees. And so that number was a little bit flashy, but it's not anything of substance. It's not like guaranteeing some risk asset. Hopefully, that makes sense. 
And so beyond that, really, the transport fees, most regulated pipelines have maximum of 90 days requirements if you fall below invest grade. If you're investment grade, you don't have any requirements. But if you fall below investment grade, you have obligations, but they're only 90 days. So that's a much smaller part of that guarantee. 
So again, I would just say, really, $600 million to $700 million of that guarantee number that you may have heard Southern talk about are just simple monthly or quarterly guarantees -- monthly guarantees essentially with very little risk because there's really no changes to that. That's just the normal course business activity. 
One thing we haven't talked much about EBITDA generation. I mean we see a pretty consistent in their history -- a pretty consistent, I think, Southern talked about this, EBITDA generation of $20 million to $30 million from this business, and we expect it to stay somewhere under our -- there will be an occasional market dislocation like we just saw. But generally, $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA generation. That doesn't mean the earnings will be consistently that way. We will be doing adjustments to our EBITDA, where some quarters, it may be quite a bit bigger; some quarters, less. But over a year, it would average out to that $20 million to $30 million. So hopefully, that answers your question. But there's not huge credit exposure for us as a company other than the just normal ongoing business activities of Sequent."

So of the 16 now projects that we have, it's over $250 million of investment opportunities we would expect and we have a goal for at least half of those projects to achieve what we're considering FID this year. That -- I'm pretty confident that all those projects will get where we need to be. But the primary initial gating item is making sure we've got sufficient land, and that's really what drives the ultimate size and scope of the project. And so that's what we're spending the most time on, on the front end here. But I'd say we still have pretty strong line of sight to the kind of scale that we identified during our Investor Day."

We still think there's a great need for natural gas in that market. There's still a great opportunity to take fuel oil out of that market and improve the emissions profile in the Northeast.

Our long-term strategy of connecting the fastest-growing natural gas markets with the best supplier continues to deliver solid financial results as demonstrated by our strong second quarter financials across our key metrics. Our stellar results this year were supported by equally strong fundamentals that demonstrate how sticking to this strategy has put us in an enviable position. 
As evidenced, Williams gas gathering volumes grew 6% in the first half of 2021, while the U.S.'s natural gas production volumes actually declined by 0.4%, continuing to prove that our assets are in the low-cost basins. 
We expect a constructive natural gas macro backdrop to continue to drive significant value for our business. Recent commitments to Transco market area expansions, coupled with producer commentary on Transco projects such as our Leady South and Regional Energy Access projects are clear pathways to growth for our Northeast gathering volumes for years to come. We will walk through more details of our business in just a moment, but I want to first call attention to our 2020 sustainability report, which we just published last week. 
As this report details, we are making headway on critical ESG-related fronts. For example, becoming the first North American midstream company to set a near-term climate goal based on right here, right now emission reduction opportunities and making steady progress on developing our leaders for the future. 
We're also looking to the future as our nationwide infrastructure footprint is well suited and adaptable to renewable energy sources like clean hydrogen and RNG blending. Williams' ongoing focus on sustainable operations positions us well to meet clean energy demand for generations to come. In fact, we are now up to 7 renewable natural gas sources flowing into our gas transportation systems, and we have 9 more that are in progress. I hope you can find some time to visit our website and read our new sustainability report. But right now, let me turn things over to John Chandler for a review of our 2Q and year-to-date results. John?"

At a very high-level summary, the quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year",1473,"Thanks, Alan. At a very high-level summary, the quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year and contributions from our upstream operations in the Wamsutter. The positives were offset somewhat by slightly higher operating expenses resulting from increased incentive compensation expenses, reflective of the strong performance that is unfolding this year. And you can see the strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, once again, we saw improvement in our key financial metrics. 
First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $77 million or 6%, and we have seen a 9% increase in EBITDA year-to-date. We will discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased $0.02 a share or 8% and AFFO grew for the quarter similar to our growth in EBITDA. AFFO is essentially cash from operations, including JV cash flows and excluding working capital fluctuations. If you put our year-to-date AFFO of $1.948 billion up against our capital investments year-to-date of $737 million and our dividends of $996 million, we have generated about $250 million of excess cash year-to-date. 
Included, as a side note, included in the capital investments is about $160 million of maintenance capital. Also, you can see our dividend coverage based on AFFO divided by dividends is a healthy 1.96x year-to-date. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter, along with continued capital discipline has led to our exceeding our leverage metric goal where we're currently set at 4.13x debt-to-EBITDA. You will see later in our guidance update in this deck that we've moved our guidance for the year from being around 4.2x by the end of the year to now less than 4.2x debt-to-EBITDA for the year. So really strong performance for the quarter and the year, and the fundamentals are set up for a good second half of the year. 
So now let's dig a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. Our upstream operations added $19 million of incremental EBITDA this quarter. And this EBITDA was entirely from our Wamsutter upstream acreage. Remember that we owned at the BP Wamsutter acreage the entire quarter, but only owned the Southland acreage for 1 month during the quarter. Production from the combined Wamsutter assets totaled 6.9 Bcf for the quarter. The Haynesville upstream acreage produced very little EBITDA, given it has only a small amount of PDP reserves. And therefore, it will take some time before we see new production and therefore, new EBITDA coming from these assets. 
Now moving to our transmission in Gulf of Mexico assets. They produced results that were $31 million more than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $25 million in incremental revenues versus the second quarter last year, including the Southeastern Trails project that went into service during the fourth quarter of last year, as well as a portion of the Leidy South project that also went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. And you can see this evidenced in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 5% from the second quarter of 2020. 
In addition, our Gulf of Mexico revenues were up somewhat due to less head-in issues compared to the second quarter of last year. In addition, commodity margins from processing volumes for processing the Gulf of Mexico gas was about $5 million due to higher NGL prices and higher volumes. Evident increases were offset somewhat by a slight increase in expense, again, mostly due to employee-related expenses, a large part of which can be attributed to higher incentive compensation accruals. 
The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $46 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 750 Mcf a day or 9% this quarter versus the second quarter of last year, while processing volumes grew 33% and set a new record. The volume growth was predominantly at our JVs in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019; and at our Marcellus South supply basin, where we benefited from more productive wells of larger pads. And just to be clear, because we do not operate Blue Racer Midstream, those volumes are not included in our volume statistics. As a result of this volume growth, though, our EBITDA from our equity method investments improved by a little over $36 million, which also includes the benefit of additional profits that we do receive from Blue Racer Midstream due to the additional ownership we acquired in mid-November last year. 
Now moving to the West G&P segment. It was down $21 million compared to the prior year. However, remember that first, we did agree to reduce gathering rates in the Haynesville in return for receiving upstream acreage in the South Mansfield area of the Haynesville. Again, as I mentioned, we are not yet seeing the benefit of those upstream assets but we have just named an operator to begin developing that acreage. The impact of the rate reduction was about a negative $15 million for the quarter. In addition, in the quarter, we also saw $9 million less EBITDA due to a deficiency that we paid us last year related to OPPL, which allowed them to pull volume that they had otherwise submitted to OPPL last year. One Oak does not have that volume obligation to OPPL this year, and therefore, we did not see the deficiency revenue this year. And finally, we did see a $9 million decline in deferred revenue from our Barnett Shale gathering assets, which is a noncash step down in revenues. 
So other than those 3 negatives, namely the lack of efficiency revenue on OPPL, the Haynesville rate decline and the deferred revenue step down in the Barnett, our West assets were otherwise up $12 million versus the second quarter of last year. And this is in large part due to higher NGL margins, where once again, in our commodity marketing group is realizing more profit from elevated NGL prices. And while our overall gather volumes in the West were down about 3.5% versus the second quarter of last year, this was more than offset by better gathering rates, where in the [indiscernible] and the Barnett, our contracted gathering rates are influenced by commodity prices. 
So now moving to year-to-date results. Year-to-date, our results show growth of $230 million of EBITDA or roughly 9% both in EBITDA, driven, of course, by the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter and by many of the same positive factors that I just mentioned affecting second quarter growth. Combined between our marketing activities and our upstream operations in the Wamsutter, Winter Storm Uri had a combined positive impact of $77 million. In addition, our upstream operations otherwise have added $27 million year-to-date. 
Our transmission in Gulf of Mexico assets are up $22 million year-to-date or about 2% better. With this increase being driven largely by additional transmission revenues from new projects that have been put into service and incremental revenue from Gulf of Mexico assets, largely due to lower downtime this year versus last year. These positives were partially offset by lower revenues from 1 less billing day on a regulated transmission pipeline and higher expenses, where, last year, expenses were delayed due to some due to COVID and because this year again, are higher due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting from our strong performance. 
Our North G&P assets are up $78 million, almost entirely driven by profits from our JV investments, namely from the Rapid Supply Hub gathering system and our Marcellus South gathering systems. In addition, we benefited from the increased ownership of Blue Racer Midstream. In total, gathering volumes for the Northeast are up 10% versus 2020, while processing volumes year-to-date are up 24%. 
And then finally, the West, West E&P is up $23 million versus next year, and this is on top of the $55 million that we earned from Winter Storm Uri. The $23 million increase is driven by higher commodity margins and slightly lower operating costs, offset by lower Barnett deferred revenues, lower Haynesville gathering rates, which were exchanged for upstream acreage, and lower open yield efficiency revenues, as mentioned in my remarks. Otherwise, we did see a 5% gathering volume decline year-to-date, but that again was more than offset by MPC and higher gathering rates, as again, I mentioned in my second quarter remarks. Again, this is stacking up to be a very good year for us. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to cover a number of key investor focus areas. Alan?"

Well, thanks, John, and we're moving on here to the key focus areas here on Slide 4. First of all, regarding our financial expectations, we are on track to generate EBITDA closer to the high end of our guidance range that we just increased at the last earnings call. The resilience of our business has supported our financial results and helped us recently overachieve against our previous leverage metric goal of 4.2x. As a result, we recently received a Moody's upgrade to Baa2 and now have a BBB equivalent credit rating amongst the 3 key rating agencies. 
Our free cash flow outlook for 2021 remains intact. And in fact, the long-range plan unveiled during our most recent Board strategy session forecasted continued steady growth in EBITDA and continued improvement in our credit metrics. Importantly, our long-range plan also shows that even after funding these many growth opportunities, our business is poised to generate significant excess free cash flows that will support a robust and multifaceted capital allocation approach that will enhance returns for our shareholders, including the potential for opportunistic share buybacks, so stay tuned on this front. 
Next, looking at our recent transactions and project development. Our -- first of all, the upstream JVs, great effort on the organization here. As we announced last month, we were able to finalize an upstream joint venture with Crowheart in the Wamsutter basin, consolidating our legacy BP Southland and Cohort upstream assets into 1 contiguous footprint of more than 1.2 million acres. So as we've mentioned before, this acreage was very divided and checker-boarded out here. And so being able to consolidate these assets in a way that it can be developed at a low cost is really critical to the value of the upstream business, important to us to the midstream business and taking advantage of the latent capacity we have out there today. 
And just recently, we inked a joint venture with GeoSouthern in the Haynesville that provides us with the following benefits: first, it unlocks significant midstream value for Williams through GeoSouthern's obligation to develop the South Mansfield acreage. Under this agreement, GeoSouthern will carry a portion of our drilling cost and will earn increased ownership in the leaseholds as they deliver on agreed to development milestones. Second, it provides Williams with the opportunity to optimize all of the natural gas production in the area through fixed fee agreements marketed by our Sequent business. And third, South Mansfield being in close -- with South Mansfield being in close proximity to Transco, it provides Williams future development opportunities, including the ability to source and deliver responsibly sourced natural gas into the growing LNG market. Importantly, both of these recent JVs improved the value proposition in the Wamsutter and the Haynesville basins as we're partnering with well-positioned, high-performing local operators and the deals require development of the properties driving volumes to our midstream and downstream assets. 
From a project execution standpoint, we continue to deliver on multiple fronts, including bringing online key projects such as Leidy South, which is on track for an early in-service now before the winter heating season. And importantly, Transco growth opportunities remain highly visible, and we've recently received customer commitments for 2 new market expansion projects in the Mid-Atlantic region. 
Transco also has ample runway to provide additional low-risk growth through rate-based modernization projects. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we continue to highlight the great growth continues to show for us out here, and we've recently reached definitive agreements for both the Shenandoah and the Whale projects, these will contribute to significant EBITDA growth beginning in 2024. 
And then finally, on sustainability. I mentioned our sustainability report at the top of the call, and we also filed our carbon emissions disclosure with the Carbon Disclosure Project last week. I'll just add that we continue to leverage our natural gas-focused strategy and today's technology to deliver on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions. At the same time, natural gas and our infrastructure are enabling the next generation of clean energy technologies. 
The next wave of renewable power generation will be up against 2 key constraints: both the transmission and the storage of energy. No other energy infrastructure system integrates a reliable delivery network into critical population centers with a massive storage solution on the scale that natural gas transmission does. We believe our infrastructure can be a critical part of both near- and long-term solutions. We continue to advance our solar projects that were announced last year, and I'm pleased to share that we have 6 projects now awaiting approval from the grid operator with another 10 ready for the same regulatory approval by the end of 2021. In total, these 16 projects amount to about $150 million in CapEx, it should start to cash flows beginning in 2023. And we have another approximately $150 million of these similar projects that are under development. We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy networks to deliver on our country's clean energy future. 
And in fact, in a partnership with the University of Wyoming, we recently awarded a $1 million -- we were recently awarded a $1 million grant from the State of Wyoming to fund a feasibility study that would evaluate the creation of a green hydrogen hub near our operations in Wyoming. And this really is another example of how we continue to leverage our existing assets and footprint to drive clean energy solutions. In the Wamsutter, we now have 1.2 million acres dedicated to our midstream assets through the Crowheart JV. But in addition to that, we have about 200,000 acres where we own or control the surface rights, which we intend to leverage for clean energy development. 
So in closing, I'll reiterate that our intense focus on our natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable, with continued growth, improving returns and significant free cash flows. This has translated into a strong balance sheet and a well-covered and growing dividend. 
Our best-in-class long-haul pipelines, Transco, Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream, are in the right place and the right markets. And by design, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. We remain bullish on natural gas because we've recognized the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of the clean energy future. 
Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world. Our networks are critical to serving both domestic and global energy demand in a lower carbon and economically viable manner. 
And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Jeremy, as you know, the pricing run-up that we've had more recently and the continued demand growth is really starting to obviously put pressure and kind of wake up the forward markets a bit. And certainly, we are seeing responses from our producers looking to take advantage of that. The area of that, I would say, that we'll see kind of the quickest response to is probably the Haynesville and tremendous amount of drilling activity that's gearing up in the Haynesville right now. But as well, you heard you probably follow the comments from Cabot on their earnings call, strong response there to price there as well. And of course, in the Southwest, Marcellus and in the Utica as well, we're really seeing pretty strong response across all those areas. So I think it's important to note that this is not just a production issue. Demand continues to grow. And so if you're looking at 2Q comparisons, we've seen against the '19 2Q, we saw demand grow by 9%. And against a 2Q of '20, we saw it about of 5.6 -- sorry, yes, about 5.6%. So continued really strong growth going on, on the demand front. And we're obviously seeing prices respond to that. 
But I think, from our perspective, as we said all along, it really is demand that is going to drive our business and price will fluctuate as required to balance that, but it really is this demand -- continued steady demand growth that we're continuing to see. And obviously, as we saw last year, we don't expect the COVID or resurgence of COVID really to have any impact on that. We're continuing to see a steady healthy growth coming on the natural gas market. 
So as we look into '22, kind of hard to predict what gas demand will continue to do. But right now, certainly, the fundamentals are looking strong, and we are seeing a healthy producer response."

Or something systematic where a percentage of cash flow could be applied to that in a given year? Just wondering, at this stage, what your thoughts are on buybacks in those respects?"

So first of all, we did have a really important discussion with the Board last week. And I think probably what was most remarkable about that was the degree of free cash flows that continue to exist on top of funding growth capital on top of continued deleveraging that comes with that growth in EBITDA and being able to fund both rate base investments and new energy venture investments, allowing for all of that, we still are showing pretty significant excess amount of free cash flow. And so I think that's probably the biggest takeaway. 
In terms of a program, we are in the process of detailing that out with our Board and putting some specific parameters around that. But I can tell you that the recommendation will be that it will be somewhat opportunistic, but it will have some framework to it in terms of what appropriate pricing levels and what those drivers will be. And I can tell you from my perspective, that will likely be multiple of wherever our debt is trading. And if you think about that, our debt has continued to stay very steady, while stock price flipped around. And certainly, there will be those times where the market runs into its scares like we saw in March and April of last year. But in reality, the debt markets have been very steady and yet prices whipped around quite a bit. And so we think that will point to when the right opportunities are to acquire stock. So it will have parameters around it. It won't just be perfect. It won't be random, and will have parameters around it in both in terms of size and the drivers for that. We likely won't announce those specific multiples on the debt multiples, but that is how we're thinking about it right now and we will be announcing. We do intend to, I should say, announce the program once we get the details of that squared away with our Board."

And I would just say that we will be able to balance that and make decisions on that as we see fit through the process. But there is such a significant amount of excess cash flow coming off that we really feel like we can hit all of those things we'd like to in terms of both continued dividend growth, continued credit metric improvement investment in our rate base and driving earnings assessment in our rate base and new energy ventures. We can do all of that, and we still have pretty significant firepower left for share buybacks when the opportunity is right. 
So really, the message we -- folks ought to be getting is that the cash flow is very significant, and it allows us to invest in all of those measures to continue to drive shareholder value."

But I would just start and say that what will be most obvious to you is that we're going to invest where we have competitive advantages around our assets. And so obviously, that points to transportation. But we do believe that in places like Wyoming where we've got such big land mass available and we have the transportation, and we have the processing capabilities and the system is already set up. We don't think that's a stretch for us to at least study. 
So a couple of things. One, it is going to -- we're only going to be doing it where we're making decent returns. And that means that we're going to have to be using competitive advantages to get returns that are over and above kind of what the market is allowing today on that kind of investment. 
And then secondly, you should think about it in terms of us always making sure that we are not leaving an opportunity where we have a competitive advantage. We're not going to let one pass us by, so we're not letting any -- we're not going to be taking any strikes at the plate and making sure that as we see opportunities, that we're attacking those very quickly.

I would say it's early in the days of hydrogen and we are working with the hydrogen production side of the equation to ensure that it can be economic and then it can drive volumes to our infrastructure. So I think we will participate in a small way initially to ensure that, that technology develops in a way that complements our infrastructure and then we'll evaluate whether or not we would invest on an ongoing basis. 
We're working on -- you mentioned the Haynesville, we permitted our Regional Energy Access project in a way that we've defined as compatible with hydrogen blending. And we're working on a hydrogen project, a pilot project on our Regional Energy Access project that will involve us participating in the production of hydrogen. It will be a very small scale, but it will demonstrate that we can leverage our infrastructure and we will earn an attractive return on that kind of investment. We're looking at that across our entire footprint. And as that scales up, I think it will be exactly what Alan said, it will be do our strategic capabilities and assets provide us with an advantage and should we leverage that advantage into investing in hydrogen production? Or just be prepared to support that development and drive those volumes to our assets? But I can tell you, we're looking at it and read the table across our footprint to make sure that we're driving forward the right solutions to support our business."

And I'll give a little more color on the Haynesville structure that I think will help folks derive how much value that's going to contribute. But with GeoSouthern, we're thrilled to announce that partnership, they're a well-proven operator with a long track record of development. And with GeoSouthern, there is a drilling commitment of over 400,000 lateral feet that they will be pursuing. And you think about our acreage, it's highly contiguous and you see a map, there's a map in our appendix that shows how it's complementary with GeoSouthern's footprint. So there's a lot of long lateral inventory at very economic returns. And so we expect them they're incentivized. There are penalties that they don't meet those drilling commitments. But beyond that, we expect them to outperform the drilling commitment because it's highly economic opportunities. 
And as they perform, the initial economics, let's have GeoSouthern at 30% of the economics, Williams at 70% of the upstream economics, but they will carry us, our capital for upstream development up to a cap of $50 million. And once that cap is achieved, they will revert to having 75% of the upstream economics in [indiscernible] and Williams will have 25% of the upstream economics. So they're highly incentivized to continue that development. 
To give you an idea of how powerful that is for our midstream systems, that development, we would expect to drive somewhere around 400,000 to 500,000 dekatherms a day of volume to our midstream assets. That's incremental volume from what we have today. And that ramp occurs relatively fast over the next 18 to 24 months. And all of that gas is committed to our midstream systems at a fee of $0.32 for gathering and treating. And as Alan mentioned, that is primarily available capacity that will be extremely high margin for us. And on top of that, we then have the ability to market that gas and drive that gas towards downstream opportunities, including integration with Transco. We've talked about marketing through our newly acquired Sequent platform. We're going to be working on a wellhead-to-water responsibly sourced gas solution that we can offer to customers. And so just the base business alone, there's a lot of value to be driven to our midstream assets in that area. 
And if you do the math, it will rapidly outpace what we gave up from a fee reduction perspective with Chesapeake. And so that gives you kind of a picture of the Haynesville. In the Wamsutter, similar structure a little bit and it's a very big asset that we're working on. And again, thrilled with Crowheart as our partner. They have been in the basin for several years. If you look at the map in our appendix, you can really see the industrial logic, again, of partnering with Crowheart. We put together over 1 million acres of now contiguous acreage. And with Crowheart, there is a drilling commitment of over 500,000 lateral feet. And as we have announced, there's a 75-25 percent initial split with Crowheart at 75% and Williams at 25%. But as they achieve performance across that 500,000 lateral feet of development, they have the ability to earn up to a 50-50 split. And so they're highly incentivized to drive volume growth. 
And in the Wamsutter basin, again, we have latent capacity that's very high margin gathering and processing. It's dedicated to us. We gather and process for approximately $0.60 a dekatherm, so very high margin business in that basin. And we have today around 300 million cubic feet a day of volumes. That system has over 700 million cubic feet a day of capacity. So on top of the gas gathering and processing, we are now -- we've dedicated all of the NGLs to Williams at a fixed margin to Mont Belvieu pricing. And so we don't wear commodity price risk, and we cover a significant news for Overland Pass pipeline for Bluestem and our downstream partnership with Targa. So that hopefully gives a little bit of color on how those will drive value to our midstream and assets."

The Wamsutter has very significant PDPs today, and where the Haynesville acreage doesn't. So we'll need to be drilling that up to produce the midstream value and the upstream value. And that will all start coming on in '22 and really into '23. 
That Wamsutter, on the other hand, with gas prices being quite a bit higher, is significantly paying for itself. And I'm not going to give you exact numbers here, but I can tell you what we paid for the South for the acreage for BP will be completely paid for in less than 2 years and with where we see gas prices and just PDP production. And of course, that development will occur and we're going to see meaningfully about the uplifts coming in the future beyond 2022 as those new wells drilled and that production comes on. 
So in the Wamsutter, you can get a sense of the return there just simply because of the PDP production and the gas prices, we'll return our capital very significantly in a very short time frame. In the Haynesville, as we look at total NPV value, yes, we did give up rates with Chesapeake and the Northern part of our system. They're bringing more rigs to work in that part of the system. But the value of that acreage as it's developed and we look at -- I won't give you an exact number, but when you look at NPV, the value generation is at least $300 million, actually higher than that over the life of this. And that combination of the upstream value and the midstream value uplift from this from the South Mansfield acreage."

And so the fee reduction has incentivized significant activity that will show up on its own as incremental earnings over time. But also, as John mentioned, the South Mansfield transaction, we see that as virtually tripling the value of that give from an NPV perspective. So really, with Chesapeake made the pie much larger, and we were both able to benefit from that transaction."

We think that, that opportunity set is attractive economically, but relatively small in scale. We've talked about a couple of hundred million dollars of potential investment. We have a few projects that we are evaluating, but we could invest in the actual aggregation and processing of those volumes. 
The project that we've done so far have primarily been just interconnects into our existing infrastructure. But the technology required for those investments is relatively straightforward. I will say it's one of the areas that we look at that is heavily dependent upon LCFS credits and RINs. And that is an area where, again, we're going to be disciplined in our investments. We're not going to develop our entire business strategy around areas that require heavily subsidized economics.

So it's not saying that we won't find ways to monetize that on the front end or let somebody else take that risk, but I do think that's a risk worth keeping your eye on given the -- if you add up all of the various projects where there's a CO2 carbon capture on ethanol load that that's putting on there and the loaded R&D starts to put them on there. It starts to be a pretty big number. So I think that's an important thing to keep your eye on as an investment."

So not sure exactly how it once are ultimately play out over long term and the Haynesville is pretty clear that as long as the drilling curves like we expect, as Alan said, in a 2- or 3-year time frame, it converts over to midstream value. 
In the meantime, our credit metrics are so strong right now and our coverage of our dividend and coverage of cash flows. We've talked to rating agencies about this, and I don't sense a concern at all about it. But again, as Alan pointed out in his opening comments, we do see growth coming in our business from EBITDA, which creates natural deleveraging and allows us to do a lot of incremental things in addition to what we're doing today and still see those metrics improve.

But that's really what makes this work and kind of transition us -- transitions us out of the upstream piece of it and into the midstream cash flows pretty quick. So as we've said all along, our goal is to get those developed rapidly and get the cash flows moving on that. 
In the Haynesville, that's a short-term issue and on set, that's a longer-term issue just because it's such an enormous deal that will -- is going to be provided -- has such a tremendous amount of inventory in that area. So what it really is the cash margin of the midstream business that is really powerful for us.

But I would say we're seeing very active producer activity up there from EQT and Southwestern as well as Cansino as a private operator, and they are chasing those liquid-rich well pad drill out right now, and that's why we're seeing a lot of activity there and really pleased that our processing capacity is not full."

And so we've had some acquisitions that have -- are still included in that range that we've put out, so that's driving us. Next year, Leidy South will be completed. In the fourth quarter of this year, most of the capital spending obviously will occur prior to that. 
And then as we get into next year, hopefully, we'll start spending towards the end of the year on Regional Energy Access. If we're fortunate on the permitting process, most of that spending will be in '23. But in addition to that, as we get into '23, the spending for Whale will hit as well. So it's looking pretty levelized, frankly, with this year being driven a little bit higher than we would have expected with some of the acquisitions that we've done. But next year, continued expansion in a lot of these projects that we've mentioned. So it's -- looks like a pretty relatively steady run at kind of the current rate and capital spending."

Next year, we see EBITDA growth. We're not giving explicit guidance on that today. But if you think about it, if we just put a 4x multiple against any EBITDA growth, that still allow us to be leveraging from a 4.13 level today.

I think it's an interesting time right now because there is this big drive to everybody is very focused on emissions reduction they're starting to be a sobering, if you will, and a realization of what that means from a cost standpoint to consumers.

And it has to be economic. Otherwise, we're just shipping jobs and industry off to other countries. 
And so I would just say there's kind of a reconciling going on, if you will, between, and no pun intended there, by the way, between the intense focus on carbon reductions and tackling that issue on the one hand and on the other issue doing it in a way that it actually is sustainable and we, as the U.S., can stay in control of our own destiny from an economic perspective. And so I think natural gas is extremely well positioned as those 2 things start to grind against each other and start to look for sensible intelligent solutions that we can really deliver on today. 
And so I would say I have seen some recognition start to go on as people start to actually think about what the cost of some of these solutions means both in terms of direct cost of consumer and in terms of reliability. And so the issues are starting to cover up a little bit as people really start to describe solutions. And so I think where natural gas is even better positioned right now then I kind of thought it would be because I am noticing that people are starting to pay attention to the impact on consumers."

Our long-term strategy of connecting the fastest-growing natural gas markets with the best supplier continues to deliver solid financial results as demonstrated by our strong second quarter financials across our key metrics. Our stellar results this year were supported by equally strong fundamentals that demonstrate how sticking to this strategy has put us in an enviable position.
As evidence, Williams gas gathering volumes grew 6% in the first half of 2021, while the U.S.'s natural gas production volumes actually declined by 0.4%, continuing to prove that our assets are in the low-cost basins. We expect a constructive natural gas macro backdrop to continue to drive significant value for our business. Recent commitments to Transco market area expansions coupled with producer commentary on Transco projects such as our Leidy South and Regional Energy Access projects are clear pathways to growth for our Northeast gathering volumes for years to come.
We will walk through more details of our business in just a moment, but I want to first call attention to our 2020 sustainability report, which we just published last week. As this report details, we are making headway on critical ESG-related fronts. For example, becoming the first North American midstream company to set a near-term climate goal based on right here, right now emission reduction opportunities and making steady progress on developing our leaders for the future. We're also looking to the future as our nationwide infrastructure footprint is well suited and adaptable to renewable energy sources like clean hydrogen and RNG blending.
Williams' ongoing focus on sustainable operations positions us well to meet clean energy demand for generations to come. In fact, we are now up to 7 renewable natural gas sources flowing into our gas transportation systems, and we have 9 more that are in progress. I hope you can find some time to visit our website and read our new sustainability report. But right now, let me turn things over to John Chandler for a review of our 2Q and year-to-date results. John?"
390225,1673718669,2360767,"The Williams Companies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","The Williams Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. At a very high-level summary, the quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year",1483,"Thanks, Alan. At a very high-level summary, the quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year and contributions from our upstream operations in the Wamsutter. These positives were offset somewhat by slightly higher operating expenses resulting from increased incentive compensation expenses, reflective of the strong performance that is unfolding this year.
And you can see the strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, once again, we saw improvements in our key financial metrics. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $77 million or 6%, and we have seen a 9% increase in EBITDA year-to-date. We will discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased $0.02 a share or 8% and AFFO grew for the quarter similar to our growth in EBITDA. 
AFFO is essentially cash from operations, including JV cash flows and excluding working capital fluctuations. If you put our year-to-date AFFO of $1.948 billion up against our capital investments year-to-date of $737 million and our dividends of $996 million, we have generated about $250 million of excess cash year-to-date. Included, as a side note, included in the capital investments is about $160 million of maintenance capital.
Also, you can see our dividend coverage based on AFFO divided by dividends is a healthy 1.96x year-to-date. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter, along with continued capital discipline, has led to our exceeding our leverage metric goal where we're currently set at 4.13x debt-to-EBITDA. You will see later in our guidance update in this deck that we've moved our guidance for the year from being around 4.2x by the end of the year to now less than 4.2x debt-to-EBITDA for the year.
So really strong performance for the quarter and the year, and the fundamentals are set up for a good second half of the year. So now let's dig a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. Our upstream operations added $19 million of incremental EBITDA this quarter. And this EBITDA was entirely from our Wamsutter upstream acreage.
Remember that we owned the BP Wamsutter acreage the entire quarter, but only owned the Southland acreage for 1 month during the quarter. Production from the combined Wamsutter assets totaled 6.9 Bcf for the quarter. The Haynesville upstream acreage produced very little EBITDA, given it has only a small amount of PDP reserves. And therefore, it will take some time before we see new production and therefore, new EBITDA coming from these assets.
Now moving to our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets. They produced results that were $31 million more than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $25 million in incremental revenues versus the second quarter last year, including the Southeastern Trails project that went into service during the fourth quarter of last year, as well as a portion of the Leidy South project that also went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. And you can see this evidenced in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 5% from the second quarter of 2020.
In addition, our Gulf of Mexico revenues were up somewhat due to less shut-in issues compared to the second quarter of last year. In addition, commodity margins from processing volumes for processing the Gulf of Mexico gas was about $5 million due to higher NGL prices and higher volumes. These revenue increases were offset somewhat by a slight increase in operating expenses, again, mostly due to employee-related expenses, a large part of which can be attributed to higher incentive compensation accruals.
The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $46 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 750 Mcf a day or 9% this quarter versus the second quarter of last year, while processing volumes grew 33% and set a new record. The volume growth was predominantly at our JVs in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019; and at our Marcellus South supply basin, where we benefited from more productive wells of larger pads. And just to be clear, because we do not operate Blue Racer Midstream, those volumes are not included in our volume statistics. As a result of this volume growth, though, our EBITDA from our equity method investments improved by a little over $36 million, which also includes the benefit of additional profits that we do receive from Blue Racer Midstream due to the additional ownership we acquired in mid-November last year.
Now moving to the West G&P segment. It was down $21 million compared to the prior year. However, remember that first, we did agree to reduce gathering rates in the Haynesville in return for receiving upstream acreage in the South Mansfield area of the Haynesville. Again, as I mentioned, we are not yet seeing the benefit of those upstream assets but we have just named an operating partner to begin developing that acreage. The impact of the gathering rate reduction was about a negative $15 million for the quarter. In addition, in the quarter, we also saw $9 million less EBITDA due to a deficiency fee that One Oak paid us last year related to OPPL, which allowed them to pull volume that they had otherwise submitted to OPPL last year. One Oak does not have that volume obligation to OPPL this year, and therefore, we did not see the deficiency revenue this year. And finally, we did see a $9 million decline in deferred revenue from our Barnett Shale gathering assets, which is a noncash step-down in revenues.
So other than those 3 negatives, namely the lack of efficiency revenue on OPPL, the Haynesville rate decline and the deferred revenue step-down in the Barnett, our West assets were otherwise up $12 million versus the second quarter of last year. And this is in large part due to higher NGL margins, where once again, in our commodity marketing group is realizing more profit from elevated NGL prices. And while our overall gather volumes in the West were down about 3.5% versus the second quarter of last year, this was more than offset by better gathering rates, where in the Piceance and the Barnett, our contracted gathering rates are influenced by commodity prices.
So now moving to year-to-date results. Year-to-date, our results show growth of $230 million of EBITDA or roughly a 9% in EBITDA, driven, of course, by the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter and by many of the same positive factors that I just mentioned affecting second quarter growth. Combined between our marketing activities and our upstream operations in the Wamsutter, winter storm Uri had a combined positive impact of $77 million. In addition, our upstream operations otherwise have added an additional $27 million year-to-date.
Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets are up $22 million year-to-date or about 2% better, with this increase being driven largely by additional transmission revenues from new projects that have been put into service and incremental revenues from Gulf of Mexico assets, largely due to lower downtime this year versus last year. These positives were partially offset by lower revenues from 1 less billing day on a regulated transmission pipeline and higher expenses, where, last year, expenses were delayed due -- some due to COVID and because this year's expenses, again, are higher due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting from our strong performance.
Our North G&P assets are up $78 million, almost entirely driven by profits from our JV investments, namely from the Bradford Supply Hub gathering system and our Marcellus South gathering systems. In addition, we benefited from the increased ownership of Blue Racer Midstream. In total, gathering volumes for the Northeast are up 10% versus 2020, while processing volumes year-to-date are up 24%.
And then finally, the West, West E&P is up $23 million versus the year-to-date last year, and this is on top of the $55 million that we earned from winter storm Uri. The $23 million increase is driven by higher commodity margins and slightly lower operating costs, offset by lower Barnett deferred revenues, lower Haynesville gathering rates, which were exchanged for upstream acreage, and lower OPPL deficiency revenues that I just mentioned in my 2Q remarks. Otherwise, we did see a 5% gathering volume decline year-to-date, but that again was more than offset by MVCs and higher gathering rates, as again, I mentioned in my second quarter remarks. Again, this is stacking up to be a very good year for us.
I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to cover a number of key investor focus areas. Alan?"

Well, thanks, John, and we're moving on here to the key investor focus areas here on Slide 4. First of all, regarding our financial expectations, we are on track to generate EBITDA closer to the high end of our guidance range that we just increased",1148,"Great. Well, thanks, John, and we're moving on here to the key investor focus areas here on Slide 4. First of all, regarding our financial expectations, we are on track to generate EBITDA closer to the high end of our guidance range that we just increased at the last earnings call. The resilience of our business has supported our financial results and helped us recently overachieve against our previous leverage metric goal of 4.2x. As a result, we recently received a Moody's upgrade to Baa2 and now have a BBB equivalent credit rating amongst the 3 key rating agencies.
Our free cash flow outlook for 2021 remains intact. And in fact, the long-range plan unveiled during our most recent Board strategy session forecasted continued steady growth in EBITDA and continued improvement in our credit metrics. Importantly, our long-range plan also shows that even after funding these many growth opportunities, our business is poised to generate significant excess free cash flows that will support a robust and multifaceted capital allocation approach that will enhance returns for our shareholders, including the potential for opportunistic share buybacks, so stay tuned on this front.
Next, looking at our recent transactions and project development. Our -- first of all, the upstream JVs, great effort on the organization here. As we announced last month, we were able to finalize an upstream joint venture with Crowheart in the Wamsutter basin, consolidating our legacy BP Southland and Crowheart upstream assets into 1 contiguous footprint of more than 1.2 million acres. So as we've mentioned before, this acreage was very divided and checker-boarded out here. And so being able to consolidate these assets in a way that it can be developed at a low cost is really critical to the value of the upstream business, important to us to the midstream business and taking advantage of the latent capacity we have out there today.
And just recently, we inked a joint venture with GeoSouthern in the Haynesville that provides us with the following benefits: first, it unlocks significant midstream value for Williams through GeoSouthern's obligation to develop the South Mansfield acreage. Under this agreement, GeoSouthern will carry a portion of our drilling cost and will earn increased ownership in the leaseholds as they deliver on agreed-to development milestones. Second, it provides Williams with the opportunity to optimize all of the natural gas production in the area through fixed fee agreements marketed by our Sequent business. And third, with the South Mansfield being in close -- with South Mansfield being in close proximity to Transco, it provides Williams with future development opportunities, including the ability to source and deliver responsibly-sourced natural gas into the growing LNG market. 
Importantly, both of these recent JVs improve the value proposition in the Wamsutter and the Haynesville basins as we're partnering with well-positioned, high-performing local operators and the deals require development of the properties driving volumes to our midstream and downstream assets. From a project execution standpoint, we continue to deliver on multiple fronts, including bringing online key projects such as Leidy South, which is on track for an early in-service now before the winter heating season. 
And importantly, Transco growth opportunities remain highly visible, and we've recently received customer commitments for 2 new market expansion projects in the Mid-Atlantic region. Transco also has ample runway to provide additional low-risk growth through rate-based modernization projects. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we continue to highlight the great growth it continues to show for us out here, and we've recently reached definitive agreements for both the Shenandoah and the Whale projects, these will contribute to significant EBITDA growth beginning in 2024.
And then finally, on sustainability. I mentioned our sustainability report at the top of the call, and we also filed our carbon emissions disclosure with the Carbon Disclosure Project last week. I'll just add that we continue to leverage our natural gas-focused strategy in today's technology to deliver on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions. At the same time, natural gas and our infrastructure are enabling the next generation of clean energy technologies.
The next wave of renewable power generation will be up against 2 key constraints: both the transmission and the storage of energy. No other energy infrastructure system integrates a reliable delivery network into critical population centers with a massive storage solution on the scale that natural gas transmission does. We believe our infrastructure can be a critical part of both near- and long-term solutions. 
We continue to advance our solar projects that were announced last year, and I'm pleased to share that we have 6 projects now awaiting approval from the grid operator with another 10 ready for the same regulatory approval by the end of 2021. In total, these 16 projects amount to about $250 million in CapEx. It should start to cash flows beginning in 2023, and we have another approximately $150 million of these similar projects that are under development. We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy networks to deliver on our country's clean energy future.
And in fact, in a partnership with the University of Wyoming, we recently awarded a $1 million -- we were recently awarded a $1 million grant from the State of Wyoming to fund a feasibility study that would evaluate the creation of a green hydrogen hub near our operations in Wyoming. And this really is another example of how we continue to leverage our existing assets and footprint to drive clean energy solutions. In the Wamsutter, we now have 1.2 million acres dedicated to our midstream assets through the Crowheart JV. But in addition to that, we have about 200,000 acres where we own or control the surface rights, which we intend to leverage for clean energy development.
So in closing, I'll reiterate that our intense focus on our natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable, with continued growth, improving returns and significant free cash flows. This has translated into a strong balance sheet and a well-covered and growing dividend. Our best-in-class long-haul pipelines, Transco, Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream, are in the right place and the right markets. And by design, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow.
We remain bullish on natural gas because we've recognized the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world. Our networks are critical to serving both domestic and global energy demand in a lower carbon and economically-viable manner. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Jeremy, as you know, the pricing run-up that we've had more recently and the continued demand growth is really starting to obviously put pressure and kind of wake up the forward markets a bit. And certainly, we are seeing responses from our producers looking to take advantage of that. The area that, I would say, that will see kind of the quickest response to is probably the Haynesville and tremendous amount of drilling activity that's gearing up in the Haynesville right now. 
But as well, you heard -- probably follow the comments from Cabot on their earnings call. Strong response there to price there as well. And of course, in the Southwest, Marcellus and in the Utica as well, we're really seeing pretty strong response across all those areas. So I think it's important to note that this is not just a production issue. Demand continues to grow. And so if you're looking at 2Q comparisons, we've seen against the '19 2Q, we saw demand grow by 9%. And against a 2Q of '20, we saw it grow about  5.6 -- sorry, yes, about 5.6%. So continued really strong growth going on, on the demand front. And we're obviously seeing prices respond to that.
But I think, from our perspective, as we said all along, it really is demand that is going to drive our business and price will fluctuate as required to balance that, but it really is this demand -- continued steady demand growth that we're continuing to see. And obviously, as we saw last year, we don't expect the COVID or a resurgence of COVID really to have any impact on that. We're continuing to see a steady, healthy growth coming on the natural gas market. So as we look into '22, kind of hard to predict what gas demand will continue to do. But right now, certainly, the fundamentals are looking strong, and we are seeing a healthy producer response."

So first of all, we did have a really important discussion with the Board last week. And I think probably what was most remarkable about that was the degree of free cash flows that continue to exist on top of funding growth capital, on top of continued deleveraging that comes with that growth in EBITDA and being able to fund both rate base investments and new energy venture investments. Allowing for all of that, we still are showing pretty significant excess amount of free cash flow. And so I think that's probably the biggest takeaway.
In terms of a program, we are in the process of detailing that out with our Board and putting some specific parameters around that. But I can tell you that the recommendation will be that it will be somewhat opportunistic, but it will have some framework to it in terms of what appropriate pricing levels and what those drivers will be. And I can tell you from my perspective, that will likely be a multiple of wherever our debt is trading. And if you think about that, our debt has continued to stay very steady while stock price has flipped around. And certainly, there will be those times where the market runs into its scares like we saw in March and April of last year. But in reality, the debt markets have been very steady and yet prices whipped around quite a bit.
And so we think that will point to when the right opportunities are to acquire stock. So it will have parameters around it. It won't just be perfect -- it won't be random, and will have parameters around it in both in terms of size and the drivers for that. We likely won't announce those specific multiples on the debt multiples, but that is how we're thinking about it right now. And we will be announcing -- we do intend to, I should say, announce the program once we get the details of that squared away with our Board."

And I would just say that we will be able to balance that and make decisions on that as we see fit through the process. But there is such a significant amount of excess cash flow coming off that we really feel like we can hit all of those things we'd like to in terms of both continued dividend growth, continued credit metric improvement investment in our rate base and driving earnings assessment in our rate base and new energy ventures.
We can do all of that, and we still have pretty significant firepower left for share buybacks when the opportunity is right. So really, the message we -- folks ought to be getting is that the cash flow is very significant, and it allows us to invest in all of those measures to continue to drive shareholder value."

Do you sort of see Williams as really just in the transportation aspect of it? And is that where you expect to invest? Will it be on the reformation side? Or do you actually see yourself participating capital-wise on electrolysis?
I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it because as I sort of think about your position in the Haynesville, it kind of seems like a blue hydrogen strategy would be very interesting where you could participate in creation and in the transportation to industrial centers in the Gulf Coast. So just kind of curious of where you feel Williams will be, let's say, in 3 to 5 years from now on the hydrogen strategy."

But I would just start and say that what will be most obvious to you is that we're going to invest where we have competitive advantages around our assets. And so obviously, that points to transportation. But we do believe that in places like Wyoming where we've got such big land mass available and we have the transportation, and we have the processing capabilities and the system is already set up. We don't think that's a stretch for us to at least study.
So a couple of things. One, it is going to -- we're only going to be doing it where we're making decent returns. And that means that we're going to have to be using competitive advantages to get returns that are over and above kind of what the market is allowing today on that kind of investment. And then secondly, you should think about it in terms of us always making sure that we are not leaving an opportunity where we have a competitive advantage.
We're not going to let one pass us by, so we're not letting any -- we're not going to be taking any strikes at the plate and making sure that as we see opportunities, that we're attacking those very quickly. So Chad, I don't know if there's anything you might add to that."

I think you said it in your remarks, we operate an incredible energy transmission and storage infrastructure, and we're very focused on ensuring that, that infrastructure is part of the solution for the next generation of energy. And so that's our primary focus. I would say it's early in the days of hydrogen and we are working with the hydrogen production side of the equation to ensure that it can be economic and that it can drive volumes to our infrastructure.
So I think we will participate in a small way initially to ensure that, that technology develops in a way that complements our infrastructure and then we'll evaluate whether or not we would invest on an ongoing basis. We're working on -- you mentioned the Haynesville. We permitted our Regional Energy Access project in a way that we've defined as compatible with hydrogen blending. And we're working on a hydrogen project, a pilot project on our Regional Energy Access project that will involve us participating in the production of hydrogen. It will be a very small scale, but it will demonstrate that we can leverage our infrastructure and we will earn an attractive return on that kind of investment. 
We're looking at that across our entire footprint. And as that scales up, I think it will be exactly what Alan said. It will be, ""Do our strategic capabilities and assets provide us with an advantage? And should we leverage that advantage into investing in hydrogen production? Or just be prepared to support that development and drive those volumes to our assets and infrastructure?"" But I can tell you, we're looking at it and read the table across our footprint to make sure that we're driving forward the right solutions to support our business."

And I'll give a little more color on the Haynesville structure that I think will help folks derive how much value that's going to contribute. But with GeoSouthern, we're thrilled to announce that partnership, they're a well-proven operator with a long track record of development. And with GeoSouthern, there is a drilling commitment of over 400,000 lateral feet that they will be pursuing. And you think about our acreage, it's highly contiguous and you see a map, there's a map in our appendix that shows how it's complementary with GeoSouthern's footprint.
So there's a lot of long lateral inventory at very economic returns. And so we expect them -- they're incentivized. There are penalties if they don't meet those drilling commitments, but beyond that, we expect them to outperform the drilling commitment because it's highly economic opportunities. And as they perform, the initial economic splits have GeoSouthern at 30% of the economics, Williams at 70% of the upstream economics, but they will carry us, our capital for upstream development up to a cap of $50 million. And once that cap is achieved, they will revert to having 75% of the upstream economics and Williams will have 25% of the upstream economics. So they're highly incentivized to continue that development.
To give you an idea of how powerful that is for our midstream systems, that development, we would expect to drive somewhere around 400,000 to 500,000 dekatherms a day of volume to our midstream assets. That's incremental volume from what we have today. And that ramp occurs relatively fast over the next 18 to 24 months. And all of that gas is committed to our midstream systems at a fee of $0.32 for gathering and treating. And as Alan mentioned, that is primarily available capacity that will be extremely high margin for us. And on top of that, we then have the ability to market that gas and drive that gas towards downstream opportunities, including integration with Transco.
We've talked about marketing through our newly acquired Sequent platform. We're going to be working on a wellhead-to-water responsibly-sourced gas solution that we can offer to customers. And so just the base business alone, there's a lot of value to be driven to our midstream assets in that area. And if you do the math, it will rapidly outpace what we gave up from a fee reduction perspective with Chesapeake. And so that gives you kind of a picture of the Haynesville. In the Wamsutter, similar structure a little bit and it's a very big asset that we were working on.
And again, thrilled with Crowheart as our partner. They have been in the basin for several years. If you look at the map in our appendix, you can really see the industrial logic, again, of partnering with Crowheart. And we put together over 1 million acres of now-contiguous acreage. And with Crowheart, there is a drilling commitment of over 500,000 lateral feet. And as we have announced, there's a 75-25% initial split with Crowheart at 75% and Williams at 25%. But as they achieve performance across that 500,000 lateral feet of development, they have the ability to earn up to a 50-50 split. And so they're highly incentivized to drive volume growth.
And in the Wamsutter basin, again, we have latent capacity that's very high margin gathering and processing. It's dedicated to us. We gather and process for approximately $0.60 a dekatherm, so very high margin business in that basin. And we have today around 300 million cubic feet a day of volumes. That system has over 700 million cubic feet a day of capacity. So on top of the gas gathering and processing, we are now -- we've dedicated all of the NGLs at Williams at a fixed margin to Mont Belvieu pricing. And so we don't wear commodity price risk, and we cover significant revenues for Overland Pass Pipeline for Bluestem and our downstream partnership with Targa. So that hopefully gives a little bit of color on how those will drive value to our midstream and downstream assets."

The Wamsutter has very significant PDPs today, and where the Haynesville acreage doesn't. So we'll need to be drilling that up to produce the midstream value and the upstream value. And that will really start coming on in '22 and really into '23.
That Wamsutter, on the other hand, with gas prices being quite a bit higher, is significantly paying for itself. And I'm not going to give you exact numbers here, but I can tell you what we paid for the South for the acreage from Southland and for BP will be completely paid for in less than 2 years and with where we see gas prices and just PDP production. And of course, that development will occur and you're going to see meaningful EBITDA uplifts coming in the future beyond 2022 as those new wells are drilled and that production comes on.
So in the Wamsutter, you can get a sense of the return there just simply because of the PDP production and the gas prices. We'll return our capital very significantly in a very short time frame. In the Haynesville, as we look at total NPV value, yes, we did give up rates with Chesapeake in the Northern part of our system. They're bringing more rigs to work in that part of the system, but the value of that acreage as it's developed and we look at that -- I won't give you the exact number, but when we look at NPV, the value generation is at least $300 million, actually higher than that, over the life of this. That's the combination of the upstream value and the midstream value uplift from this, from the South Mansfield acreage."

It's, I think, also a great example of creating a win-win for us and our customer. Chesapeake has been able to increase activity. And we, this time last year, Chesapeake was still not running rigs in the Haynesville. With the fee reduction that we offered, they now have 3 rigs running in their Springridge area. And so the fee reduction has incentivized significant activity that will show up on its own as incremental earnings over time. But also, as John mentioned, through the South Mansfield transaction, we see that as virtually tripling the value of that give back from an NPV perspective. So really, with Chesapeake made the pie much larger, and we're both able to benefit from that transaction."

I think we've said that we are willing to invest in RNG aggregation and processing if it makes sense from an economic perspective. And again, similar to what we talked about hydrogen, we have a strategic advantage. We have been looking at our footprint. We've been identifying sites that have potentially attractive economics from an RNG capture processing and delivery perspective. We think that, that opportunity set is attractive economically, but relatively small in scale. We've talked about a couple of hundred million dollars of potential investment. We have a few projects that we are evaluating where we could invest in the actual aggregation and processing of those volumes.
The project that we've done so far have primarily been just interconnects into our existing infrastructure. But the technology required for those investments is relatively straightforward. I will say it's one of the areas that we look at that is heavily dependent upon LCFS credits and RINs. And that is an area where, again, we're going to be disciplined in our investments. We're not going to develop our entire business strategy around areas that require heavily subsidized economics.
And so I think there's a place for it where we can drive significant value because of our strategic footprint. And I think we can invest at a level of modest and will -- and I would tell you because of those LCFS credits and dependency on those credits, we're identifying those opportunities in areas where we would have pretty rapid payback of those investments. So very attractive returns that would provide us with the confidence in those structures."

And if you start looking at the weight on the LCFS program to California, in particular, I think that's something we certainly are going to be paying attention to is the degree of sustainability of some of these credits and subsidies that are out there and making sure that we're not overinvesting against that risk.
So it's not to say that we won't find ways to monetize that on the front end or let somebody else take that risk, but I do think that's a risk worth keeping your eye on given the -- if you add up all of the various projects where there's a CO2 carbon capture on ethanol load that that's putting on there and the loaded R&D starts to put them on there. It starts to be a pretty big number. So I think that's an important thing to keep your eye on as an investment."

Again, the Haynesville, both deals are designed -- both structures in the Haynesville and Wamsutter are designed for us to reduce our interest.

And so whether that ultimately transfers to our partner or gets bought out in those, we don't have a long-term intent to be in the upstream business and intend just to do this to drive value in the midstream. So not sure exactly how Wamsutter ultimately plays out over long term and the Haynesville is pretty clear that as long as the drilling curves like we expect, as Alan said, in a 2- or 3-year time frame, it converts over to midstream value.
In the meantime, our credit metrics are so strong right now and our coverage of our dividend and coverage of cash flows. We've talked to rating agencies about this, and I don't sense a concern at all about it. But again, as Alan pointed out in his opening comments, we do see growth coming in our business from EBITDA, which creates natural deleveraging and allows us to do a lot of incremental things in addition to what we're doing today and still see those metrics improve.

But that's really what makes this work and kind of transition us -- transitions us out of the upstream piece of it and into the midstream cash flows pretty quick. So as we've said all along, our goal is to get those developed rapidly and get the cash flows moving on that.
In the Haynesville, that's a shorter-term issue and on Wamsutter, that's a longer-term issue just because it's such an enormous deal that will -- is going to be providing -- has such a tremendous amount of inventory in that area, so -- but it really is the cash margin of the midstream business that is really powerful for us.

But I would say if it is a new run rate for us just because our Oak Grove TXP III project came online in the first quarter. And obviously, we have filled that up in the second quarter and are running at full tilt there on our OVM processing for the most part. And so we are looking at opportunities to interconnect with our Blue Racer facilities and take advantage of some potential lease capacity that they may have.

And then as we get into next year, hopefully, we'll start spending towards the end of the year on Regional Energy Access. If we're fortunate on the permitting process, most of that spending will be in '23. But in addition to that, as we get into '23, the spending for Whale will hit as well.

Next year, we see EBITDA growth. We're not giving explicit guidance on that today. But if you think about it, if we just put a 4x multiple against any EBITDA growth, that still allow us to be leveraging from a 4.13 level today. And so any kind of reasonable amount of EBITDA growth adds substantially on top of that $1.7 billion that we're spending this year.

And so I would just say there's kind of a reconciling going on, if you will, between, and no pun intended there, by the way, between the intense focus on carbon reductions and tackling that issue on the one hand and on the other issue doing it in a way that it actually is sustainable and we, as the U.S., can stay in control of our own destiny from an economic perspective. And so I think natural gas is extremely well positioned as those 2 things start to grind against each other and start to look for sensible intelligent solutions that we can really deliver on today.
And so I would say I have seen some recognition start to go on as people start to actually think about what the cost of some of these solutions means both in terms of direct cost of consumer and in terms of reliability.

To go to an environmentally-backed statement will take a little bit longer for us. It shouldn't have an appreciable impact on the overall project schedule. We would still expect to have a FERC certificate next year in 2022 and then could begin construction later that year. We still plan for a Q4 2023 in-service date for the project as we stand today."

We do have a lot of good news to share with you today, but let me just start by saying that our long-term strategy of connecting the fastest-growing natural gas markets with the best supply areas continues to deliver exceptional financial results as demonstrated by these higher-than-expected third quarter financials.
As John will walk through in just a moment, we achieved all-time record results in the third quarter with our adjusted EBITDA up 12% compared to the same period last year, driven by growth across all 3 of our major business segments. Given our robust performance to date and continued strong fundamentals, we are raising our 2021 EBITDA guidance midpoint for the second time this year to a level that is now 8% above our realized 2020 results, which I'll remind you, came in above expectations last year in a very challenging backdrop. Not only did we deliver more on our financial performance this quarter than we expected, but we continue to make strides in executing on key projects and transactions that give us a clear line of sight to sustained growth for many years to come. We'll talk a little bit about that today.
But -- so for right now, let me turn it over to John to provide you some insight into the drivers of this all-time record quarter for Williams. John?"

First of all, just what an incredible quarter we had. At a very high-level summary, the quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year, significant contributions from our upstream operations in the Wamsutter and the benefit of higher commodity prices in our West segment.
The positives were offset somewhat by slightly higher operating expenses resulting from increased incentive compensation expenses, reflective of the strong performance that is unfolding for the year. And you can see that strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, once again, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics.
First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $153 million or 12%, setting a new record, and we've seen a 10% increase in EBITDA year-to-date. We'll discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased $0.07 a share or 26%. AFFO also grew significantly for the quarter, up $217 million or 25%. And AFFO, I'll remind you is essentially cash from operations including JV cash flows and excluding working capital fluctuations.
If you put our year-to-date AFFO of $3 billion, up against capital investments year-to-date of $1.2 billion, and dividends year-to-date of $1.5 billion, you can see that we generated over $300 million of excess cash year-to-date. Included in those capital investments I just mentioned were $307 million of maintenance capital. Also, you can see our dividend coverage based on AFFO divided by dividend is a healthy 2.17x for the quarter. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter along with continued capital discipline has led to our exceeding our leverage metric goal where we currently set at 4.04x net debt to EBITDA. You'll see later in our guidance update in the deck that we've moved our guidance for the year from where we were at less than 4.2x for the year now to around 4x at year-end. So a really strong performance for the quarter and the year, and the fundamentals are set up for a good fourth quarter and a very good 2022.
So now let's go to the next slide and dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, West performed very well, realizing $153 million or 12% higher EBITDA. Our upstream operations added $55 million to adjusted EBITDA this quarter. This is almost entirely from the Wamsutter upstream acreage. Production from the combined assets, mostly from Wamsutter, totaled 232 million CFEs a day for the quarter net to our ownership. Again, the Haynesville upstream acreage produces very little EBITDA, given it has only a small amount of existing PDP reserves. And therefore, it will take a little time before we see new production and therefore, EBITDA coming from those assets.
Our Transmission Gulf of Mexico assets produced results that were $8 million more than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $24 million in revenue versus the third quarter 2020 including the Southeastern Trails project that went into service in the fourth quarter of last year and a portion of the Leidy South project that also went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. And you can see this evidenced in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 4% from the third quarter of last year.
Offsetting this somewhat was Gulf of Mexico revenues that were down due to incremental impacts from hurricane shut-ins during the quarter from Hurricane Ida in comparison to the hurricane impacts in the third quarter of last year. Just so you have a number there, the incremental impact this year was a negative $5 million versus the third quarter of last year on hurricane impacts.
In addition, the transportation revenue increases were offset somewhat by a slight increase in operating expenses mostly due to employee-related expenses, a large part of which can be attributed to higher incentive compensation accruals. The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $46 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 470 million a day or 5% this quarter versus the third quarter of 2020, while processing volumes grew 20%. The volume growth was predominantly at our joint ventures in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019; and at our Marcellus South supply basin where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads.
And just to be clear, because we do not operate Blue Racer Midstream, those volumes are not included in the volume statistics I just quoted. As a result of these increased JV volumes, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by $45 million, which also included the benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer Midstream, again, due to our additional ownership we acquired in mid-November of last year.
Otherwise, in the Northeast, higher revenues from higher processing volumes were offset by higher expenses, again, with a significant portion of those expenses being related to higher incentive compensation accruals. If you go to the West, that segment improved by $48 million compared to prior year. $35 million of this increase is related to higher commodity margins due to higher natural gas and higher NGL prices. Otherwise, the remainder of the uplift in EBITDA comes from lower operating costs due to lower maintenance fees, and due to the absence of legal costs and small asset write-offs that occurred in the third quarter of last year. And revenues for the West were only up slightly compared to the same period last year.
Now there are a number of big items that go opposite directions and revenues that I'd like to point out. First of all, for example, remember that we lowered our gathering rates in the Haynesville this year in return for undeveloped upstream acreage from Chesapeake in the South Mansfield area in the Haynesville. The resulting gathering revenue decrease from this during this quarter was more than offset by rate increases in the Barnett and the Piceance where our gathering contracts allow us to participate in the upside when prices are higher.
Also last year, our partner on Overland Pass pipeline was paying us an efficiency fee to allow them to pull volume off of OPPO. Those deficiency fees do not exist this year. However, the absence of those fees are being offset by fees from higher gathering volumes otherwise. And to that point, overall gathering volumes in the West were up 1% with higher volumes in the Haynesville and the Piceance being offset somewhat by lower volumes in the Wamsutter and the Barnett.
And then finally, the Sequent segment produced near flat adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Sequent  traditionally makes a significant portion of its profit in the first couple of quarters of the year in the heart of the winter season and, therefore, did not realize profit for the quarter. Sequent does have a significant portion of their transportation capacity hedged with basis swaps as well as our storage inventory hedge with NYMEX positions, which, of course, led to the large $277 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on those hedges this quarter as prices increased and as basis differentials widened in some markets. This, of course, means that the intrinsic value of our storage and transportation positions have gone up significantly as well. And again, you'll see a significant portion of that value realized in the first half of 2022.
So now let's go to the year-to-date results. Again, our year-to-date results showed a strong growth of $383 million or 10% in adjusted EBITDA. Many profitable things are happening across all of our segments. First, I'd point to Winter Storm Yuri, which added $55 million in profits to the West, and it contributed $22 million of incremental profits to our upstream results. In addition, our upstream operations otherwise have added an additional $83 million year-to-date, almost entirely from the Wamsutter properties. Our transmission in Gulf of Mexico assets are up $30 million or 2% better with the increases being driven largely by additional transmission revenues from new projects that have been put into service and incremental revenues from Gulf of Mexico assets, largely due to lower downtime this year versus last year. These positives were partially offset by lower revenues due to a Transco rate case decline following the rate case final settlement in mid-2020 related to just a few markets. And as a reminder, a majority of our transfer rates actually increased in 2019.
In addition, expenses are higher this year year-to-date due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting again from our strong performance. The Northeast G&P is up $124 million for the year, almost entirely driven by profits from our JV investments, again, namely from the Bradford Supply Hub gathering systems and our Marcellus South gathering systems. In addition, we benefited from increased ownership in Blue Racer Midstream. In total, gathering volumes for the Northeast are up 8% over the third quarter of last year, while processing volumes are up 22%.
And then in the West, our West G&P is up $71 million, and this is on top of the $55 million that we earned from Winter storm Erie. The $71 million increase is driven by higher commodity margins, higher gathering rates in the Barnett and pads where we participate in the commodity upside and lower operating costs. These positives were offset somewhat by lower deferred revenue in the Barnett, Lower Haynesville gathering rates, which again, were exchanged for upstream acreage and lower Overland Pass Pipeline profits from lower actual volume shipped and the elimination of the deficiency payments that we were receiving in 2020. And while we did see a 4% gathering volume decline year-to-date in the West, that was mostly offset by minimum volume commitment payments.
Again, this is stacking up to be an incredible year for us. One other thing I do want to point out, we did pick up in some of the narratives from some of the analysts last night, the view that our operating costs increased. And we did ourselves a bit of a disservice by not providing more information on our other operating segment, where our E&P upstream operations reside. Actually, if you look on the face of our financial statements, our operating expenses went up $73 million, $12 million of that came from Sequent who, by the way, covered most of that with their profits. E&P went up $51 million on cost, but of course, they're making significant EBITDA. So they're covering that with their revenues. And then the rest is related to bonus expenses. So our expense is actually when you extract Sequent and E&P and the bonus costs are actually down otherwise. So we actually are not seeing a significant -- or seeing expense increases and in fact, the contrary to other than the bonus-related expenses. So I thought I'd clear that.
I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to cover a number of key investor focus areas. Alan?"

Well, thanks, John, and we'll move on here to Slide 4, covering key investor focus areas.Our natural gas focused strategy is delivering even better results than we expected in this high commodity price environment. Demand for natural gas in the t",1545,"Great. Well, thanks, John, and we'll move on here to Slide 4, covering key investor focus areas.
Our natural gas focused strategy is delivering even better results than we expected in this high commodity price environment. Demand for natural gas in the third quarter was surprisingly inelastic against this higher-than-expected pricing environment. And while we would prefer more moderate natural gas prices for our business over the long haul, the recent demand resilience highlights the near- and long-term role that natural gas will play as a complement to growing demand for renewable energy and emission reduction in general.
The past 18 months have demonstrated the benefits of our high-quality portfolio of contracts through which we've thoughtfully built a business that is durable in the down cycles, but exposed to upside potential when it is available. This quarter's results show how meaningful that upside can be even after excluding our upstream results. Along these lines, we also have contracted our business over the years to be protected from inflationary environments and we see additional upside potential in our G&P businesses due to contract terms that adjust our rates for inflation. In short, our business and its contractual portfolios are set up with a long-term investor in mind and are positioned to thrive through these cycles.
So looking at our financial strength and focus on long-term shareholder value here. We are increasing our '21 financial guidance for the second time this year, as we mentioned, with our EBITDA midpoint now residing $5.525 billion, and that is 8% higher than last year's strong $5.105 billion of EBITDA. And of course, that was a fee by itself in the environment that we are in. So we're really excited to show our durability in the down cycle and our exposure here on the positive side as well coming through.
And while the past few years have been characterized by lower commodity prices and reduced producer customer activity, among other challenges, our updated '21 EBITDA and EPS guidance, the midpoint translates into a 3-year CAGR of 6% on the EBITDA and 17% on the EPS. So a 3-year CAGR on our EPS now at 17% at that midpoint. And of course, this is proving up our ability to produce reliable and growing earnings under a variety of market conditions. Our financial results in '21 continued to derisk our balance sheet, which is now at about 4.0 leverage. And also of note, we recently issued $1.25 billion of 10-year and 30-year bonds at the most attractive interest rates ever issued here at Williams. This is significant because we are now positioned to allocate capital to a variety of options that will provide compounding value to our long-term shareholders. To this end, we've continued to grow our stable quarterly dividend through our investors and remain steadfast in maintaining the long-term security of the dividend. And most recently, we unveiled our long-term capital allocation priorities, including a $1.5 billion opportunistic share repurchase program that has the potential to enhance shareholder returns beyond the dividend.
And perhaps most unique to Williams as we think about capital allocation is the option we have to grow dependable earnings by investing in the modernization of our regulated transmission systems, which will both grow earnings and as well reduce submissions across our footprint.
So next here, looking at growth. From a project execution point, we continue to deliver on multiple fronts, including bringing online key projects such as Leidy South, which we are targeting to bring into full service earlier than projected and importantly, before the winter heating season. And while projects such as REA remain in the execution phase, we've continued to receive interest in demand pool projects on the Transco system. Our 2 recently announced Mid-Atlantic expansions will add a little more than 500 million a day of capacity on the system. And in the coming weeks, we expect to secure a precedent agreement for another system expansion, bringing a total of 3 incremental expansion projects on Transco just here in the last half of '21.
Our natural gas fundamentals are not only supportive of our transmission assets, but also our G&P business. And our gathering volumes continue to grow at a rate of nearly 10x the lower 48 U.S. gas production volumes. This, of course, was led by the Marcellus growth where we are also growing a rate that is almost double that of our competitors. And you can see the layout of that in some slides we put in the appendix.
With projects like Leidy South and REA providing takeaway out of the basin, we expect our gathering volumes in the Northwest -- Northeast story to remain resilient. In fact, we expect to announce a system expansion in the basin soon, underscoring that we don't see takeaway constraints of the near term deterrent to volume growth in our systems there in our Northeast gathering area.
And finally, on sustainability. As we think about sustainability, both today and into the future, our highly reliable natural gas infrastructure is extremely well positioned to continue replacing higher carbon fuels while supporting the growth of renewable energy and responsibly sourced natural gas for LNG export. We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy networks to deliver on our country's clean energy future.
And to this end, we are pursuing emerging opportunities like a hydrogen hub near our assets in Southwestern Wyoming and are evaluating a large-scale co-development of wind energy, electrolysis and synthetic gas methanation in the State of Wyoming as part of our recently announced MOU with Worster. Our solar initiative continues to move forward as we now advance the execution of now 12 projects on our systems. And those are, as we've mentioned before, large solar arrays that will provide power for our fairly large loads on our compression and processing facilities.
Now looking at our renewable natural gas efforts. We set a 2021 goal of adding an incremental 5 million a day of renewable natural gas and we now expect to exceed that goal. We recently signed an interconnect that should enable up to 10 million cubic feet per day of a new source of RNG supply, bringing our entire R&G portfolio, close to 25 million cubic feet per day with in-service dates in the '22 through '23 time frame. So a lot going on, on that front. Team's doing a great job of making sure that we're capturing opportunities in and around our assets there.
We do remain steadfast in the view that natural gas will play a role in the world's clean energy future and our latest efforts to advance responsibly sourced gas through the value chain will provide transparency on the sustainability of our operations and help to solidify the role of natural gas in reducing emissions. We're also pursuing sustainable investment opportunities and are pleased to be partnering on 2 strategies with Energy Impact Partners, an investment firm that makes venture and growth investments in companies that are optimizing energy consumption and improving sustainable energy. Williams is among the first midstream investors in the platform, and we're expecting to facilitate diverse investment opportunities that reduce emissions and advance our ESG goals.
Finally, our ongoing focus on sustainable operations continues to deliver strong results that are being recognized by our key rating agencies in this space. Williams sits in the top quartile for our industry with rankings that reflect the dedication of our team towards doing the right thing from an ESG perspective.
So here in closing, a lot of really positive things to report on this quarter, demonstrating that our intense focus on natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued growth, improving returns and significant free cash flows. This has translated into a strong balance sheet and a well-covered and growing dividend. And our best-in-class long-haul pipes like Transco, Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream are in the right place and in the right markets.
And by design, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. The triple punch of benefits provided by American sourced natural gas must not be understated as we work to accelerate our clean energy future around the world. As we work to balance sustainability and climate goals with growing energy demand, natural gas will remain a key component of the fuel mix and should be prioritized as renewables complement to more aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world.
Natural gas does provide a right here, right now, emissions reduction solution that is economically viable and can keep industry and manufacturing here at home. Williams Transmission & Storage networks are extremely well positioned to aggregate and bring scale to multiple mission reduction opportunities taking out higher carbon fuels while supporting renewable energy and emerging opportunities like hydrogen and carbon capture.
So in closing, we produced tremendous 3Q results. But more importantly, we have an unmatched platform to continue to deliver growth and lower emissions at the same time. We look forward to helping our customers and stakeholders meet their goals in an environmentally and financially sustainable manner.
And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

One of those that you heard John mention is we did take an accrual for bonuses for the year and both on our long-term incentive comp as well. I see a lot of people adjusting that out of their EBITDA. We don't adjust that out of our EBITDA. So our long-term incentive comp. And we did take some accruals for that as well as our annual bonus, which obviously, with this kind of performance, we'll be paying out. And so those -- that was a hit to the quarter that would be negative.
On the other side of that, we had about $24 million, I believe, of pricing increase on our NGLs and inventory. And so to the degree that, that doesn't increase again, that would offset against that positive that shows up in the quarter. So that's kind of a nonoperational issue, if you will. We have to price that inventory up, but to the degree that NGL prices don't move again, and that wouldn't show up. So that's a couple of 1 positive, 1 negative. I would just say, we pay attention to the forward strip when we think about our forecast and in our guidance. And obviously, those are backward dated as we sit here. And so our expectations would be the same moving forward.
As it relates to the E&P business, I will say that that's not a huge driver of our business, obviously. It's pretty measured, as you can see. It will become larger in '22 as we start -- as the Haynesville starts to get developed, that will be a net positive where we will build a larger sensitivity to gas prices in '22 as the Haynesville starts to be developed. So I would just say we're -- we know this was a good quarter in terms of pricing, and we're not going to build our business in a way that's just sustained off of high commodity prices, and that's hopefully evident in how we forecast our business as well. So nice to take the winnings when they come to us, but we're not going to build -- we're not going to forecast our business around that. Obviously, if prices do stay high, then we'll certainly see the rewards from that."

I think as it relates to things like increasing the 45Q amount. Obviously, that would be positive for us, particularly as we think about utilizing our infrastructure for carbon capture and in places like the Gulf Coast where we have a pretty sizable footprint that extends out to some of those water drive reservoirs that could be key targets for carbon sequestration. So lots of positives, I think, in that area.
On the methane emissions issue, we are really encouraging that to be done in a way that rewards those who reduce methane emissions. We think it's smart to continue to put focus on methane emission reductions, and we're extremely well positioned for that. But we would much prefer one that rewards the good actors in that and not just a pure attack, but one that does incent those that have been working to reduce their emissions, and we think we stand out in that regard, and we think that would be a net positive for us if it's positioned that way. Obviously, we think that makes sense when you're talking about the lowest carbon content hydrocarbon. It seems a little bit odd that you would just put a pure tax on that when it has such an ability to help reduce emissions around the world.
So we're hopeful that we'll get to a wide place on that, but we think that actually could be positioned in a way that could be somewhat of a positive for us. So we look forward to that. So I think that's -- I don't know Chad or..."

I would tell you, I think on balance, obviously, we prefer a lower corporate tax rate and an alternative in fact, in the inverse, AMP is just timing of tax payments, higher tax rates forever and permanent. So if that's where we land with AMT, that's not terrible for us. The question is going to really be around NOL usage against -- and so under the old tax scheme when we had an alternate tax before, you could take up to 80% of your NOLs against your income for the alternative minimum tax calculation. That's not clear in the current legislation. As we've thought about it, we've seen -- let's say we could take 50% or take 50% of your income out usage of NOLs. That alternative minimum tax would be not that sizable for us. We'd probably be able to cover it with excess cash flow. So that's how we look at it now. But just to be clear, there's still a lot of questions around the usage of NOLs going forward. Can you use 50%, 80% or use them at all? And so that's still yet to be understood. And just us an additional fact that we're carrying forward $4 billion of net operating -- of NOLs."

And I would just say that we've been pretty clear about how we're thinking about that, and it is a a multiple of the cost of our 10-year debt cost in the market for 10-year debt cost. And so you can see that that spread, but price actually kind of widened or did widen. And so that yield continued to go down and therefore move away from that multiple during the period since we announced the buyback. But I would say as we don't make investment in that or if we continue to invest in earnings, either one of those will continue to drive our credit metrics to a more positive place, which will drive down the 10-year debt, which then will improve the price on that or the -- would lower the yield, which we would invest in. So I think it's pretty natural in terms of how that will occur. If money is flowing in a way that is improving our credit metrics, you would expect our 10-year rate to continue to improve, which would continue to lower the yield and eventually, we would hit a point in which we would be buying back, but we certainly stand ready. And if that price moves of that zone, we'll be anxious to be taking advantage of that, if that occurs.
So nothing's really changed from our perspective on that other than the fact that our PAUSE amount of free cash flow continues to expand and accelerate, but other than that, nothing has really changed here. We announced that."

First, to the projects, I would just say our returns generally continue to improve. One that's kind of been -- as we've said many times, there's kind of a double-edged sword about the difficulty of building projects. It certainly has, I think, been detrimental to the country and the industry overall. But to the degree that you're the incumbent with pipe in place and you can expand those via brownfield that it effectively expands our return opportunity in that regard. So I would just say that the returns in general, not saying that they always will be that way. But in general, these returns that for these -- the Mid-Atlantic projects that we're mentioning are at least as good as Atlantic Sunrise or better. And so that's kind of the way to think about that REAs and attractive return projects as well.
And the question of how many do you have, we keep the slide updated in there about the number of projects in development in our appendix. And it always looks like it's the same old slide, but in reality, that we are moving projects from development into execution, and we have new projects flowing in there that are keeping that pipeline very full. So I would just tell you, we don't see much backing off in the way of opportunity for expansions of our transmission systems. And with that, obviously, will flow gas from the low-cost producing areas, and we're well positioned to capture that on the gathering side as well. So despite what you might think when you listen to the media and the rhetoric, it's certainly not showing up and people's reluctance to make long-term commitments to our transmission systems for supplies that they know they're going to need, whether that's to back up renewables or whether it is a base load that it's people and our customers certainly understand that it takes time to build these projects and then it takes long-term commitments to being built, and that's what we're continuing to see."

But right now, there's -- I think you should expect steady growth in our dividend that's well covered and very durable. And we think this is the kind of business. We've built a long-term durable business as I think we've proven out, and we think that our yield on our dividend ought to continue to trade down ability and the growth in our dividend.

Maybe starting with your last question, yes, the incentives will be supportive in accelerating project opportunities. I think as we've discussed, hydrogen has been without an incentive structure and really need an incentive structure to help support being projects jump started. And I would also say that it is still early days on the hydrogen front. We're at the pilot stage on -- I would characterize project opportunities. But as far as our ambition goes and if things prove out, if costs continue to come down, as we expect they would, the incentives get passed. In Wyoming, for example, Alan talked about the potential to develop an energy hub in Wyoming in partnership with Ørsted and others, you could envision a very large wind power production facility, 300 to 500 megawatts if not larger. There's a tremendous wind resource in Wyoming that hasn't been fully developed because it's not easy to build electric infrastructure to deliver that power to markets outside of Wyoming. We have pipeline infrastructure that can deliver that energy to other parts of the country. And so we could build a very substantial wind power generation platform tied to several hundred megawatts of hydrogen production that we can move through -- we believe we could move through our existing infrastructure to customers across our footprint.
So those are big ambitions. And I would tell you, again, it's very early innings. But the pieces are coming together, and we're very hopeful. We're going to start by crawling before we walk and put some projects online that I think will demonstrate the feasibility, but that gives you just 1 example. And looking at others across our footprint, but that's 1 example of where we think we can get to scale."

So curious, how should we think about any sort of upward pressure on fees as we get into next year in this environment?"

We're watching the supply chain issues and the inflation issues very closely. We got in front of the supply chain concerns early on with treating chemical and lube and things of that nature to make sure that we have looking to operate the business. And as you would expect, we are seeing price increases, fuel, diesel, gasoline prices are up. It's really a small component of what our overall expenses are in the business, and we like it can be managed appropriately. As you mentioned, the bulk of our gathering processing agreements do have escalators in them. So we are protected there on the avian processing side. And on the transmission side, we could obviously take advantage of rate cases if we need to. But we've done a really good job managing our cost for several years now. And so we've been in very good shape for a number of years in managing that. And I suspect our teams will continue to do a great job at that going forward here and take advantage of opportunities where we can to control our costs. But we will see some increased costs and there's no doubt about that. And the escalators that we have. There's very escalators that we use in the gathering and process of an agreement, and I believe that we definitely cover the expense increases that we'll see."

And so tends to drive us towards longer-term contracts and one that we know that the value will be in there for the transportation to the long haul.

We're not an electrolysis company, and we're going to need technology providers to work with us, whether or not we invest in those parts of the value chain. I think we will stand prepared to do that.

And we were able in the Wyoming area even though this should have showed up in the production volumes coming out on the Setra. I think it's always a good thing To pay attention to the C3+ volumes because, obviously, the ethane comes in and out based on pricing and C3+ is kind of a better indicator of what's available on a regular basis. But I would say the Patrick draw of facility in Wyoming that we picked up earlier in the year, which was an adjacent plant EcoScreen shutdown, and we were able to pick those volumes up and those volumes came directly into our system as well. And so we also picked up some volumes off of a competitor pipeline there during the bankruptcy process from South Glenn so those volumes flowed into us as well.
So they're at Echo Springs or our Wamsutter facility. We've really been able to pick up the equity volumes that are coming to us. So some of that equity would have gotten produced. Some of it would have gone on to competitor pipeline. All of that is now coming into our pipeline. And so that some of."

What I would say is that we are seeing strong interest from both LNG off-takers and utility customers. We have a wellhead to water and a wellhead bird strategy with respect to responsibly source gas. We haven't been extremely explicit on our plans in this area because we've been working very hard and long as Alan mentioned, we have a very credible solution in place. And I will tell you that we're clearly seeing a need within the marketplace to demonstrate not only within our footprint, but to work with our upstream partners and to work with our downstream customers to really track the full life cycle emissions footprint the gas that flows through our systems.
And so we will be announcing several solutions that we are going to be focused on delivering for our customers. We have been in discussions with several of our customers, but we think we can marry the solutions that we're developing with our producing partners efforts as well as our LNG customers and our utility customers. And we want to be able to shine a very credible light on the emissions footprint of the products that we move, the gas that we move for our systems and then show how we are going to drive down those emissions over time.
And just circling back to Alan's comments also, the Transco system is the largest, most flexible pipeline system in the United States. We have the benefit of having multiple lines in our right of way. We can do a lot with that system and demonstrate a lower emissions footprint today and to show a continually decreasing emissions footprint over time. We want to make sure we can do that in a very credible manner. And so -- and I do truly believe we are working with the Sequent team to make sure we can market that gas has an incredible responsibly sourced product. And we are seeing a real intense focus on that front.
To the point where we've even had meetings with utility customers that have told us, they are looking at the midstream providers to understand the emissions footprint of their potential gas supply, and they're going to factor that into their decisions with respect to how they source their gas. And we think that sets up very well for us again because we've got, I think, the most modern, most efficient system in the United States."

So I think that's about as far as it's gone at this point. But I think it's certainly something -- I think it's pretty strong support across the industry for making that more of a determinant in the marketing space, and we certainly want to be a part of that. But it's got to be credible, reliable and something that's got good strong bad behind it that ultimately could perhaps be even traded. And so that's what where we're focused on."

And so the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is going to be a real driver of growth as you look out 3 years. And then beyond that, as we've mentioned many times, investing in the modernization of our rate base, which will come with emissions reduction along our systems and about $400 million of solar projects that we are moving rapidly through the development stage right now and starting to move towards execution on those projects.

And thanks, Danilo, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We do have a lot of good news to share with you today, but let me just start by saying that our long-term strategy of connecting the fastest-growing natural gas markets with the best supply areas continues to deliver exceptional financial results as demonstrated by these higher-than-expected third quarter financials. 
As John will walk through in just a moment, we achieved all-time record results in the third quarter with our adjusted EBITDA up 12% compared to the same period last year, driven by growth across all 3 of our major business segments. Given our robust performance to date and continued strong fundamentals, we are raising our 2021 EBITDA guidance midpoint for the second time this year to a level that is now 8% above our realized 2020 results, which I'll remind you, came in above expectations last year in a very challenging backdrop. Not only did we deliver more on our financial performance this quarter than we expected, but we continue to make strides in executing on key projects and transactions that give us a clear line of sight to sustained growth for many years to come. We'll talk a little bit about that today. 
But -- so for right now, let me turn it over to John to provide you some insight into the drivers of this all-time record quarter for Williams. John?"

First of all, just what an incredible quarter we had. At a very high-level summary, the quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year, significant contributions from our upstream operations in the Wamsutter and the benefit of higher commodity prices in our West segment. 
The positives were offset somewhat by slightly higher operating expenses resulting from increased incentive compensation expenses, reflective of the strong performance that is unfolding for the year. And you can see that strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, once again, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics. 
First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $153 million or 12%, setting a new record, and we've seen a 10% increase in EBITDA year-to-date. We'll discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased $0.07 a share or 26%. AFFO also grew significantly for the quarter, up $217 million or 25%. And AFFO, I'll remind you is essentially cash from operations including JV cash flows and excluding working capital fluctuations. 
If you put our year-to-date AFFO of $3 billion, up against capital investments year-to-date of $1.2 billion, and dividends year-to-date of $1.5 billion, you can see that we generated over $300 million of excess cash year-to-date. Included in those capital investments I just mentioned were $307 million of maintenance capital. Also, you can see our dividend coverage based on AFFO divided by dividend is a healthy 2.17x for the quarter. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter along with continued capital discipline has led to our exceeding our leverage metric goal where we currently set at 4.04x net debt to EBITDA. You'll see later in our guidance update in the deck that we've moved our guidance for the year from where we were at less than 4.2x for the year now to around 4x at year-end. So a really strong performance for the quarter and the year, and the fundamentals are set up for a good fourth quarter and a very good 2022. 
So now let's go to the next slide and dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well, realizing $153 million or 12% higher EBITDA. Our upstream operations added $55 million to adjusted EBITDA this quarter. This is almost entirely from the Wamsutter upstream acreage. Production from the combined assets, mostly from Wamsutter, totaled 232 million CFEs a day for the quarter net to our ownership. Again, the Haynesville upstream acreage produces very little EBITDA, given it has only a small amount of existing PDP reserves. And therefore, it will take a little time before we see new production and therefore, EBITDA coming from those assets. 
Our Transmission Gulf of Mexico assets produced results that were $8 million more than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $24 million in revenue versus the third quarter 2020 including the Southeastern Trails project that went into service in the fourth quarter of last year and a portion of the Leidy South project that also went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. And you can see this evidenced in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 4% from the third quarter of last year. 
Offsetting this somewhat was Gulf of Mexico revenues that were down due to incremental impacts from hurricane shut-ins during the quarter from Hurricane Ida in comparison to the hurricane impacts in the third quarter of last year. Just so you have a number there, the incremental impact this year was a negative $5 million versus the third quarter of last year on hurricane impacts. 
In addition, the transportation revenue increases were offset somewhat by a slight increase in operating expenses mostly due to employee-related expenses, a large part of which can be attributed to higher incentive compensation accruals. The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $46 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 470 million a day or 5% this quarter versus the third quarter of 2020, while processing volumes grew 20%. The volume growth was predominantly at our joint ventures in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019; and at our Marcellus South supply basin where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads. 
And just to be clear, because we do not operate Blue Racer Midstream, those volumes are not included in the volume statistics I just quoted. As a result of these increased JV volumes, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by $45 million, which also included the benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer Midstream, again, due to our additional ownership we acquired in mid-November of last year. 
Otherwise, in the Northeast, higher revenues from higher processing volumes were offset by higher expenses, again, with a significant portion of those expenses being related to higher incentive compensation accruals. If you go to the West, that segment improved by $48 million compared to prior year. $35 million of this increase is related to higher commodity margins due to higher natural gas and higher NGL prices. Otherwise, the remainder of the uplift in EBITDA comes from lower operating costs due to lower maintenance fees, and due to the absence of legal costs and small asset write-offs that occurred in the third quarter of last year. And revenues for the West were only up slightly compared to the same period last year. 
Now there are a number of big items that go opposite directions and revenues that I'd like to point out. First of all, for example, remember that we lowered our gathering rates in the Haynesville this year in return for undeveloped upstream acreage from Chesapeake in the South Mansfield area in the Haynesville. The resulting gathering revenue decrease from this during this quarter was more than offset by rate increases in the Barnett and the Piceance where our gathering contracts allow us to participate in the upside when prices are higher. 
Also last year, our partner on Overland Pass Pipeline was paying us an efficiency fee to allow them to pull volume off of OPPL. Those deficiency fees do not exist this year. However, the absence of those fees are being offset by fees from higher gathering volumes otherwise. And to that point, overall gathering volumes in the West were up 1% with higher volumes in the Haynesville and the Piceance being offset somewhat by lower volumes in the Wamsutter and the Barnett. 
And then finally, the Sequent segment produced near flat adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Sequent  traditionally makes a significant portion of it's profit in the first couple of quarters of the year in the heart of the winter season and, therefore, did not realize profit for the quarter. Sequent does have a significant portion of their transportation capacity hedged with basis swaps as well as our storage inventory hedge with NYMEX positions, which, of course, led to the large $277 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on those hedges this quarter as prices increased and as basis differentials widened in some markets. This, of course, means that the intrinsic value of our storage and transportation positions have gone up significantly as well. And again, you'll see a significant portion of that value realized in the first half of 2022. 
So now let's go to the year-to-date results. Again, our year-to-date results showed a strong growth of $383 million or 10% in adjusted EBITDA. Many profitable things are happening across all of our segments. First, I'd point to Winter Storm Yuri, which added $55 million in profits to the West, and it contributed $22 million of incremental profits to our upstream results. In addition, our upstream operations otherwise have added an additional $83 million year-to-date, almost entirely from the Wamsutter properties. Our transmission in Gulf of Mexico assets are up $30 million or 2% better with the increases being driven largely by additional transmission revenues from new projects that have been put into service and incremental revenues from Gulf of Mexico assets, largely due to lower downtime this year versus last year. These positives were partially offset by lower revenues due to a Transco rate case decline following the rate case final settlement in mid-2020 related to just a few markets. And as a reminder, a majority of our transfer rates actually increased in 2019. 
In addition, expenses are higher this year year-to-date due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting again from our strong performance. The Northeast G&P is up $124 million for the year, almost entirely driven by profits from our JV investments, again, namely from the Bradford Supply Hub gathering systems and our Marcellus South gathering systems. In addition, we benefited from increased ownership in Blue Racer Midstream. In total, gathering volumes for the Northeast are up 8% over the third quarter of last year, while processing volumes are up 22%. 
And then in the West, our West G&P is up $71 million, and this is on top of the $55 million that we earned from Winter storm Uri. The $71 million increase is driven by higher commodity margins, higher gathering rates in the Barnett and Piceance where we participate in the commodity upside and lower operating costs. These positives were offset somewhat by lower deferred revenue in the Barnett, Lower Haynesville gathering rates, which again, were exchanged for upstream acreage and lower Overland Pass Pipeline profits from lower actual volume shipped and the elimination of the deficiency payments that we were receiving in 2020. And while we did see a 4% gathering volume decline year-to-date in the West, that was mostly offset by minimum volume commitment payments. 
Again, this is stacking up to be an incredible year for us. One other thing I do want to point out, we did pick up in some of the narratives from some of the analysts last night, the view that our operating costs increased. And we did ourselves a bit of a disservice by not providing more information on our other operating segment, where our E&P upstream operations reside. Actually, if you look on the face of our financial statements, our operating expenses went up $73 million, $12 million of that came from Sequent, who by the way, covered most of that with their profits. E&P went up $51 million on cost, but of course, they're making significant EBITDA. So they're covering that with their revenues. And then the rest is related to bonus expenses. So our expense is actually when you extract Sequent and E&P and the bonus costs are actually down otherwise. So we actually are not seeing a significant -- or seeing expense increases and in fact, the contrary to other than the bonus-related expenses. So I thought I'd clear that. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to cover a number of key investor focus areas. Alan?"

Well, thanks, John, and we'll move on here to Slide 4, covering key investor focus areas. Our natural gas focused strategy is delivering even better results than we expected in this high commodity price environment. Demand for natural gas in the",1538,"Great. Well, thanks, John, and we'll move on here to Slide 4, covering key investor focus areas. 
Our natural gas focused strategy is delivering even better results than we expected in this high commodity price environment. Demand for natural gas in the third quarter was surprisingly inelastic against this higher-than-expected pricing environment. And while we would prefer more moderate natural gas prices for our business over the long haul, the recent demand resilience highlights the near- and long-term role that natural gas will play as a complement to growing demand for renewable energy and emission reduction in general. 
The past 18 months have demonstrated the benefits of our high-quality portfolio of contracts through which we've thoughtfully built a business that is durable in the down cycles, but exposed to upside potential when it is available. This quarter's results show how meaningful that upside can be even after excluding our upstream results. Along these lines, we also have contracted our business over the years to be protected from inflationary environments and we see additional upside potential in our G&P businesses due to contract terms that adjust our rates for inflation. In short, our business and its contractual portfolios are set up with a long-term investor in mind and are positioned to thrive through these cycles. 
So looking at our financial strength and focus on long-term shareholder value here. We are increasing our '21 financial guidance for the second time this year, as we mentioned, with our EBITDA midpoint now residing $5.525 billion, and that is 8% higher than last year's strong $5.105 billion of EBITDA. And of course, that was a fee by itself in the environment that we are in. So we're really excited to show our durability in the down cycle and our exposure here on the positive side as well coming through. 
And while the past few years have been characterized by lower commodity prices and reduced producer customer activity, among other challenges, our updated '21 EBITDA and EPS guidance, the midpoint translates into a 3-year CAGR of 6% on the EBITDA and 17% on the EPS. So a 3-year CAGR on our EPS now at 17% at that midpoint. And of course, this is proving up our ability to produce reliable and growing earnings under a variety of market conditions. Our financial results in '21 continued to derisk our balance sheet, which is now at about 4.0 leverage. And also of note, we recently issued $1.25 billion of 10-year and 30-year bonds at the most attractive interest rates ever issued here at Williams. This is significant because we are now positioned to allocate capital to a variety of options that will provide compounding value to our long-term shareholders. To this end, we've continued to grow our stable quarterly dividend through our investors and remain steadfast in maintaining the long-term security of the dividend. And most recently, we unveiled our long-term capital allocation priorities, including a $1.5 billion opportunistic share repurchase program that has the potential to enhance shareholder returns beyond the dividend. 
And perhaps most unique to Williams as we think about capital allocation is the option we have to grow dependable earnings by investing in the modernization of our regulated transmission systems, which will both grow earnings and as well reduce submissions across our footprint. 
So next here, looking at growth. From a project execution point, we continue to deliver on multiple fronts, including bringing online key projects such as Leidy South, which we are targeting to bring into full service earlier than projected and importantly, before the winter heating season. And while projects such as REA remain in the execution phase, we've continued to receive interest in demand pool projects on the Transco system. Our 2 recently announced Mid-Atlantic expansions will add a little more than 500 million a day of capacity on the system. And in the coming weeks, we expect to secure a precedent agreement for another system expansion, bringing a total of 3 incremental expansion projects on Transco just here in the last half of '21. 
Our natural gas fundamentals are not only supportive of our transmission assets, but also our G&P business. And our gathering volumes continue to grow at a rate of nearly 10x the lower-48 U.S. gas production volumes. This, of course, was led by the Marcellus growth where we are also growing a rate that is almost double that of our competitors. And you can see the layout of that in some slides we put in the appendix. 
With projects like Leidy South and REA providing takeaway out of the basin, we expect our gathering volumes in the Northwest -- Northeast story to remain resilient. In fact, we expect to announce a system expansion in the basin soon, underscoring that we don't see takeaway constraints of the near term deterrent to volume growth in our systems there in our Northeast gathering area. 
And finally, on sustainability. As we think about sustainability, both today and into the future, our highly reliable natural gas infrastructure is extremely well positioned to continue replacing higher carbon fuels while supporting the growth of renewable energy and responsibly sourced natural gas for LNG export. We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy networks to deliver on our country's clean energy future. 
And to this end, we are pursuing emerging opportunities like a hydrogen hub near our assets in Southwestern Wyoming and are evaluating a large-scale co-development of wind energy, electrolysis and synthetic gas-via-methanation in the State instead of Wyoming as part of our recently announced MOU with Orsted. Our solar initiative continues to move forward as we now advance the execution of now 12 projects on our systems. And those are, as we've mentioned before, large solar arrays that will provide power for our fairly large loads on our compression and processing facilities. 
Now looking at our renewable natural gas efforts. We set a 2021 goal of adding an incremental 5 million a day of renewable natural gas and we now expect to exceed that goal. We recently signed an interconnect that should enable up to 10 million cubic feet per day of a new source of RNG supply, bringing our entire RNG portfolio, close to 25 million cubic feet per day with in-service dates in the '22 through '23 time frame. So a lot going on, on that front. Team's doing a great job of making sure that we're capturing opportunities in and around our assets there. 
We do remain steadfast in the view that natural gas will play a role in the world's clean energy future and our latest efforts to advance responsibly sourced gas through the value chain will provide transparency on the sustainability of our operations and help to solidify the role of natural gas in reducing emissions. We're also pursuing sustainable investment opportunities and are pleased to be partnering on 2 strategies with Energy Impact Partners, an investment firm that makes venture and growth investments in companies that are optimizing energy consumption and improving sustainable energy. Williams is among the first midstream investors in the platform, and we're expecting to facilitate diverse investment opportunities that reduce emissions and advance our ESG goals. 
Finally, our ongoing focus on sustainable operations continues to deliver strong results that are being recognized by our key rating agencies in this space. Williams sits in the top quartile for our industry with rankings that reflect the dedication of our team towards doing the right thing from an ESG perspective. 
So here in closing, a lot of really positive things to report on this quarter, demonstrating that our intense focus on natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued growth, improving returns and significant free cash flows. This has translated into a strong balance sheet and a well-covered and growing dividend. And our best-in-class long-haul pipes like Transco, Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream are in the right place and in the right markets. 
And by design, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. The triple punch of benefits provided by American sourced natural gas must not be understated as we work to accelerate our clean energy future around the world. As we work to balance sustainability and climate goals with growing energy demand, natural gas will remain a key component of the fuel mix and should be prioritized as renewables carbon-intensive fuels around the world. 
Natural gas does provide a right here, right now, emissions reduction solution that is economically viable and can keep industry and manufacturing here at home. Williams Transmission & Storage networks are extremely well positioned to aggregate and bring scale to multiple mission reduction opportunities taking out higher carbon fuels while supporting renewable energy and emerging opportunities like hydrogen and carbon capture. 
So in closing, we produced tremendous 3Q results. But more importantly, we have an unmatched platform to continue to deliver growth and lower emissions at the same time. We look forward to helping our customers and stakeholders meet their goals in an environmentally and financially sustainable manner. 
And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

One of those that you heard John mention is we did take an accrual for bonuses for the year and both on our long-term incentive comp as well. I see a lot of people adjusting that out of their EBITDA. We don't adjust that out of our EBITDA. So our long-term incentive comp. And we did take some accruals for that as well as our annual bonus, which obviously, with this kind of performance, we'll be paying out. And so those -- that was a hit to the quarter that would be negative.
On the other side of that, we had about $24 million, I believe, of pricing increase on our NGLs and inventory. And so to the degree that, that doesn't increase again, that would offset against that positive that shows up in the quarter. So that's kind of a non-operational issue, if you will. We have to price that inventory up, but to the degree that NGL prices don't move again, and that wouldn't show up. So that's a couple of 1 positive, 1 negative. I would just say, we pay attention to the forward strip when we think about our forecast and in our guidance. And obviously, those are backward dated as we sit here. And so our expectations would be the same moving forward.
As it relates to the E&P business, I will say that that's not a huge driver of our business, obviously. It's pretty measured, as you can see. It will become larger in '22 as we start -- as the Haynesville starts to get developed, that will be a net positive where we will build a larger sensitivity to gas prices in '22 as the Haynesville starts to be developed. So I would just say we're -- we know this was a good quarter in terms of pricing, and we're not going to build our business in a way that's just sustained off of high commodity prices, and that's hopefully evident in how we forecast our business as well. So nice to take the winnings when they come to us, but we're not going to build -- we're not going to forecast our business around that. Obviously, if prices do stay high, then we'll certainly see the rewards from that."

So quite lots of positives, I think, in that area.
On the methane emissions issue, we are really encouraging that to be done in a way that rewards those who reduce methane emissions. We think it's smart to continue to put focus on methane emission reductions, and we're extremely well positioned for that. But we would much prefer one that rewards the good actors in that and not just a pure attack, but one that does incent those that have been working to reduce their emissions, and we think we stand out in that regard, and we think that would be a net positive for us if it's positioned that way. Obviously, we think that makes sense when you're talking about the lowest carbon content hydrocarbon. It seems a little bit odd that you would just put a pure tax on that when it has such an ability to help reduce emissions around the world.

I kind of expect that we could get that. And I would just say that we've been pretty clear about how we're thinking about that, and it is a a multiple of the cost of our 10-year debt cost in the market for 10-year debt cost. And so you can see that that spread, but price actually kind of widened or did widen. And so that yield continued to go down and therefore move away from that multiple during the period since we announced the buyback. But I would say as we don't make investment in that or if we continue to invest in earnings, either one of those will continue to drive our credit metrics to a more positive place, which will drive down the 10-year debt, which then will improve the price on that or the -- would lower the yield, which we would invest in. So I think it's pretty natural in terms of how that will occur. If money is flowing in a way that is improving our credit metrics, you would expect our 10-year rate to continue to improve, which would continue to lower the yield and eventually, we would hit a point in which we would be buying back, but we certainly stand ready. And if that price moves of that zone, we'll be anxious to be taking advantage of that, if that occurs.
So nothing's really changed from our perspective on that other than the fact that our amount of free cash flow continues to expand and accelerate, but other than that, nothing has really changed here. We announced that."

First, to the projects, I would just say our returns generally continue to improve. One that's kind of been -- as we've said many times, there's kind of a double-edged sword about the difficulty of building projects. It certainly has, I think, been detrimental to the country and the industry overall. But to the degree that you're the incumbent with pipe in place and you can expand those via brownfield that it effectively expands our return opportunity in that regard. So I would just say that the returns in general, not saying that they always will be that way. But in general, these returns that for these -- the Mid-Atlantic projects that we're mentioning are at least as good as Atlantic Sunrise or better. And so that's kind of the way to think about that REAs and attractive return projects as well.
And the question of how many do you have, we keep the slide updated in there about the number of projects in development in our appendix. And it always looks like it's the same old slide, but in reality, that we are moving projects from development into execution, and we have new projects flowing in there that are keeping that pipeline very full. So I would just tell you, we don't see much backing off in the way of opportunity for expansions of our transmission systems. And with that, obviously, will flow gas from the low-cost producing areas, and we're well positioned to capture that on the gathering side as well. So despite what you might think when you listen to the media and the rhetoric, it's certainly not showing up and people's reluctance to make long-term commitments to our transmission systems for supplies that they know they're going to need, whether that's to back up renewables or whether it is a base load that it's people and our customers certainly understand that it takes time to build these projects and then it takes long-term commitments to being built, and that's what we're continuing to see."

So don't expect -- we don't expect anything special if we did some kind of asset sale and by the way, don't run off with that one because there's no intent behind that was something special or some kind of structure that delivered a bunch of cash, then we would consider that. But right now, there's -- I think you should expect steady growth in our dividend that's well covered and very durable. And we think this is the kind of business. We've built a long-term durable business as I think we've proven out, and we think that our yield on our dividend ought to continue to trade down                and durability and the growth in our dividend. And I think it's a pretty hard dividend to compete with, frankly, given its security and the growth in it by both the utility sector and within our peer group.

Maybe starting with your last question, yes, the incentives will be supportive in accelerating project opportunities. I think as we've discussed, hydrogen has been without an incentive structure and really need an incentive structure to help support being projects jump started. And I would also say that it is still early days on the hydrogen front. We're at the pilot stage on -- I would characterize project opportunities. But as far as our ambition goes and if things prove out, if costs continue to come down, as we expect they would, the incentives get passed. In Wyoming, for example, Alan talked about the potential to develop an energy hub in Wyoming in partnership with Ørsted and others, you could envision a very large wind power production facility, 300 to 500 megawatts if not larger. There's a tremendous wind resource in Wyoming that hasn't been fully developed because it's not easy to build electric infrastructure to deliver that power to markets outside of Wyoming. We have pipeline infrastructure that can deliver that energy to other parts of the country. And so we could build a very substantial wind power generation platform tied to several hundred megawatts of hydrogen production that we can move through -- we believe we could move through our existing infrastructure to customers across our footprint.
So those are big ambitions. And I would tell you, again, it's very early innings. But the pieces are coming together, and we're very hopeful. We're going to start by crawling before we walk and put some projects online that I think will demonstrate the feasibility, but that gives you just 1 example. And looking at others across our footprint, but that's 1 example of where we think we can get to scale."

And so we're going to stick to what we're good at. We're going to partner with really strong capable partners like Orsted and others. And so I think we'll -- we certainly think we have a very unique set of skills and infrastructure to make these projects possible. So we're going to want to make sure that we participate where it makes sense. But I'd say it's a little bit early on to understand exactly where we're going to be putting our investments. And so clearly, the New York Dec announcement, we're not a wind power company. We're not an electrolysis company, and we're going to need technology providers to work with us, whether or not we invest in those parts of the value chain. I think we will stand prepared to do that. If it's a smart place to invest is what we're doing on the solar front. It's what we're doing in certain RNG opportunities but it's still pretty early on to figure out how all those pieces come together, but we're constantly evaluating that."

And we were able in the Wyoming area even though this should have showed up in the production volumes coming out on the C3. I think it's always a good thing to pay attention to the C3-plus volumes because, obviously, the ethane comes in and out based on pricing and C3-plus is kind of a better indicator of what's available on a regular basis. But I would say the processing plant facility in Wyoming that we picked up earlier in the year, which was an adjacent plant to Eco Springs shutdown, and we were able to pick those volumes up and those volumes came directly into our system as well. And so we also picked up some volumes off of a competitor pipeline there during the bankruptcy process from South Glenn so those volumes flowed into us as well.
So they're at Echo Springs or our Wamsutter facility. We've really been able to pick up the equity volumes that are coming to us. So some of that equity would have gotten produced. Some of it would have gone on to competitor pipeline. All of that is now coming into our pipeline. And so that some of."

What I would say is that we are seeing strong interest from both LNG off-takers and utility customers. We have a wellhead to water and a wellhead bird strategy with respect to responsibly source gas. We haven't been extremely explicit on our plans in this area because we've been working very hard and long as Alan mentioned, we have a very credible solution in place. And I will tell you that we're clearly seeing a need within the marketplace to demonstrate not only within our footprint, but to work with our upstream partners and to work with our downstream customers to really track the full life cycle emissions footprint, the gas that flows through our systems.
And so we will be announcing several solutions that we are going to be focused on delivering for our customers. We have been in discussions with several of our customers, but we think we can marry the solutions that we're developing with our producing partners efforts as well as our LNG customers and our utility customers. And we want to be able to shine a very credible light on the emissions footprint of the products that we move, the gas that we move for our systems and then show how we are going to drive down those emissions over time.
And just circling back to Alan's comments also, the Transco system is the largest, most flexible pipeline system here in the United States. We have the benefit of having multiple lines in our right of way. We can do a lot with that system and demonstrate a lower emissions footprint today and to show a continually decreasing emissions footprint over time. We want to make sure we can do that in a very credible manner. And so -- and I do truly believe we are working with the Sequent team to make sure we can market that gas has an incredible responsibly sourced product. And we are seeing a real intense focus on that front.
To the point where we've even had meetings with utility customers that have told us, they are looking at the midstream providers to understand the emissions footprint of their potential gas supply, and they're going to factor that into their decisions with respect to how they source their gas. And we think that sets up very well for us again because we've got, I think, the most modern, most efficient system in the United States."

And so I would say when it comes to doing long-term contracts at index pricing that people are going to be asking those questions and the tide right now, we just say the tide is going to go to the runner, so to speak, the responsible source gas to the degree that somebody can prove that up or demonstrate that they're on a path to be able to prove that. So I think that's about as far as it's gone at this point. But I think it's certainly something -- I think it's pretty strong support across the industry for making that more of a determinant in the marketing space, and we certainly want to be a part of that. But it's got to be credible, reliable and something that's got good strong bed at behind it that ultimately could perhaps be even traded. And so that's what where we're focused on."

And so the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is going to be a real driver of growth as you look out 3 years. And then beyond that, as we've mentioned many times, investing in the modernization of our rate base, which will come with emissions reduction along our systems and about $400 million of solar projects that we are moving rapidly through the development stage right now and starting to move towards execution on those projects. So those are kind of the primary drivers. That hasn't really changed a whole lot. I would say some of the projects on Transco are moving up from our development list into execution list.

And so those are kind of the immediate variables that we'll be navigating between. But if we -- I would just say it's pretty strong multiplying effect as our EBITDA continues to grow, and we continue to invest in earnings projects, and our EBITDA continues to grow that move down on the debt metric, and it starts to move pretty fast.

We do have a lot of good news to share with you today, but let me just start by saying that our long-term strategy of connecting the fastest-growing natural gas markets with the best supply areas continues to deliver exceptional financial results as demonstrated by these higher-than-expected third quarter financials. 
As John will walk through in just a moment, we achieved all-time record results in the third quarter with our adjusted EBITDA up 12% compared to the same period last year, driven by growth across all 3 of our major business segments. Given our robust performance to date and continued strong fundamentals, we are raising our 2021 EBITDA guidance midpoint for the second time this year to a level that is now 8% above our realized 2020 results, which I'll remind you, came in above expectations last year in a very challenging backdrop. Not only did we deliver more on our financial performance this quarter than we expected, but we continue to make strides in executing on key projects and transactions that give us a clear line of sight to sustained growth for many years to come. We'll talk a little bit about that today. 
But -- so for right now, let me turn it over to John to provide you some insight into the drivers of this all-time record quarter for Williams. John?"
390225,1684979415,3110125,"The Williams Companies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","The Williams Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan.

First of all, just what an incredible quarter we had. At a very high-level summary, the quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year, significant contributions from our upstream operations in the Wamsutter and the benefit of higher commodity prices in our West segment. 
The positives were offset somewhat by slightly higher operating expenses resulting from increased incentive compensation expenses, reflective of the strong performance that is unfolding for the year. And you can see that strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, once again, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics. 
First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $153 million or 12%, setting a new record, and we've seen a 10% increase in EBITDA year-to-date. We'll discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased $0.07 a share or 26%. AFFO also grew significantly for the quarter, up $217 million or 25%. And AFFO, I'll remind you is essentially cash from operations including JV cash flows and excluding working capital fluctuations. 
If you put our year-to-date AFFO of $3 billion, up against capital investments year-to-date of $1.2 billion, and dividends year-to-date of $1.5 billion, you can see that we generated over $300 million of excess cash year-to-date. Included in those capital investments I just mentioned were $307 million of maintenance capital. Also, you can see our dividend coverage based on AFFO divided by dividend is a healthy 2.17x for the quarter. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter along with continued capital discipline has led to our exceeding our leverage metric goal where we currently set at 4.04x net debt to EBITDA. You'll see later in our guidance update in the deck that we've moved our guidance for the year from where we were at less than 4.2x for the year now to around 4x at year-end. So a really strong performance for the quarter and the year, and the fundamentals are set up for a good fourth quarter and a very good 2022. 
So now let's go to the next slide and dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well, realizing $153 million or 12% higher EBITDA. Our upstream operations added $55 million to adjusted EBITDA this quarter. This is almost entirely from the Wamsutter upstream acreage. Production from the combined assets, mostly from Wamsutter, totaled 232 million CFEs a day for the quarter net to our ownership. Again, the Haynesville upstream acreage produces very little EBITDA, given it has only a small amount of existing PDP reserves. And therefore, it will take a little time before we see new production and therefore, EBITDA coming from those assets. 
Our Transmission Gulf of Mexico assets produced results that were $8 million more than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $24 million in revenue versus the third quarter 2020 including the Southeastern Trails project that went into service in the fourth quarter of last year and a portion of the Leidy South project that also went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. And you can see this evidenced in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 4% from the third quarter of last year. 
Offsetting this somewhat was Gulf of Mexico revenues that were down due to incremental impacts from hurricane shut-ins during the quarter from Hurricane Ida in comparison to the hurricane impacts in the third quarter of last year. Just so you have a number there, the incremental impact this year was a negative $5 million versus the third quarter of last year on hurricane impacts. 
In addition, the transportation revenue increases were offset somewhat by a slight increase in operating expenses mostly due to employee-related expenses, a large part of which can be attributed to higher incentive compensation accruals. The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $46 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 470 million a day or 5% this quarter versus the third quarter of 2020, while processing volumes grew 20%. The volume growth was predominantly at our joint ventures in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019; and at our Marcellus South supply basin where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads. 
And just to be clear, because we do not operate Blue Racer Midstream, those volumes are not included in the volume statistics I just quoted. As a result of these increased JV volumes, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by $45 million, which also included the benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer Midstream, again, due to our additional ownership we acquired in mid-November of last year. 
Otherwise, in the Northeast, higher revenues from higher processing volumes were offset by higher expenses, again, with a significant portion of those expenses being related to higher incentive compensation accruals. If you go to the West, that segment improved by $48 million compared to prior year. $35 million of this increase is related to higher commodity margins due to higher natural gas and higher NGL prices. Otherwise, the remainder of the uplift in EBITDA comes from lower operating costs due to lower maintenance fees, and due to the absence of legal costs and small asset write-offs that occurred in the third quarter of last year. And revenues for the West were only up slightly compared to the same period last year. 
Now there are a number of big items that go opposite directions and revenues that I'd like to point out. First of all, for example, remember that we lowered our gathering rates in the Haynesville this year in return for undeveloped upstream acreage from Chesapeake in the South Mansfield area in the Haynesville. The resulting gathering revenue decrease from this during this quarter was more than offset by rate increases in the Barnett and the Piceance where our gathering contracts allow us to participate in the upside when prices are higher. 
Also last year, our partner on Overland Pass Pipeline was paying us an efficiency fee to allow them to pull volume off of OPPL. Those deficiency fees do not exist this year. However, the absence of those fees are being offset by fees from higher gathering volumes otherwise. And to that point, overall gathering volumes in the West were up 1% with higher volumes in the Haynesville and the Piceance being offset somewhat by lower volumes in the Wamsutter and the Barnett. 
And then finally, the Sequent segment produced near flat adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Sequent  traditionally makes a significant portion of its profit in the first couple of quarters of the year in the heart of the winter season and, therefore, did not realize profit for the quarter. Sequent does have a significant portion of their transportation capacity hedged with basis swaps as well as our storage inventory hedge with NYMEX positions, which, of course, led to the large $277 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on those hedges this quarter as prices increased and as basis differentials widened in some markets. This, of course, means that the intrinsic value of our storage and transportation positions have gone up significantly as well. And again, you'll see a significant portion of that value realized in the first half of 2022. 
So now let's go to the year-to-date results. Again, our year-to-date results showed a strong growth of $383 million or 10% in adjusted EBITDA. Many profitable things are happening across all of our segments. First, I'd point to Winter Storm Yuri, which added $55 million in profits to the West, and it contributed $22 million of incremental profits to our upstream results. In addition, our upstream operations otherwise have added an additional $83 million year-to-date, almost entirely from the Wamsutter properties. Our transmission in Gulf of Mexico assets are up $30 million or 2% better with the increases being driven largely by additional transmission revenues from new projects that have been put into service and incremental revenues from Gulf of Mexico assets, largely due to lower downtime this year versus last year. These positives were partially offset by lower revenues due to a Transco rate case decline following the rate case final settlement in mid-2020 related to just a few markets. And as a reminder, a majority of our transfer rates actually increased in 2019. 
In addition, expenses are higher this year year-to-date due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting again from our strong performance. The Northeast G&P is up $124 million for the year, almost entirely driven by profits from our JV investments, again, namely from the Bradford Supply Hub gathering systems and our Marcellus South gathering systems. In addition, we benefited from increased ownership in Blue Racer Midstream. In total, gathering volumes for the Northeast are up 8% over the third quarter of last year, while processing volumes are up 22%. 
And then in the West, our West G&P is up $71 million, and this is on top of the $55 million that we earned from Winter storm Uri. The $71 million increase is driven by higher commodity margins, higher gathering rates in the Barnett and Piceance where we participate in the commodity upside and lower operating costs. These positives were offset somewhat by lower deferred revenue in the Barnett, Lower Haynesville gathering rates, which again, were exchanged for upstream acreage and lower Overland Pass Pipeline profits from lower actual volume shipped and the elimination of the deficiency payments that we were receiving in 2020. And while we did see a 4% gathering volume decline year-to-date in the West, that was mostly offset by minimum volume commitment payments. 
Again, this is stacking up to be an incredible year for us. One other thing I do want to point out, we did pick up in some of the narratives from some of the analysts last night, the view that our operating costs increased. And we did ourselves a bit of a disservice by not providing more information on our other operating segment, where our E&P upstream operations reside. Actually, if you look on the face of our financial statements, our operating expenses went up $73 million, $12 million of that came from Sequent, who by the way, covered most of that with their profits. E&P went up $51 million on cost, but of course, they're making significant EBITDA. So they're covering that with their revenues. And then the rest is related to bonus expenses. So our expense is actually when you extract Sequent and E&P and the bonus costs are actually down otherwise. So we actually are not seeing a significant -- or seeing expense increases and in fact, the contrary to other than the bonus-related expenses. So I thought I'd clear that. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to cover a number of key investor focus areas. Alan?"

Our natural gas focused strategy is delivering even better results than we expected in this high commodity price environment. Demand for natural gas in the",1538,"Great. Well, thanks, John, and we'll move on here to Slide 4, covering key investor focus areas. 
Our natural gas focused strategy is delivering even better results than we expected in this high commodity price environment. Demand for natural gas in the third quarter was surprisingly inelastic against this higher-than-expected pricing environment. And while we would prefer more moderate natural gas prices for our business over the long haul, the recent demand resilience highlights the near- and long-term role that natural gas will play as a complement to growing demand for renewable energy and emission reduction in general. 
The past 18 months have demonstrated the benefits of our high-quality portfolio of contracts through which we've thoughtfully built a business that is durable in the down cycles, but exposed to upside potential when it is available. This quarter's results show how meaningful that upside can be even after excluding our upstream results. Along these lines, we also have contracted our business over the years to be protected from inflationary environments and we see additional upside potential in our G&P businesses due to contract terms that adjust our rates for inflation. In short, our business and its contractual portfolios are set up with a long-term investor in mind and are positioned to thrive through these cycles. 
So looking at our financial strength and focus on long-term shareholder value here. We are increasing our '21 financial guidance for the second time this year, as we mentioned, with our EBITDA midpoint now residing $5.525 billion, and that is 8% higher than last year's strong $5.105 billion of EBITDA. And of course, that was a fee by itself in the environment that we are in. So we're really excited to show our durability in the down cycle and our exposure here on the positive side as well coming through. 
And while the past few years have been characterized by lower commodity prices and reduced producer customer activity, among other challenges, our updated '21 EBITDA and EPS guidance, the midpoint translates into a 3-year CAGR of 6% on the EBITDA and 17% on the EPS. So a 3-year CAGR on our EPS now at 17% at that midpoint. And of course, this is proving up our ability to produce reliable and growing earnings under a variety of market conditions. Our financial results in '21 continued to derisk our balance sheet, which is now at about 4.0 leverage. And also of note, we recently issued $1.25 billion of 10-year and 30-year bonds at the most attractive interest rates ever issued here at Williams. This is significant because we are now positioned to allocate capital to a variety of options that will provide compounding value to our long-term shareholders. To this end, we've continued to grow our stable quarterly dividend through our investors and remain steadfast in maintaining the long-term security of the dividend. And most recently, we unveiled our long-term capital allocation priorities, including a $1.5 billion opportunistic share repurchase program that has the potential to enhance shareholder returns beyond the dividend. 
And perhaps most unique to Williams as we think about capital allocation is the option we have to grow dependable earnings by investing in the modernization of our regulated transmission systems, which will both grow earnings and as well reduce submissions across our footprint. 
So next here, looking at growth. From a project execution point, we continue to deliver on multiple fronts, including bringing online key projects such as Leidy South, which we are targeting to bring into full service earlier than projected and importantly, before the winter heating season. And while projects such as REA remain in the execution phase, we've continued to receive interest in demand pool projects on the Transco system. Our 2 recently announced Mid-Atlantic expansions will add a little more than 500 million a day of capacity on the system. And in the coming weeks, we expect to secure a precedent agreement for another system expansion, bringing a total of 3 incremental expansion projects on Transco just here in the last half of '21. 
Our natural gas fundamentals are not only supportive of our transmission assets, but also our G&P business. And our gathering volumes continue to grow at a rate of nearly 10x the lower-48 U.S. gas production volumes. This, of course, was led by the Marcellus growth where we are also growing a rate that is almost double that of our competitors. And you can see the layout of that in some slides we put in the appendix. 
With projects like Leidy South and REA providing takeaway out of the basin, we expect our gathering volumes in the Northwest -- Northeast story to remain resilient. In fact, we expect to announce a system expansion in the basin soon, underscoring that we don't see takeaway constraints of the near term deterrent to volume growth in our systems there in our Northeast gathering area. 
And finally, on sustainability. As we think about sustainability, both today and into the future, our highly reliable natural gas infrastructure is extremely well positioned to continue replacing higher carbon fuels while supporting the growth of renewable energy and responsibly sourced natural gas for LNG export. We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy networks to deliver on our country's clean energy future. 
And to this end, we are pursuing emerging opportunities like a hydrogen hub near our assets in Southwestern Wyoming and are evaluating a large-scale co-development of wind energy, electrolysis and synthetic gas-via-methanation in the State instead of Wyoming as part of our recently announced MOU with Orsted. Our solar initiative continues to move forward as we now advance the execution of now 12 projects on our systems. And those are, as we've mentioned before, large solar arrays that will provide power for our fairly large loads on our compression and processing facilities. 
Now looking at our renewable natural gas efforts. We set a 2021 goal of adding an incremental 5 million a day of renewable natural gas and we now expect to exceed that goal. We recently signed an interconnect that should enable up to 10 million cubic feet per day of a new source of RNG supply, bringing our entire RNG portfolio, close to 25 million cubic feet per day with in-service dates in the '22 through '23 time frame. So a lot going on, on that front. Team's doing a great job of making sure that we're capturing opportunities in and around our assets there. 
We do remain steadfast in the view that natural gas will play a role in the world's clean energy future and our latest efforts to advance responsibly sourced gas through the value chain will provide transparency on the sustainability of our operations and help to solidify the role of natural gas in reducing emissions. We're also pursuing sustainable investment opportunities and are pleased to be partnering on 2 strategies with Energy Impact Partners, an investment firm that makes venture and growth investments in companies that are optimizing energy consumption and improving sustainable energy. Williams is among the first midstream investors in the platform, and we're expecting to facilitate diverse investment opportunities that reduce emissions and advance our ESG goals. 
Finally, our ongoing focus on sustainable operations continues to deliver strong results that are being recognized by our key rating agencies in this space. Williams sits in the top quartile for our industry with rankings that reflect the dedication of our team towards doing the right thing from an ESG perspective. 
So here in closing, a lot of really positive things to report on this quarter, demonstrating that our intense focus on natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued growth, improving returns and significant free cash flows. This has translated into a strong balance sheet and a well-covered and growing dividend. And our best-in-class long-haul pipes like Transco, Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream are in the right place and in the right markets. 
And by design, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. The triple punch of benefits provided by American sourced natural gas must not be understated as we work to accelerate our clean energy future around the world. As we work to balance sustainability and climate goals with growing energy demand, natural gas will remain a key component of the fuel mix and should be prioritized as renewables carbon-intensive fuels around the world. 
Natural gas does provide a right here, right now, emissions reduction solution that is economically viable and can keep industry and manufacturing here at home. Williams Transmission & Storage networks are extremely well positioned to aggregate and bring scale to multiple mission reduction opportunities taking out higher carbon fuels while supporting renewable energy and emerging opportunities like hydrogen and carbon capture. 
So in closing, we produced tremendous 3Q results. But more importantly, we have an unmatched platform to continue to deliver growth and lower emissions at the same time. We look forward to helping our customers and stakeholders meet their goals in an environmentally and financially sustainable manner. 
And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

One of those that you heard John mention is we did take an accrual for bonuses for the year and both on our long-term incentive comp as well. I see a lot of people adjusting that out of their EBITDA. We don't adjust that out of our EBITDA. So our long-term incentive comp. And we did take some accruals for that as well as our annual bonus, which obviously, with this kind of performance, we'll be paying out. And so those -- that was a hit to the quarter that would be negative.
On the other side of that, we had about $24 million, I believe, of pricing increase on our NGLs and inventory. And so to the degree that, that doesn't increase again, that would offset against that positive that shows up in the quarter. So that's kind of a non-operational issue, if you will. We have to price that inventory up, but to the degree that NGL prices don't move again, and that wouldn't show up. So that's a couple of 1 positive, 1 negative. I would just say, we pay attention to the forward strip when we think about our forecast and in our guidance. And obviously, those are backward dated as we sit here. And so our expectations would be the same moving forward.
As it relates to the E&P business, I will say that, that's not a huge driver of our business, obviously. It's pretty measured, as you can see. It will become larger in '22 as we start -- as the Haynesville starts to get developed, that will be a net positive where we will build a larger sensitivity to gas prices in '22 as the Haynesville starts to be developed. So I would just say we're -- we know this was a good quarter in terms of pricing, and we're not going to build our business in a way that's just sustained off of high commodity prices, and that's hopefully evident in how we forecast our business as well. So nice to take the winnings when they come to us, but we're not going to build -- we're not going to forecast our business around that. Obviously, if prices do stay high, then we'll certainly see the rewards from that."

So quite lots of positives, I think, in that area.
On the methane emissions issue, we are really encouraging that to be done in a way that rewards those who reduce methane emissions. We think it's smart to continue to put focus on methane emission reductions, and we're extremely well positioned for that. But we would much prefer one that rewards the good actors in that and not just a pure attack, but one that does incent those that have been working to reduce their emissions, and we think we stand out in that regard, and we think that would be a net positive for us if it's positioned that way. Obviously, we think that makes sense when you're talking about the lowest carbon content hydrocarbon. It seems a little bit odd that you would just put a pure tax on that when it has such an ability to help reduce emissions around the world.
So we're hopeful that we'll get to a wide place on that, but we think that actually could be positioned in a way that could be somewhat of a positive for us. So we look forward to that. So I think that's -- I don't know Chad or..."

So if that's where we land with AMT, that's not terrible for us. The question is going to really be around NLO usage against -- and so under the old tax scheme when we had an alternate tax before, you could take up to 80% of your NLOs  against your income for the alternative minimum tax calculation. That's not clear in the current legislation. As we've thought about it, we've seen -- let's say we could take 50% or take 50% of your income out usage of NLOs. That alternative minimum tax would be not that sizable for us. We'd probably be able to cover it with excess cash flow. So that's how we look at it now.

And so that yield continued to go down and therefore move away from that multiple during the period since we announced the buyback. But I would say as we don't make investment in that or if we continue to invest in earnings, either one of those will continue to drive our credit metrics to a more positive place, which will drive down the 10-year debt, which then will improve the price on that or the -- would lower the yield, which we would invest in. So I think it's pretty natural in terms of how that will occur. If money is flowing in a way that is improving our credit metrics, you would expect our 10-year rate to continue to improve, which would continue to lower the yield and eventually, we would hit a point in which we would be buying back, but we certainly stand ready. And if that price moves of that zone, we'll be anxious to be taking advantage of that, if that occurs.

And we believe we've got the worth of about $2 billion or so that we could invest between both Northwest and Transco on those projects. And that could be a very long-term program, over maybe 6 years or so. And so when you start doing the math on that, that's $300 million to $500 million a year potentially that we could deploy there.

First, to the projects, I would just say our returns generally continue to improve. One that's kind of been -- as we've said many times, there's kind of a double-edged sword about the difficulty of building projects. It certainly has, I think, been detrimental to the country and the industry overall. But to the degree that you're the incumbent with pipe in place and you can expand those via brownfield that it effectively expands our return opportunity in that regard. So I would just say that the returns in general, not saying that they always will be that way. But in general, these returns that for these -- the Mid-Atlantic projects that we're mentioning are at least as good as Atlantic Sunrise or better. And so that's kind of the way to think about that REAs and attractive return projects as well.
And the question of how many do you have, we keep the slide updated in there about the number of projects in development in our appendix. And it always looks like it's the same old slide, but in reality, that we are moving projects from development into execution, and we have new projects flowing in there that are keeping that pipeline very full. So I would just tell you, we don't see much backing off in the way of opportunity for expansions of our transmission systems. And with that, obviously, will flow gas from the low-cost producing areas, and we're well positioned to capture that on the gathering side as well. So despite what you might think when you listen to the media and the rhetoric, it's certainly not showing up and people's reluctance to make long-term commitments to our transmission systems for supplies that they know they're going to need, whether that's to back up renewables or whether it is a base load that it's people and our customers certainly understand that it takes time to build these projects and then it takes long-term commitments to being built, and that's what we're continuing to see."

So don't expect -- we don't expect anything special if we did some kind of asset sale and by the way, don't run off with that one because there's no intent behind that was something special or some kind of structure that delivered a bunch of cash, then we would consider that. But right now, there's -- I think you should expect steady growth in our dividend that's well covered and very durable. And we think this is the kind of business. We've built a long-term durable business as I think we've proven out, and we think that our yield on our dividend ought to continue to trade down                and durability and the growth in our dividend. And I think it's a pretty hard dividend to compete with, frankly, given its security and the growth in it by both the utility sector and within our peer group.

Maybe starting with your last question, yes, the incentives will be supportive in accelerating project opportunities. I think as we've discussed, hydrogen has been without an incentive structure and really need an incentive structure to help support being projects jump started. And I would also say that it is still early days on the hydrogen front. We're at the pilot stage on -- I would characterize project opportunities. But as far as our ambition goes and if things prove out, if costs continue to come down, as we expect they would, the incentives get passed. In Wyoming, for example, Alan talked about the potential to develop an energy hub in Wyoming in partnership with Ørsted and others, you could envision a very large wind power production facility, 300 to 500 megawatts if not larger. There's a tremendous wind resource in Wyoming that hasn't been fully developed because it's not easy to build electric infrastructure to deliver that power to markets outside of Wyoming. We have pipeline infrastructure that can deliver that energy to other parts of the country. And so we could build a very substantial wind power generation platform tied to several hundred megawatts of hydrogen production that we can move through -- we believe we could move through our existing infrastructure to customers across our footprint.
So those are big ambitions. And I would tell you, again, it's very early innings. But the pieces are coming together, and we're very hopeful. We're going to start by crawling before we walk and put some projects online that I think will demonstrate the feasibility, but that gives you just 1 example. And looking at others across our footprint, but that's 1 example of where we think we can get to scale."

And we were able in the Wyoming area even though this should have showed up in the production volumes coming out on the C3. I think it's always a good thing to pay attention to the C3-plus volumes because, obviously, the ethane comes in and out based on pricing and C3-plus is kind of a better indicator of what's available on a regular basis. But I would say the processing plant facility in Wyoming that we picked up earlier in the year, which was an adjacent plant to Eco Springs shutdown, and we were able to pick those volumes up and those volumes came directly into our system as well. And so we also picked up some volumes off of a competitor pipeline there during the bankruptcy process from South Glenn so those volumes flowed into us as well.
So they're at Echo Springs or our Wamsutter facility. We've really been able to pick up the equity volumes that are coming to us. So some of that equity would have gotten produced. Some of it would have gone on to competitor pipeline. All of that is now coming into our pipeline. And so that some of."

What I would say is that we are seeing strong interest from both LNG off-takers and utility customers. We have a wellhead to water and a wellhead bird strategy with respect to responsibly source gas. We haven't been extremely explicit on our plans in this area because we've been working very hard and long as Alan mentioned, we have a very credible solution in place. And I will tell you that we're clearly seeing a need within the marketplace to demonstrate not only within our footprint, but to work with our upstream partners and to work with our downstream customers to really track the full life cycle emissions footprint, the gas that flows through our systems.
And so we will be announcing several solutions that we are going to be focused on delivering for our customers. We have been in discussions with several of our customers, but we think we can marry the solutions that we're developing with our producing partners efforts as well as our LNG customers and our utility customers. And we want to be able to shine a very credible light on the emissions footprint of the products that we move, the gas that we move for our systems and then show how we are going to drive down those emissions over time.
And just circling back to Alan's comments also, the Transco system is the largest, most flexible pipeline system here in the United States. We have the benefit of having multiple lines in our right of way. We can do a lot with that system and demonstrate a lower emissions footprint today and to show a continually decreasing emissions footprint over time. We want to make sure we can do that in a very credible manner. And so -- and I do truly believe we are working with the Sequent team to make sure we can market that gas has an incredible responsibly sourced product. And we are seeing a real intense focus on that front.
To the point where we've even had meetings with utility customers that have told us, they are looking at the midstream providers to understand the emissions footprint of their potential gas supply, and they're going to factor that into their decisions with respect to how they source their gas. And we think that sets up very well for us again because we've got, I think, the most modern, most efficient system in the United States."

So I think that's about as far as it's gone at this point. But I think it's certainly something -- I think it's pretty strong support across the industry for making that more of a determinant in the marketing space, and we certainly want to be a part of that.

And so the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is going to be a real driver of growth as you look out 3 years. And then beyond that, as we've mentioned many times, investing in the modernization of our rate base, which will come with emissions reduction along our systems and about $400 million of solar projects that we are moving rapidly through the development stage right now and starting to move towards execution on those projects. So those are kind of the primary drivers. That hasn't really changed a whole lot. I would say some of the projects on Transco are moving up from our development list into execution list.

And thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to share the results of a very strong fourth quarter, rounding out a year of record business performance for Williams but yet again, illustrates the stability and predictability of our business. So starting here with Slide 1.
First of all, I'm thrilled to announce that our EBITDA once again exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance range for the fourth consecutive year and resulted in a 4% CAGR for the same 4-year period and that also during the same period, we dramatically improved our credit metrics through our asset sale program. So really a nice, steady period here of very predictable growth and balance sheet improvement.
This unmatched predictability is important to our value proposition and is further reinforced by this being the 20th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding Street expectations. We also met or exceeded all of our other key financial metrics, allowing us to once again produce positive free cash flow even after buying the outstanding interest in Caiman II that controls Blue Racer Midstream in the fourth quarter.
Our focus on continuously improving our project execution, our operating margin ratio, reliability metrics and safety performance delivered strong financial performance again in 2020 and allowed us to yet again achieve record gas gathering volumes and contracted gas transmission capacity. And all of these steady improvements and accomplishments build off of a clear foundational strategy that allows us to stay focused and aligned across the organization.
We demonstrated incredible business resiliency in a year of unprecedented challenges for our industry and our country. Our strong results in 2020 show just how durable this business can be against several headwinds such as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated oil price collapse, major customer bankruptcies and an active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico that exceeded anything from an outage standpoint that we had on record.
This tumultuous 2020 market environment allowed us to truly distinguish ourselves. In fact, we were one of the few Midstream companies to maintain and in fact, deliver on our pre-COVID guidance ranges that we provided to you in 2019. And I'm excited to see what this organization can produce without the large number of headwinds that we navigated through this past year in '21.
Moving on here. In addition to executing on our business in 2020, we accelerated our ESG performance. Last summer, Williams became the first U.S. Midstream company to announce a climate commitment, setting an emissions reduction goal for 2030 that is based on real achievable targets and that imposes accountability on the management team that's setting these goals. We believe that focusing on the right here and right now opportunity sets us on a positive trajectory to achieving net zero target by 2050.
In addition, we co-led an industry effort to standardize ESG metrics with the Energy Infrastructure Council. And in January, we hosted the industry's first ever ESG event specifically devoted to sharing the company's direction, goals, aspirations and tangible accomplishments related to ESG performance.
In summary, in 2020, we once again demonstrated the stability and predictability of our business and importantly, we've also shown the ability to focus and execute our plan without being distracted by the challenging macro backdrop.
And with that, I'll turn it over to John to go through the details."

At a very high-level summary for the quarter, our cost reduction efforts, new Transco projects brought into service, incredibly strong results out of our Northeast G&P segment and a catch-up of minimum volume commitment EBITDA from a favorab",2046,"Thanks, Alan. At a very high-level summary for the quarter, our cost reduction efforts, new Transco projects brought into service, incredibly strong results out of our Northeast G&P segment and a catch-up of minimum volume commitment EBITDA from a favorable Wamsutter-Southland bankruptcy settlement helped to offset a decline in profits from deferred revenue step-downs at our Gulfstar deepwater platform, along with shut-ins from hurricane activities early during the fourth quarter of 2020.
As you can see the strong performance in our statistics on this page, in fact, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics, both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $52 million or 4% for all of the reasons I just mentioned. The same played out in our year-to-date results. Adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was up $90 million or 2%.
However, I think it's interesting to point out that if you adjust for noncash to deferred revenue step-downs at our Gulfstar platform and at our Barnett gathering system, both of which were known and expected, as well as a few other smaller noncash items, our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA without these noncash comparability items is actually up 4%, again, much like it was during the fourth quarter. We'll discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 29%, largely due to increased EBITDA and reduced income taxes that were due in the fourth quarter of '19. There were -- there was a larger-than-normal state tax adjustment and also, to a certain extent, lesser interest expense this year. Our year-to-date EPS is also up 11%, again, due to increased EBITDA, lower allocations of income to noncontrolling interest owners, and again, to a lesser extent, due to lower interest expense.
This quarter, we're presenting a new cash flow metric, and we'll continue to present this going forward. The measure is available funds from operations. This measure will replace distributable cash flow and is similar to DCF, except it's derived from cash from operations and is before all capital spending, including before maintenance capital. Or said differently, AFFO is simply cash from operations, adjusting out working capital fluctuations and also adjusting for cash flows from or to our noncontrolling interest owners that shows up in the financing section of our cash flow statement.
A reconciliation of this measure of the cash from operations can be found in the appendix of this presentation and also in our analyst package. You can see the AFFO grew for both the fourth quarter and year-to-date, similar to the growth in adjusted EBITDA, except some of the EBITDA growth is from our consolidated JVs. And so some of that growth does belong and does flow to our JV owners.
Distributable cash flow increased for the quarter due to higher EBITDA and also due to a $42 million alternative minimum tax refund we received during the quarter that was not present in the 2019 period. DCF for the year is also up again due to higher EBITDA and lower maintenance capital offset somewhat by increased EBITDA paid to our noncontrolling interest owners and due to lower alternative minimum tax cash refunds that we received for overall in 2020 versus 2019.
On the capital spending front, our intentional capital discipline drove capital spending down this year and free cash flow up. And to that point, our total capital spending for the year was 40% less than last year and that our spending this year included the acquisition of most of the remaining interest in the Caiman II Blue Racer ownership for about $160 million in mid-November. As a result of that acquisition, we are now a 50% owner of Blue Racer with First Reserve owning the other 50% interest, and we're excited to see what synergies we can bring to that business now that we have a larger stake and we're the operator.
Included in this capital spending number is also maintenance capital, which for the year was $393 million, about $107 million less than it was in 2019. Finally, if you put our AFFO in 2020 of $3.6 billion, up against our total capital spending, including maintenance of $1.5 billion and our dividend of $1.9 billion, you can see that we were free cash flow positive in 2020. This strong cash generation and capital discipline has helped move us towards our goal to improve our leverage metrics for the year. And this year, our debt-to-EBITDA metrics ended at 4.35x, down from 4.39x at the end of 2019.
So now let's go to the next slide and dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. As you'll hear throughout each segment, cost control has been a big benefit this year. Before we dive in each segment, we believe it's important to isolate a few unusual items to make the numbers more comparable and reflective of the ongoing performance of the business.
We've identified those unusual items, which are shown on this chart as noncash comparability items. Interestingly, for the quarter, they net to only $2 million, and they consist primarily of 2 things. The first is a $24 million reduction in noncash deferred revenue step down in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment on our deepwater Gulfstar platform.
As a reminder, our deferred revenue, we received significant upfront cash payments several years ago from the deepwater producer but did not recognize revenue at that time. We have been amortizing the payments we previously received in the income over the last several years and that amortization has been shrinking.
The second unusual item is a $20 million minimum volume commitment true-up entry that we made in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to our settlement with Southland who agreed to pay us the MVCs they owed us for the year. This adjustment is for the first through the third quarter that we recorded in the fourth quarter. We had stopped recording those MVCs at the beginning of 2020 when Southland originally filed for bankruptcy.
So with or without those noncash items, our EBITDA was up over 4%. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment produced results that were $25 million better than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $17 million in revenues for the quarter, including the Gateway project that came into service in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Hillabee Phase 2 project that came into service in the second quarter of 2020 and the Southeastern Trail project that we need to service during the fourth quarter of 2020.
We also did have a little over $20 million in lower cost during the fourth quarter of '20 due to lower maintenance and lower labor expenses. Offsetting these positives was $10 million in lower Gulf of Mexico profit due to shut-ins resulting from hurricane activity occurring in October, which is unusual for hurricane activity this late in the year. The impact of the shut-ins can be further seen in reduced deepwater gathering volumes, which were down about 13% quarter-over-quarter.
The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on very strong, producing record results and contributing $29 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 7% in the quarter and processing volumes were up 9%. The volume growth was predominantly at our joint ventures in the Bradford Supply Hub where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019 and at our Marcellus South supply basin where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads.
As a result, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by a little over $20 million in the Northeast, which also includes the additional benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer, again, due to our increased ownership, which again was acquired in mid-November. The Northeast also benefited from cost reduction efforts of about $9 million, much of which came from reduced labor costs.
And then finally, on the West, our West segment was down about $8 million compared to 2019. But within that, revenues overall improved a little less than $2 million in the West, with increases coming from higher rates and net MVCs in the Eagle Ford supply basin due to the contract renegotiations that have been completed with Chesapeake in late 2019 and due to special payments received from our partner on OPPL for allowing them to pull volumes off of the system. These revenue increases were offset somewhat by lower deferred revenues in the Barnett shale, lower Haynesville revenues due to lower volumes and rate and slightly lower volumes in the Midcontinent and Rockies.
Despite revenues being up in total, gathered volumes for the West were down 8%. Interestingly though, roughly 90% of that volume decline occurred in the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Wamsutter. And of note, each of these basins were impacted by a customer bankruptcy. And with the Southland filing a reemergence filing a couple of weeks ago, all those bankruptcies should be resolved soon.
Also of note, in 2 of those 3 basins where we saw a majority of our volumes decline, specifically in the Wamsutter and Eagle Ford, our revenues are protected by MVCs. So overall, the reduced volumes only had a small impact on revenues. And just as with our other segments, the West experienced lower cost of about $3 million as we keep a relentless focus on efficiencies and cost controls.
Now offsetting the higher revenues and lower costs in the West were commodity margins, which declined about $8 million due in part to lower volumes and due to a contract commitment there. We also had the absence of a favorable property tax reimbursement that we received in the fourth quarter of 2019 that was $6 million and was something that we had received from a third-party compression provider. And we also had lower JV EBITDA in the fourth quarter of '20 of about $4 million with most of that coming from lower OPPL profits. And again, though, our partner on OPPL [ kept us whole ], as I mentioned a minute ago, reflected in our revenues.
Now moving to year-to-date results. Our year-to-date results showed growth of 1.8% in adjusted EBITDA, driven by many of the same factors affecting our fourth quarter growth. The Barnett and Gulfstar noncash deferred revenue step-downs totaled $109 million in 2020 versus 2019. While the net impact of commodity price fluctuations on our inventory line fill position created an $8 million noncash reduction in EBITDA.
So without those noncash comparability items, full year adjusted EBITDA results were actually up more like 4%, much like our fourth quarter results. And then looking at that by segment, the Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets delivered $41 million of growth with an uplift coming from expansion projects and expense reductions being offset somewhat by lower Gulf of Mexico volumes and the impact that has had on commodity margins in the TGOM area. In the Gulf of Mexico, the total impact of shut-ins from COVID, hurricanes and the price collapse earlier in 2020 had about a negative $49 million impact to our EBITDA.
The Northeast is obviously a huge part of our growth this year adding $194 million in EBITDA in 2020 versus the prior year with the overall gathering volumes up 7% and incremental revenues being realized from processing, transportation and fractionation of gas and NGLS, while at the same time, we have been reducing costs.
And finally, in the West, it's off by $33 million, largely because of the Barnett MVC payments that ended in June of 2019 and lower Haynesville profits due to lower realized rates being offset somewhat by reduced operating expenses in the West. Otherwise, in the West, our gathered volumes were down about 4%, but they were largely offset by higher rates and the MVCs in the Eagle Ford due to the renegotiated contract with Chesapeake in December of 2019.
So again, all in all, despite a tough market and a tough hurricane season, we've had a really good year on the back of cost reductions, Northeast performance and new pipeline projects coming into service on Transco. I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to discuss our 2021 guidance. Alan?"

Well, thanks, John, and now we're going to turn to our '21 EBITDA guidance metric. So I want to emphasize that we continue to expect the same level of supportive fundamentals underpinning our base business for '21. However, we do have more upside potential than we had in 2020 in this plan due in part to upstream transactions that have the potential to drive incremental cash flows across our Midstream assets in '21 and beyond plus an emerging gas storage imbalance caused by the recent higher demand that will likely put a call on gas-directed drilling here in '21 as well.
So we're providing our initial EBITDA guidance range of $5.05 billion to $5.35 billion with the midpoint up 2% over last year. And we'll get to EBITDA drivers here in just a second on what those specifics are, but let's go through the rest of the guidance here.
Our available funds from operations or AFFO, as John described, which will now replace the DCF, are expected to be within a range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, which translates to a per share range of $2.92 up to $3.16 per share. And importantly, even with a 2.5% increase in the dividend announced earlier in the year, we are still maintaining similar coverage on our dividend, whether looking at the DCF metric or AFFO metric, and this continues to really underscore the continued safety of our dividend.
Our growth CapEx of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion is expected to remain in line with 2020, and this includes known opportunistic upstream acquisitions in the Wamsutter basin that will be immediately accretive to both credit metrics and earnings. And notably, we still expect to generate free cash flow after CapEx and dividend, which provide us financial flexibility.
And speaking of financial flexibility, we estimate ending the year with a leverage ratio of 4.25, but with the line of sight that we have currently, to a targeted 4.2 objective as we have consistently overachieved on this metric, and I know a lot of you all follow that very closely. We continue to perform very well on that. And we think we've got a lot of things that could help drive us towards that 4.2 -- or getting to that 4.2 here in '21.
So looking at drivers of our '21 EBITDA guidance, we expect continued Northeast G&P growth from the base business and to a lesser extent, the bolt-on Blue Racer acquisition. In our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business, we see Transco growth continuing to add stable EBITDA via the Southeastern Trails project that was just placed in service ahead of schedule at the end of the year. And we expect late year contributions to come from our Leidy South expansion, which is now under construction. And additionally, we expect a nice recovery in our Gulf of Mexico earnings this year due to less production outages from hurricane and the COVID-19 pandemic impacts.
Offsets to our EBITDA growth are driven primarily from lower NGL throughput on the jointly owned Overland Pass Pipeline, lower earnings on our jointly owned Rocky Mountain Midstream business in the DJ Basin and lower gathering rates from our global resolution in the Haynesville with Chesapeake Energy. So these are partial offsets that we do already have built into our guidance. And of course, on that last note, a lot of potential upside to us coming in the Haynesville, both from a much healthier Chesapeake, well positioned to develop the Haynesville, which is very well positioned in this gas market as well as our ability to drive volumes on the upstream properties that we now control.
Our takeaway here is that our EBITDA is primarily driven by growth in the base business with upstream EBITDA accounting for less than 1% of this forecast. We purposely did not include a full year of the upstream EBITDA from these existing producing reserves because we fully intend to transact during the year in a way that allows us to enjoy midstream cash flow growth in '22 and beyond as we find the right partner to fully exploit the growth available in these high-value properties that we were able to pick up this past year.
So we are in a very strong position now to ensure that this acreage is developed quickly and gets turned into fee-based growth on our existing Midstream capacity. So we really are excited about the upside potential that we've positioned ourselves for around that business.
So in closing, I'll reiterate that intense focus on our natural gas based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued moderate growth, improving returns and free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes are in the right place, and our formidable gathering assets are in low-cost basis that will be called on to meet gas demands that continue to grow.
We remain bullish on natural gas because we recognize the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world.
Williams is focused on sustainable operations, including ready-now solutions to address climate change. And by setting a near-term goal for 2030, we will leverage our natural gas focused strategy and today's technologies to focus on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions in and around our business. We also are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy network to deliver on this next phase of energy transition.
I also think it is important in light of last week's severe cold weather event to talk about the resiliency and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure. Despite historic cold that enveloped much of the country, Williams did not have -- we did not have to curtail any services to our gas transmission customers. And in fact, operate above design capacity on our Northwest Pipeline system for a period and delivered flawlessly on a new record 3-day peak on the Northwest Pipeline system. Our customers expect this from us based on our long history of performance, and we are certainly glad that they do.
However, last week's weather demonstrated the importance of a comprehensive energy strategy of -- the need for a comprehensive energy strategy for the U.S., one that doesn't demonize one energy source over the other but that includes the mix of energy that does not drive towards singular dependency because of labels imposed by the environmental opposition. And there are important and complex decisions that need to be [ balanced ] to address the things that we all want from our energy sources, reliability, affordability and balancing the issues of carbon intensity.
And when we think about carbon intensity, we really have to consider that from a global perspective. And we believe that when all of these factors are accurately weighed and balanced, natural gas will be a very critical part of the energy mix for many more decades to come.
So finally, I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of our entire workforce in ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to America's cities and communities not only this last week in the face of severe weather challenges but amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those who benefit from our services may never realize the work needed to ensure the continued access to safe and reliable energy. Our employees are critical infrastructure workers on the front lines of keeping our country's natural gas system operating and flowing, doing so while also enduring power outages and lack of water with their own homes.
I am extremely proud of our employees for their efforts to keep our operations running smoothly during these extreme circumstances while also going the extra mile to keep themselves and their coworkers safe and healthy.
And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."

Well, first of all, I would say, we -- in our base business, we have about $900 million of capital in what would be our normal base business. So it is a little bit lower than what we've had historically. And that is -- about half of that is in TGOM. So that includes Whale. It includes building out Leidy South, kind of the final dollars on Southeastern Trails and cleanup and so forth on the Southeastern Trails and some money on the front end of the REA project. So that's kind of the primary drivers there in TGOM, that's about half of that $900 million.
And then on the balance of that, about 2/3 of that is into Northeast, both finishing up projects as well as getting some new projects started that are driving higher margins for us in the Northeast and some of that growth. A lot of that investment actually will drive growth in '22 there in the Northeast as well.
And then finally, the balance of that is in the West, some of that is in the Permian, pretty good expansion going on in the Permian as well as in the Haynesville area as we're really going to be having to work hard to keep out [ front of a lot ] the drilling activity that's emerging there in the Haynesville. So that pretty well rounds that up.
The second part of your question around the opportunistic upstream involves us taking advantage of the strong position we had with our Midstream assets out there, particularly around the Southland bankruptcy. And we will be in the position of acquiring both the BP acreage out there that's adjacent and intermingled with that as well as the Southland acreage.
And we're able, given our position in the bankruptcy there, we were able to pick that up for some very attractive pricing. And as a result now, we're going to be working to gain the right person, the right party to rapidly develop those reserves and take advantage of the latent Midstream capacity that we have out there.
So we are really excited about that both in the Wamsutter because there's a tremendous amount of value to be driven across our Midstream assets by using the PDP cash flows to drive that as well as in the Haynesville, where we're already seeing Chesapeake get very focused on developing the remaining -- the northern part of the Haynesville that they hung on to -- and as well some very attractive interest coming from parties that we're in a process to find the right party to develop the Haynesville acreage.
So I want to make it clear, we have no intention of hanging on to that. We're not going to become an E&P business. There is no if, ands or buts on that front. But this does allow us to put the right parties in place and assure ourselves that we have the right parties in place to take the cash flows off of these assets and put it back into the drill bit to drive Midstream cash flow.
So really has turned into something actually a lot more positive than we were expecting. And we really feel like there's a lot of upside from this, both in '21 and as well though into '22 and beyond as we attract the capital to develop those reserves. So really, what is normally an area that might have been a problem for us with all these bankruptcies, we really were able to find a way to really turn some lemons into lemonade there, and we're really excited about the kind of value that's going to be driven out there over the next several years."

So we paid less than $200 million for those assets, actually significantly less than $200 million, more to the tune of 150 to 160-point for that acreage. Then we have very little EBITDA in our guidance for that because we're not sure exactly what kind of partnership structure we'll have. Or somebody will just buy us out of that acreage, will we partner and so EBITDA uplift. So there's a lot of big upside, I think, that we can see out of that."

So that was good to see.
In South Mansfield, we view that as an additional opportunity where we have 350 million to 550 million a day of capacity available from a Midstream perspective for development in that area. We closed on that transaction prior to '21. And we've been out now talking to potential partners, and we've seen incredibly robust interest in this asset. It is a contiguous blocked up position in some really top-tier both Haynesville and Mid-Bossier area and again, has available Midstream capacity.
I would say that we're likely to finalize our partnership strategy over the next couple of months. I expect that we will have a very strong, well-capitalized partner that will operate that asset, and we'll dedicate 1 to 2 rigs at any given time to really fill up and utilize that capacity.

We really developed that plan before we've seen this recent call. And I think this week, we're going to see a huge pull on natural gas from storage this week and likely take us down below the 5-year average.
And meanwhile, production, we really haven't seen the activity in production to stabilize that decline in storage. And the places that are going to be able to respond to that quickly are going to be Haynesville and the Marcellus and Utica. And so we didn't have any of that in our plans when we laid this plan out. So certainly, that is upside to this.
In fact, most of the growth in the Northeast was really just margin expansion. It wasn't really a lot of volume -- expected volume growth. The growth that we've had there has really just been margin expansion.
So that is certainly an attractive upside for us there. It is not based on the Upstream at all. In fact, we basically assumed -- we just got the PDPs flowing in here for Haynesville and Wamsutter, assuming a July kind of finality to finding the right owners. So we only have cash flows in here on the Wamsutter area through about July.
And in the Haynesville, we do have the PDPs in there, but we also have development capital that likely would be coming out of there if that gets done. So I wouldn't be the first to admit that we've been very conservative on our -- on the Upstream side of this because we really want to leave ourselves full flexibility, and we didn't -- to be able to either fully dispose of the asset if the right price was there. But at the end of the day, we just wanted to have full flexibility. So we were very conservative in how we included the value of those Upstream positions.
And you're right, I think the upsides are probably mostly related to volumes in the Northeast. But I would also say we remain pretty conservative in the forecast that we have for the deepwater and any other area, frankly, that can contribute from a gas side.
So -- and then I would say the other area that we've included, we have assumed rising cost versus 2020. We did a great job in 2020 on cost and our '21 does assume that we've got some come back on costs that, frankly, the team has just been doing a terrific job in managing. And so that's another area of opportunity for us as well."

We do expect that it could a little bit more active in '21.

The -- but I would just say as well, our team did a great job of doing things like selling fuel [ in trains ] that we had bought at first of the month, turning down our processing recoveries and then selling that fuel in trains back into the market.
And so I would tell you that, I think net-net, it's going to be a little bit of a positive for us in terms of the way we manage things.

And to the degree that we have a line of sight for how that's going to happen, that's how we see it. And so far, they've been pretty accurate, consistently pretty accurate in the way that they've been forecasting that. They know their reserves and they know the market.
I will say that -- obviously excited about Leidy South coming on and opening up additional capacity. That's about 580 million a day of additional takeaway capacity out of the Northeast, and our team has got a really good head start on Leidy South on the projects there. And so again, great execution going on by that team. And then ultimately, REA will be additional takeaway out of that area as well.
So we're -- really, those projects are very important from a synergy standpoint because not only do we get nice returns on the transmission, we get the gathering volume uplifts -- upstream of that as well."

And in fact, as a result of that, it would probably drive us in the other direction because it's basically saying there's a weak market right now for GDP assets. And if that's true, then this probably wouldn't be the right time to be liquidating assets.
So not to say we don't constantly have our eyes open to structure and things that can add value from that. But I think we're in a position of getting to our leverage metrics in a pretty straightforward manner, and particularly these upstream assets could be a really nice tool for that as well.

And I think now a lot of those questions are cleared up and you can see through our performance. I think we demonstrated the resiliency. And through diversification, not that we didn't have issues in certain basins, but we had good performance in other basins, and it kind of washes itself out.
And so what I would say is while the market is probably a little bit weaker, I think our demonstrated performance front of the business is a little bit stronger, a little bit clearer now a year later.

You guys once again highlighted about a $12 billion backlog on transmission projects.

But I think you have to be careful about drawing that kind of conclusion. Most of the projects that we've been doing have been 6%. We still were rolling off a lot of deferred revenue this last year and a little bit into '21. So I think you have to be careful about making those kind of broad assumptions.
So for instance, when the deepwater business comes on, that's going to be a very high-growth rate on a fairly low amount of capital. And in the Northeast, sometimes we get nice surges of margin based on very high incremental return opportunities as they come to us.
And on the other hand, we have a decline built that's just part of the gathering business. If there's an area that's not growing, there's a decline that's working against it all the time. But I would tell you that it's more complex than taking $1 billion in saying that, that produces 2%.
On the other thing, and I would say I think we feel very comfortable with a 2% growth rate. If we are investing $1 billion, we feel very comfortable with achieving a 2% growth rate. But given some of the upside that we've got in some of these areas, I think that probably would be kind of considered a floor from my perspective on that. So we might talk about potential problems on this."

We look at that backlog, and it's really dynamic because we have a lot of projects that come into that backlog and that we execute on a lot of those projects. And Southeastern Trail is one that came out of the backlog like South came out of that backlog and became an execution project. And Regional Energy Access will be the same once we get that filing underway and their permitting underway.
So you'll continue to see projects come out of our backlog and move it into the execution phase over the next several years. There's a plethora of opportunities along the Transco corridor to take advantage of coal-fired generation that's going to come off-line and ultimately be converted to gas and renewables.
And I think from the activities we've seen in Texas and Oklahoma over the last week, there definitely needs to be a mixture of energy generation resources in the mix in order to diversify across fuel sources. And so I'm a true believer of that.
Our company is definitely a natural gas focused company now adding in some renewable mix into the play there to take advantage of some opportunities we have. But ultimately, on the Transco system, we're going to be able to drive a lot of new capital investment there on the back of coal-fired generation going away.
And then lastly, our emissions reduction program projects, we have upwards of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of investment opportunity there on the Transco system and likely replacing a large component of our reciprocating compression to do modern either electric drives or gas turbines to reduce our emissions footprint there along the Transco corridor. So there's definitely a lot of investment opportunity that we envision coming in the future for Transco's asset footprint."

Compared to the way the business used to be structured, we just had very little and it's getting harder and harder to see, frankly. But the areas that we do have the most exposure are keep-whole, primarily, keep-whole agreements in our Opal area. And we do have some exposure in the Gulf Coast as well.
So you'll see that listed as Southwest Wyoming when I say Opal. I think in our EBITDA breakout, I think it shows you Southwest Wyoming. So that's the majority of that exposure. And again, we do have some margin in places like our Discovery asset in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. But I think the total and plan on a gross margin basis, we're down to well under 2% now. So it's a really, really small number."

And clearly, the public markets are just -- have been sour about spending on anything. And I think the private markets have been seeing the opportunity and taking advantage of that pullback. We certainly are seeing that Haynesville is the poster child for that, for sure, where there's so much private capital that's going to work there.
But it's an attractive place because you don't have a lot of the basis risk that you have to manage in the long-haul capacity risk that you have to manage coming out of the Marcellus. So it's an easy place to go in, in a fairly derisked manner. And that's what's attracting -- as Chad mentioned, that's also what's attracting a lot of capital to our opportunity there in the Haynesville.
So that's -- definitely, the money that can come in and get out pretty quickly by turning a bit and turning it into cash up against the -- the current forward strip, which is what a lot of the private parties are doing is what we're seeing. So it's a fairly derisked model and they're just looking around the various basins for opportunities to do that.

And I think as we get to this end of this year, obviously, that will be -- but make no mistake about it, the first thing, and we've been very clear on this, is debt reduction is the first place to go with that.
Once we get beyond that, things like investing in our rate base on Transco on things like the emission reduction project will be put up against other alternatives for that capital reduction, whether that's further debt reduction or share buyback. And those are the things that would be in competition for that further capital allocation as we get into that year.
But it's an interesting dilemma because not very many people -- in fact, I don't know if I could describe to you too many other pipelines that are in the position of being able to invest in the rate base. And for us, the cost of capital, it just hasn't met that return hurdle internally.
So in the past, it really hadn't been thought of as an opportunity. But as we think about the emission reduction project, that's a very sizable capital investment opportunity that will make a decision on that versus other alternatives from a cost to capital standpoint.

But if you look in our analyst package and if you look at the operating costs in each of our segments and you compare 2019 to 2020, you'll see a number of a $223 million reduction in operating expense. But I want to be clear on that.
2019 had incremental expenses because we did a voluntary severance program and we're cutting costs of -- 2019 costs were elevated. 2020 costs were low because we've changed the benefits program around days off. And anyway, it resulted in a $40 million benefit to 2020 expense. I'm dragging you through all that to say that $223 million reduction in expenses on a normalized adjusted EBITDA basis is only a $100 million reduction, $103 million reduction in expenses between 2019 and 2020, and that includes an $11 million increase in property -- in operating taxes, [indiscernible] taxes.
And so we saved about $114 million between '19 and '20. We think about 70% of that will stick going into '21. So 30% of that revert. So we'll see costs go up by about $30 million just due to operating costs kind of not -- that's not retaining all that savings. And then operating taxes, probably for another $20 million to $25 million. So you're looking at probably $50 million of total expense increases in '21. So a great job.
