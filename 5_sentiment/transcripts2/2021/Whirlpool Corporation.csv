Before we begin, I'll remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports. We also want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.

In difficult times like the one we're living through today, it is important that we remain true to our guiding principles.  Whirlpool's 110-year history is rooted in our value-driven commitment to our shareholders, employees, consumers and communities in which we operate. 
In 2020, we faced unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, yet we remain firm in our commitment to all of our stakeholders. The health and well-being of our employees was and it remains our top priority. We increased safety measures at all manufacturing plants and provided additional resources to care for families and those who fell ill. We established business continuity plans to ensure our consumers have received our products to improve life at home with their families. And we continue to support our global communities by procuring medical supplies, making donations and engineering critical equipment for frontline workers. 
In parallel, we made significant advancements to onboard our sustainability targets, resulting in ratings improvements and external recognition. Most notably, we received a low risk rating from Sustainalytics, a year-over-year improvement driven by our outstanding energy and wealth efficiency programs and our strong global product safety systems. And we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of our long-standing sustainable business practices. 2020 marked our 14th time on the list in the last 15 years. 
I'm very proud of the way our employees have managed through this pandemic. It is ultimately the agility of our organization and the resilience of our employees that allowed us to deliver record results in 2020. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter 2020 highlights on Slide 4. We we delivered strong organic net sales growth of over 10%, driven by solid industry demand across the globe. Additionally, we delivered ongoing EBIT margin of over 11%, a second consecutive quarter of double-digit margins and a year-over-year expansion of 410 basis points. Lastly, we successfully executed our go-to-market initiative, and drove strong cost takeout across the globe leading to positive EBIT and EBIT margin expansion in all regions. 
Now turning to Slide 5, we will discuss our full year highlights. We took immediate and decisive action as we announced and executed our 500 million-plus cost take-out program. Further, we realigned our go-to-market strategy to effectively operate within a supply-constrained environment. And structural and sustained positive demand trends and exceptional execution of our COVID-19 response strategy resulted in record ongoing earnings per share of $18.55, a 16% improvement compared to the prior year above our previous guidance. Record ongoing EBIT margin of 9.1%, a 220 basis point improvement and a 25% increase in total EBIT compared to the prior year. And record free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion with positive free cash flow in North America, Latin America and Europe. 
Despite significant macroeconomic uncertainty, we strengthened our balance sheet, and drove significant shareholder value. We reduced our gross debt leverage to 2.3x, making progress towards our long-term target of 2x. We delivered a return on invested capital of approximately 11%, representing the fourth consecutive year of improvement as we realize the benefits of continued EBIT margin expansion at an optimized asset base in our Europe region. Lastly, we returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and increased our dividends for the eighth consecutive year. 
Overall, the results we delivered in 2020 reflect the structural improvements we have made not just in 2020, but also in those made during the years before. We are a fundamentally different company with an improved margin and cash flow profile. 2020 could have been a setback for us, instead, we were able to significantly accelerate our progress towards our long-term financial goals. 
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, price mix delivered 375 basis points of margin expansion driven by reduced promotional investments and mix benefits as consumers invest in their homes. Additionally, we delivered on our cost takeout program positively impacting margins by 125 basis points. Further, reduced steel and resin costs resulted in a favorable impact of 125 basis points. These margin benefits were partially offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency. For the full year, very strong margin expansion from price mix and our cost takeout program were partially offset by increased brand investments in currency. 
Overall, we're very pleased to be delivering on our long-term EBIT margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive very strong results in '21. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

In North America, we delivered 4% revenue growth, driven by continued strong demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered record EBIT driven by the flawless execution of our cost takeout and go-to-market actions. Lastly, we continue to optimize our supply chain operations, driving weekly improvements in our production yield. Delivering top line growth and a record EBIT performance, the region's outstanding results again demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business model. 
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Share growth in Italy and the U.K., along with strong demand in the region, drove another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $29 million, led by increased demand and strong cost takeout. We overcame the challenges presented by COVID-19 and restored profitability to the region in line with our commitment at the start of the year. Our 2020 results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategic actions and the progress we have made to date. 
Turning to Slide 10, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 5% with organic net sales growth of 28%, led by strong demand in Brazil. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 12% with continued strong demand and disciplined execution of go-to-market actions, offsetting significant currency devaluation. Overall, the region's 2020 performance serves as a proof point of the viability of our long-term financial goals, highlighting our ability to deliver double-digit margins in a strong demand environment. 
Turning to Slide 11, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Asia region. In India, we delivered strong year-over-year net sales growth driven by demand recovery. In China, we delivered Whirlpool branded share growth in addition to EBIT improvement led by cost productivity actions. Overall, we are pleased to see a rebound in Asia and look forward to building on this momentum in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 13, Marc and I will discuss our full year 2021 guidance. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

Well needless to say some uncertainty remains as we continue to operate in a COVID environment. However, we do believe increased disposable income, investment in the home and a favorable housing shift are here to stay and will drive strong demand. 
Based on our internal model for industry and broad economy, we expect global industry growth of 4%. As we have demonstrated in 2020, we are uniquely positioned to capture restructure shifts and further advance our strategic priorities. 
It is with confidence that we provide our '21 guidance, which reflects our fourth consecutive year of record earnings per share and significant top line growth. We expect to drive net sales growth of approximately 6%, as we capitalize the strong demand and share gains in all regions. Additionally, we expect to deliver above 9% ongoing EBIT margin and deliver free cash flow of $1 billion or more. 
Turning to Slide 14, we show the drivers of our 9% plus ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect price/mix to deliver approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion through 3 key initiatives. One, disciplined execution of our go-to-market actions; two, recently announced cost-based price increase in Brazil, Russia and India; and three, new product launches, just to give you a few examples of our legacy of innovation. 
In 2020, we rolled out our new global dishwasher architecture, featuring the largest capacity for a rack dishwasher. In Europe, we launched a Red Dot Award-winning built-in induction cook top. In the United States, we entered the consumables detergent business with the launch of our ultra concentrated wash detergents. 
Next, we expect net cost to positively impact margin by 150 basis points as an ongoing cost productivity efforts, coupled with a carryover benefit from our 2020 cost takeout program more than offset elevated freight and labor costs. We expect raw material inflation to negatively impact margin by 150 basis points, led by higher steel and resin cost. Further, as we continue to invest in the future, we expect increased marketing and technology investments to drive a negative margin impact of 50 basis points while unfavorable currency, primarily Latin America, expected to impact margins by approximately 50 basis points. In total, we expect these actions to deliver 9% plus ongoing EBIT margin, an EBIT improvement of over $1 million compared to the prior year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items."

Turning to Slide 15, we show our regional guidance for the year. Starting with industry demand, we expect a robust demand environment for North America, supported by continued strength from consumer nesting trends and increased discretionary spending. Additionally, the impact from positive U.S. housing starts, which began to strengthen in late 2019 and strong existing home sales will translate to higher appliance demand. In EMEA, we expect a continued recovery in the first half of the year to support strong growth. While in Latin America, we expect modest growth of 2% to 4% as the benefits from government stimulus in Brazil are lessened. Asia industry is expected to accelerate by 6% to 8% as the region rebounds from prolonged shutdowns in 2020. 
Regarding our EBIT guidance, we expect very strong margins of 15% or more in North America. We expect the impact of favorable go-to-market initiatives and disciplined cost actions to offset cost inflation. In EMEA, we expect the strategic actions laid out during our 2019 Investor Day to drive EBIT margin expansion of over 250 basis points and a full year EBIT margin of over 2.5%. In Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of 7% or higher as steady demand improvements and positive price/mix are offset by continued currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil. Lastly, we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 2% or higher in Asia driven by demand recovery. 
Turning to Slide 16, we will discuss the drivers of our 2021 free cash flow. We expect another year of very strong cash earnings of approximately $2 billion driven by sustained EBIT margins. We plan to increase capital investments to historical levels to support the launch of innovative products around the globe. Additionally, we will continue to invest in world-class manufacturing and our digital transformation journey. Further, as we ended 2020 with record low inventory levels, we are planning for a moderate inventory build. 
We anticipate restructuring cash outlays of approximately $225 million primarily due to the impact of COVID-19-related restructuring actions executed in 2020 and the exit of our Naples, Italy operations. Overall, we expect to drive free cash flow of $1 billion or more as we focus on continuing to deliver record EBIT margin levels and prioritizing our capital investments. 
Turning to Slide 17, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. We remain fully committed to funding the business, driving innovation and growth while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. We expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future. We have reinstated our share repurchase program that had been temporarily suspended during the height of the pandemic. With a clear focus on returning increased levels of cash to shareholders, we expect to repurchase shares at moderate levels. Lastly, we have a clear line of sight to delivering on our long-term goal of gross debt-to-EBITDA of 2x. 
Now on Slide 18, I'll turn it back over to Marc to summarize our key messages."

Let me just recap what you've heard over the past few minutes. We are extremely pleased to see that despite the enormous challenges of operating in a global dynamic, our teams were able to deliver on our long-term value creation targets. In North America, we delivered nearly 16% EBIT margins for the full year, significantly above our long-term margin growth for the region of 13% plus. We restored the European region to profitability. In Latin America, we capitalized on strong industry demand, demonstrating the long-term margin potential in the region. And finally, we delivered record free cash flow of $1.25 billion or 6.4% of sales, above our long-term goal of 6% of sales. Further, we demonstrated an unwavering commitment to our environmental, social and governance priorities, resulting in significant advancements to our targets.

First of all, stepping back in North America Q4 -- not just Q4, we're needless to say exceptionally pleased with the overall financial performance in North America and the margins which we achieved in light of a pandemic which is still pretty severe. Now specifically to the volumes and the supply chain, now our overall volume directionally are in the line in the scope of what you talked about, which also means we're kind of on a sequential base Q3 versus Q4. We directionally kept market share. But year-over-year, we're down. So it's the same down, which we had also in Q3 and Q4, which is ultimately related to the supply chain constraints which we have. 
Now our supply chain constraints, and we talked about it in the prior earnings call, there are fundamentally pandemic-driven, i.e., you have absenteeism in factories, you have labor shortage, you have component shortages, which have been significant, and we have transportation bottlenecks. So yes, of course, we're improving month by month, but it's also against the demand, which is rising month by month. So we're kind of -- we're still having a fairly significant back order situation slightly better than at the end of Q3, but only slightly. And from everything which we see right now, that's where we -- in our prepared remarks that's probably by the end of Q2, a little bit depending on the progress of the pandemic which should be out of the constraints. But it will be around us pretty much as long as COVID is around us. It also would be crystal clear, it impacts pretty much everyone producing in the Americas, producing in Europe, it is less, almost no impact if you produce in China or Asia."

And again, we continue to implement and drive actions related to that. So we'll also have some some additional actions that rolled out in Q4 that will continue to get a benefit for this year. 
The second thing is if you look across our broader production base and as we get more efficient in understanding how to deal with some of the COVID inefficiencies that have come around, that will be a help for us. Incrementally, we expect volume to be, as we talked about, volume to be higher this year, so that will help to drive additional cost savings. And then on top of that, within any given year, we typically look to drive a certain amount of reduction in what we call infrastructure and SG&A spend. And so that's probably another big portion of what comes out there. But where we start the year in terms of the cost takeout programs we've already initiated versus what we've got in the pipeline, we feel very good about that number. 
Additionally, from a manufacturing footprint, we ceased production in our Naples facility in Italy during Q4. And so we'll start to see the benefits of that also rolling in this year from a cost perspective."

So I would say we have a -- I know you say it, we have a track record of being able to deal with costs. 
Now of course, we do know raw material is a headwind this year, and we showed earlier it's 250 to 300 million. But I think we have other tools to overcome some of these headwinds. And there's carryover, there's additional measures which we're taking. And as you also know, it's not the first raw material headwind we're dealing with, and we have dealt with very successfully in the past. 
The other thing also in raw material, because I see in some writing, not in new writing out there, people are always referring to spot prices, et cetera. Keep in mind, we are either having long-term contracts or hedged in certain positions. So I would say we're less exposed to volatility you see in spot markets than most other players.

So Eric, on the demand trend, First of all, we got to recognize in 2020, yes, you've all seen the North American industry volume was a positive. I think what most people lose sight of is the quality of demand has changed in a positive way. We saw, in particular in Q2 and beginning of Q3, you saw a lot of duress or COVID-related stress purchases, the freezers, the microwaves, et cetera, but that has gradually shifted more and more into the more higher mix, i.e., remodeled kitchen upgrades or rebuilding our entire home construction. 
So beyond the numbers of a volume, we're really pleased with the mix which comes with the increased volume. But it also means we do not see the demand as well with the COVID spike. Yes, there was a little bit of a COVID spike. This is structurally and sustained powerful demand which is yet coming to extremely strong housing trends, but it's more than housing. It's the entire home improvement. And we do not see that fundamentally changing anytime soon. 
That's probably on -- of all the global regions, I would say North America, may be the region where we're most bullish about. From a structural demand trend, it's very healthy, and we just do not see that slowing down. So I know the number which we guided to, but it could even be -- it might be even stronger.

As we've talked about, by the middle of the year is when we expect to begin to have worked through that, assuming that nothing in the environment changes around us, because most of these, as we've said, supply chain issues are COVID-driven. So that would put us in a place where we've really caught up only -- not only on the demand, but on the need for higher retail inventory levels. 
And then as you get into the back half of the year, you'll begin to see us build our inventory level slightly as we return to what would be a normalized environment, and we talked about during 2020, how our inventory levels came down during this time period. So I think that's kind of a path we see throughout the year, but by about midyear normalizing from a trade inventory level. And then in the third to fourth quarter, normalizing our inventories."

Now on the promotions going forward, as you know, we're not commenting on our go-forward pricing strategy. The only thing which I want to hint to and repeat is our promotion strategy has not changed, no matter what. We participate, then we can create value for us, the trade customer or the consumer.

Seems like we'll continue into the first half. And if that's correct, I mean, should we be thinking about more of a flat to down price/mix dynamic in the back half? Related to this is, I heard that, if I heard right, you talked about price increases in Russia, Brazil, India, but not the U.S., despite obviously having significant raw material inflation, and I was just wondering if the -- in lieu of those normally what we'd expect would be some price increases to offset raw materials.

And to begin with, as we look at -- we're very happy with the performance that we saw in the back half of the year within EMEA and the margin improvement that we made. Now we have to remember that EMEA typically does have their first quarter is their lowest quarter of the year. So we do expect to continue to be profitable. But obviously, when you look at a quarter -- sequential quarter-over-quarter, we wouldn't expect to see continued margin growth within Q1. 
For the full year, we do expect the margin growth to obviously to materialize to 2.5%. And a big part of what drives that is, one, you've got cost takeout actions that took place. And many of those were not implemented until the back half of the year within EMEA. Two, as I've talked about, with the share gains that we've seen and the continued improvement in volumes there and demand there, we do feel very positive on that. So both of those set us up coming out of 2021 on what I would say is a good trajectory that we feel will put us on track to our longer-term margin goals there. 
Now the bigger drivers of that will continue to be cost takeout. In addition to with the market share gains that we're seeing right now and some of the new product introductions we're doing. We do expect to grow volumes there, and we've talked about that over the next few years. That's one of the key drivers to get those margins to a healthier longer-term level."

So I'm very pleased that that huge spend in Q2, we were able to achieve on a full year base of profit in Europe, which midyear was a very difficult target to even think about. But we achieved the full year profit. 
Now we all know achieving a profit is not a heroic achievement, but it's an important milestone. And what it basically tells me is with the second half performance, we're back on track with a trajectory which we laid out in front of you, which said we want to get Europe very quickly to 2% to 4%. And when viable work and the long-term strategic levers, get it on track versus 7% or 8% operating margin target, which we talk about.

Without getting into details of our percentages, I think let me maybe more make the qualitative comments, which also adds to why we're confident, in particular in North America, on the long-term demand trends. As you know, on the replacement side, we were running against the trough of the industry in 2008 to 2010. We're now pretty much coming out of this trough. Keep also in mind when people typically take this reference to 8 to 10 years appliance, that's when you replace. Last year was a year of extreme intense use at home, which probably accelerated the replacement of -- the need for replacement. So I would say on a fundamental replacement, we're now coming, I think, soon, the trough will be behind us. So that will give strength. 
On top of that, we saw last year, throughout the year, I talked about significantly higher discretionary demand, first coming from really the duress and stress to really structure improvement, and I think on top of that, the housing side will come stronger and stronger and stronger. The housing side, the only thing where you probably don't see extreme numbers in the short term is it's housing supply constraints, okay? But you saw housing starts 1.7 million or 1.667 December. That is a promising sign, and it's been the highest in a long time. Still far away from where we believe it should be. It should be around 2 million housing starts. So that is not yet fully in the numbers. But again, that's -- these are all the data points, which give us the high degree of confidence in the structural demand improvements."

It's the housing side, it's the home improvement side. And the one thing which I really want to emphasize is which sometimes outside observers get wrong, is everybody thinks about post COVID, everything will go back to where it used to be. It won't. First of all COVID will be around longer than we want it to be. Second of all, a consumer who has been more than 1 year essentially at home will not change behavior overnight. It's not -- consumer mind is not a flash memory which you just erase. That behavioral trend is not going to go away. And also in the context of how people talk about future work, you should assume that going forward, the average consumer spends more time at home than before. It's just going to be that way. 
What it leads to is a fundamental reorientation of the consumer towards the house, the purpose of the house, how I live in the house and how much money I invest in the house. And frankly, some people refer to it as more for the housing play. I wouldn't even say it's a housing -- we're a home play. I don't care -- well, I do care, but if you improve your home, it will benefit us. If you upgrade the kitchen, it will benefit us. If you build a new house, it benefits us. So there's multiple trends, which are all ultimately coming from consumer reorientation to the home, which will really play in our favor."

But what we always have said is, one, we at least intend to buy back any dilution that comes through any of our executive compensation programs or other things. So that's kind of the minimum that we look at. Again, when we say a moderate amount, we're also going to keep an eye on what the situation is around us and globally, and we feel very confident as we've talked about our balance sheet is in a very strong position. But also we want to be cautious throughout the year. Just with any of the unknowns that could come. So I think you should think about it being, as I said, at a minimum on that lower level that at least eliminates any dilution that could occur."

We also had Mexico, very strong business in the other part was very impressive. The way I read it is this is a demonstration of what this region can deliver. Now there are, of course, crazy swings coming from currency, and you all have seen what the Brazilian real does and Mexican peso has now strengthened the region a little bit. So I would say that performance is even more impressive for knowing how much currency losses we had in particular in Brazil. 
So the way I would look at it going forward, that region is absolutely reached from a structural perspective, which is able to deliver 8% to 10%. And right now, we guided 7% plus. And we're pretty confident. And I would also emphasize, we're confident on. Plus our Latin America business is a very well-run business, operating very strong. We have exceptionally strong brands. 
The demand trends in that probably has been really positive surprise, held up pretty strong in Latin America, and I would even argue last year was the least impacted from the demand trends of all regions, which is largely a result of the COVID stimulus in their respective countries. 
But we see that continuing. The demand holds up strong. Of course, we're observing currency fluctuations, we're observing the raw material increases, which weren't particularly impactful in Latin America. But again, coming from the second half of last year, we're very encouraged by what our Latin America business can deliver."

Obviously, with a lot of this, what you would focus on mix and perhaps structural changes due to accelerated cycle uses. Could you just expand on your North America margin guidance of 15% in the context of lower seasonality and sequentiality as opposed to year-over-year. I guess what I'm looking at is I just did the average margin swing in North America in '18 and '19, so the quarters versus the average, and it was only about 50 basis points, which kind of surprised me, but not really considering how you guys are executing better. Is that a reasonable way to think about margin volatility in '21? Is that going to kind of be off the average by maybe that much each quarter given your comments around seasonality lacking."

And I think the best way to think about it is that our North America margins will be relatively similar to our overall seasonality of the business that we've talked about because just think of the percentage that they are of our overall business and our overall profits. So that's obviously one of the bigger drivers there. 
Two is as we've talked about, as we look towards the year, we do believe in terms of volume and demand, the front half of the year being strong as we work through some of the backlog that will help normalize our business on a full year basis and especially within North America. 
Additionally, as we've said, we had more of the cost savings there within probably starting in the second quarter through the fourth quarter. So the dispersion of additional cost savings isn't as big in North America as it might be in the rest of the globe. So I think, yes, thinking about it that way is probably correct."

I know you guys have been really focused on delivering positive EBIT. But was there -- it seems like you must have gained a lot of share. So perhaps because it's a country-by-country event and you guys really lost a lot of floor space, usually, it took you a while to get back in. I know you had success at IKEA, but what really happened? I mean, did you guys just have better throughput, so people accepted your product perhaps ahead of your expectations in terms of share gains?

As you also know, there is no European market. There's a lot of countries. And I'm particularly pleased that in several of our key countries, such as U.K., Italy, France and now also lately, Russia, we expanded our share position which I think ultimately is a result of we have strong products, strong placement and very good execution. So I think it's a combination of all of that. 
But I also want to be very clear, we're not yet back to the level where I would expect us to be from a share perspective. I think we're still quite a bit of room to grow. You also know strategically, our particular focus is on the kitchen business, where naturally it takes a little bit longer to gain back the share, and that remains our focus. So I would say I would read the share gains, yes, we're proud, promising sign, but we're not done. 
So with that in mind, and also given that we're coming almost back to the top of the hour, so this was the last question. And so before you all check out and hang up and get on your keyboards, let me just pass on 1 important last message though, so just stay with me in another 1 or 2 minutes. 
When I reflect on your questions, a lot of them were what happens next quarter, 2 quarters down the road, supply chain seasonality. So they were short term and maybe rightfully, and that's what you also obviously talk about. But I would also strongly encourage you, zoom out. And what I mean with that, look at the long term, look at the fundamentals. 
Last year has been the third year in a row where we delivered all-time record EPS. We just guided towards a fourth year in a row. Four years in a row doesn't make it a onetime wonder. We're not a COVID play. This is a structural improvement and a different company.  Can you just highlight what we promised several years ago: We are delivering towards our long-term shareholder targets. And I'm very pleased a long way. You guys had some questions. We are delivering. We are guiding $19 to $20. So if you -- beyond, of course, the short-term challenges, I think you should also give us some credit that we demonstrated sustainability to deal with whatever is thrown at us. This is -- it's 3 years in a row, now 4 years in a row. That is an exceptionally strong, long-term fundamental trend. And I think it is fair to say that the work today is a very different company than it was 10 years 
ago. So with that in mind, thanks for listening to us, and have a wonderful day."

In difficult times like the ones we're living through today, it is important that we remain true to our guiding principles. Whirlpool's 110-year history is rooted in our value-driven commitment to our shareholders, employees, consumers and communities in which we operate.
In 2020, we faced unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, yet we remain firm in our commitment to all of our stakeholders. The health and well-being of our employees was and it remains our top priority. We increased safety measures at all manufacturing plants and provided additional resources to care for families and those who fell ill. We established business continuity plans to ensure our consumers have received our products to improve life at home with their families. And we continue to support our global communities by procuring medical supplies, making donations and engineering critical equipment for frontline workers.
In parallel, we made significant advancements to onboard our sustainability targets, resulting in ratings improvements and external recognition. Most notably, we received a low risk rating from Sustainalytics, a year-over-year improvement driven by our outstanding energy and wealth efficiency programs and our strong global product safety systems. And we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of our long-standing sustainable business practices. 2020 marked our 14th time on the list in the last 15 years.
I'm very proud of the way our employees have managed through this pandemic. It is ultimately the agility of our organization and the resilience of our employees that allowed us to deliver record results in 2020.
Now turning to our fourth quarter 2020 highlights on Slide 4. We delivered strong organic net sales growth of over 10%, driven by solid industry demand across the globe. Additionally, we delivered ongoing EBIT margin of over 11%, a second consecutive quarter of double-digit margins and a year-over-year expansion of 410 basis points. Lastly, we successfully executed our go-to-market initiative and drove strong cost takeout across the globe, leading to positive EBIT and EBIT margin expansion in all regions.
Now turning to Slide 5, we will discuss our full year highlights. We took immediate and decisive action as we announced and executed our $500 million-plus cost takeout program. Further, we realigned our go-to-market strategy to effectively operate within a supply-constrained environment. And structural and sustained positive demand trends and exceptional execution of our COVID-19 response strategy resulted in record ongoing earnings per share of $18.55, a 16% improvement compared to the prior year above our previous guidance.
Record ongoing EBIT margin of 9.1%, a 220 basis point improvement and a 25% increase in total EBIT compared to the prior year. And record free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion with positive free cash flow in North America, Latin America and Europe.
Despite significant macroeconomic uncertainty, we strengthened our balance sheet and drove significant shareholder value. We reduced our gross debt leverage to 2.3x, making progress towards our long-term target of 2x. We delivered a return on invested capital of approximately 11%, representing the fourth consecutive year of improvement as we realize the benefits of continued EBIT margin expansion at an optimized asset base in our Europe region. Lastly, we returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and increased our dividends for eighth consecutive year.
Overall, the results we delivered in 2020 reflect the structural improvements we have made not just in 2020, but also in those made during the years before. We are a fundamentally different company with an improved margin and cash flow profile. 2020 could have been a setback for us, instead we were able to significantly accelerate our progress towards our long-term financial goals.
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, price/mix delivered 375 basis points of margin expansion driven by reduced promotional investments and mix benefits as consumers invest in their homes. Additionally, we delivered on our cost takeout program positively impacting margins by 125 basis points. 
Further, reduced steel and resin costs resulted in a favorable impact of 125 basis points. These margin benefits were partially offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency. For the full year, very strong margin expansion from price/mix, and our cost takeout program were partially offset by increased brand investments and currency.
Overall, we're very pleased to be delivering on our long-term EBIT margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive very strong results in '21.
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our fourth quarter regional results. In North America, we delivered 4% revenue growth, driven by continued strong demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered record EBIT driven by the flawless execution of our cost takeout and go-to-market actions. Lastly, we continue to optimize our supply chain operations, driving weekly improvements in our production yield. Delivering top line growth and a record EBIT performance, the region's outstanding results again demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business model.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Share growth in Italy and the U.K., along with strong demand in the region, drove another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $29 million led by increased demand and strong cost takeout. We overcame the challenges presented by COVID-19 and restored profitability to the region in line with our commitment at the start of the year. Our 2020 results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategic actions and the progress we have made to date.
Turning to Slide 10, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 5% with organic net sales growth of 28%, led by strong demand in Brazil. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 12% with continued strong demand and disciplined execution of go-to-market actions, offsetting significant currency devaluation. Overall, the region's 2020 performance serves as a proof point of the viability of our long-term financial goals, highlighting our ability to deliver double-digit margins in a strong demand environment.
Turning to Slide 11, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Asia region. In India, we delivered strong year-over-year net sales growth driven by demand recovery. In China, we delivered Whirlpool branded share growth in addition to EBIT improvement led by cost productivity actions. Overall, we are pleased to see a rebound in Asia and look forward to building on this momentum in 2021.
Turning to Slide 13, Marc and I will discuss our full year 2021 guidance. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

Well, needless to say some uncertainty remains as we continue to operate in a COVID environment. However, we do believe increased disposable income, investments in the home and a favorable housing shift are here to stay and will drive strong demand.
Based on our internal model for industry and broad economy, we expect global industry growth of 4%. As we have demonstrated in 2020, we are uniquely positioned to capture restructural shifts and further advance our strategic priorities.
It is with confidence that we provide our '21 guidance, which reflects our fourth consecutive year of record earnings per share and significant top line growth. We expect to drive net sales growth of approximately 6%, as we capitalize strong demand and share gains in all regions. Additionally, we expect to deliver above 9% ongoing EBIT margin and deliver free cash flow of $1 billion or more.
Turning to Slide 14, we show the drivers of our 9% plus ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect price/mix to deliver approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion through 3 key initiatives: One, disciplined execution of our go-to-market actions; two, recently announced cost-based price increase in Brazil, Russia and India; and three, new product launches, just to give you a few examples of our legacy of innovation. 
In 2020, we rolled out our new global dishwasher architecture, featuring the largest capacity third rack dishwasher. In Europe, we launched a Red Dot award-winning built-in induction cooktop. In the United States, we entered the consumables detergent business with the launch of our ultra-concentrated wash detergent.
Next, we expect net cost to positively impact margin by 150 basis points as ongoing cost productivity efforts, coupled with a carryover benefit from our 2020 cost takeout program, more than offset elevated freight and labor costs. We expect raw material inflation to negatively impact margin by 150 basis points, led by higher steel and resin cost. 
Further, as we continue to invest in the future, we expect increased marketing and technology investments to drive a negative margin impact of 50 basis points while unfavorable currency, primarily Latin America, expected to impact margins by approximately 50 basis points. In total, we expect these actions to deliver 9% plus ongoing EBIT margin, an EBIT improvement of over $1 million compared to the prior year.
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items."

Turning to Slide 15, we show our regional guidance for the year. Starting with industry demand, we expect a robust demand environment for North America, supported by continued strength from consumer nesting trends and increased discretionary spending. Additionally, the impact from positive U.S. housing starts, which began to strengthen in late 2019 and strong existing home sales, will translate to higher appliance demand.
In EMEA, we expect a continued recovery in the first half of the year to support strong growth. While in Latin America, we expect modest growth of 2% to 4% as the benefits from government stimulus in Brazil are lessened.
Asia industry is expected to accelerate by 6% to 8% as the region rebounds from prolonged shutdowns in 2020.
Regarding our EBIT guidance, we expect very strong margins of 15% or more in North America. We expect the impact of favorable go-to-market initiatives and disciplined cost actions to offset cost inflation. In EMEA, we expect the strategic actions laid out during our 2019 Investor Day to drive EBIT margin expansion of over 250 basis points and a full year EBIT margin of over 2.5%.
In Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of 7% or higher as steady demand improvements and positive price/mix are offset by continued currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil.
Lastly, we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 2% or higher in Asia driven by demand recovery.
Turning to Slide 16, we will discuss the drivers of our 2021 free cash flow. We expect another year of very strong cash earnings of approximately $2 billion, driven by sustained EBIT margins. We plan to increase capital investments to historical levels to support the launch of innovative products around the globe. Additionally, we will continue to invest in world-class manufacturing and our digital transformation journey. Further, as we ended 2020 with record-low inventory levels, we are planning for a moderate inventory build. We anticipate restructuring cash outlays of approximately $225 million, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19-related restructuring actions executed in 2020 and the exit of our Naples, Italy operations. Overall, we expect to drive free cash flow of $1 billion or more as we focus on continuing to deliver record EBIT margin levels and prioritizing our capital investments.
Turning to Slide 17, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. We remain fully committed to funding the business, driving innovation and growth while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. We expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future. We have reinstated our share repurchase program that had been temporarily suspended during the height of the pandemic. With a clear focus on returning increased levels of cash to shareholders, we expect to repurchase shares at moderate levels.

Let me just recap what you've heard over the past few minutes. We are extremely pleased to see that despite the enormous challenges of operating in a global dynamic, our teams were able to deliver on our long-term value creation targets. 
In North America, we delivered nearly 16% EBIT margins for the full year, significantly above our long-term margin goal for the region of 13% plus. We restored the European region to profitability. In Latin America, we capitalized on strong industry demand, demonstrating the long-term margin potential in the region. And finally, we delivered record free cash flow of $1.25 billion or 6.4% of sales, above our long-term goal of 6% of sales.
Further, we demonstrated an unwavering commitment to our environmental, social and governance priorities, resulting in significant advancements to our targets.
Building on the momentum of our 2020 performance and the operational excellence of our global team, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver another record year in '21.
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

First of all, stepping back in North America Q4 -- not just Q4, we're needless to say exceptionally pleased with the overall financial performance in North America and the margins, which we achieved in l",300,"First of all, David, good morning and thanks a lot. First of all, stepping back in North America Q4 -- not just Q4, we're needless to say exceptionally pleased with the overall financial performance in North America and the margins, which we achieved in light of a pandemic, which is still pretty severe. 
Now specifically to the volumes and the supply chain, I would say our overall volume directionally are in the line in the scope of what you talked about, which also means we're kind of on a sequential base Q3 versus Q4. We directionally kept market share. But year-over-year, we're down. So it's the same down, which we had also in Q3 and Q4, which is ultimately related to the supply chain constraints, which we have.
Now our supply chain constraints, and we talked about it in the prior earnings call, there are fundamentally pandemic-driven, i.e., you have absenteeism in factories; you have labor shortage; you have component shortages, which have been significant; and we have transportation bottlenecks. So yes, of course, we're improving month by month, but it's also against the demand, which is rising month by month. So we're kind of -- we're still having a fairly significant backorder situation slightly better than at the end of Q3, but only slightly. 
And from everything which we see right now, that's where we -- in our prepared remarks, probably by the end of Q2, a little bit depending on the progress of the pandemic, which should be out of the constraints. But it will be around us pretty much as long as COVID is around us. It also would be crystal clear. It impacts pretty much everyone producing in the Americas, producing in Europe. It is less, almost no impact if you produce in China or Asia."

And again, we continue to implement and drive actions related to that. So we'll also have some additional actions that rolled out in Q4 that will continue to get a benefit for this year.
The second thing is if you look across our broader production base and as we get more efficient in understanding how to deal with some of the COVID inefficiencies that have come around, that will be a help for us. Incrementally, we expect volume to be -- as we've talked about, volume to be higher this year, so that will help to drive additional cost savings. 
And then on top of that, within any given year, we typically look to drive a certain amount of reduction in what we call infrastructure and SG&A spend. And so that's probably another big portion of what comes out there. But where we start the year in terms of the cost takeout programs we've already initiated versus what we've got in the pipeline, we feel very good about that number.
Additionally, as we've talked about, from a manufacturing footprint, we ceased production in our Naples facility in Italy during Q4. And so we'll start to see the benefits of that also rolling in this year from a cost perspective."

David, The comment I would want to add is, first of all, also coming back to last year, as you know, in -- last year, we significantly dialed up our cost takeouts. We started the year with a certain assumption, which we also gave you in the earnings call. And then we -- once the pandemic hit us, we massively ramped it up to $500 million net cost takeout, and we did. So I would say, we have a -- I know you see it, we have a track record of being able to deal with costs.
Now of course, we do know raw material is a headwind this year, and we showed earlier it's $250 million to $300 million. But I think we have other tools to overcome some of these headwinds. And there's carryover versus additional measures, which we're taking. And as you also know, it's not the first raw material headwind we're dealing with and we have dealt with very successfully in the past.
The other thing also in raw material, because I see in some writing, not in your writing out there, people are always referring to spot prices, et cetera. Keep in mind, we are either having long-term contracts or hedge on certain positions. So I would say we're less exposed to volatility you see in spot markets than most other players, and that's a good thing. And I think that also gives us probably a higher level of confidence that's pretty much the range, which we're talking about."

So Eric, on the demand trends, first of all, we got to recognize in 2020, yes, you've all seen the North America industry volume was a positive. I think what most people lose sight of is the quality of demand has changed in a positive way. We saw -- in particular in Q2 and beginning of Q3, you saw a lot of duress or COVID-related stress purchases, freezers, the microwaves, et cetera. But that has gradually shifted more and more into the more higher mix, i.e., remodeled kitchen upgrades or rebuilding our entire home construction.
So beyond the numbers of a volume, we're really pleased with the mix, which comes with the increased volume. But it also means we do not see the demand as well with the COVID spike. Yes, there was a little bit of a COVID spike. This is structurally and sustained healthy demands, which is, yes, coming to extremely strong housing trends, but it's more than housing. It's the entire home improvement, and we do not see that fundamentally changing anytime soon. That's probably on -- of all the global regions, I would say North America, may be the region where we're most bullish about. From a structural demand trend, it's very healthy, and we just do not see that slowing down. 
So I know the number, which we've guided to, but it could even be -- it might be even stronger. So we're very confident about the structural sustained demand trends. I think we're -- particularly, as we get our supply chain constraints resolved, I think we're confident we can capitalize on these demand trends. So -- and that's on the demand.

We're beginning, as Marc talked about earlier, starting to see improvements here early in the year in terms of our ability to start to catch up on some of that backlog. As we've talked about, by the middle of the year is when we expect to begin to have worked through that, assuming that nothing in the environment changes around us because most of these, as we've said, supply chain issues are COVID-driven. So that would put us in a place where we've really caught up only -- not only on the demand, but on the need for higher retail inventory levels.
And then as you get into the back half of the year, you'll begin to see us build our inventory level slightly as we return to what would be a normalized environment. And we talked about during 2020, how our inventory levels came down during this time period. So I think that's kind of the path we see throughout the year, but by about mid-year normalizing from a trade inventory level. And then in the third to fourth quarter, normalizing our inventories."

So there's no promotional pressure on the backorder resolving that. That on its own is a fairly sizable portion.
Now on the promotions going forward, as you know, we're not commenting on our go-forward pricing strategy. The only thing which I want to hint to and repeat is our promotion strategy has not changed, no matter what. We participate, then we can create value for us, the trade customer or the consumer, but we make a case-by-case decision.

I mean, Marc, you talked about obviously not having to promote your backlog, and by all accounts, it appears that the demand trends that have allowed for that reduced promotional backdrop seems like will continue into the first half. And if that's correct, I mean, should we be thinking about more of a flat to down price/mix dynamic in the back half? 
Related to this is, I heard that -- if I heard right, you talked about price increases in Russia, Brazil, India, but not the U.S., despite obviously having significant raw material inflation.

And to begin with, as we look at -- we're very happy with the performance that we saw in the back half of the year within EMEA and the margin improvement that we made. Now we have to remember that EMEA typically does have -- their first quarter is their lowest quarter of the year. So we do expect to continue to be profitable. But obviously, when you look at a quarter -- sequential quarter-over-quarter, we wouldn't expect to see continued margin growth within Q1.
For the full year, we do expect the margin growth to -- obviously to materialize to 2.5%. And a big part of what drives that is, one, you've got cost takeout actions that took place. And many of those were not implemented until the back half of the year within EMEA. Two, as I've talked about, with the share gains that we've seen and the continued improvement in volumes there and demand there, we do feel very positive on that. So both of those set us up coming out of 2021 on what I would say is a good trajectory that we feel will put us on track to our longer-term margin goals there.
Now the bigger drivers of that will continue to be cost takeout. In addition to -- with the market share gains that we're seeing right now and some of the new product introductions we're doing, we do expect to grow volumes there, and we've talked about that over the next few years.

As a reminder, the pandemic from a consumer sellout hit Europe harder than it did Latin America or North America. So Q2, as you all remember, was pretty devastating from demand and also what it meant. So I'm very pleased that with that huge spend in Q2, we were able to achieve on a full year base of profit in Europe, which mid-year was a very difficult target to even think about. But we achieved the full year profit. 
Now we all know achieving a profit is not a heroic achievement, but it's an important milestone. And what it basically tells me with the second half performance is we're back on track with a trajectory, which we laid out in front of you, which said we want to get Europe very quickly to 2% to 4% and when while we work on the long-term strategic levers get it on track versus 7% or 8% operating margin target, which we talk about. And today, I would say the second half performance -- I'm not reading too much between Q3 and Q4, the second half performance gives us all the confidence we're back on this trajectory."

Without getting into details of our percentages, I think let me maybe more make the qualitative comments, which also adds to why we're confident, in particular North America, on the long-term demand trends. As you know, on the replacement side, we were running against the trough of the industry in 2008 to 2010. We're now pretty much coming out of this trough. 
Keep also in mind when people typically take this reference to 8 to 10 years appliance, that's when you replace. Last year was a year of extreme intense use at home, which probably accelerated that replacement of -- the need for replacement. So I would say on a fundamental replacement, we're now coming -- I think, soon, the trough will be behind us. So that will give strength. 
On top of that, we saw last year -- throughout the year, I talked about significantly higher discretionary demand. First, coming from really the duress and stress to really structure improvement. And I think on top of that, the housing side will come stronger and stronger and stronger. The housing side, the only thing where you probably don't see extreme numbers in short term is its housing supply constraints, okay? But you saw housing starts 1.7 million or 1.667 million, December. That is a promising sign, and it's been the highest in a long time. Still far away from where we believe it should be. It should be around 2 million housing starts. So that is not yet fully in the numbers. But again, that's -- these are all the data points, which give us the high degree of confidence in the structural demand improvements."

Now first of all, in macro scheme, of course, there's uncertainty. There's uncertainty every year around what happens in raw material, currency, et cetera. But I think this year, and that's different from the last few years, we have a high degree of confidence in structural demand trends, and that's just real, okay? It's the housing side. It's the home improvement side. And the one thing which I really want to emphasize is, which sometimes outside observers get wrong, is everybody thinks about post-COVID, everything will go back to where it used to be. It won't. 
First of all, COVID will be around longer than we want it to be. Second of all, a consumer who has been more than 1 year essentially at home will not change behavior overnight. It's not -- consumer mind is not a flash memory, which you just erase. That behavioral trend is not going to go away. And also in the context of how people talk about future work, you should assume that, going forward, the average consumer spends more time at home than before. It's just going to be that way. 
What it leads to is a fundamental reorientation of the consumer towards the house, the purpose of the house, how I live in the house and how much money I invest in the house. And frankly, some people refer to it as more for the housing play. I wouldn't even say it's a housing, we're a home play. I don't care -- well, I do care, but if you improve your home, it will benefit us. If you upgrade the kitchen, it will benefit us. If you build a new house, it benefits us. So there's multiple trends, which are all ultimately coming from a consumer reorientation to the home, which will really play in our favor."

Now there are, of course, crazy swings coming from currency, and you all have seen what the Brazilian real does and Mexican peso has now strengthened recently a little bit. So I would say that performance is even more impressive for knowing how much currency losses we had in particular in Brazil.
So the way I would look at it going forward, that region is absolutely reached from a structural perspective, which is able to deliver 8% to 10%. And right now, we guided 7% plus. And we're pretty confident. And I would also emphasize, we're confident on plus. Our Latin America business is a very well-run business, operating very strong. We have exceptionally strong brands.
The demand trends in that probably has been really positive surprise, held up pretty strong in Latin America. And I would even argue last year, it was the least impacted from the demand trends of all regions, which is largely a result of the COVID stimulus in their respective countries. So -- but we see that continuing. The demand holds up strong. Of course, we're observing currency fluctuations.

So that's obviously one of the bigger drivers there. 
Two is as we've talked about, as we look towards the year, we do believe in terms of volume and demand, the front half of the year being strong as we work through some of the backlog that will help normalize our business on a full year basis and especially within North America. 
Additionally, as we've said, we had more of the cost savings there within probably starting in the second quarter through the fourth quarter. So the dispersion of additional cost savings isn't as big in North America as it might be in the rest of the globe. So I think, yes, thinking about it that way is probably correct."

So I think it's a combination of all of that.
But I also want to be very clear, we're not yet back to the level where I would expect us to be from a share perspective. I think we're still quite a bit of room to grow. You also know, strategically, our particular focus is on the kitchen business where naturally it takes a little bit longer to gain back the share, and that remains our focus.

When I reflect on your questions, a lot of them were what happens next quarter, 2 quarters down the road, supply chain seasonality. So they were short term and maybe rightfully, and that's what you also obviously talk about. But I would also strongly encourage you, zoom out.

We just guided towards a fourth year in a row. Four years in a row doesn't make it a onetime wonder. We're not a COVID play. This is a structural improvement and a different company. 
Can you just highlight what were promised several years ago? We are delivering towards our long-term shareholder targets, and I'm very pleased. Along the way, you guys had some questions. We are delivering. We are guiding $19 to $20. So if you -- beyond, of course, the short-term challenges, I think you should also give us some credit that we demonstrated sustainability to deal with whatever is thrown at us. This is -- it's 3 years in a row, now 4 years in a row. That is an exceptionally strong, long-term fundamental trend. And I think it is fair to say that the Whirlpool today is a very different company than it was 10 years ago.
So with that in mind, thanks for listening to us, and have a wonderful day."

In difficult times like the ones we're living through today, it is important that we remain true to our guiding principles. Whirlpool's 110-year history is rooted in our value-driven commitment to our shareholders, employees, consumers and communities in which we operate.
In 2020, we faced unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, yet we remain firm in our commitment to all of our stakeholders. The health and well-being of our employees was and it remains our top priority. We increased safety measures at all manufacturing plants and provided additional resources to care for families and those who fell ill. We established business continuity plans to ensure our consumers have received our products to improve life at home with their families. And we continue to support our global communities by procuring medical supplies, making donations and engineering critical equipment for frontline workers.
In parallel, we made significant advancements to onboard our sustainability targets, resulting in ratings improvements and external recognition. Most notably, we received a low risk rating from Sustainalytics, a year-over-year improvement driven by our outstanding energy and wealth efficiency programs and our strong global product safety systems. And we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of our long-standing sustainable business practices. 2020 marked our 14th time on the list in the last 15 years.
I'm very proud of the way our employees have managed through this pandemic. It is ultimately the agility of our organization and the resilience of our employees that allowed us to deliver record results in 2020.
Now turning to our fourth quarter 2020 highlights on Slide 4. We delivered strong organic net sales growth of over 10%, driven by solid industry demand across the globe. Additionally, we delivered ongoing EBIT margin of over 11%, a second consecutive quarter of double-digit margins and a year-over-year expansion of 410 basis points. Lastly, we successfully executed our go-to-market initiative and drove strong cost takeout across the globe, leading to positive EBIT and EBIT margin expansion in all regions.
Now turning to Slide 5, we will discuss our full year highlights. We took immediate and decisive action as we announced and executed our $500 million-plus cost takeout program. Further, we realigned our go-to-market strategy to effectively operate within a supply-constrained environment. And structural and sustained positive demand trends and exceptional execution of our COVID-19 response strategy resulted in record ongoing earnings per share of $18.55, a 16% improvement compared to the prior year above our previous guidance.
Record ongoing EBIT margin of 9.1%, a 220 basis point improvement and a 25% increase in total EBIT compared to the prior year. And record free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion with positive free cash flow in North America, Latin America and Europe.
Despite significant macroeconomic uncertainty, we strengthened our balance sheet and drove significant shareholder value. We reduced our gross debt leverage to 2.3x, making progress towards our long-term target of 2x. We delivered a return on invested capital of approximately 11%, representing the fourth consecutive year of improvement as we realize the benefits of continued EBIT margin expansion at an optimized asset base in our Europe region. Lastly, we returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and increased our dividends for eighth consecutive year.
Overall, the results we delivered in 2020 reflect the structural improvements we have made not just in 2020, but also in those made during the years before. We are a fundamentally different company with an improved margin and cash flow profile. 2020 could have been a setback for us, instead we were able to significantly accelerate our progress towards our long-term financial goals.
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, price/mix delivered 375 basis points of margin expansion driven by reduced promotional investments and mix benefits as consumers invest in their homes. Additionally, we delivered on our cost takeout program positively impacting margins by 125 basis points. 
Further, reduced steel and resin costs resulted in a favorable impact of 125 basis points. These margin benefits were partially offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency. For the full year, very strong margin expansion from price/mix, and our cost takeout program were partially offset by increased brand investments and currency.
Overall, we're very pleased to be delivering on our long-term EBIT margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive very strong results in '21.
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our fourth quarter regional results. In North America, we delivered 4% revenue growth, driven by continued strong demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered record EBIT driven by the flawless execution of our cost takeout and go-to-market actions. Lastly, we continue to optimize our supply chain operations, driving weekly improvements in our production yield. Delivering top line growth and a record EBIT performance, the region's outstanding results again demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business model.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Share growth in Italy and the U.K., along with strong demand in the region, drove another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $29 million led by increased demand and strong cost takeout. We overcame the challenges presented by COVID-19 and restored profitability to the region in line with our commitment at the start of the year. Our 2020 results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategic actions and the progress we have made to date.
Turning to Slide 10, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 5% with organic net sales growth of 28%, led by strong demand in Brazil. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 12% with continued strong demand and disciplined execution of go-to-market actions, offsetting significant currency devaluation. Overall, the region's 2020 performance serves as a proof point of the viability of our long-term financial goals, highlighting our ability to deliver double-digit margins in a strong demand environment.
Turning to Slide 11, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Asia region. In India, we delivered strong year-over-year net sales growth driven by demand recovery. In China, we delivered Whirlpool-branded share growth in addition to EBIT improvement led by cost productivity actions. Overall, we are pleased to see a rebound in Asia and look forward to building on this momentum in 2021.
Turning to Slide 13, Marc and I will discuss our full year 2021 guidance. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

Well, needless to say some uncertainty remains as we continue to operate in a COVID environment.

Well, needless to say some uncertainty remains as we continue to operate in a COVID environment. However, we do believe increased disposable income, investments in the home and a favorable housing shift are here to stay and will drive strong demand.
Based on our internal model for industry and broad economy, we expect global industry growth of 4%. As we have demonstrated in 2020, we are uniquely positioned to capture restructural shifts and further advance our strategic priorities.
It is with confidence that we provide our '21 guidance, which reflects our fourth consecutive year of record earnings per share and significant top line growth. We expect to drive net sales growth of approximately 6%, as we capitalize strong demand and share gains in all regions. Additionally, we expect to deliver above 9% ongoing EBIT margin and deliver free cash flow of $1 billion or more.
Turning to Slide 14, we show the drivers of our 9% plus ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect price/mix to deliver approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion through 3 key initiatives: One, disciplined execution of our go-to-market actions; two, recently announced cost-based price increase in Brazil, Russia and India; and three, new product launches, just to give you a few examples of our legacy of innovation. 
In 2020, we rolled out our new global dishwasher architecture, featuring the largest capacity third rack dishwasher. In Europe, we launched a Red Dot award-winning built-in induction cooktop. In the United States, we entered the consumables detergent business with the launch of our ultra-concentrated wash detergent.
Next, we expect net cost to positively impact margin by 150 basis points as ongoing cost productivity efforts, coupled with a carryover benefit from our 2020 cost takeout program, more than offset elevated freight and labor costs. We expect raw material inflation to negatively impact margin by 150 basis points, led by higher steel and resin cost. 
Further, as we continue to invest in the future, we expect increased marketing and technology investments to drive a negative margin impact of 50 basis points while unfavorable currency, primarily Latin America, expected to impact margins by approximately 50 basis points. In total, we expect these actions to deliver 9% plus ongoing EBIT margin, an EBIT improvement of over $1 million compared to the prior year.
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items."

Turning to Slide 15, we show our regional guidance for the year. Starting with industry demand, we expect a robust demand environment for North America, supported by continued strength from consumer nesting trends and increased discretionary spending. Additionally, the impact from positive U.S. housing starts, which began to strengthen in late 2019 and strong existing home sales, will translate to higher appliance demand.
In EMEA, we expect a continued recovery in the first half of the year to support strong growth. While in Latin America, we expect modest growth of 2% to 4% as the benefits from government stimulus in Brazil are lessened.
Asia industry is expected to accelerate by 6% to 8% as the region rebounds from prolonged shutdowns in 2020.
Regarding our EBIT guidance, we expect very strong margins of 15% or more in North America. We expect the impact of favorable go-to-market initiatives and disciplined cost actions to offset cost inflation. In EMEA, we expect the strategic actions laid out during our 2019 Investor Day to drive EBIT margin expansion of over 250 basis points and a full year EBIT margin of over 2.5%.
In Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of 7% or higher as steady demand improvements and positive price/mix are offset by continued currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil.
Lastly, we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 2% or higher in Asia driven by demand recovery.
Turning to Slide 16, we will discuss the drivers of our 2021 free cash flow. We expect another year of very strong cash earnings of approximately $2 billion, driven by sustained EBIT margins. We plan to increase capital investments to historical levels to support the launch of innovative products around the globe. Additionally, we will continue to invest in world-class manufacturing and our digital transformation journey. Further, as we ended 2020 with record-low inventory levels, we are planning for a moderate inventory build. We anticipate restructuring cash outlays of approximately $225 million, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19-related restructuring actions executed in 2020 and the exit of our Naples, Italy operations. Overall, we expect to drive free cash flow of $1 billion or more as we focus on continuing to deliver record EBIT margin levels and prioritizing our capital investments.
Turning to Slide 17, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. We remain fully committed to funding the business, driving innovation and growth while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. We expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future. We have reinstated our share repurchase program that had been temporarily suspended during the height of the pandemic. With a clear focus on returning increased levels of cash to shareholders, we expect to repurchase shares at moderate levels. 
Lastly, we have a clear line of sight to delivering on our long-term goal of gross debt-to-EBITDA of 2x.

Let me just recap what you've heard over the past few minutes. We are extremely pleased to see that despite the enormous challenges of operating in a global dynamic, our teams were able to deliver on our long-term value creation targets. 
In North America, we delivered nearly 16% EBIT margins for the full year, significantly above our long-term margin goal for the region of 13% plus. We restored the European region to profitability. In Latin America, we capitalized on strong industry demand, demonstrating the long-term margin potential in the region. And finally, we delivered record free cash flow of $1.25 billion or 6.4% of sales, above our long-term goal of 6% of sales.
Further, we demonstrated an unwavering commitment to our environmental, social and governance priorities, resulting in significant advancements to our targets.

First of all, stepping back in North America Q4 -- not just Q4, we're needless to say exceptionally pleased with the overall financial performance in North America and the margins, which we achieved in light of a pandemic, which is still pretty severe. 
Now specifically to the volumes and the supply chain, I would say our overall volume directionally are in the line, in the scope of what you talked about, which also means we're kind of on a sequential base Q3 versus Q4. We directionally kept market share. But year-over-year, we're down. So it's the same down, which we had also in Q3 and Q4, which is ultimately related to the supply chain constraints, which we have.
Now our supply chain constraints, and we talked about it in the prior earnings call, there are fundamentally pandemic-driven, i.e., you have absenteeism in factories; you have labor shortage; you have component shortages, which have been significant; and we have transportation bottlenecks. So yes, of course, we're improving month by month, but it's also against the demand, which is rising month by month. So we're kind of -- we're still having a fairly significant backorder situation slightly better than at the end of Q3, but only slightly. 
And from everything which we see right now, that's where we -- in our prepared remarks, probably by the end of Q2, a little bit depending on the progress of the pandemic, which should be out of the constraints. But it will be around us pretty much as long as COVID is around us. It also would be crystal clear. It impacts pretty much everyone producing in the Americas, producing in Europe. It is less, almost no impact if you produce in China or Asia."

And again, we continue to implement and drive actions related to that. So we'll also have some additional actions that rolled out in Q4 that will continue to get a benefit for this year.
The second thing is if you look across our broader production base and as we get more efficient in understanding how to deal with some of the COVID inefficiencies that have come around, that will be a help for us. Incrementally, we expect volume to be -- as we've talked about, volume to be higher this year, so that will help to drive additional cost savings. 
And then on top of that, within any given year, we typically look to drive a certain amount of reduction in what we call infrastructure and SG&A spend. And so that's probably another big portion of what comes out there. But where we start the year in terms of the cost takeout programs we've already initiated versus what we've got in the pipeline, we feel very good about that number.
Additionally, as we've talked about, from a manufacturing footprint, we ceased production in our Naples facility in Italy during Q4. And so we'll start to see the benefits of that also rolling in this year from a cost perspective."

We started the year with a certain assumption, which we also gave you in the earnings call. And then we -- once the pandemic hit us, we massively ramped it up to $500 million net cost takeout, and we did. So I would say, we have a -- I know you see it, we have a track record of being able to deal with costs.
Now of course, we do know raw material is a headwind this year, and we showed earlier it's $250 million to $300 million. But I think we have other tools to overcome some of these headwinds. And there's carryover versus additional measures, which we're taking. And as you also know, it's not the first raw material headwind we're dealing with and we have dealt with very successfully in the past.
The other thing also in raw material, because I see in some writing, not in your writing out there, people are always referring to spot prices, et cetera. Keep in mind, we are either having long-term contracts or hedge on certain positions. So I would say we're less exposed to volatility you see in spot markets than most other players, and that's a good thing.

It's the entire home improvement, and we do not see that fundamentally changing anytime soon. That's probably on -- of all the global regions, I would say North America, may be the region where we're most bullish about. From a structural demand trend, it's very healthy, and we just do not see that slowing down. 
So I know the number, which we've guided to, but it could even be -- it might be even stronger. So we're very confident about the structural sustained demand trends. I think we're -- particularly, as we get our supply chain constraints resolved, I think we're confident we can capitalize on these demand trends. So -- and that's on the demand. Jim, do you want to cover the supply chain?"

I'd say, Eric, from a supply chain perspective, as we talked about earlier is, one, we've seen our supply chain now being able to at least keep up with the existing levels of demand. We're beginning, as Marc talked about earlier, starting to see improvements here early in the year in terms of our ability to start to catch up on some of that backlog. As we've talked about, by the middle of the year is when we expect to begin to have worked through that, assuming that nothing in the environment changes around us because most of these, as we've said, supply chain issues are COVID-driven. So that would put us in a place where we've really caught up only -- not only on the demand, but on the need for higher retail inventory levels.
And then as you get into the back half of the year, you'll begin to see us build our inventory level slightly as we return to what would be a normalized environment. And we talked about during 2020, how our inventory levels came down during this time period. So I think that's kind of the path we see throughout the year, but by about mid-year normalizing from a trade inventory level. And then in the third to fourth quarter, normalizing our inventories."

Now on the promotions going forward, as you know, we're not commenting on our go-forward pricing strategy. The only thing which I want to hint to and repeat is our promotion strategy has not changed, no matter what. We participate, then we can create value for us, the trade customer or the consumer, but we make a case-by-case decision.

I mean, Marc, you talked about obviously not having to promote your backlog, and by all accounts, it appears that the demand trends that have allowed for that reduced promotional backdrop seems like will continue into the first half. And if that's correct, I mean, should we be thinking about more of a flat to down price/mix dynamic in the back half? 
Related to this is, I heard that -- if I heard right, you talked about price increases in Russia, Brazil, India, but not the U.S., despite obviously having significant raw material inflation. And I was just wondering if the -- in lieu of those, normally what we'd expect would be some price increases to offset raw materials.

And to begin with, as we look at -- we're very happy with the performance that we saw in the back half of the year within EMEA and the margin improvement that we made. Now we have to remember that EMEA typically does have -- their first quarter is their lowest quarter of the year. So we do expect to continue to be profitable. But obviously, when you look at a quarter -- sequential quarter-over-quarter, we wouldn't expect to see continued margin growth within Q1.
For the full year, we do expect the margin growth to -- obviously to materialize to 2.5%. And a big part of what drives that is, one, you've got cost takeout actions that took place. And many of those were not implemented until the back half of the year within EMEA. Two, as I've talked about, with the share gains that we've seen and the continued improvement in volumes there and demand there, we do feel very positive on that. So both of those set us up coming out of 2021 on what I would say is a good trajectory that we feel will put us on track to our longer-term margin goals there.
Now the bigger drivers of that will continue to be cost takeout. In addition to -- with the market share gains that we're seeing right now and some of the new product introductions we're doing, we do expect to grow volumes there, and we've talked about that over the next few years. That's one of the key drivers to get those margins to a healthier longer-term level."

As a reminder, the pandemic from a consumer sellout hit Europe harder than it did Latin America or North America. So Q2, as you all remember, was pretty devastating from demand and also what it meant. So I'm very pleased that with that huge spend in Q2, we were able to achieve on a full year base of profit in Europe, which mid-year was a very difficult target to even think about. But we achieved the full year profit. 
Now we all know achieving a profit is not a heroic achievement, but it's an important milestone. And what it basically tells me with the second half performance is we're back on track with a trajectory, which we laid out in front of you, which said we want to get Europe very quickly to 2% to 4% and when while we work on the long-term strategic levers get it on track versus 7% or 8% operating margin target, which we talk about.

Without getting into details of our percentages, I think let me maybe more make the qualitative comments, which also adds to why we're confident, in particular North America, on the long-term demand trends. As you know, on the replacement side, we were running against the trough of the industry in 2008 to 2010. We're now pretty much coming out of this trough. 
Keep also in mind when people typically take this reference to 8 to 10 years appliance, that's when you replace. Last year was a year of extreme intense use at home, which probably accelerated that replacement of -- the need for replacement. So I would say on a fundamental replacement, we're now coming -- I think, soon, the trough will be behind us. So that will give strength. 
On top of that, we saw last year -- throughout the year, I talked about significantly higher discretionary demand. First, coming from really the duress and stress to really structure improvement. And I think on top of that, the housing side will come stronger and stronger and stronger. The housing side, the only thing where you probably don't see extreme numbers in short term is its housing supply constraints, okay? But you saw housing starts 1.7 million or 1.667 million, December. That is a promising sign, and it's been the highest in a long time. Still far away from where we believe it should be. It should be around 2 million housing starts. So that is not yet fully in the numbers. But again, that's -- these are all the data points, which give us the high degree of confidence in the structural demand improvements."

It's the home improvement side. And the one thing which I really want to emphasize is, which sometimes outside observers get wrong, is everybody thinks about post-COVID, everything will go back to where it used to be. It won't. 
First of all, COVID will be around longer than we want it to be. Second of all, a consumer who has been more than 1 year essentially at home will not change behavior overnight. It's not -- consumer mind is not a flash memory, which you just erase. That behavioral trend is not going to go away. And also in the context of how people talk about future work, you should assume that, going forward, the average consumer spends more time at home than before. It's just going to be that way. 
What it leads to is a fundamental reorientation of the consumer towards the house, the purpose of the house, how I live in the house and how much money I invest in the house. And frankly, some people refer to it as more for the housing play. I wouldn't even say it's a housing, we're a home play. I don't care -- well, I do care, but if you improve your home, it will benefit us. If you upgrade the kitchen, it will benefit us. If you build a new house, it benefits us. So there's multiple trends, which are all ultimately coming from a consumer reorientation to the home, which will really play in our favor."

We also had Mexico, very strong business in the upper part. It was very impressive. The way I read it is this is a demonstration of what this region can deliver. Now there are, of course, crazy swings coming from currency, and you all have seen what the Brazilian real does and Mexican peso has now strengthened recently a little bit. So I would say that performance is even more impressive for knowing how much currency losses we had in particular in Brazil.
So the way I would look at it going forward, that region is absolutely reached from a structural perspective, which is able to deliver 8% to 10%. And right now, we guided 7% plus. And we're pretty confident. And I would also emphasize, we're confident on plus. Our Latin America business is a very well-run business, operating very strong. We have exceptionally strong brands.
The demand trends in that probably has been really positive surprise, held up pretty strong in Latin America. And I would even argue last year, it was the least impacted from the demand trends of all regions, which is largely a result of the COVID stimulus in their respective countries. So -- but we see that continuing. The demand holds up strong. Of course, we're observing currency fluctuations. We're observing the raw material increases, which were particularly impactful in Latin America. But again, coming from the second half of last year, we're very encouraged by what our Latin America business can deliver."

Obviously, with a lot of this, what you would focus on mix and perhaps structural changes due to accelerated cycle uses. Could you just expand on your North America margin guidance of 15% in the context of lower seasonality and sequentiality as opposed to year-over-year. I guess what I'm looking at is I just did the average margin swing in North America in '18 and '19, so the quarters versus the average, and it was only about 50 basis points, which kind of surprised me, but not really considering how you guys are executing better. Is that a reasonable way to think about margin volatility in '21? Is that going to kind of be off the average by maybe that much each quarter given your comments around seasonality lacking?"

And I think the best way to think about it is that our North America margins will be relatively similar to our overall seasonality of the business that we've talked about because just think of the percentage that they are of our overall business and our overall profits. So that's obviously one of the bigger drivers there. 
Two is as we've talked about, as we look towards the year, we do believe in terms of volume and demand, the front half of the year being strong as we work through some of the backlog that will help normalize our business on a full year basis and especially within North America. 
Additionally, as we've said, we had more of the cost savings there within probably starting in the second quarter through the fourth quarter. So the dispersion of additional cost savings isn't as big in North America as it might be in the rest of the globe. So I think, yes, thinking about it that way is probably correct."

As you also know, there is no European market. There's a lot of countries. And I'm particularly pleased that in several of our key countries, such as U.K., Italy, but also France, and now also lately, Russia, we expanded our share position, which I think ultimately is a result of we have strong products, strong placement and very good execution. So I think it's a combination of all of that.
But I also want to be very clear, we're not yet back to the level where I would expect us to be from a share perspective. I think we're still quite a bit of room to grow. You also know, strategically, our particular focus is on the kitchen business where naturally it takes a little bit longer to gain back the share, and that remains our focus. So I would say -- I would read the share gains, yes, we're proud, promising sign, but we're not done. 
So with that in mind, and also given that we're coming almost back to the top of the hour, so this was the last question. So before you all check out and hang up and get on your keyboards, let me just pass on one important last message though, just stay with me in another 1 or 2 minutes. 
When I reflect on your questions, a lot of them were what happens next quarter, 2 quarters down the road, supply chain seasonality. So they were short term and maybe rightfully, and that's what you also obviously talk about. But I would also strongly encourage you, zoom out. And what I mean with that, look at the long term, look at the fundamentals. Last year has been the third year in a row where we delivered all-time record EPS. We just guided towards a fourth year in a row. Four years in a row doesn't make it a onetime wonder. We're not a COVID play. This is a structural improvement and a different company. 
Can you just highlight what were promised several years ago? We are delivering towards our long-term shareholder targets, and I'm very pleased. Along the way, you guys had some questions. We are delivering. We are guiding $19 to $20. So if you -- beyond, of course, the short-term challenges, I think you should also give us some credit that we demonstrated sustainability to deal with whatever is thrown at us. This is -- it's 3 years in a row, now 4 years in a row. That is an exceptionally strong, long-term fundamental trend. And I think it is fair to say that the Whirlpool today is a very different company than it was 10 years ago.
So with that in mind, thanks for listening to us, and have a wonderful day."

In difficult times like the ones we're living through today, it is important that we remain true to our guiding principles. Whirlpool's 110-year history is rooted in our value-driven commitment to our shareholders, employees, consumers and communities in which we operate.
In 2020, we faced unprecedented challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, yet we remain firm in our commitment to all of our stakeholders. The health and well-being of our employees was and it remains our top priority. We increased safety measures at all manufacturing plants and provided additional resources to care for families and those who fell ill. We established business continuity plans to ensure our consumers have received our products to improve life at home with their families. And we continue to support our global communities by procuring medical supplies, making donations and engineering critical equipment for frontline workers.
In parallel, we made significant advancements to onboard our sustainability targets, resulting in ratings improvements and external recognition. Most notably, we received a low risk rating from Sustainalytics, a year-over-year improvement driven by our outstanding energy and wealth efficiency programs and our strong global product safety systems. And we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in recognition of our long-standing sustainable business practices. 2020 marked our 14th time on the list in the last 15 years.
I'm very proud of the way our employees have managed through this pandemic. It is ultimately the agility of our organization and the resilience of our employees that allowed us to deliver record results in 2020.
Now turning to our fourth quarter 2020 highlights on Slide 4. We delivered strong organic net sales growth of over 10%, driven by solid industry demand across the globe. Additionally, we delivered ongoing EBIT margin of over 11%, a second consecutive quarter of double-digit margins and a year-over-year expansion of 410 basis points. Lastly, we successfully executed our go-to-market initiative and drove strong cost takeout across the globe, leading to positive EBIT and EBIT margin expansion in all regions.
Now turning to Slide 5, we will discuss our full year highlights. We took immediate and decisive action as we announced and executed our $500 million-plus cost takeout program. Further, we realigned our go-to-market strategy to effectively operate within a supply-constrained environment. And structural and sustained positive demand trends and exceptional execution of our COVID-19 response strategy resulted in record ongoing earnings per share of $18.55, a 16% improvement compared to the prior year above our previous guidance.
Record ongoing EBIT margin of 9.1%, a 220 basis point improvement and a 25% increase in total EBIT compared to the prior year. And record free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion with positive free cash flow in North America, Latin America and Europe.
Despite significant macroeconomic uncertainty, we strengthened our balance sheet and drove significant shareholder value. We reduced our gross debt leverage to 2.3x, making progress towards our long-term target of 2x. We delivered a return on invested capital of approximately 11%, representing the fourth consecutive year of improvement as we realize the benefits of continued EBIT margin expansion at an optimized asset base in our Europe region. Lastly, we returned strong levels of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and increased our dividends for eighth consecutive year.
Overall, the results we delivered in 2020 reflect the structural improvements we have made not just in 2020, but also in those made during the years before. We are a fundamentally different company with an improved margin and cash flow profile. 2020 could have been a setback for us, instead we were able to significantly accelerate our progress towards our long-term financial goals.
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, price/mix delivered 375 basis points of margin expansion driven by reduced promotional investments and mix benefits as consumers invest in their homes. Additionally, we delivered on our cost takeout program positively impacting margins by 125 basis points. 
Further, reduced steel and resin costs resulted in a favorable impact of 125 basis points. These margin benefits were partially offset by continued marketing and technology investments and the unfavorable impact of currency. For the full year, very strong margin expansion from price/mix, and our cost takeout program were partially offset by increased brand investments and currency.
Overall, we're very pleased to be delivering on our long-term EBIT margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive very strong results in '21.
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our fourth quarter regional results. In North America, we delivered 4% revenue growth, driven by continued strong demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered record EBIT driven by the flawless execution of our cost takeout and go-to-market actions. Lastly, we continue to optimize our supply chain operations, driving weekly improvements in our production yield. Delivering top line growth and a record EBIT performance, the region's outstanding results again demonstrate the fundamental strength of our business model.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Share growth in Italy and the U.K., along with strong demand in the region, drove another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $29 million led by increased demand and strong cost takeout. We overcame the challenges presented by COVID-19 and restored profitability to the region in line with our commitment at the start of the year. Our 2020 results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategic actions and the progress we have made to date.
Turning to Slide 10, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 5% with organic net sales growth of 28%, led by strong demand in Brazil. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 12% with continued strong demand and disciplined execution of go-to-market actions, offsetting significant currency devaluation. Overall, the region's 2020 performance serves as a proof point of the viability of our long-term financial goals, highlighting our ability to deliver double-digit margins in a strong demand environment.
Turning to Slide 11, I'll review our fourth quarter results for our Asia region. In India, we delivered strong year-over-year net sales growth driven by demand recovery. In China, we delivered Whirlpool-branded share growth in addition to EBIT improvement led by cost productivity actions. Overall, we are pleased to see a rebound in Asia and look forward to building on this momentum in 2021.

Well, needless to say some uncertainty remains as we continue to operate in a COVID environment. However, we do believe increased disposable income, investments in the home and a favorable housing shift are here to stay and will drive strong demand.
Based on our internal model for industry and broad economy, we expect global industry growth of 4%. As we have demonstrated in 2020, we are uniquely positioned to capture restructural shifts and further advance our strategic priorities.
It is with confidence that we provide our '21 guidance, which reflects our fourth consecutive year of record earnings per share and significant top line growth. We expect to drive net sales growth of approximately 6%, as we capitalize strong demand and share gains in all regions. Additionally, we expect to deliver above 9% ongoing EBIT margin and deliver free cash flow of $1 billion or more.
Turning to Slide 14, we show the drivers of our 9% plus ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We expect price/mix to deliver approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion through 3 key initiatives: One, disciplined execution of our go-to-market actions; two, recently announced cost-based price increase in Brazil, Russia and India; and three, new product launches, just to give you a few examples of our legacy of innovation. 
In 2020, we rolled out our new global dishwasher architecture, featuring the largest capacity third rack dishwasher. In Europe, we launched a Red Dot award-winning built-in induction cooktop. In the United States, we entered the consumables detergent business with the launch of our ultra-concentrated wash detergent.
Next, we expect net cost to positively impact margin by 150 basis points as ongoing cost productivity efforts, coupled with a carryover benefit from our 2020 cost takeout program, more than offset elevated freight and labor costs. We expect raw material inflation to negatively impact margin by 150 basis points, led by higher steel and resin cost. 
Further, as we continue to invest in the future, we expect increased marketing and technology investments to drive a negative margin impact of 50 basis points while unfavorable currency, primarily Latin America, expected to impact margins by approximately 50 basis points. In total, we expect these actions to deliver 9% plus ongoing EBIT margin, an EBIT improvement of over $1 million compared to the prior year.
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to highlight a few remaining guidance items."

Turning to Slide 15, we show our regional guidance for the year. Starting with industry demand, we expect a robust demand environment for North America, supported by continued strength from consumer nesting trends and increased discretionary spending. Additionally, the impact from positive U.S. housing starts, which began to strengthen in late 2019 and strong existing home sales, will translate to higher appliance demand.
In EMEA, we expect a continued recovery in the first half of the year to support strong growth. While in Latin America, we expect modest growth of 2% to 4% as the benefits from government stimulus in Brazil are lessened.
Asia industry is expected to accelerate by 6% to 8% as the region rebounds from prolonged shutdowns in 2020.
Regarding our EBIT guidance, we expect very strong margins of 15% or more in North America. We expect the impact of favorable go-to-market initiatives and disciplined cost actions to offset cost inflation. In EMEA, we expect the strategic actions laid out during our 2019 Investor Day to drive EBIT margin expansion of over 250 basis points and a full year EBIT margin of over 2.5%.
In Latin America, we expect to deliver EBIT margins of 7% or higher as steady demand improvements and positive price/mix are offset by continued currency devaluation in Argentina and Brazil.
Lastly, we expect to achieve EBIT margins of 2% or higher in Asia driven by demand recovery.
Turning to Slide 16, we will discuss the drivers of our 2021 free cash flow. We expect another year of very strong cash earnings of approximately $2 billion, driven by sustained EBIT margins. We plan to increase capital investments to historical levels to support the launch of innovative products around the globe. Additionally, we will continue to invest in world-class manufacturing and our digital transformation journey. Further, as we ended 2020 with record-low inventory levels, we are planning for a moderate inventory build. We anticipate restructuring cash outlays of approximately $225 million, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19-related restructuring actions executed in 2020 and the exit of our Naples, Italy operations. Overall, we expect to drive free cash flow of $1 billion or more as we focus on continuing to deliver record EBIT margin levels and prioritizing our capital investments.
Turning to Slide 17, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. We remain fully committed to funding the business, driving innovation and growth while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders. We expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future. We have reinstated our share repurchase program that had been temporarily suspended during the height of the pandemic. With a clear focus on returning increased levels of cash to shareholders, we expect to repurchase shares at moderate levels. 
Lastly, we have a clear line of sight to delivering on our long-term goal of gross debt-to-EBITDA of 2x.
Now on Slide 18, I'll turn it back over to Marc to summarize our key messages."

Let me just recap what you've heard over the past few minutes. We are extremely pleased to see that despite the enormous challenges of operating in a global dynamic, our teams were able to deliver on our long-term value creation targets. 
In North America, we delivered nearly 16% EBIT margins for the full year, significantly above our long-term margin goal for the region of 13% plus. We restored the European region to profitability. In Latin America, we capitalized on strong industry demand, demonstrating the long-term margin potential in the region. And finally, we delivered record free cash flow of $1.25 billion or 6.4% of sales, above our long-term goal of 6% of sales.
Further, we demonstrated an unwavering commitment to our environmental, social and governance priorities, resulting in significant advancements to our targets.
Building on the momentum of our 2020 performance and the operational excellence of our global team, we are confident that we are well positioned to deliver another record year in '21.
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

First of all, stepping back in North America Q4 -- not just Q4, we're needless to say exceptionally pleased with the overall financial performance in North America and the margins, which we achieved in l",300,"First of all, David, good morning and thanks a lot. First of all, stepping back in North America Q4 -- not just Q4, we're needless to say exceptionally pleased with the overall financial performance in North America and the margins, which we achieved in light of a pandemic, which is still pretty severe. 
Now specifically to the volumes and the supply chain, I would say our overall volume directionally are in the line, in the scope of what you talked about, which also means we're kind of on a sequential base Q3 versus Q4. We directionally kept market share. But year-over-year, we're down. So it's the same down, which we had also in Q3 and Q4, which is ultimately related to the supply chain constraints, which we have.
Now our supply chain constraints, and we talked about it in the prior earnings call, there are fundamentally pandemic-driven, i.e., you have absenteeism in factories; you have labor shortage; you have component shortages, which have been significant; and we have transportation bottlenecks. So yes, of course, we're improving month by month, but it's also against the demand, which is rising month by month. So we're kind of -- we're still having a fairly significant backorder situation slightly better than at the end of Q3, but only slightly. 
And from everything which we see right now, that's where we -- in our prepared remarks, probably by the end of Q2, a little bit depending on the progress of the pandemic, which should be out of the constraints. But it will be around us pretty much as long as COVID is around us. It also would be crystal clear. It impacts pretty much everyone producing in the Americas, producing in Europe. It is less, almost no impact if you produce in China or Asia."

And again, we continue to implement and drive actions related to that. So we'll also have some additional actions that rolled out in Q4 that will continue to get a benefit for this year.
The second thing is if you look across our broader production base and as we get more efficient in understanding how to deal with some of the COVID inefficiencies that have come around, that will be a help for us. Incrementally, we expect volume to be -- as we've talked about, volume to be higher this year, so that will help to drive additional cost savings. 
And then on top of that, within any given year, we typically look to drive a certain amount of reduction in what we call infrastructure and SG&A spend. And so that's probably another big portion of what comes out there. But where we start the year in terms of the cost takeout programs we've already initiated versus what we've got in the pipeline, we feel very good about that number.
Additionally, as we've talked about, from a manufacturing footprint, we ceased production in our Naples facility in Italy during Q4. And so we'll start to see the benefits of that also rolling in this year from a cost perspective."

David, The comment I would want to add is, first of all, also coming back to last year, as you know, in -- last year, we significantly dialed up our cost takeouts. We started the year with a certain assumption, which we also gave you in the earnings call. And then we -- once the pandemic hit us, we massively ramped it up to $500 million net cost takeout, and we did. So I would say, we have a -- I know you see it, we have a track record of being able to deal with costs.
Now of course, we do know raw material is a headwind this year, and we showed earlier it's $250 million to $300 million. But I think we have other tools to overcome some of these headwinds. And there's carryover versus additional measures, which we're taking. And as you also know, it's not the first raw material headwind we're dealing with and we have dealt with very successfully in the past.
The other thing also in raw material, because I see in some writing, not in your writing out there, people are always referring to spot prices, et cetera. Keep in mind, we are either having long-term contracts or hedge on certain positions. So I would say we're less exposed to volatility you see in spot markets than most other players, and that's a good thing. And I think that also gives us probably a higher level of confidence that's pretty much the range, which we're talking about."

So Eric, on the demand trends, first of all, we got to recognize in 2020, yes, you've all seen the North America industry volume was a positive. I think what most people lose sight of is the quality of demand has changed in a positive way. We saw -- in particular in Q2 and beginning of Q3, you saw a lot of duress or COVID-related stress purchases, freezers, the microwaves, et cetera. But that has gradually shifted more and more into the more higher mix, i.e., remodeled kitchen upgrades or rebuilding our entire home construction.
So beyond the numbers of a volume, we're really pleased with the mix, which comes with the increased volume. But it also means we do not see the demand as well with the COVID spike. Yes, there was a little bit of a COVID spike. This is structurally and sustained healthy demands, which is, yes, coming to extremely strong housing trends, but it's more than housing. It's the entire home improvement, and we do not see that fundamentally changing anytime soon. That's probably on -- of all the global regions, I would say North America, may be the region where we're most bullish about. From a structural demand trend, it's very healthy, and we just do not see that slowing down. 
So I know the number, which we've guided to, but it could even be -- it might be even stronger. So we're very confident about the structural sustained demand trends. I think we're -- particularly, as we get our supply chain constraints resolved, I think we're confident we can capitalize on these demand trends. So -- and that's on the demand.

As we've talked about, by the middle of the year is when we expect to begin to have worked through that, assuming that nothing in the environment changes around us because most of these, as we've said, supply chain issues are COVID-driven. So that would put us in a place where we've really caught up only -- not only on the demand, but on the need for higher retail inventory levels.
And then as you get into the back half of the year, you'll begin to see us build our inventory level slightly as we return to what would be a normalized environment. And we talked about during 2020, how our inventory levels came down during this time period. So I think that's kind of the path we see throughout the year, but by about mid-year normalizing from a trade inventory level. And then in the third to fourth quarter, normalizing our inventories."

Now on the promotions going forward, as you know, we're not commenting on our go-forward pricing strategy. The only thing which I want to hint to and repeat is our promotion strategy has not changed, no matter what.

Related to this is, I heard that -- if I heard right, you talked about price increases in Russia, Brazil, India, but not the U.S., despite obviously having significant raw material inflation.

And to begin with, as we look at -- we're very happy with the performance that we saw in the back half of the year within EMEA and the margin improvement that we made. Now we have to remember that EMEA typically does have -- their first quarter is their lowest quarter of the year. So we do expect to continue to be profitable. But obviously, when you look at a quarter -- sequential quarter-over-quarter, we wouldn't expect to see continued margin growth within Q1.
For the full year, we do expect the margin growth to -- obviously to materialize to 2.5%. And a big part of what drives that is, one, you've got cost takeout actions that took place. And many of those were not implemented until the back half of the year within EMEA. Two, as I've talked about, with the share gains that we've seen and the continued improvement in volumes there and demand there, we do feel very positive on that. So both of those set us up coming out of 2021 on what I would say is a good trajectory that we feel will put us on track to our longer-term margin goals there.
Now the bigger drivers of that will continue to be cost takeout. In addition to -- with the market share gains that we're seeing right now and some of the new product introductions we're doing, we do expect to grow volumes there, and we've talked about that over the next few years. That's one of the key drivers to get those margins to a healthier longer-term level."

As a reminder, the pandemic from a consumer sellout hit Europe harder than it did Latin America or North America. So Q2, as you all remember, was pretty devastating from demand and also what it meant. So I'm very pleased that with that huge spend in Q2, we were able to achieve on a full year base of profit in Europe, which mid-year was a very difficult target to even think about. But we achieved the full year profit. 
Now we all know achieving a profit is not a heroic achievement, but it's an important milestone. And what it basically tells me with the second half performance is we're back on track with a trajectory, which we laid out in front of you, which said we want to get Europe very quickly to 2% to 4% and when while we work on the long-term strategic levers get it on track versus 7% or 8% operating margin target, which we talk about. And today, I would say the second half performance -- I'm not reading too much between Q3 and Q4, the second half performance gives us all the confidence we're back on this trajectory."

Without getting into details of our percentages, I think let me maybe more make the qualitative comments, which also adds to why we're confident, in particular North America, on the long-term demand trends. As you know, on the replacement side, we were running against the trough of the industry in 2008 to 2010. We're now pretty much coming out of this trough. 
Keep also in mind when people typically take this reference to 8 to 10 years appliance, that's when you replace. Last year was a year of extreme intense use at home, which probably accelerated that replacement of -- the need for replacement. So I would say on a fundamental replacement, we're now coming -- I think, soon, the trough will be behind us. So that will give strength. 
On top of that, we saw last year -- throughout the year, I talked about significantly higher discretionary demand. First, coming from really the duress and stress to really structure improvement. And I think on top of that, the housing side will come stronger and stronger and stronger. The housing side, the only thing where you probably don't see extreme numbers in short term is its housing supply constraints, okay? But you saw housing starts 1.7 million or 1.667 million, December. That is a promising sign, and it's been the highest in a long time. Still far away from where we believe it should be. It should be around 2 million housing starts. So that is not yet fully in the numbers. But again, that's -- these are all the data points, which give us the high degree of confidence in the structural demand improvements."

Now first of all, in macro scheme, of course, there's uncertainty. There's uncertainty every year around what happens in raw material, currency, et cetera. But I think this year, and that's different from the last few years, we have a high degree of confidence in structural demand trends, and that's just real, okay? It's the housing side. It's the home improvement side. And the one thing which I really want to emphasize is, which sometimes outside observers get wrong, is everybody thinks about post-COVID, everything will go back to where it used to be. It won't. 
First of all, COVID will be around longer than we want it to be. Second of all, a consumer who has been more than 1 year essentially at home will not change behavior overnight. It's not -- consumer mind is not a flash memory, which you just erase. That behavioral trend is not going to go away. And also in the context of how people talk about future work, you should assume that, going forward, the average consumer spends more time at home than before. It's just going to be that way. 
What it leads to is a fundamental reorientation of the consumer towards the house, the purpose of the house, how I live in the house and how much money I invest in the house. And frankly, some people refer to it as more for the housing play. I wouldn't even say it's a housing, we're a home play. I don't care -- well, I do care, but if you improve your home, it will benefit us. If you upgrade the kitchen, it will benefit us. If you build a new house, it benefits us. So there's multiple trends, which are all ultimately coming from a consumer reorientation to the home, which will really play in our favor."

Now there are, of course, crazy swings coming from currency, and you all have seen what the Brazilian real does and Mexican peso has now strengthened recently a little bit.

So the way I would look at it going forward, that region is absolutely reached from a structural perspective, which is able to deliver 8% to 10%. And right now, we guided 7% plus. And we're pretty confident. And I would also emphasize, we're confident on plus. Our Latin America business is a very well-run business, operating very strong. We have exceptionally strong brands.
The demand trends in that probably has been really positive surprise, held up pretty strong in Latin America. And I would even argue last year, it was the least impacted from the demand trends of all regions, which is largely a result of the COVID stimulus in their respective countries. So -- but we see that continuing. The demand holds up strong. Of course, we're observing currency fluctuations.

Two is as we've talked about, as we look towards the year, we do believe in terms of volume and demand, the front half of the year being strong as we work through some of the backlog that will help normalize our business on a full year basis and especially within North America. 
Additionally, as we've said, we had more of the cost savings there within probably starting in the second quarter through the fourth quarter.

As you also know, there is no European market. There's a lot of countries. And I'm particularly pleased that in several of our key countries, such as U.K., Italy, but also France, and now also lately, Russia, we expanded our share position, which I think ultimately is a result of we have strong products, strong placement and very good execution. So I think it's a combination of all of that.
But I also want to be very clear, we're not yet back to the level where I would expect us to be from a share perspective. I think we're still quite a bit of room to grow. You also know, strategically, our particular focus is on the kitchen business where naturally it takes a little bit longer to gain back the share, and that remains our focus. So I would say -- I would read the share gains, yes, we're proud, promising sign, but we're not done. 
So with that in mind, and also given that we're coming almost back to the top of the hour, so this was the last question. So before you all check out and hang up and get on your keyboards, let me just pass on one important last message though, just stay with me in another 1 or 2 minutes. 
When I reflect on your questions, a lot of them were what happens next quarter, 2 quarters down the road, supply chain seasonality. So they were short term and maybe rightfully, and that's what you also obviously talk about. But I would also strongly encourage you, zoom out. And what I mean with that, look at the long term, look at the fundamentals. Last year has been the third year in a row where we delivered all-time record EPS. We just guided towards a fourth year in a row. Four years in a row doesn't make it a onetime wonder. We're not a COVID play. This is a structural improvement and a different company. 
Can you just highlight what were promised several years ago? We are delivering towards our long-term shareholder targets, and I'm very pleased. Along the way, you guys had some questions. We are delivering. We are guiding $19 to $20. So if you -- beyond, of course, the short-term challenges, I think you should also give us some credit that we demonstrated sustainability to deal with whatever is thrown at us. This is -- it's 3 years in a row, now 4 years in a row. That is an exceptionally strong, long-term fundamental trend. And I think it is fair to say that the Whirlpool today is a very different company than it was 10 years ago.
So with that in mind, thanks for listening to us, and have a wonderful day."

In the first quarter, global semiconductors and resin",397,"Thanks, Roxanne, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our first quarter business results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the volatile industry dynamics and our decisive response plan. 
In the first quarter, global semiconductors and resin shortages amplified existing supply constraints and thus impacted our product availability. Further, we are faced with rapidly rising inflationary pressures, primarily in steel and resins. To address these issues, we swift the responses with necessary actions to protect margins and product availability. We announced significant cost-based price increase in various countries across the globe, ranging from 5% to 12%. Additionally, we reset our supply chain model to constrained-driven logic that constantly adjust production based on component availability. I strongly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins. These actions propelled our Q1 results and give us high confidence to significantly increase our full year ongoing earnings per share guidance by 18% to a range of $22.50 to $23.50. 
Now turning to our first quarter highlights on Slide 5. We delivered strong revenue growth of 24%, driven by sustained consumer demand and previously announced cost based pricing actions. Additionally, we delivered record ongoing EBIT margin of 12.4%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit margins. Further, we generated positive free cash flow of $132 million as a result of strong earnings and lower working capital levels. Lastly, we successfully delivered on our long-term gross debt leverage target of 2x. 
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of first quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix delivered 575 basis points of margin expansion, driven by reduced promotions and previously announced cost-based pricing benefits. Additionally, we delivered margin improvement of 375 basis points from net cost related to a carryover impact of structural cost takeout actions and higher volumes as we begin to compare against the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year. These margin benefits were partially offset by raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, resulting in an unfavorable impact of 225 basis points. Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and continued currency devaluation in Latin America impacted margins by a combined 125 basis points. Overall, we're very pleased to be delivering on our long-term EBIT margin commitment, and we're confident this positive momentum will continue to drive outstanding results throughout 2021. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

In North America, we delivered 20% revenue growth, driven by continued strong consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another quarter of record EBIT margin driven by strong volume growth PAUSE and the flawless execution of our go-to-market actions. Lastly, we continue to optimize our supply chain operations, resulting in modest sequential share gains. The region's outstanding results continue to demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Strong demand and share gains in key countries drove a third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in the region. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $36 million led by increased revenue and strong cost takeout. These results again demonstrate the effectiveness of our ongoing strategic actions. 
Turning to Slide 10, I'll review our first quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 18% with revenue growth, excluding currency of 35%, led by strong demand across Brazil and Mexico. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.5%, with continued strong demand and the early impact of cost-based pricing actions offsetting significant currency devaluation. 
Turning to Slide 11, I'll review our first quarter results for our Asia region. In Asia, we delivered strong year-over-year net sales growth, led by demand across the region and share gains in China. Additionally, we delivered significant EBIT expansion across both India and China led by go-to-market and continued cost productivity actions. However, uncertainty remains as COVID-19 cases continue to surge in India.

Finally, we're also raising our EPS guidance significantly to $22.50 to $23.50, a year-over-year increase of 25%. 
Turning to Slide 14, we show the drivers of our revised EBIT margin guidance. We expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by price/mix as we continue to be disciplined in our go-to-market strategy and capture the benefits of our previously announced cost-based pricing actions. We continue to forecast net cost takeouts to favorably impact margin by 150 basis points as we realize the carryover benefits of our 2020 cost reduction program and ongoing cost initiatives. The global material cost inflation, in particular, in steel and resins will negatively impact our business by about $1 billion. We expect cost increases to peak in the third quarter. Increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, are expected to impact margins by 75 basis points each. Overall, based on our track record, we are confident in our ability to navigate this uncertain environment and deliver approximately 10% EBIT margin.

We have updated the EBIT guidance of our North America and Latin America regions to reflect the benefits of pricing actions and continued demand strength. This brings our EBIT guidance for North America to 15.5-plus percent and Latin America to approximately 8%. Lastly, in March, [ Galan's ] launched its formal partial tender offer for majority stake in Whirlpool. [indiscernible] this partial tender offer is successfully closed in the second quarter. Based on this assumption, we would expect to see approximately 7 months of Whirlpool China revenue and EBIT removed from the region's results. This is approximately $300 million in net sales and approximately $15 million of EBIT loss. With the deconsolidation of Whirlpool China business and continuation of our profitable India business, we anticipate an increase in Asia's EBIT margin to 5% plus. 
Turning to Slide 16. We will discuss the drivers of our 2021 free cash flow. With expectations for stronger top line growth and improved EBIT margins, we increased our cash earnings guidance by $250 million. From a working capital perspective, we expect to see inventory build throughout the year as we compare against record low levels in 2020 and unlock bottlenecks in our supply chain. Lastly, we now expect $150 million from the sale of a majority of our shares in Whirlpool China, in addition to the continued optimization of our real estate portfolio. Overall, we now expect to drive free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion or 5.7% of sales, in line with our long-term goal of 6%. 
Turning to Slide 17, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. We continue to expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures in research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future. Additionally, with a clear focus on returning strong levels of cash to shareholders, we increased our dividend for the ninth consecutive year. Also, we have increased our share buyback program by $2 billion, bringing our remaining authorization to $2.4 billion. Lastly, we have delivered on our long-term gross debt leverage goal of 2x.

First question I had was on the real impressive progress, I think, around the North American top line. And you talked about driving those results were continued improvements in supply chain, allowing for some modest share gains. I was hoping you could talk to the fact that it appears that you obviously grew maybe a touch in excess of the market. But from a volume perspective, I mean, there's obviously a price/mix component. So maybe number one, you could talk about your volume growth roughly? And how you're thinking about share right now, if you were able to match the AHAM shipment growth? 
And number two, how you think about your excess backlog, this was an area that, I think at the end of the year, you're at 7, 8 weeks, if you're able to make any progress there?

So let me try to answer both of your questions. First, on the narrow top line. Obviously, we're very, very pleased with a 20% growth in Q1, and it is right run rate, certainly much better than Q4 and Q3. So we feel we have the right momentum. 
To be clear on 2 parameters, we gained moderate share sequential, i.e., Q1 versus Q4. However, on a year-over-year basis, we have not gained share, just to be clear. We will also -- there's a reason why we don't provide unit volumes anymore. Having said that, of a 20%, there is a healthy component of price/mix. It's roughly in line with what we show for the corporation. But there's also underlying growth. 
Now the comparison to AHAM and the AHAM T6 or T7, that's part of the reason why we stopped communicating with volume. First of all, as you know, even in the EM numbers, there's quite a bit of noise about the calendar days, which is very [indiscernible] get into. And two, it's always a question about the T5, T6, T7. Having said that, we feel good about where we are right now from a run rate in Q1, both in volume and revenue, and we're pretty confident we can sustain that growth relative to the market on a full year base. 
Now to the second part of your question on the excess backlog. I think, if I heard you correctly, you were saying, are we 1 quarter away from resolving the backlog? We're not. That's the plan. So now let me give you a much more qualified perspective on this one. In our January earnings call, I think we were referring to 7 or 8 weeks of order backlog. That had its peak pretty much around October, November last year. And then, slowly started to moderate towards January, and that's why we felt, yes, we're on track to kind of really bring that down quite a bit, which obviously, we absolutely want to do because we have consumers waiting for our products. So 2 things happened since -- or actually 3 things. One is consumer demand did not only stay strong. Actually, it grew. And that's why we updated our full year expectation on industry. Keeping off in mind when we refer to these full year industry numbers, these are, in a certain way, constrained industry shipments. I think the unconstrained consumer demand will be well above the 6%, which we guide right now. So a, you have demand, which didn't slow down, actually got stronger. Two, we had major events on the supply chain, one was the Texas winter storm, which unfortunately impact a big part of the petrochemical production PAUSE and subsequently, resins and what it means for our supply chain. Two, you have the semiconductor issue, which I know in other industries has been already a major headache in Q4 and Q1. Because of a different sourcing strategy, which we have, we were largely mitigating these effects. But like the nature of any hedge, you can't escape it forever. And that semiconductor shortage was amplified also by, again, a little bit of the Texas winter storm because there's 1 or 2 important factories for us. And you have a Japan fire, which also unfortunately impacts us. So you put a constrained -- a COVID constrained supply chain, plus semiconductors, plus resins against a stronger consumer demand, it's stress on the system. And what it ultimately translates into the back orders, unfortunately, will remain elevated for some time to come. I would expect right now, and admittedly, it's very difficult to forecast it. But right now, we should assume that Q2, Q3 will be on similar elevated levels. And right now, it looks like Q4, we should see some moderation on this one. 
Sorry, it was a long answer, but I think it's probably helpful to give you a little bit more PAUSE perspective on all these moving parts in the supply chain."

I don't start at '22 because that is far out in the current environment, to be very honest with -- there's so much uncertainties associated with that. But let me give you our perspective on the dynamics of how raw materials seem to unfold. And also, first of all, emphasizing, there's a big difference between absolute levels of raw materials and increases year-over-year. 
So when I refer to increases year-over-year, we do expect a continued increase in Q2. Also, a strong increase in Q3. And probably, the increases seem to likely peak in Q3, and then will start moderating it from there on down. The level of moderation however, will still mean a level of absolute raw material costs, which will be significantly increased. And I think that's also largely what we will carry into '22. But again, there's -- Sam, I hope we appreciate the last 10 weeks overall, has dramatically changed in raw materials. And I don't think we're in a stable environment right now. But that's right now, our best scenario again. Q2 further increased, Q3 peaking, Q4 probably slightly moderating in terms of increases, but still being on a very high absolute level."

And then your question on the spread from Q2 to Q3, listen, what you see from an overall price/mix perspective, as we've shown, the first quarter kind of aligns with the guidance we've given for the full year. So what it says is, as you go through, but materials are still a little bit lower, and that's to the seasonality that Marc talked about. As we go throughout the year, materials will be more of a headwind, but we expect the pricing to take hold, and that will be a bigger driver of the price/mix versus the reduced promotional environment that now that year-over-year is coming down as a benefit. But the 2 offset each other, and that's why we believe we'll be flat price/mix throughout the year."

And I think you'll hear many producers out there talking about that over the next few weeks as they've seen that, but also to some of the things Marc talked about earlier, especially around what's causing some of the issues within our supply chain of a lack of resins and all that. That also caused, as you think about the Texas storms and the rising oil prices and that has caused a higher cost within our resin space also. So steel and resins are probably the 2 biggest drivers. And then you think about all the components we have that may contain pieces of that. So it's a pretty broad-based throughout our supply portfolio."

Steel, if you look at the spot prices, steel just the last 8 weeks has seen a dramatic increase. Take North America, they went up to $1,500. These are levels, I mean, unheard of. Now we do not buy at spot but ultimately, the way our [indiscernible] are shaped up, we can't escape spot trend forever. And so ultimately, you see also something around this one. 
And resin is our second biggest buy, which is obviously a reflection of a, higher oil prices and two, these constraints coming out of Texas, they certainly don't lead to lower prices. So put these 2 together, plus then the subsequent or cascading impact it has on strategic components, which we buy because our suppliers also have to pay for steel, et cetera, so you put that all together, that led to that fairly dramatic change. 
Now with regards to your question about the confidence level. I, right now, can only characterize it that is our very best estimate at this point. I wouldn't characterize it as extremely pessimistic or optimistic. I think it's a well-balanced. But of course, I mean, in the current world, which we're living right now, it's -- there's always uncertainty. I mean, we saw that the last 8 weeks, but I do believe it's fair to assume $1 billion is about the right number for this year."

Now obviously, as with your passes with a lot of, as you said, moving parts and big elements, we will then have to redefine what is a really long-term steady-state margin objective for North America. But I would say, the progress of the last couple of years have certainly encouraged us to think differently about what can be steady state margins in North America.

Now we all know that is not the end state. That's not the final target, but exactly in line with what we had in mind for our turnaround plan. That is largely driven, yes, the European team also demonstrates good disciplined cost. We'll also face the same cost inflation in Europe as we are in North America, maybe not the exactly same magnitude, but it's almost the same. And frankly, we've got nice progress in regaining market share in several key countries in Q1. 
Now the European market also has been very strong in Q1, but I think even against a strong market, we grew market share.

And then, maybe a broader comment on the fundamental nature of demand that we're seeing. The mix of product, of course, in Q2 and to some extent, Q3 last year, we saw a lot of, call it, COVID emergency products, okay? The microwave, the small fridge or replacement products because the washer broke down. That mix has gradually shifted and continues to shift towards a richer mix, i.e., people are investing in the home. There's disposable income and people are upgrading or investing. So it's not the ""COVID purchase"" anymore. It's really structural investment in the home. And that's a good thing to see. 
The broader comment I want to make. In the past, some people were referring to asking us, well, what you see right now on demand is that pull forward. Frankly, I don't think pull forward describe adequately what's going on because pull forward implies there's a fixed amount of the years you get out of an appliance. And if you buy this year, you don't buy next year. And that is not an adequate description. I think we need to think more in terms of appliance from a consumer perspective, how much use, how much mileage, how many cycles you get out in appliance. And what last year showed with people spending so much time in home, the consumption was higher. Literally, the consumption. So what happened last year and what happened this year, if people spending so much time in home, the appliance consumption is higher. So it's not a pull forward. It's an accelerated use, which drives a lot of demand and which we expect also to continue for quite some time."

Do you think the promotional activity that we're comping are set -- that's already in next year's numbers or last year's numbers, is that something that -- is there any reason promotional activity wouldn't return, in your opinion, given what's happened in the last 12 months in terms of competitors' domestic capacity or categories?

What we're seeing right now is the demand is a sustained and multiyear demand trend. It's not a blip. It's a strong upcycle. And in particular, for North America, you have general consumer trend of investing in the home, people also going forward will spend more days at home. Just think about all these flexible work policies. People will spend more time at home, which ultimately drives higher investments in the home and accelerated use of appliance in the home. Coupled that with the housing market in the U.S., which I think some people refer to golden age of housing. Housing demand will not slow down the next couple of years, if at all, will increase. So put that together, you will have multiyear strong consumer demand in the U.S. And you heard us before talking about consumer demand, to be honest, and obvious, I've been doing the earnings call this probably year by most bullish about mid- and long-term consumer demand trends in North America. So I'm not worried about consumer demand. I'm a promotional environment, I can only repeat what I said before. We have our policy. That policy is unchanged. I can't comment what our competitors are doing, and I won't. And that's a pure speculation.

Like in China, you have U.K. where it's reaching 30%. U.S. on a multiyear perspective, has been more around 12%. Obviously, last year was increased. Now to also clarify, there's a big difference between pure online purchase and kind of mix because pretty much every consumer goes online anyhow to -- as a prebuy and pre-information. And of course, the pure online transaction has significantly increased in particular Q2, Q3. But I would say, in the U.S., less so than in other markets, and that's simply reflection because many retailers remained opened, which has not been the same in other countries. 
So I think will that settle back a little bit to pre-COVID levels, I would say, not entirely. I think you would -- what COVID brought is a structural percentage point change in terms of how many people will just buy purely online. So we may not see the COVID peak in terms of online sales going forward over the next -- in the midterm, but it certainly will not go back to pre-COVID. So I think coming out of this one, and again, the dust has not settled, but I would not be surprised if you see in the U.S. online -- pure online transaction in the ballpark of 15% to 20% already this year. 
So I think that pretty much marks the end of our questions. So let me maybe just close here and usually, when you close these kind of calls, you repeat the confidence and you repeat everything you said. I'm actually going to keep that part fairly short because, as you saw before, we increased our guidance from $18.55 to midpoint $23, more than $4.50, you don't do that if you're not confident.

But what our employees are right now, delivering and committing is beyond the extraordinary. What I mean with that is we have still -- COVID is still very real. I know U.S. is getting out of the woods, slowly, but it's very real throughout the world. And on top of that, we have these constraints and challenges, which you just talked about. To give you a little bit of picture on COVID is very real, we are factoring [ Manaus ]. We have to shut it down because we had to give industrial oxygen to a local hospital because they ran out of normal oxygen. We have India fully being hit by the COVID wave, and we have several thousand employees in India. We have, in the month of April, 576 colleagues who got positively diagnosed. So it is very real, and that means a lot of pain and anxiety for a lot of our employees. While, at the same time, what we easily and casually described as supply chain constraints, it's hard to express what amount of stress that puts on an organization.

Before we discuss our first quarter business results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the volatile industry dynamics and our decisive response plan. In the first quarter, global semiconductors and resin",396,"Thanks, Roxanne, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our first quarter business results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the volatile industry dynamics and our decisive response plan. 
In the first quarter, global semiconductors and resin shortages amplified existing supply constraints and thus impacted our product availability. Further, we are faced with rapidly rising inflationary pressures, primarily in steel and resins. To address these issues, we swiftly responded with necessary actions to protect margins and product availability. We announced significant cost-based price increase in various countries across the globe, ranging from 5% to 12%. 
Additionally, we reset our supply chain model to constrained-driven logic that constantly adjust production based on component availability. I strongly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins. These actions propelled our Q1 results and give us high confidence to significantly increase our full year ongoing earnings per share guidance by 18% to a range of $22.50 to $23.50. 
Now turning to our first quarter highlights on Slide 5. We delivered strong revenue growth of 24%, driven by sustained consumer demand and previously announced cost based pricing actions. Additionally, we delivered record ongoing EBIT margin of 12.4%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit margins. Further, we generated positive free cash flow of $132 million as a result of strong earnings and lower working capital levels. Lastly, we successfully delivered on our long-term gross debt leverage target of 2x. 
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of first quarter EBIT margin. Price/mix delivered 575 basis points of margin expansion, driven by reduced promotions and previously announced cost-based pricing benefits. Additionally, we delivered margin improvement of 375 basis points from net cost related to a carryover impact of structural cost takeout actions and higher volumes as we begin to compare against the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year. These margin benefits were partially offset by raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, resulting in an unfavorable impact of 225 basis points. Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and continued currency devaluation in Latin America impacted margins by a combined 125 basis points. Overall, we're very pleased to be delivering on our long-term EBIT margin commitment, and we're confident this positive momentum will continue to drive outstanding results throughout 2021. 
And now, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

In North America, we delivered 20% revenue growth, driven by continued strong consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another quarter of record EBIT margin driven by strong volume growth and the flawless execution of our go-to-market actions. Lastly, we continue to optimize our supply chain operations, resulting in modest sequential share gains. The region's outstanding results continue to demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model. 
Turning to Slide 9. I'll review our first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Strong demand and share gains in key countries drove a third consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in the region. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $36 million led by increased revenue and strong cost takeout. These results again demonstrate the effectiveness of our ongoing strategic actions. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'll review our first quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 18% with revenue growth, excluding currency of 35%, led by strong demand across Brazil and Mexico. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.5%, with continued strong demand and the early impact of cost-based pricing actions offsetting significant currency devaluation. 
Turning to Slide 11. I'll review our first quarter results for our Asia region. In Asia, we delivered strong year-over-year net sales growth, led by demand across the region and share gains in China. Additionally, we delivered significant EBIT expansion across both India and China led by go-to-market and continued cost productivity actions. However, uncertainty remains as COVID-19 cases continue to surge in India. 
Turning to Slide 13. Marc and I will discuss our revised full year 2021 guidance. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

So while macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs. W",266,"Thanks, Jim. So while macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs. We are raising our guidance for net sales growth from 6% to now 13%, and EBIT margin from 9% to now approximately 10%. In addition, with higher earnings, we now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion instead of $1 billion. Finally, we're also raising our EPS guidance significantly to $22.50 to $23.50, a year-over-year increase of 25%. 
Turning to Slide 14, we show the drivers of our revised EBIT margin guidance. We expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by price/mix as we continue to be disciplined in our go-to-market strategy and capture the benefits of our previously announced cost-based pricing actions. We continue to forecast net cost takeouts to favorably impact margin by 150 basis points as we realize the carryover benefits of our 2020 cost reduction program and ongoing cost initiatives. 
The global material cost inflation, in particular, in steel and resins will negatively impact our business by about $1 billion. We expect cost increases to peak in the third quarter. Increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, are expected to impact margins by 75 basis points each. Overall, based on our track record, we are confident in our ability to navigate this uncertain environment and deliver approximately 10% EBIT margin. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to highlight our regional industry and EBIT margin expectations."

We have slightly increased our global industry expectations to 5%, reflecting the demand strength in North America. We have updated the EBIT guidance of our North America and Latin America regions to reflect the benefits of pricing actions and continued demand strength. This brings our EBIT guidance for North America to 15.5-plus percent and Latin America to approximately 8%. 
Lastly, in March, Galanz launched its formal partial tender offer for a majority stake in Whirlpool China. Our EBIT guidance for Asia assumes Galanz' partial tender offer is successfully closed in the second quarter. Based on this assumption, we would expect to see approximately 7 months of Whirlpool China revenue and EBIT removed from the region's results. This is approximately $300 million in net sales and approximately $15 million of EBIT loss. With the deconsolidation of Whirlpool China business and continuation of our profitable India business, we anticipate an increase in Asia's EBIT margin to 5% plus. 
Turning to Slide 16. We will discuss the drivers of our 2021 free cash flow. With expectations for stronger top line growth and improved EBIT margins, we increased our cash earnings guidance by $250 million. From a working capital perspective, we expect to see inventory build throughout the year as we compare against record low levels in 2020 and unlock bottlenecks in our supply chain. Lastly, we now expect $150 million from the sale of a majority of our shares in Whirlpool China, in addition to the continued optimization of our real estate portfolio. Overall, we now expect to drive free cash flow of approximately $1.25 billion or 5.7% of sales, in line with our long-term goal of 6%. 
Turning to Slide 17, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. We continue to expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future. 
Additionally, with a clear focus on returning strong levels of cash to shareholders, we increased our dividend for the ninth consecutive year. Also, we have increased our share buyback program by $2 billion, bringing our remaining authorization to $2.4 billion. Lastly, we have delivered on our long-term gross debt leverage goal of 2x.

I was hoping you could talk to the fact that it appears that you obviously grew maybe a touch in excess of the market. But from a volume perspective, I mean, there's obviously a price/mix component. So maybe, number one, you could talk about your volume growth roughly and how you're thinking about share right now, if you were able to match the AHAM shipment growth.
And number two, how you think about your excess backlog. That's just an area that, I think, at the end of the year, you're at 7, 8 weeks, if you're able to make any progress there.

So let me try to answer both of your questions. First, on the narrow top line. Obviously, we're very, very pleased with a 20% growth in Q1, and it is right run rate, certainly much better than Q4 and Q3. So we feel we have the right momentum. 
To be clear on 2 parameters, we gained moderate share sequential, i.e., Q1 versus Q4. However, on a year-over-year basis, we have not gained share, just to be clear. We will also -- there's a reason why we don't provide unit volumes anymore. Having said that, of the 20%, there is a healthy component of price/mix. It's roughly in line with what we [ show for ] the corporation. But there's also underlying growth. 
Now the comparison to AHAM and the AHAM T6 or T7, that's part of the reason why we stopped communicating the volume. First of all, as you know, even in the AHAM numbers, there's quite a bit of noise about the calendar days, which is very complicated to get into. And two, it's always a question about the T5, T6, T7. Having said that, we feel good about where we are right now from the run rate in Q1, both in volume and revenue, and we're pretty confident we can sustain that growth relative to the market on a full year base. 
Now to the second part of your question on the excess backlog. I think, if I heard you correctly, you were saying, are we 1 quarter away from resolving the backlog? We're not. That's the same plan. 
So now let me give you a much more qualified perspective on this one. In our January earnings call, I think we were referring to 7 or 8 weeks of order backlog. That had its peak pretty much around October, November last year. And then, slowly started to moderate towards January, and that's why we felt, yes, we're on track to kind of really bring that down quite a bit, which obviously, we absolutely want to do because we have consumers waiting for our products. 
So 2 things happened since -- or actually 3 things. One is consumer demand did not only stay strong, actually it grew. And that's why we updated our full year expectation on industry. Keeping also in mind, when we refer to these full year industry numbers, these are, in a certain way, constrained industry shipments. I think the unconstrained consumer demand will be well above the 6%, which we guide right now. 
So a, you have demand, which didn't slow down, actually got stronger. Two, you had major events on the supply chain, one was the Texas winter storm, which unfortunately impacted a big part of the petrochemical production, and subsequently, resins and what it means for our supply chain. 
Two, you have the semiconductor issue, which I know in other industries has been already a major headache in Q4 and Q1. Because of a different sourcing strategy, which we have, we were largely mitigating these effects. But like the nature of any hedge, you can't escape it forever. And that semiconductor shortage was amplified also by, again, a little bit of the Texas winter storm because there's 1 or 2 important factories for us. And you have the Japan fire, which also unfortunately impacts us. So you put a constrained -- a COVID-constrained supply chain, plus semiconductors, plus resins against a stronger consumer demand, it's stress on the system. And what it ultimately translates into the back orders, unfortunately, will remain elevated for some time to come. I would expect right now, and admittedly, it's very difficult to forecast it. But right now, we should assume that Q2, Q3 will be on similar elevated levels. And right now, it looks like Q4, we should see some moderation on this one. 
Sorry about the long answer, but I think it's probably helpful to give you a little bit more perspective on all these moving parts in the supply chain."

And then the second question, you had a terrific -- obviously, a terrific price versus RMI spread in the first quarter, it was 3.5 points, the difference between 5.75% and 2.25%. How do you envision that spread in Q2 and Q3, as your lead times are obviously -- and the industry lead times are obviously still extended? I would think that, that spread would continue.

I don't start at '22 because that is far out in the current environment, to be very honest, there's so much uncertainties associated with that. But let me give you our perspective on the dynamics of how raw materials seem to unfold. And also, first of all, emphasizing there's a big difference between absolute levels of raw materials and increases year-over-year.  
So when I refer to increases year-over-year, we do expect a continued increase in Q2. Also, a strong increase in Q3. And probably, the increases seem to likely peak in Q3, and then will start moderating from there on down. The level of moderation, however, will still mean a level of absolute raw material costs, which will be significantly increased. And I think that's also largely what we will carry into '22. But again, there's -- Sam, and I hope we appreciate the last 10 weeks overall has dramatically changed in raw materials. And I don't think we're in a stable environment right now. But that's right now, our best scenario. Again, Q2 further increased, Q3 peaking, Q4 probably slightly moderating in terms of increases, but still being on a very high absolute level."

And Sam, I would align with Marc on that, that that's kind of the pattern we see.

And then your question on the spread from Q2 to Q3, listen, what you see from an overall price/mix perspective, as we've shown, the first quarter kind of aligns with the guidance we've given for the full year. So what it says is, as you go through, but materials are still a little bit lower, and that's to the seasonality that Marc talked about. As we go throughout the year, materials will be more of a headwind, but we expect the pricing to take hold, and that will be a bigger driver of the price/mix versus the reduced promotional environment that now that year-over-year is coming down as a benefit. But the 2 offset each other, and that's why we believe we'll be flat price/mix throughout the year."

And I think you'll hear many producers out there talking about that over the next few weeks as they've seen that, but also to some of the things Marc talked about earlier, especially around what's causing some of the issues within our supply chain of a lack of resins and all that. That also caused -- as you think about the Texas storms and the rising oil prices and that has caused a higher cost within our resin space also. So steel and resins are probably the 2 biggest drivers. And then you think about all the components we have that may contain pieces of that. So it's a pretty broad-based throughout our supply portfolio."

Steel, if you look at the spot prices, steel just the last 8 weeks has seen a dramatic increase. Take North America, they went up to $1,500. These are levels, I mean, unheard of. Now we do not buy at spot but ultimately, the way our contracts are shaped up, we can't escape spot trend forever. And so ultimately, you see also something around this one.  
And resin is our second biggest buy, which is obviously a reflection of: a, higher oil prices; and two, these constraints coming out of Texas. They certainly don't lead to lower prices. So put these 2 together, plus then the subsequent or cascading impact it has on strategic components, which we buy because our suppliers also have to pay for steel, et cetera, so you put that all together, that led to that fairly dramatic change.  
Now with regards to your question about the confidence level. I, right now, can only characterize it that is our very best estimate at this point. I wouldn't characterize it as extremely pessimistic or optimistic. I think it's well-balanced.

Coupled with this one is coming back to the earlier comments, which I made to Michael about the supply chain. Our supply chain will be constrained. It doesn't make sense to promote products, which you can't produce. So now again, the promotion plans will always change.

Now obviously, as [ the year ] passes with a lot of, as you said, moving parts and big elements, we will then have to redefine what is a really long-term steady-state margin objective for North America. 
But I would say, the progress of the last couple of years have certainly encouraged us to think differently about what can be steady state margins in North America. And I would expect that in the next investor meeting, which we will have the appropriate time announced and it will be -- then is when we'll give a perspective of our long-term margin guidance."

Admittedly, it is not the same level as Latin America or North America, but it's a profit and a really impressive year-over-year improvement. Also, 2.5%, which we guided for this year, to be honest, that's perfectly in line with what we had in mind as our turnaround plan. 
Now we all know that is not the end state. That's not the final target, but it's exactly in line with what we had in mind for our turnaround plan. That is largely driven, yes, the European team also demonstrates good disciplined cost. We're also faced with the same cost inflation in Europe as we are in North America, maybe not the exactly same magnitude, but it's almost the same. And frankly, we've got nice progress in regaining market share in several key countries in Q1. 
Now the European market also has been very strong in Q1, but I think even against a strong market, we grew market share. As I said repeatedly in the past, the biggest element of progress where we need to continue to demonstrate progress throughout the next couple of years is on the building of the kitchen business in Europe, where it always takes a little bit longer to regain market share.

And then, maybe a broader comment on the fundamental nature of demand that we're seeing. The mix of product, of course, in Q2 and to some extent, Q3 last year, we saw a lot of, call it, COVID emergency products, okay? The microwave, the small fridge or replacement products because the washer broke down. That mix has gradually shifted and continues to shift towards a richer mix, i.e., people are investing in the home. There's disposable income and people are upgrading or investing. So it's not the ""COVID purchase"" anymore. It's really structural investment in the home. And that's a good thing to see. 
The broader comment I want to make. In the past, some people were referring to asking us, well, what you see right now on demand, is that pull-forward? Frankly, I don't think pull-forward describes adequately what's going on because pull forward implies there's a fixed amount of the years you get out of an appliance. And if you buy this year, you don't buy next year. And that is not an adequate description. I think we need to think more in terms of appliance from a consumer perspective, how much use, how much mileage, how many cycles you get out in appliance. And what last year showed with people spending so much time in home, the consumption was higher. Literally, the consumption. So what happened last year and what happened this year, if people spending so much time in home, the appliance consumption is higher. So it's not a pull-forward. It's an accelerated use, which drives a lot of demand and which we expect also to continue for quite some time."

But it seems like that at home really is a tailwind well into 2022 as well. And I think you've been very clear to guidance that the second half margins domestically will normalize, something in that sub-15%, but where we are in FY '22 remains uncertain. Do you think the promotional activity that we're comping are set -- that's already in next year's numbers or last year's numbers, is that something that -- is there any reason promotional activity wouldn't return, in your opinion, given what's happened in the last 12 months in terms of competitors' domestic capacity or categories?

What we're seeing right now is the demand is a sustained and multiyear demand trend. It's not a blip. It's a strong upcycle. And in particular, for North America, you have the general consumer trend of investing in the home, people also going forward will spend more days at home. Just think about all these flexible work policies. People will spend more time at home, which ultimately drives higher investments in the home and accelerated use of appliance in the home. Couple that with the housing market in the U.S., which I think some people refer to as golden age of housing. Housing demand will not slow down in the next couple of years, if at all, will increase. So put that together, you will have multiyear strong consumer demand in the U.S. 
And you heard us before talking about consumer demand, to be honest, in all the years I've been doing the earnings call, this is probably the year that I'm most bullish about mid- and long-term consumer demand trends in North America. So I'm not worried about consumer demand. On a promotional environment, I can only repeat what I said before. We have our policy. That policy is unchanged. I can't comment what our competitors are doing, and I won't. And that's a pure speculation. But right now, from everything you heard from us before, in a supply-constrained environment, you should assume we will not be very aggressive on the promotional side."

And we talked earlier about whether it was cost-based price increases we took in 2012, '18 that we're taking now, I think that's just a continued demonstration of our ability to adjust to the environment around us and still maintain and expand our margins."

So obviously, the consumer trends in terms of buying online or purely online are vastly different country by country, okay? You have some countries where it's already almost 50%. Like in China, you have U.K. where it's reaching 30%. U.S. on a multiyear perspective has been more around 12%. Obviously, last year was increased. 
Now to also clarify, there's a big difference between pure online purchase and kind of mixed because pretty much every consumer goes online anyhow to -- as a prebuy and pre-information. And of course, the pure online transaction has significantly increased, in particular Q2, Q3. But I would say, in the U.S., less so than in other markets, and that's simply a reflection because many retailers remained open, which has not been the same in other countries. 
So I think will that settle back a little bit to pre-COVID levels? I would say not entirely. I think you would -- what COVID brought is a structural percentage point change in terms of how many people will just buy purely online. So we may not see the COVID peak in terms of online sales going forward over the next -- in the midterm, but it certainly will not go back to pre-COVID. 
So I think coming out of this one -- and again, the dust has not settled, but I would not be surprised if you see in the U.S. online -- pure online transaction in the ballpark of 15% to 20% already this year. 
So I think that pretty much marks the end of our questions. So let me maybe just close here and usually, when you close these kind of calls, you repeat the confidence and you repeat everything you said. I'm actually going to keep that part fairly short because, as you saw before, we increased our guidance from $18.55 to midpoint $23, more than $4.50, you don't do that if you're not confident. We are confident, and I hope we expressed it adequately in the last hour or so. 
I rather want to use this -- close the year actually to thank our employees and give you a little bit color. We always expect a lot from our employees. But what our employees are right now delivering and committing is beyond the extraordinary. What I mean with that is we have still -- COVID is still very real. I know U.S. is getting out of the woods slowly, but it's very real throughout the world. And on top of that, we have these constraints and challenges, which we just talked about. 
To give you a little bit of picture that COVID is very real, we have a factory in Manaus. We had to shut it down because we had to give industrial oxygen to a local hospital because they ran out of normal oxygen. We have India fully being hit by the COVID wave, and we have several thousand employees in India. We have, in the month of April, 576 colleagues who got positively diagnosed. So it is very real, and that means a lot of pain and anxiety for a lot of our employees. While, at the same time, what we so easily and casually described as supply chain constraints, it's hard to express what amount of stress that puts on an organization. 
So I'm sitting here, and I just -- I want to tell our employees, it's not lost. We certainly do recognize the extraordinary effort being put into this one, and our organization is delivering. And I just want to express my thanks. And I guess, that marks the end of our Q&A. Thank you, everybody. Bye."

While lessened, disruptions",400,"Thanks, Corey, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our second quarter results, I'd like to acknowledge that we are comparing to a period in which the world was experiencing a greater step of disruption from COVID-19. While lessened, disruptions from the pandemic do, in fact, remain along with volatile industry dynamics and numerous global supply chain constraints. Having said that, our impressive results throughout this entire period, and again in Q2, demonstrates the strong execution of our global teams and the resiliency of our business model. 
Now turning to our second quarter highlights on Slide 4, we delivered very strong revenue growth of 32% year-over-year which also represents growth above 2019 levels, driven by robust and sustained consumer demand and the execution of our pricing actions. Next, our decisive response plan to address volatile industry dynamics and broad supply constraints delivered ongoing EPS of $6.64, a $4.57 improvement year-over-year. Ongoing EBIT margin of 11.4%, a year-over-year improvement of 640 basis points, overcoming 400 basis points of cost inflation. 
Additionally, we generated positive free cash flow of $769 million led by strong earnings and the successful completion of a partial tender offer of our Whirlpool China business and the divestiture of our Turkey subsidiary. These global results were driven by substantial EBIT growth and margin expansion across every region. The execution of these actions and the sustained consumer demand delivery very strong Q2 results and give us the confidence to significantly raise our guidance to approximately $26 per share. 
Turning to Slide 5, we show the drivers of our second quarter EBIT margin. Price and mix delivered 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by reduced promotions and the further implementation of a previously announced cost-based pricing actions. Additionally, structural cost takeout actions, higher volumes and ongoing cost productivity initiatives delivered 550 basis points of net cost margin improvement. These margin benefits were partially offset by raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, which resulted in an unfavorable impact of 400 basis points. 
Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and the continued impact from currency in Latin America impacted margin by a combined 100 basis points. Overall, we are very pleased to be delivering even above our long-term EBIT margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive outstanding results throughout 2021 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Additionally, we delivered another q",354,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, we delivered 22% revenue growth driven by sustained strong consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another quarter of very strong EBIT margin, driven by volume growth and the disciplined execution of our go-to-market actions and the previously announced cost-based price increases that were fully in place as we exited the quarter. Demand for our products remains high as we continue to produce in a constrained environment that we now expect to persist throughout 2021. Lastly, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model. 
Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Double-digit growth in all key countries drove a fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 10% in the region. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $97 million, led by increased revenue and strong cost takeout overcoming inflationary pressures. These results demonstrate the progress we are making towards our long-term goals. 
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our second quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 76%, led by strong demand across Brazil and Mexico and the continued growth of our direct-to-consumer business. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 9.7% and with continued robust demand and the execution of cost-based price actions, offsetting inflation and currency devaluation. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'll review our second quarter results for our Asia region. In Asia, revenue decline of 1% reflects the successful partial tender offer for our Whirlpool China business, which was completed in May. Additionally, as COVID cases surged in India, we were yet again faced with shutdowns, significantly impacting the industry. However, in June, as we exited the quarter, we began to see demand recover. Despite this disruption, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT growth of $23 million, led by pricing and cost productivity actions. 
Turning to Slide 12, Marc and I will discuss our revised full year 2021 guidance. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and volatile we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs. We are raising our guidance and are now expecting to drive net sales growth of approximately 16% and EBIT margin of 10.5-plus percent. Additionally, we now expect to deliver $1.7 billion in free cash flow or 7.5% of net sales driven by higher earnings and the completed divestitures. Excluding the impact of divestitures, we expect to deliver on our long-term goal of free cash flow at 6% of net sales. Finally, we are significantly raising our EPS guidance to approximately $26, a year-over-year increase of over 40%. 
Turning to Slide 13, we show the drivers of our revised EBIT margin guidance. We continue to expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven at price and mix as we demonstrate the disciplined execution of our go-to-market strategy and capture the benefits of our previously announced cost-based pricing actions. We have increased our expectation for net cost to 175 basis points as we realized further efficiencies from higher revenues and strong cost takeout initiative. 
As we closely monitor cost inflation globally, particularly in steel and resins, we continue to expect our business to be negatively impacted by about $1 billion with the peak increases to materialize in the third quarter. Increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, are expected to impact margin by 125 basis points. Overall, based on our track record, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate this uncertain environment and deliver 10.5-plus percent EBIT margin, representing our fourth consecutive year of margin expansion. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to highlight our regional industry and EBIT margin expectations."

Turning to Slide 14, we show our updated industry and regional EBIT guidance for the year. We have increased our North America industry expectation to 10-plus percent to reflect the continued demand strength. We continue to expect to see demand strength driven from broader home nesting trends and an undersupplied housing market. Additionally, we have updated the EBIT guidance of our North America region to reflect the benefits of increased cost efficiencies which are more than offsetting increased costs from logistics, labor and operational inefficiencies of producing in a heavily constrained environment. This brings our EBIT guidance for North America to approximately 17%. 
Lastly, we continue to expect to deliver strong growth and significant EBIT expansion across our international regions with each region contributing to our global EBIT margin of 10.5-plus percent. 
Turning to Slide 15, we will discuss the drivers of our updated 2021 free cash flow. We now expect to drive free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of $450 million. Driven by expectations for stronger top line growth and improved EBIT margins, we increased our cash earnings guidance by $250 million. Next, we have reflected the benefit from the divestitures completed in the quarter. This represents free cash flow generation of 7.5% of sales, delivering above our long-term goal of 6%. 
Turning to Slide 16. We provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. We continue to expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future. This includes industry-leading externally recognized innovation such as our newly launched 2-in-1 removable agitator in our top load laundry machine in North America, and the launch of new products in EMEA, such as our new built-in refrigerator, which is recognized as the quietest built-in fridge in the marketplace. Next, with a clear focus on returning strong levels of cash to shareholders and a signal of our confidence in the business, we expect to increase our rate of share repurchases in the second half of 2021 to at or above $300 million. Lastly, we repaid a $300 million maturing bond and issued our inaugural sustainability bond focusing on actions to drive positive environmental and social impacts. This milestone further advances our global sustainability strategy and reflects our core philosophy that sound corporate citizenship and environmental performance are good for business and underscores our leadership position in our industry as we continue our constant pursuit of improving life at home.

You will probably also ask who was the beneficiary. It's still largely similar to what we've seen in Q1. Chinese-based production is a little bit less constrained than call it the Americas, and to some extent, Europe, and that's still the beneficiary. And as you know, we largely produced in MES, what we sell MES. 
Having said that, going forward, sequentially, we do expect to gradually increase our shares. I'm saying gradually because the supply chain constraints will not immediately disappear.

So I would say we saw that in -- it's still bad news, but we recognized that earlier probably than most.

And at this point, we certainly can't exclude that they will beat that number easily and to be very transparent. So and again, these markets are a little bit more volatile than some of the North American or European markets. But right now, you have out right now, we have strong momentum -- There is a little bit more caution going forward because we're also comping some pretty big numbers in all transparency. But by now, so far, we've seen strength out of both Brazil and Mexico with some plus and minus. So long and short, there could be an upside revision on that guidance, volume guidance for Latin America. 
Our next question comes from the line of David McGregor from Longbow Research."

So first, let me zoom before we talk about M&A capital allocation. Our capital allocation policy and guidance is unchanged. And by the way, that's why we included in all clarity on every earnings call in the presentation. So first priority is always fund the business. We are investing capital slightly more than the prior 2 years. Part of that is capacity expansion, part of that is new product, so that takes a little bit. -- We also know, as in April, we increased dividends from ninth consecutive year, and that should be also capital allocation priority going forward and will be. And we kind of -- we refinanced it, we didn't pay down massive debt, and right now, we have a pretty healthy cash balance, which then obviously leads the question what do you do with the additional capacity, which we have, one. And Jim alluded to this one earlier in his prepared remarks, is we are kind of -- the second half will be higher on the share buybacks than the first half. Jim mentioned a number of 300 million plus. We can debate about how big the plus will be. But that's -- right now, we just consider our company both on past performance and performance which we guide to and what we consider our long-range plan, it our companies a good investment, and that's why we're dialing up with share buybacks. 
And M&A is -- we always said it's certainly, by definition, opportunistic. We have certain targets on our list but we started it to be available, and they also need to be available at a justifiable price, which is not always a given. Obviously, this is the wrong forum to talk about some immediate M&A, and there's nothing imminent to be clear. But I would just say a strong balance sheet gives you optionality, and that's a good thing, and that's a situation we're in, but we're -- this optionality will not make us unnecessarily trigger happy. So we'll be very prudent in how we take certain capital allocation decisions."

So I can't speak for our competitors. I can speak for ourselves. We -- as I mentioned before, we did recognize the significant inflationary pressures coming at us probably early by [indiscernible], okay? As a consequence, we had to make the decisions, which we ultimately communicated. If you have this cost coming at you, you can mitigate it, you have to raise prices. That's a decision which we've taken already early in the year, and we communicated. And consequently, we basically raised prices in most parts of the world, but also obviously in Europe, not only one, but in some cases, even price. So we -- and the good thing is what we communicated, we implemented and we start seeing the benefits. To be clear, not yet all of that because some of that will fully materialize in Q3. But what we communicated, we implemented. So again, if you would look at whatever reliable market data you have, either in Europe and other parts of the world, you probably would come to the conclusion that we're a little bit ahead of the competition just facing that reality. Now with regard to the long-term margin development, I would say Europe is exactly where we wanted to have it from a turnaround plan. We said this year will be around 2.5% operating margin. And we also indicated next year, you should probably expect around 4%, and that's just consistent with our trajectory, which we forecast for Europe, and I'm pleased that they're delivering despite all the ins and outs, which we have on inflation and everything else. So I feel very good about where we are from a long-term turnaround and the long-term value creation scenario for Europe, and it's right now consistent with what we communicated to you a couple of quarters ago."

But were there any different tools that you kind of deployed to understand that? Or what gave you that confidence to assume steel prices? Or what are your insights, I guess, it's led to your proper thinking early? And the implication of that into FY '22 because if you said raw material pricing is not going to peak until the third quarter, as I look out into our FY '22 estimate, it seems logical to assume that you'll have quite a bit of this pricing still in. How should we think about that, those 2 components of raw material and the price you pursued to get it?"

You're also right in this steel is just a big part of our cost base, and that's where we saw a significant portion of the raw material, not everything because it was on resins and logistic costs, but a significant portion. To answer your question about how did you know? I mean, it basically comes back to data and experience, okay? It's not that we started buying steel this year. We've done that for about 109 or 110 years. So we know steel, very good experience, but we also have a lot of data. We have -- we know the cost model by steel mill everywhere, we know what our contracts are, we know how they're running. But having said that, the steel market is always -- there's a spot element to it, there's a structural element. So you still got to take several actions into account. And it will our abilities will still always include some surprises. But right now, I think our steel market right now, this is pretty much where we unfortunately forecasted it would be."

I guess just stepping back, given the -- obviously, sales went up in North America, supply constraints are more persistent. So if you could just kind of address why you think that the supply constraints have remained? Is it just a function of higher demand? And then as it relates to your margin, which I think historically, you guys have talked about 15% incremental on revenue, it's obviously higher, which I assume is a direct connection of higher demand, tight supply, i.e., low promotional activities because you guys were looking more for a 14% margin in the back half which are now higher? Could you talk to your view, if that's the proper logic, that margins were up because of lower promotions and demand. If you see that normalizing really into next year, just so we have a little better steps of that thinking right now as it relates to promotional activity and that supply constraint"

And the first 1 is more why we think the supply constraints will last and what the source of that is. The supply constraints are fundamentally driven by similar elements as we've seen in prior quarters, with now a slightly different emphasis on 1 item in particular. Fundamentally, talk about 3 issues, labor shortages, broader component shortages because other suppliers also have labor shortages, other issues in the factory. And thirdly, very specifically what either resins because of the Texas storm and semiconductors. These are the fundamental sources. Now in the first quarter, it was predominantly broader components, labor shortage and resins. In the second quarter, we saw more and more of a semiconductor, while some of the other sources kind of got less and less. Having said that, all of that will be around us for some time. I think the labor shortages are increasingly manageable. I think the other component shortage get less. But the semiconductor challenges will not go away anytime soon. I think you may see that well into 2022. And again, it's difficult to forecast, but that's not going to go away short term. 
Now which leads me then to the broader comment. And many of you have commented or asked about the new normal or normalized or whatever you want to call it. And I think the 2 messages which I really want to pass on is, one is whatever the new normal is, it will happen a lot later than most people assume. We always understand what everybody hopes for a new normal to be next quarter, it's not going to be. So this environment in which we are right now successfully operating will be around us for a lot longer than most people assume. Two, in our specific case, and I hope you have seen this one our new normal will look very different from a previous normal because we've taken structural fixed cost actions, consumer preference has shifted certain business models around e-commerce have changed our new normal will be not comparable to the pre-COVID normal. So I know that was a broader comment, but I think it's important to make that point here."

Additionally, within there, as we look at some of the other costs that have increased, while we've increased some of our cost-saving initiatives, when you look year-over-year in the back half of the year, you do have other things such as labor costs and transportation costs that still do provide a little bit of a headwind from that perspective.

Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. 
Before we begin, I want to remind you that as we conduct this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements to assist you in better understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-Q and other periodic reports. 
We also want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. 
Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. [Operator Instructions]
With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc."

While lessened, disruptions",399,"Thanks, Korey, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our second quarter results, I'd like to acknowledge that we are comparing to a period in which the world was experiencing a greater step of disruption from COVID-19. While lessened, disruptions from the pandemic do, in fact, remain along with volatile industry dynamics and numerous global supply chain constraints. Having said that, our impressive results throughout this entire period, and again in Q2, demonstrates the strong execution of our global teams and the resiliency of our business model. 
Now turning to our second quarter highlights on Slide 4. We delivered very strong revenue growth of 32% year-over-year which also represents growth above 2019 levels, driven by robust and sustained consumer demand and the execution of our pricing actions. Next, our decisive response plan to address volatile industry dynamics and broad supply constraints delivered ongoing EPS of $6.64, a $4.57 improvement year-over-year; ongoing EBIT margin of 11.4%, a year-over-year improvement of 640 basis points, overcoming 400 basis points of cost inflation. Additionally, we generated positive free cash flow of $769 million led by strong earnings and the successful completion of a partial tender offer of our Whirlpool China business and the divestiture of our Turkey subsidiary. 
These global results were driven by substantial EBIT growth and margin expansion across every region. The execution of these actions and the sustained consumer demand delivered very strong Q2 results and give us the confidence to significantly raise our guidance to approximately $26 per share. 
Turning to Slide 5, we show the drivers of our second quarter EBIT margin. Price and mix delivered 600 basis points of margin expansion, driven by reduced promotions and the further implementation of previously announced cost-based pricing actions. Additionally, structural cost takeout actions, higher volumes and ongoing cost productivity initiatives delivered 550 basis points of net cost margin improvement. These margin benefits were partially offset by raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, which resulted in an unfavorable impact of 400 basis points. 
Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and the continued impact from currency in Latin America impacted margin by a combined 100 basis points. Overall, we are very pleased to be delivering even above our long-term EBIT margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive outstanding results throughout 2021 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results."

Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, we delivered 22% revenue growth driven by sustained strong consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another q",353,"Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review our second quarter regional results. In North America, we delivered 22% revenue growth driven by sustained strong consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another quarter of very strong EBIT margin, driven by volume growth and the disciplined execution of our go-to-market actions and the previously announced cost-based price increases that were fully in place as we exited the quarter. 
Demand for our products remains high as we continue to produce in a constrained environment that we now expect to persist throughout 2021. Lastly, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model. 
Turning to Slide 8, I'll review our second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Double-digit growth in all key countries drove a fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 10% in the region. Additionally, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT improvement of $97 million, led by increased revenue and strong cost takeout overcoming inflationary pressures. These results demonstrate the progress we are making towards our long-term goals. 
Turning to Slide 9, I'll review our second quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased 76%, led by strong demand across Brazil and Mexico and the continued growth of our direct-to-consumer business. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 9.7%, with continued robust demand and the execution of cost-based price actions offsetting inflation and currency devaluation. 
Turning to Slide 10. I'll review our second quarter results for our Asia region. In Asia, revenue decline of 1% reflects the successful partial tender offer for our Whirlpool China business, which was completed in May. Additionally, as COVID cases surged in India, we were yet again faced with shutdowns, significantly impacting the industry. However, in June, as we exited the quarter, we began to see demand recover. Despite this disruption, the region delivered year-over-year EBIT growth of $23 million, led by pricing and cost productivity actions. 
Turning to Slide 12, Marc and I will discuss our revised full year 2021 guidance. I will now turn it over to Marc to begin."

While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and volatile, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising",305,"Thanks, Jim. While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and volatile, we are confident that sustained strong consumer demand and our previously announced cost-based pricing actions will offset the impact of global supply constraints and rising input costs. We are raising our guidance and are now expecting to drive net sales growth of approximately 16% and EBIT margin of 10.5-plus percent. Additionally, we now expect to deliver $1.7 billion in free cash flow or 7.5% of net sales driven by higher earnings and the completed divestitures. Excluding the impact of divestitures, we expect to deliver on our long-term goal of free cash flow at 6% of net sales. Finally, we are significantly raising our EPS guidance to approximately $26, a year-over-year increase of over 40%. 
Turning to Slide 13, we show the drivers of our revised EBIT margin guidance. We continue to expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven at price and mix as we demonstrate the disciplined execution of our go-to-market strategy and capture the benefits of our previously announced cost-based pricing actions. We have increased our expectation for net cost to 175 basis points as we realized further efficiencies from higher revenues and strong cost takeout initiative. 
As we closely monitor cost inflation globally, particularly in steel and resins, we continue to expect our business to be negatively impacted by about $1 billion with peak increases to materialize in the third quarter. Increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, are expected to impact margin by 125 basis points. 
Overall, based on our track record, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate this uncertain environment and deliver 10.5-plus percent EBIT margin, representing our fourth consecutive year of margin expansion. 
Now I'll turn it over to Jim to highlight our regional industry and EBIT margin expectations."

Turning to Slide 14, we show our updated industry and regional EBIT guidance for the year. We have increased our North America industry expectation to 10-plus percent to reflect the continued demand strength. We continue to expect to see demand strength driven from broader home nesting trends and an undersupplied housing market. 
Additionally, we have updated the EBIT guidance of our North America region to reflect the benefits of increased cost efficiencies which are more than offsetting increased costs from logistics, labor and operational inefficiencies of producing in a heavily constrained environment. This brings our EBIT guidance for North America to approximately 17%. 
Lastly, we continue to expect to deliver strong growth and significant EBIT expansion across our international regions with each region contributing to our global EBIT margin of 10.5-plus percent. 
Turning to Slide 15, we will discuss the drivers of our updated 2021 free cash flow. We now expect to drive free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of $450 million. Driven by expectations for stronger top line growth and improved EBIT margins, we increased our cash earnings guidance by $250 million. 
Next, we have reflected the benefit from the divestitures completed in the quarter. This represents free cash flow generation of 7.5% of sales, delivering above our long-term goal of 6%. 
Turning to Slide 16. We provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. We continue to expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development, highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future. This includes industry-leading externally recognized innovation such as our newly launched 2-in-1 removable agitator in our top load laundry machine in North America, and the launch of new products in EMEA, such as our new built-in refrigerator, which is recognized as the quietest built-in fridge in the marketplace. 
Next, with a clear focus on returning strong levels of cash to shareholders and a signal of our confidence in the business, we expect to increase our rate of share repurchases in the second half of 2021 to at or above $300 million. 
Lastly, we repaid a $300 million maturing bond and issued our inaugural sustainability bond, focusing on actions to drive positive environmental and social impacts. This milestone further advances our global sustainability strategy and reflects our core philosophy that sound corporate citizenship and environmental performance are good for business and underscores our leadership position in our industry as we continue our constant pursuit of improving life at home. 
Now on Slide 17, I'll turn it back over to Marc to summarize our key messages."

So I think what you basically state here is, on a sequential basis, we were not able to further improve our market share in Q2 in North America, which ultimately comes entirely back to supply chain constraints, which we discussed and which we talked about. You will probably also ask who was the beneficiary. It's still largely similar to what we've seen in Q1. Chinese-based production is a little bit less constrained than, call it the Americas, and to some extent, Europe, and that's still the beneficiary. And as you know, we largely produce in U.S., what we sell in U.S.
Having said that, going forward, sequentially, we do expect to gradually increase our shares. I'm saying gradually because the supply chain constraints will not immediately disappear. They gradually get better. But we will be fundamentally faced with the supply constraint for some quarters to come. Now again, every quarter becoming slightly better."

And think about, typically, on an annual basis, we target between 50 to 150 basis points of incremental cost reduction. 
And so what we're seeing right now as we improved our guidance for the year is, one, we see some of the programs that we implemented last year as well as early this year are delivering more we expected. And then the second thing that we're seeing on that is we did identify some of the -- but there's no one large opportunity, it's just multiple opportunities that have delivered more than we expected.

Outside of the U.S., we feel pretty good about also market share performance in Q2. So we picked up slightly market share in Europe. We're very solid in South America and India. We also have a really strong market share position. So it's predominantly U.S. production constraints, which kind of didn't allow us to further expand our market share in Q2. In the long term, we've got to do both. We've got to deliver strong financial performance while expanding our market share. And we're confident we can do that. 
Having said that, I think what you particularly hold us accountable is the revenue growth. And revenue growth is not always unit market share because there's -- it's our business model and how we explore it, there are multiple opportunities to get additional revenues beyond the pure unit growth. And that's particularly what you need to focus on. And that's why I also feel very good about what we guided this year with $22.5 billion, which is a very, very strong organic growth, no matter where you come from.

On the other hand, I think we got the reading right already in Q1. But and you see that because we didn't have to further change it. So I would say we saw that in -- it's still bad news, but we recognized that earlier probably than most. 
And two, the recognition that this whole, what I call this upside down work with constraints everywhere will last a lot longer than probably everybody was hoping for. Now I think the best thing is we recognized that earlier. We adjusted our actions, we took strong actions.

But as Marc would have talked about earlier from a supply chain perspective in the U.S., we're still trying to catch up. And we would expect to continue to build small amounts of inventory go forward."

So first, let me zoom out before we talk about M&A capital allocation. Our capital allocation policy and guidance is unchanged. And by the way, that's why we included in all clarity on every earnings call in the presentation. So first priority is always fund the business.
We are investing capital slightly more than the prior 2 years. Part of that is capacity expansion, part of that is new product, so that takes a little bit. We also know, in April, we increased dividends for the ninth consecutive year, and that should be also capital allocation priority going forward and it will be. And we kind of -- we refinanced it, we didn't pay down massive debt, and right now, we have a pretty healthy cash balance, which then obviously leaves the question, what do you do with the additional capacity, which we have, one. 
And Jim alluded to this one earlier in his prepared remarks, is we are kind of -- the second half will be higher on the share buybacks than the first half. Jim mentioned a number of 300 million plus. We can debate about how big the plus will be. But that's -- right now, we just consider our company both on past performance and performance which we guide to and what we consider our long-range plan, it's -- our companies is a good investment, and that's why we're dialing up with share buybacks. 
And M&A is -- we always said it's certainly, by definition, opportunistic. We have certain targets on our list but these targets need to be available, and they also need to be available at a justifiable price, which is not always a given. Obviously, this is the wrong forum to talk about some immediate M&A, and there's nothing imminent to be clear. But I would just say a strong balance sheet gives you optionality, and that's a good thing, and that's a situation that we're in, but we're -- this optionality will not make us unnecessarily trigger-happy. So we'll be very prudent in how we take certain capital allocation decisions."

So I can't speak for our competitors. I can speak for ourselves. We -- as I mentioned before, we did recognize the significant inflationary pressures coming at us probably early than everyone, okay? As a consequence, we had to make the decisions, which we ultimately communicated. If you have this cost coming at you, you can't mitigate it, you have to raise prices. That's a decision which we've taken already early in the year, and we communicated. 
And consequently, we basically raised prices in most parts of the world, but also obviously in Europe, not only once, but in some cases, even twice. So we -- and the good thing is what we communicated, we implemented and we start seeing the benefits. To be clear, not yet all of that because some of that will fully materialize in Q3. But what we communicated, we implemented. So again, if you would look at whatever reliable market data you have, either in Europe or in other parts of the world, you probably would come to the conclusion that we're a little bit ahead of the competition just facing that reality. 
Now with regards to the long-term margin development, I would say Europe is exactly where we wanted to have it from a turnaround plan. We said this year will be around 2.5% operating margin. And we also indicated next year, you should probably expect around 4%, and that's just consistent with our trajectory, which we forecast for Europe, and I'm pleased that they're delivering despite all the ins and outs, which we have on inflation and everything else. 
So I feel very good about where we are from a long-term turnaround and the long-term value creation scenario for Europe, and it's right now consistent with what we communicated to you a couple of quarters ago."

But were there any different tools that you kind of deployed to understand that? Or what gave you that confidence to assume steel prices? Or what are your insights, I guess? It's what led to your proper thinking early.
And the implication of that into FY '22, because you said that raw material pricing is not going to peak until the third quarter, as I look out into our FY '22 estimate, it seems logical to assume that you'll have quite a bit of this pricing still in. How should we think about that, those 2 components of raw material and the price you pursued to get it?"

So first of all, on raw material and steel specifically, I mean in all transparency, compared to what we thought last year, November, we would be -- we were somewhat surprised by the magnitude of raw material increase.

You're also right in this steel, it's just a big part of our cost base, and that's where we saw a significant portion of the raw material, not everything because we also saw on resins and logistic costs, but a significant portion. 
To answer your question about how did you know? I mean it basically comes back to data and experience, okay? It's not that we started buying steel this year. We've done that for about 109 or 110 years. 
So we know steel by experience, but we also have a lot of data. We have -- we know the cost model by steel mill everywhere, we know what our contracts are, we know how they're running. But having said that, the steel market is always -- there's a spot element to it, there's a structural element. So you've still got to take several actions into account. And it will -- despite our abilities, will still always include some surprises.

I guess just stepping back, given the -- obviously, sales went up in North America, supply constraints are more persistent.

And then as that relates to your margin, which I think historically, you guys have talked about 15% incremental on revenue, it's obviously higher, which I assume is a direct connection of higher demand, tight supply, i.e., low promotional activities. Because you guys were looking more for a 14% margin in the back half, which are now higher. 
Could you talk to your view, if that's the proper logic, that margins were up because of lower promotions and demand, if you see that normalizing really into next year?

And the first one is more why we think the supply constraints will last and what the source of that is. The supply constraints are fundamentally driven by similar elements as we've seen in prior quarters, so it's now a slightly different emphasis on 1 item in particular. 
Fundamentally, talk about 3 issues: Labor shortages, broader component shortages because other suppliers also have labor shortages, other issues in the factory. And thirdly, very specifically was either resins because of the Texas storm and semiconductors. These are the fundamental sources. Now in the first quarter, it was predominantly broader components, labor shortage and resins. In the second quarter, we saw more and more of a semiconductor, while some of the other sources kind of got less and less. 
Having said that, all of that will be around us for some time. I think the labor shortages are increasingly manageable. I think the other component shortage get less. But the semiconductor challenges will not go away anytime soon. I think you may see that well into 2022. And again, it's difficult to forecast, but that's not going to go away short term. 
Now which leads me then to the broader comment. And many of you have commented or asked about the new normal or normalized or whatever you want to call it. And I think the 2 messages which I really want to pass on is, one is whatever the new normal is, it will happen a lot later than most people assume. We always -- I understand that everybody hopes for a new normal to be next quarter, it's not going to be. So this environment in which we are right now successfully operating will be around us for a lot longer than most people assume. 
Two, in our specific case, and I hope you have seen this one, our new normal will look very different from the previous normal because we've taken structural fixed cost actions, consumer preference has shifted, certain business models around e-commerce have changed. Our new normal will be not comparable to the pre-COVID normal. I know that was a broader comment, but I think it's important to make that point here."

So I don't think you're necessarily missing anything. It's just the timing of material cost increases begin to come in. And that's what we expect for the full year.

Now when you get into the back half of this year, the factories were up and running at full speed during that time period. So you're not getting necessarily the volume leverage benefits year-over-year that you would have seen before. 
Additionally, within there, as we look at some of the other costs that have increased, while we've increased some of our cost-saving initiatives, when you look year-over-year in the back half of the year, you do have other things such as labor costs and transportation costs that still do provide a little bit of a headwind from that perspective.

So let me maybe just wrap up here, given that we're kind of coming to the end of the questions. First of all, I appreciate you all joining. Good questions. And obviously, we're available for follow-up. I just want to recap, as you've seen, we had truly outstanding results in Q2 as we had truly outstanding results in the prior quarters, and we're guiding towards outstanding results in the back half of the year. So we feel very good about where we are from financial performance. 
As evidenced by your questions, we're living in what I call an upside down world. And I think that will be around us for some time to come. But I think we absolutely have demonstrated we are able and capable to perform very successfully in this upside down environment, which ultimately, it's a testimony of our agility, but also the resilience of our business model. 
So we feel very good where we are. We feel very good about our future. And looking forward to talk to you either next earnings call or in between. Thanks a lot."

We anticipate that in the third quarter, we would face both a constrained supply chain alongside elevated inflation. The exceptional execution of the actions we put in place and the sustained robust consumer demand delivered yet another quarter of very strong results. We delivered revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, which represents growth of 8% compared to 2019. 
Next, the decisive actions we took early this year delivered strong double-digit margins of 11.1%, which largely offset the expected cost inflation of 650 basis points. 
Additionally, we generated positive adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion, a $1.1 billion increase compared to a year ago. Cash generation was led by strong earnings and the successful completion of divestitures in the first half of the year. 
Lastly, we opportunistically executed $441 million in share buybacks in the third quarter and added to our previous investments in Elica India by acquiring the majority interest in the company. 
Our ability to successfully deliver strong results in a difficult operating environment gives us the confidence to increase our guidance to approximately $26.25 per share. 
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of our third quarter EBIT margin. Raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, resulted in an unfavorable impact of 650 basis points. This was fully offset by our combined price mix and net cost actions. Price and mix delivered 600 basis points of margin expansion led by the execution of the previously announced cost-based price increases. Additionally, ongoing cost productivity initiatives delivered 50 basis points of net cost margin improvement. Our ongoing cost initiatives more than offset increased logistics, labor and other supply chain premiums we and many companies are facing. Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and the continued impact from currency in Latin America impacted margins by a combined 75 basis points. Overall, we are very pleased to be delivering above our previous long-term EBIT margin commitment and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive very strong results throughout 2021 and beyond. 
Now turning to Slide 7, I will discuss our revised full year 2021 guidance. We remain confident in both the actions we have put in place to protect margins and in the strong execution capabilities we continue to demonstrate. We expect to drive strong net sales growth of approximately 13% and EBIT margins of 10.8%. Additionally, we continue to expect to deliver $1.7 billion in adjusted free cash flow, or 7.7% of net sales. Finally, we are raising our ongoing EPS guidance to approximately $26.25, a year-over-year increase of over 40%. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show the drivers of our increased ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We continue to expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by price mix. We have increased our expectation for net cost takeout to 200 basis points as we realize further efficiencies and continue to focus on cost productivity. 
Within our net cost results, we are fully offsetting the inefficiencies across the supply chain, notably in distribution and labor. While our expectations remain unchanged, we continuously monitor cost inflation globally, -- largely in steel and resins, and still expect our business to be negatively impacted by about $1 billion, with the peak increase already realized in the third quarter. Inflation is fully offset by our price mix actions. 
We continue to expect increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, to impact margins by 125 basis points. 
Overall, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate in this environment and deliver 10.8% EBIT margin, representing our fourth consecutive year of margin expansion. 
Turning to Slide 9, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. Our commitment to fund innovation and growth remains unchanged as we expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development. 
Next, with a clear focus on returning significant levels of cash to shareholders, we expect to repurchase over $940 million of shares in 2021, which includes over $300 million in the fourth quarter. Including dividends, we expect to return a total of over $1.2 billion to shareholders this year. 
Now I'll turn it over to Joe to review our regional results."

In North America, we delivered 5% revenue growth, with sustained and robust consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another quarter with strong EBIT margin driven by disciplined execution of cost-based price increases. Demand for our products remains high as we operate in a constrained environment which we expect to persist into 2022. Lastly, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model. 
Turning to Slide 12, I'll review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The region delivered stable revenue year-over-year, which represents growth of over 15% compared to 2019. Cost-based price increases partially offset the impact of inflation in the quarter. We remain confident in the actions we have in place. Our long-term turnaround plan for the region remains on track. 
Turning to Slide 13, I'll review our third quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased by 17%, led by cost-based price increases and strong demand across Mexico. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.7% despite supply constraints, inflation and continued negative impact from currency. 
Turning to Slide 14, I'll review our third quarter results for our Asia region. The region's revenue decline was entirely driven by the Whirlpool China divestiture. Excluding this, the region grew by 3% year-over-year or 10% compared to 2019. As expected, the region continued to recover from COVID-related shutdowns experienced in the first half of the year. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.6% driven by cost-based price actions and positive impact from our Whirlpool China divestiture. Lastly, our increased investments in Elica PB India enhances our built-in cooking product offering, strengthens our distribution network and is expected to be margin-accretive to the region. 
Now on Slide 16, I'll turn it back over to Marc to discuss our new long-term value creation goals."

We are a 110-year-old company with a legacy of success and a vision anchored on improving life at home. From our introduction of the first electric ringer washer and first [indiscernible] in early 1900s to our launch of a first French door built-in refrigerator and our leadership in connected appliances today, we relentlessly reinvent ourselves with consumers at the heart of everything we do. These new long-term value creation goals build on our strong foundation, but reflect the fact that we are a very different Whirlpool than 10 years ago, operating in a very different world. 
Today, we are operating in a supply-constrained and inflationary environment, which is negatively impacting most industries across the world, yet we are on track for a year of record performance. In 2020, the world was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, before that, numerous other unforeseen global challenges. We faced many significantly challenging environment, and yet we're on track for our fourth consecutive year of record results. 
We have an agile and resilient business model, which enables us to succeed in any operating environment. Our increased value creation growth demonstrate our confidence in our long-term success and are supported by strong underlying drivers, such as a positive outlook on housing, strong replacement demand and evolving consumer habits. Additionally, our demonstrated value-creating go-to-market approach, lower cost base and compelling innovation pipeline position us for continued success. Our new long-term value-creation goals reflect our confidence in the different Whirlpool in this different world. 
Now turning to Slide 17, you will see that we have exceeded our existing targets. We first introduced these targets in 2017 with a clear focus on value creation and a balanced approach to grow profitably. We've been consistently delivering at or above all of these targets. While we're pleased with our progress, we're not done yet. And turning to Slide 18, I will review our new long-term value creation goals. 
We now expect revenue to grow at the rate of 5% to 6%, almost doubling our previous goal of approximately 3%. 
Next, we are increasing our EBIT margin expectations from approximately 10% to a range of 11% to 12%. This is a level of performance that our business is absolutely capable of achieving. 
Additionally, we expect to continue to convert cash at a high level and have increased our adjusted free cash flow as a percent of net sales from 6% plus to a range of 7% to 8%. 
Lastly, we expect to deliver return on invested capital of 15% to 16%, an increase from our previous target of 12% to 14%. 
We are confident in our future success and achieving these goals will continue to drive significant shareholder return. 
Now turning to Slide 19, I will discuss why we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%. Demand in our industry is segmented by 3 primary purchase drivers: housing, replacement and discretionary. We are entering a period with strong growth catalysts across all 3 categories. 
First, let's begin with new housing construction. Housing remained well below historical and structurally needed levels for over a decade. This is compounded by pent-up demand from millennials that we're only now beginning to see. Lastly, interest rates remain at historically low levels. 
Second, let me discuss replacement. We're entering a period in which the natural replacement cycle will move from a headwind to a tailwind. This is driven by elevated usage rates and a larger installed base of appliances which will need to be replaced. Also, with our installed base of connected appliances, we have clear data on how our consumers are using our products, and they're using them more. For example, consumers are using our connected wall ovens and freestanding ranges twice as often as before COVID. Even more important, with hybrid work models becoming more widespread, we do expect appliance usage levels to remain significantly higher than pre COVID, ultimately driving shorter replacement cycles. 
Third, let's review discretionary purchases. COVID has brought a fundamental reorientation of a consumer towards home which will not just go away. In addition, consumer remains healthy with increased disposable income and more equity in their home, which ultimately drives higher investments in the home. 
To recap, we have strong positive demand trends across all 3 segments. 
Next, turning to Slide 20, I will discuss additional revenue catalysts. During this pandemic, we all witnessed a significant increase in all e-commerce activities which we do not expect to revert back to pre-COVID level. Over the past years, we've built our own global direct-to-consumer business that represents today approximately $1 billion. Our multiyear investment in our strategic digital transformation has been and will continue to deliver growth rates of over 25%. 
Lastly, we continue to enter and expand upon new ecosystems which presents significant new revenue opportunities. This was demonstrated when we entered the consumable detergent segment business with the launch of our ultra-concentrated wash detergent. We offer an end-to-end experience that the consumer can fill his or her detergent for both dispenser and the unit, be alerted when replenishment is needed and order through our app for convenient at-home delivery. This is one of many applications where we have earned the right to win. 
Moving to Slide 21, I would like to address why we're positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and grow profitably. As we exited the Great Recession of 2009 to 2011, we took many difficult actions enabling the low fixed cost position we have today. We removed over $1 billion in costs while reducing our fixed asset base by over 30% in just the last 5 years. 
Next, we have a proven value-creating approach to promotions and a relentless focus on cost and complexity reduction. All of these are evidenced by our continued demonstration of financial success, and we're not done yet. For example, today, we are absorbing significant costs associated with operating in an inflationary environment. 
Lastly, we will continue to prioritize investments to drive innovation and growth. 
Now turning to Slide 22, I will review our adjusted free cash flow and return on invested capital expectations. Large acquisition-related items are behind us. Additionally, a seasonally balanced approach and disciplined working capital management position us to drive higher cash conversion. Next, we will opportunistically seek bolt-on acquisition targets that are EPS-accretive soon after acquisition. And with our significant reduced asset base, we are positioned to continue to deliver strong return on our investments. 
Now turning to Slide 23, let me recap what you heard over the past few minutes. Q3 again impressively demonstrated our ability to operate in a very challenging environment and deliver very strong operating results. Sustained housing market demand and strong operational execution gives us the confidence to increase our ongoing earnings per share to approximately $26.25 while delivering adjusted free cash flow of $1.7 billion. Next, we are unwavering on our commitment to drive strong shareholder value as we expect to deliver record ongoing EPS and return over $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021.  
As we look beyond 2021, we firmly believe we have demonstrated that our business is structurally different and well positioned to, again, build on our record results. 
Lastly, our new long-term value creation goals reflect the fact that we are a different Whirlpool operating in a different world. In early 2022, we plan to hold an Investor Day at which time we look forward to discussing our view of our business in greater depth. 
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

Obviously, an expression of confidence in your ability to continue growing the financial performance of the company, so thanks for that. I wanted to talk about a more immediate condition, being cost inflation. You're dealing with a fairly substantial level now. Inflation looks like it will continue into 2022. Can you just talk about your plans to mitigate the impact to profitability, the extent to which you feel further price increases are achievable to offset that pressure?"

So first of all, on the cost inflation, as you know, we -- ever since our Q1 earnings call, we guided to a significant cost inflation. We put out $1 billion as the cost inflation in April, and that's the same $1 billion which we have today. So probably one of the few companies who kind of didn't change the guidance. We saw it coming, and we're dealing with it. 
In this Q3, also as we expected, we probably saw the highest inflation increase ever year-over-year. I mean 6.5% which is sitting in the Q3 P&L. Frankly, in 22 years, I never had a single [indiscernible] with that kind of inflation. But we dealt with it. And I would say Q3 is certainly a proof point, a strong proof point, that we can deal with exceptionally high inflation. 
So going forward, we don't expect that the inflation will quickly fall off and will be short term. By definition [indiscernible] carry over into next year. But by definition, you will also have pricing carryover into next year. So I would say, as you know, around this time of year, we're not yet giving guidance on inflation for next year, we'll do that in January. But I would rather point to Q3 as a proof point. Even an extreme spike of inflation year-over-year like you had in Q3, we're dealing with it without even a blip on our margin. So I'm pretty confident that we can deal with the carryover which we will see to some extent from inflation."

But again, if you split in several pieces, it's kind of -- I think if there's anything which we've seen in the last 18 months is basically the consumer, call it the category price elasticity is very little. Typically, what you see in price list is more what you see promotional or cross price elasticity in the store. But the consumer is very limited price elasticity. Actually, in fact, over years, we've been running consumer research where we ask consumers before they enter the store, how much do you expect to pay versus what we actually paid. And they consistently overestimate how much we have to pay. So I think it's just the nature of an infrequent purchase that the consumer awareness of the exact price point is somewhat limited. 
On top of that, let's not also forget the disposable income in households is right now probably at an all-time high. So I think from that perspective, I'm less concerned. Will, at one point, promotional pressure in the market will get a little bit bigger? Yes. But right now, we're not seeing it in the current environment. And as long as the broader global supply chain constraints will exist, I think you will see very little pressure from that perspective."

When we saw a significant drop in volumes around the globe and significant disruption, our overall margins for that quarter only dropped to 5%. If you look at our North America business, it was actually 12% during that. So I think that's one beginning a proof point there. 
I think the second thing that we've always pointed to is when we came out of the recessionary period in 2011, 2012, a lot of the improvements we made really brought our overall margins up to that type of point and got our North America margins up to 8% at that time. And we've kept those fixed costs out and taken more out. 
So I think what you saw in a very extreme situation in 2020 proves that we can handle drops in volume as well as we can handle some of the shocks that come with these type of volatile environments."

So Sam, let me maybe first take it and then JOe Liotine, our COO, will kind of add to it.

So Sam, let me maybe first take it and then JOe Liotine, our COO, will kind of add to it. 
So first of all, on the long term, you've seen that beyond establishing a very healthy EBIT margin target in the long term of 11% to 12%, we kind of significantly increased our revenue growth goal to 5% to 6%. That is, as you pointed out, driven by both market demand and market share aspirations. 
The demand -- let me just comment this one, we're exceptionally positive in terms of the outlook going forward on the mid and long term. And that is driven by, as we pointed out earlier, the housing market is a strength, will be a strength. The housing market has been undersupplied for decades. Our position in the builder channel is a very strong one, it's probably been the strongest in 100 years. So we feel good about housing market. 
Replacement, and that's what still many people get a little bit wrong when they look at the market, replacement has been, as we pointed out, has been a headwind in the last couple of years because in a certain way you were cycling or comping against the low sales period of financial crisis. It now starts turning into a tailwind because you're now comping or replacing against the stronger installed years or strong growth years of post-financial crisis. 
On top of that, and I can't stress this enough, this COVID has brought increased appliance usage. So if you want to say so, you have a significantly higher wear and tear, which will further drive replacement cycles. 
And lastly, we're very bullish on the discretionary spend. As I mentioned before, there's high disposable income, consumer reorientation towards the home. 
To put that all together, I think we rarely had the scenario where all 3 demand components point in the right direction. That is the fundamental background of why we feel very good about the demand. 
But beyond this one, yes, we do believe we can further expand our share of that business, not just in North America, around the globe. It is -- and let Joe comment on this one, kind of through existing tools. 
But the other thing which we also pointed out early in the presentation is there's different revenue streams. If you have a D2C business, it gives you a higher revenue per unit. If you have additional revenue sources like the detergent business or other kind of ecosystem revenues, that is additional revenue. So it is going beyond calling the natural or the traditional market share on a unit perspective. Joe?"

In addition, our laundry products in top where we've launched some really fantastic products here just recently in the last quarter or so and those are just getting seeded now and will have the growth trajectory into 2022. Super excited about those and then Marc touched on it. 
There's products in the new areas around detergents. Our Yummly Pro that we just recently launched as well that are just now getting in the marketplace and are essentially new areas of growth for us that we've not really participated in historically. 
So you put that all together with the fundamentals behind demand, we're very optimistic about the overall demand profile."

So we did not make progress on regaining market share in North America, that is correct. Let me give you a little bit of perspective. That has nothing to do with products or new products, as Joe pointed out. Has nothing to do with pricing. It's entirely to do with how much can we dial up production, okay? 
Now also here, to give you a little bit background, we finally produced in Q3 more than in Q3 2020 and more than in Q3 2019. 
Now you wonder why we didn't ship more. Last year Q3, we still were reducing inventory, i.e., we were selling off inventory. And now we -- because we had to rebound the inventory, we started to carefully build back up inventory. Carefully, because we -- we just have to make the logistics flow work. So that explains a little bit different. 
But frankly, yes, we would have liked to dial up production more. We're facing similar constraints, as you hear through the press, it's labor shortage, component shortage and transportation bottlenecks. 
Again, as you can reiterate from production volumes, it's slowly getting better in Q3 and we expect that to also continue to slowly getting better. but it's not going to disappear overnight. So we will carry some of the constraints into next year. But right now, that is still the fundamental constraint against regaining certain market share levels. We feel very confident, and hopefully you heard that from Joe about our product range, which from a price perspective, well positioned. So it's just about how much we can further increase production."

Having said that, we also expect to continue to increase production every quarter.

So I would say that, that, as Marc said earlier, that we kind of -- the guidance we've given is more at the low end. And so -- but we don't see that as a significant mover within there.
I'd say the second thing when you think about where we are from the perspective this year, obviously, if you look at our free cash flow, it's been very strong this year. And with that, we've increased the amount of cash we return to shareholders, whether it be through share buyback or dividends this year. And we have 5 different capital allocation priorities. Now as we look forward, share buyback will continue to be one of those. And especially in an environment right now where we don't have a different strategic purpose for the cash, we would continue to do that. But also some things that we've highlighted in there is we continue to invest or expect to continue to invest higher levels in our business. Especially coming out of this period right now where we haven't been able to implement large product launches in some of our factories, you should see our CapEx picking up along with we will continue to look at opportunistic M&A, things that come along.

As we look at these options, as you can imagine, we have regular reviews with our Board to discuss the capital allocation, which ultimately comes back to where can we create the biggest return for shareholders for each allocated dollar, particularly in the share buyback. The ultimate decision about how attractive a share buyback, it's not a tactical decision. What we basically look at is what is the discounted value of our long-range plan versus market valuation right now for share price? And right now, we do see a fairly significant disconnect between these 2 numbers, and that's why we have, in accordance with our Board, we made the decision to buy back a significant amount of shares.

But I think as you pointed out, more importantly, because a lot of the question came up about the last 5 quarters, margin, can you keep them? That should be the best indication. We have all confidence that we can deliver on these margin levels. 
The real big change, I think is, as we pointed out, is moving our revenue goal from 3% to 5% to 6%. And that is really, I think, the biggest change in this value creation goals where -- and that is simply coming from longer-term strong demand trends.

And so certainly, that world, I think, is still going to be a bit challenged as we look forward across all different factors, labor, could be components, supplier disruptions, whatever it might be. And so I think that is inherent in what we've experienced and what we will expect here in the short term looking forward. 
To the point Jim made a little earlier in terms of our cash flow, there is -- as a consequence of these constraints, we had been a little bit more even throughout the year and less seasonality around either holidays or promotions or even business segments. So I think that has been a consequence of us being even every month as opposed to something else that we've experienced historically. 
How it impacts promotions with retailers? I really can't comment on that. That's really kind of for them to decide. But I would say, generally speaking, that is what we've experienced as a consequence of how we're managing our supply chain and how we're managing our production. And Marc touched on it as well, we are seeing an increase in production quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for us, and that's a positive.

First of all, in terms of how often they look at it. And I just want to repeat what I said in the earlier remarks, we know from our connected appliance, where we have a significant installed base of several hundred thousand units, we know actual usage data, not research, not reported, real usage data. And on freestanding ranges and ovens, we see 2x the usage of pre COVID. On washers, we see 27% higher increased usage rate. So -- and that doesn't go away quickly because the hybrid work, people will spend more time at home. 
So first of all, the consumers will see the product more often and use it more often. Second of all, because of all these nesting trends and investing in the home, consumers care more for about what they invest for home and what kind of products they have in there. So I would strongly argue that, in general terms, you will see high replacement cycles and probably also higher willingness to spend because people are investing in the home."

So you basically tie up a little bit more inventory in transportation than you would do in normal circumstances. And that's, I think, what you would have seen in Q3. But of course, rest assured, we're trying to reduce the backlog of orders which we have as quickly as possible."

And I guess just a quick clarification, and then I have a 3-second question. It seems like your implied fourth quarter guide, which is kind of flattish for total revs, would still suggest in a positive price environment that, that volume dynamic is likely to continue in 4Q. So could you just clarify that? 
But then the second question is more around your confidence in the inflationary environment. This has been such a dynamic environment for every company, as you acknowledged. So just what are you seeing that's giving you the confidence or the visibility in terms of this kind of being the peak as you account?"

And I'd say, Mike, if I start with the first question here and say, when we look at Q4 and all that, as Marc alluded to earlier, we believe that right now, our guidance for the full year is we do believe that that's on the low end of where we'll be.",280,"Yes. And I'd say, Mike, if I start with the first question here and say, when we look at Q4 and all that, as Marc alluded to earlier, we believe that right now, our guidance for the full year is we do believe that that's on the low end of where we'll be. So you take that into Q4 and the assumptions that we have around our ability to produce and get product out of the door continues to increase. And so you can pretty much back into from the guidance we've given on revenues where we expect our sales to be. But as we've said, we expect to continue to see throughput within our factories increase. And then when I look at just the dynamic of the market around us right now and say, okay, with where we are today, obviously we've done a very good job of understanding what the cost environment was going to do and offsetting that with cost-based price increases throughout the year. And as we look forward, and I think Marc alluded to this earlier, we do see some carryover benefits that still will continue to come. 
I think the other thing that I'd point to more historically even within our business and our ability to handle some of these dynamics, if you look back to like the 2018, '19 time frame, we also had cost increases within that and many of them were driven by tariffs, which we were able to offset with cost-based pricing back then. 
So again, the trends that we see right now, we believe we're taking the right actions to offset and we expect to continue to do that."

But again, I want to repeat what I said earlier, we basically saw that coming. We gave in April the inflation outlook, which probably many people perceived as, ""Oh, that's pessimistic."" But it turned out to be true, so I think we were pretty accurate in our reading of the broader markets, commodity markets and also the short-term markets. 
So -- and as such, probably that's also the prime reason why this Q3, which had a pretty brutal year-over-year increase of inflation, [ 6.5 ] points, but it didn't leave a dent in our bottom up. And that's, I would say, is pretty remarkable. 
So being able to read inflation outlook a little bit earlier than others helps you just deal with it earlier. And then I think we've demonstrated it in Q3. 
As it comes to next year, as I mentioned before, of course, there will be carryover. But there will be also a carryover from pricing, and I would again use Q3 as a proof point. We are able to operate in a pretty challenging dynamic environment, and we will continue to do so."

When you look at our North America business, what it indicates is that we believe that, that business will stay at above a 15% EBIT margin type of range right now. And so we feel very good about where we are. Remember, our previous guidance was 13% plus for that. So we do believe we've made a step change in the profitability within North America. But a big driver that you shouldn't discount here is that the international, our businesses outside the U.S., will continue to expand margin."

As you move forward, is the accelerated revenue growth representing mostly confidence in faster market growth? Or does that imply a different performance focused commitment to market share?"

Having sai",499,"So let me just take this one. First of all, to already answer the second part of your question, I think it primarily demonstrates confidence in the market outlook because of the market demand, we just view it as very strong as it were before. 
Having said that and stepping back a little bit, it's couple of years ago when we were operating at 6% or 7% EBIT margin, if you just look at the pure financials, how you create economic value for the company, you know you have a higher lever on the margin expansion compared to revenue growth. We are operating on different levels. If you take the North America business, operating at 17% or 18%, by definition, if you just look at basic value creation, you can create even more value, economic value, if you drive the growth. So it all depends -- I wouldn't call it a shift. It just depends on where you are kind of in your margin progression and where you have going forward the highest lever for economic value creation. 
That picture, of course, is slightly different in Europe. In Europe, we will continue to drive a margin expansion very hard because we're not yet done with our turnaround. And again, it depends on the respective region where we are in the business, and that's where we kind of -- depending where we are, have a particular focus on margin expansion or revenue expansion. 
But again, the overriding theme is we're highly confident on a very strong market demand in the near and long term. 
So with that, I think we're coming to the end of this Q&A session. First of all, I appreciate everybody calling in, dialing in. There was a lot of material to absorb today because it was more than the earnings call, it was also about the long-term value creation goals, and I appreciate a lot of questions about these long-term value creation goals. 
And again, I just want to reiterate what I said both on the call. This is now after Q2 last year with 5 exceptionally strong quarters. But it's not just the 5 quarters, this is year #4 where we have year-after-year all-time record performance. And I think I think you would all agree, it was not particularly easy trading environment, no smooth sailing, but we delivered. In a certain way, you can almost say, well, give us a rough environment, we'll perform well. And I think that's the confidence you should also see going forward. We're not kind of planning or expecting that it's all going to be nice next year. It will continue to be challenging. But every quarter from this proof point, we have an agile organization, we have an agile business model and we can deal with what comes and we can perform exceptionally well in these circumstances. 
With that in mind, I thank you all for calling in, and wish you all a nice Friday and a nice weekend."

We anticipate that in the third quarter, we would face both a constrained supply chain alongside elevated inflation. The exceptional execution of the actions we put in place and the sustained robust consumer demand delivered yet another quarter of very strong results. We delivered revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, which represents growth of 8% compared to 2019. 
Next, the decisive actions we took early this year delivered strong double-digit margins of 11.1%, which largely offset the expected cost inflation of 650 basis points.  
Additionally, we generated positive adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion, a $1.1 billion increase compared to a year ago. Cash generation was led by strong earnings and the successful completion of divestitures in the first half of the year.  
Lastly, we opportunistically executed $441 million in share buybacks in the third quarter and added to our previous investments in Elica India by acquiring the majority interest in the company.  
Our ability to successfully deliver strong results in a difficult operating environment gives us the confidence to increase our guidance to approximately $26.25 per share. 
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of our third quarter EBIT margin. Raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, resulted in an unfavorable impact of 650 basis points. This was fully offset by our combined price mix and net cost actions. Price and mix delivered 600 basis points of margin expansion led by the execution of the previously announced cost-based price increases. Additionally, ongoing cost productivity initiatives delivered 50 basis points of net cost margin improvement. Our ongoing cost initiatives more than offset increased logistics, labor and other supply chain premiums we and many companies are facing. Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and the continued impact from currency in Latin America impacted margins by a combined 75 basis points. Overall, we are very pleased to be delivering above our previous long-term EBIT margin commitments and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive very strong results throughout 2021 and beyond.
Now turning to Slide 7, I will discuss our revised full year 2021 guidance. We remain confident in both the actions we have put in place to protect margins and in the strong execution capabilities we continue to demonstrate. We expect to drive strong net sales growth of approximately 13% and EBIT margins of 10.8%. Additionally, we continue to expect to deliver $1.7 billion in adjusted free cash flow, or 7.7% of net sales. Finally, we are raising our ongoing EPS guidance to approximately $26.25, a year-over-year increase of over 40%. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show the drivers of our increased ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We continue to expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by price mix. We have increased our expectation for net cost takeout to 200 basis points as we realize further efficiencies and continue to focus on cost productivity.  
Within our net cost results, we are fully offsetting the inefficiencies across the supply chain, notably in distribution and labor. While our expectations remain unchanged, we continuously monitor cost inflation globally, -- largely in steel and resins, and still expect our business to be negatively impacted by about $1 billion, with the peak increase already realized in the third quarter. Inflation is fully offset by our price mix actions. 
We continue to expect increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, to impact margins by 125 basis points.  
Overall, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate in this environment and deliver 10.8% EBIT margin, representing our fourth consecutive year of margin expansion.  
Turning to Slide 9. we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. Our commitment to fund innovation and growth remains unchanged as we expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development.  
Next, with a clear focus on returning significant levels of cash to shareholders, we expect to repurchase over $940 million of shares in 2021, which includes over $300 million in the fourth quarter. Including dividends, we expect to return a total of over $1.2 billion to shareholders this year.  
Now I'll turn it over to Joe to review our regional results."

In North America, we delivered 5% revenue growth, with sustained and robust consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another quarter with strong EBIT margin driven by disciplined execution of cost-based price increases. Demand for our products remains high as we operate in a constrained environment which we expect to persist into 2022. Lastly, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model.  
Turning to Slide 12, I'll review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The region delivered stable revenue year-over-year, which represents growth of over 15% compared to 2019. Cost-based price increases partially offset the impact of inflation in the quarter. We remain confident in the actions we have in place. Our long-term turnaround plan for the region remains on track.  
Turning to Slide 13, I'll review our third quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased by 17%, led by cost-based price increases and strong demand across Mexico. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.7% despite supply constraints, inflation and continued negative impact from currency.  
Turning to Slide 14, I'll review our third quarter results for our Asia region. The region's revenue decline was entirely driven by the Whirlpool China divestiture. Excluding this, the region grew by 3% year-over-year or 10% compared to 2019. As expected, the region continued to recover from COVID-related shutdowns experienced in the first half of the year. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.6% driven by cost-based price actions and positive impact from our Whirlpool China divestiture. Lastly, our increased investments in Elica PB India enhances our built-in cooking product offering, strengthens our distribution network and is expected to be margin-accretive to the region. 
Now on Slide 16, I'll turn it back over to Marc to discuss our new long-term value creation goals."

We are a 110-year-old company with a legacy of success and a vision anchored on improving life at home. From our introduction of the first electric wringer-washer and first                  in early 1900s to our launch of a first French door built-in refrigerator and our leadership in connected appliances today.  We relentlessly reinvent ourselves with consumers at the heart of everything we do. These new long-term value creation goals build on our strong foundation, but reflect the fact that we are a very different Whirlpool than 10 years ago, operating in a very different world.
Today, we are operating in a supply-constrained and inflationary environment, which is negatively impacting most industries across the world. Yet, we are on track for a year of record performance.  
In 2020, the world was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, before that, numerous other unforeseen global challenges. We faced many significantly challenging environment, and yet we're on track for our fourth consecutive year of record results.  
We have an agile and resilient business model, which enables us to succeed in any operating environment. Our increased value creation growth demonstrate our confidence in our long-term success and are supported by strong underlying drivers, such as a positive outlook on housing, strong replacement demand and evolving consumer habits. Additionally, our demonstrated value-creating go-to-market approach, lower cost base and compelling innovation pipeline position us for continued success. Our new long-term value-creation goals reflect our confidence in the different Whirlpool in this different world.  
Now turning to Slide 17, you will see that we have exceeded our existing targets. We first introduced these targets in 2017 with a clear focus on value creation and a balanced approach to grow profitably. We've been consistently delivering at or above all of these targets. While we're pleased with our progress, we're not done yet. And turning to Slide 18, I will review our new long-term value creation goals.  
We now expect revenue to grow at the rate of 5% to 6%, almost doubling our previous goal of approximately 3%. Next, we are increasing our EBIT margin expectations from approximately 10% to a range of 11% to 12%. This is a level of performance that our business is absolutely capable of achieving.  
Additionally, we expect to continue to convert cash at a high level and have increased our adjusted free cash flow as a percent of net sales from 6% plus to a range of 7% to 8%.  
Lastly, we expect to deliver return on invested capital of 15% to 16%, an increase from our previous target of 12% to 14%.  
We are confident in our future success and that achieving these goals will continue to drive significant shareholder return.  
Now turning to Slide 19, I will discuss why we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%. Demand in our industry is segmented by 3 primary purchase drivers: housing, replacement and discretionary. We are entering a period with strong growth catalysts across all 3 categories.  
First, let's begin with new housing construction. Housing remained well below historical and structurally needed levels for over a decade. This is compounded by pent-up demand from millennials that we're only now beginning to see. Lastly, interest rates remain at historically low levels.  
Second, let me discuss replacement. We're entering a period in which the natural replacement cycle will move from a headwind to a tailwind. This is driven by elevated usage rates and a larger installed base of appliances which will need to be replaced. Also, with our installed base of connected appliances, we have clear data on how our consumers are using our products, and they're using them more. For example, consumers are using our connected wall ovens and freestanding ranges twice as often as before COVID. Even more important, with hybrid work models becoming more widespread, we do expect appliance usage levels to remain significantly higher than pre-COVID, ultimately driving shorter replacement cycles.
Third, let's review discretionary purchases. COVID has brought a fundamental reorientation of a consumer towards home which will not just go away. In addition, consumer remains healthy with increased disposable income and more equity in their home, which ultimately drives higher investments in the home. 
To recap, we have strong positive demand trends across all 3 segments. 
Next, turning to Slide 20, I will discuss additional revenue catalysts. During this pandemic, we all witnessed a significant increase in all e-commerce activities which we do not expect to revert back to pre-COVID level. Over the past years, we've built our own Whirlpool direct-to-consumer business that represents today approximately $1 billion. Our multiyear investment in our strategic digital transformation has been and will continue to deliver growth rates of over 25%. 
Lastly, we continue to enter and expand upon new ecosystems, which presents significant new revenue opportunities. This was demonstrated when we entered the consumable detergent segment business with the launch of our ultra-concentrated wash detergent. We offer an end-to-end experience that the consumer can fill his or her detergent for both dispenser in the unit, be alerted when replenishment is needed and order through our app for convenient at-home delivery. This is one of many applications where we have earned the right to win. 
Moving to Slide 21, I would like to address why we're positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and grow profitably. As we exited the Great Recession of 2009 to 2011, we took many difficult actions enabling the low fixed cost position we have today. We removed over $1 billion in costs while reducing our fixed asset base by over 30% in just the last 5 years. 
Next, we have a proven value-creating approach to promotions and a relentless focus on cost and complexity reduction. All of these are evidenced by our continued demonstration of financial success, and we're not done yet. For example, today, we are absorbing significant costs associated with operating in an inflationary environment. 
Lastly, we will continue to prioritize investments to drive innovation and growth. 
Now turning to Slide 22, I will review our adjusted free cash flow and return on invested capital expectations. Large acquisition-related items are behind us. Additionally, a seasonally balanced approach and disciplined working capital management position us to drive higher cash conversion. Next, we will opportunistically seek bolt-on acquisition targets that are EPS-accretive soon after acquisition. And with our significant reduced asset base, we are positioned to continue to deliver strong return on our investments. 
Now turning to Slide 23, let me recap what you heard over the past few minutes. Q3 again impressively demonstrated our ability to operate in a very challenging environment and deliver very strong operating results. Sustained housing market demand and strong operational execution gives us the confidence to increase our ongoing earnings per share to approximately $26.25 while delivering adjusted free cash flow of $1.7 billion. Next, we are unwavering on our commitment to drive strong shareholder value as we expect to deliver record ongoing EPS and return over $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021.  
As we look beyond 2021, we firmly believe we have demonstrated that our business is structurally different and well positioned to, again, build on our record results. 
Lastly, our new long-term value creation goals reflect the fact that we are a different Whirlpool operating in a different world. In early 2022, we plan to hold an Investor Day at which time we look forward to discussing our view of our business in greater depth. 
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

Obviously, an expression of confidence in your ability to continue growing the financial performance of the company, so thanks for that. I wanted to talk about a more immediate condition, being cost inflation. You're dealing with a fairly substantial level now. Inflation looks like it will continue into 2022. Can you just talk about your plans to mitigate the impact to profitability, the extent to which you feel further price increases are achievable to offset that pressure?"

So first of all, on the cost inflation, as you know, we -- ever since our Q1 earnings call, we guided to a significant cost inflation. We put out $1 billion as the cost inflation in April, and that's the same $1 billion which we have today. So probably one of the few companies who kind of didn't change the guidance. We saw it coming, and we're dealing with it. 
In this Q3, also as we expected, we probably saw the highest inflation increase ever year-over-year. I mean 6.5% which is sitting in the Q3 P&L. Frankly, in 22 years, I never had to [indiscernible] with that kind of inflation. But we dealt with it. And I would say Q3 is certainly a proof point, a strong proof point, that we can deal with exceptionally high inflation. 
So going forward, we don't expect that the inflation will quickly fall off and will be short term. By definition there is carry over into next year. But by definition, you will also have pricing carryover into next year. So I would say, as you know, around this time of year, we're not yet giving guidance on inflation for next year, we'll do that in January. But I would rather point to Q3 as a proof point. Even an extreme spike of inflation year-over-year like you had in Q3, we're dealing with it without even a blip on our margin. So I'm pretty confident that we can deal with the carryover which we will see to some extent from inflation."

But again, if you split in several pieces, it's kind of -- I think if there's anything which we've seen in the last 18 months is basically the consumer, call it the category price elasticity is very little. Typically, what you see in price list is more what you see promotional or cross price elasticity in the store. But with consumer, there is very limited price elasticity. Actually, in fact, over years, we've been running consumer research where we ask consumers before they enter the store, how much do you expect to pay versus what we actually paid. And they consistently overestimate how much we have to pay. So I think it's just the nature of an infrequent purchase that the consumer awareness of the exact price point is somewhat limited. 
On top of that, let's not also forget the disposable income in households is right now probably at an all-time high. So I think from that perspective, I'm less concerned. Will, at one point, promotional pressure in the market will get a little bit bigger? Yes. But right now, we're not seeing it in the current environment. And as long as the broader global supply chain constraints will exist, I think you will see very little pressure from that perspective."

And I think you can take the second quarter of 2020 as really a good benchmark out there. When we saw a significant drop in volumes around the globe and significant disruption, our overall margins for that quarter only dropped to 5%. If you look at our North America business, it was actually 12% during that. So I think that's one beginning a proof point there. 
I think the second thing that we've always pointed to is when we came out of the recessionary period in 2011, 2012, a lot of the improvements we made really brought our overall margins up to that type of point and got our North America margins up to 8% at that time. And we've kept those fixed costs out and taken more out. 
So I think what you saw in a very extreme situation in 2020 proves that we can handle drops in volume as well as we can handle some of the shocks that come with these type of volatile environments."

So Sam, let me maybe first take it and then Joe Liotine, our COO, will kind of add to it.

So Sam, let me maybe first take it and then Joe Liotine, our COO, will kind of add to it. 
So first of all, on the long term, you've seen that beyond establishing a very healthy EBIT margin target in the long term of 11% to 12%, we kind of significantly increased our revenue growth goal to 5% to 6%. That is, as you pointed out, driven by both market demand and market share aspirations. 
The demand -- let me just comment this one, we're exceptionally positive in terms of the outlook going forward on the mid and long term. And that is driven by, as we pointed out earlier, the housing market is a strength, will be a strength. The housing market has been undersupplied for decades. Our position in the builder channel is a very strong one, it's probably been the strongest in 100 years. So we feel good about housing market. 
Replacement, and that's what still many people get a little bit wrong when they look at the market, replacement has been, as we pointed out, has been a headwind in the last couple of years because in a certain way you were cycling or comping against the low sales period of financial crisis. It now starts turning into a tailwind because you're now comping or replacing against the stronger installed years or strong growth years of post-financial crisis. 
On top of that, and I can't stress this enough, this COVID has brought increased appliance usage. So if you want to say so, you have a significantly higher wear and tear, which will further drive replacement cycles. 
And lastly, we're very bullish on the discretionary spend. As I mentioned before, there's high disposable income, consumer reorientation towards the home. 
To put that all together, I think we rarely had the scenario where all 3 demand components point in the right direction. That is the fundamental background of why we feel very good about the demand. 
But beyond this one, yes, we do believe we can further expand our share of that business, not just in North America, around the globe. It is -- and let Joe comment on this one --  kind of through existing tools. 
But the other thing which we also pointed out early in the presentation is there's different revenue streams. If you have a D2C business, it gives you a higher revenue per unit. If you have additional revenue sources like the detergent business or other kind of ecosystem revenues, that is additional revenue. So it is going beyond calling the natural or the traditional market share on a unit perspective. Joe?"

So we did not make progress on regaining market share in North America, that is correct. Let me give you a little bit of perspective. That has nothing to do with products or new products, as Joe pointed out. Has nothing to do with pricing. It's entirely to do with how much can we dial up production, okay? 
Now also here, to give you a little bit background, we finally produced in Q3 more than in Q3 2020 and more than in Q3 2019. 
Now you wonder why we didn't ship more. Last year Q3, we still were reducing inventory, i.e., we were selling off inventory. And now we -- because we had to rebound the inventory, we started to carefully build back up inventory. Carefully, because we -- we just have to make the logistics flow work. So that explains a little bit different. 
But frankly, yes, we would have liked to dial up production more. We're facing similar constraints, as you hear through the press, it's labor shortage, component shortage and transportation bottlenecks. 
Again, as you can read from production volumes, it's slowly getting better in Q3 and we expect that to also continue to slowly getting better. but it's not going to disappear overnight. So we will carry some of the constraints into next year. But right now, that is still the fundamental constraint against regaining certain market share levels. We feel very confident, and hopefully you heard that from Joe about our product range, which from a price perspective, well positioned. So it's just about how much we can further increase production."

I'd say the second thing when you think about where we are from the perspective this year, obviously, if you look at our free cash flow, it's been very strong this year. And with that, we've increased the amount of cash we return to shareholders, whether it be through share buyback or dividends this year. And we have 5 different capital allocation priorities. Now as we look forward, share buyback will continue to be one of those. And especially in an environment right now where we don't have a different strategic purpose for the cash, we would continue to do that. But also some things that we've highlighted in there as we continue to invest or expect to continue to invest higher levels in our business. Especially coming out of this period right now where we haven't been able to implement large product launches in some of our factories, you should see our CapEx picking up along with, we will continue to look at opportunistic M&A, things that come along.

The ultimate decision about how attractive a share buyback, it's not a tactical decision. What we basically look at is what is the discounted value of our long-range plan versus market valuation right now for share price? And right now, we do see a fairly significant disconnect between these 2 numbers, and that's why we have, in accordance with our Board, we made the decision to buy back a significant amount of shares.

The real big change, I think is, as we pointed out, is moving our revenue goal from 3% to 5% to 6%. And that is really, I think, the biggest change in this value creation goals where -- and that is simply coming from longer-term strong demand trends. 
And again, trying to stay away from time lines, but I would see the 5% to 6% growth numbers you should see earlier, because we do see that demand strength both on short, mid and long term."

Maybe you don't have the Black Friday events. That's my first question."

Yes. So from a supply constraint standpoint, I mean if we just zoom out a little bit and go back to what we've experienced over the last 18 months, I mean we have had many different events throughout the last 18 months, we've shown a very good ability to deal with them, although not always perfectly, but I would say deal with them successfully. And so certainly, that world, I think, is still going to be a bit challenged as we look forward across all different factors, labor, could be components, supplier disruptions, whatever it might be. And so I think that is inherent in what we've experienced and what we will expect here in the short term looking forward. 
To the point Jim made a little earlier in terms of our cash flow, there is -- as a consequence of these constraints, we had been a little bit more even throughout the year and less seasonality around either holidays or promotions or even business segments. So I think that has been a consequence of us being even every month as opposed to something else that we've experienced historically. 
How it impacts promotions with retailers? I really can't comment on that. That's really kind of for them to decide. But I would say, generally speaking, that is what we've experienced as a consequence of how we're managing our supply chain and how we're managing our production. And Marc touched on it as well, we are seeing an increase in production quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for us, and that's a positive. But certainly, it doesn't relieve everything completely from the equation."

First of all, in terms of how often they look at it. And I just want to repeat what I said in the earlier remarks, we know from our connected appliance, where we have a significant installed base of several hundred thousand units, we know actual usage data, not research, not reported, real usage data. And on freestanding ranges and ovens, we see 2x the usage of pre COVID. On washers, we see 27% higher increased usage rate. So -- and that doesn't go away quickly because the hybrid work, people will spend more time at home. 
So first of all, the consumers will see the product more often and use it more often. Second of all, because of all these nesting trends and investing in the home, consumers care more for about what they invest for home and what kind of products they have in there. So I would strongly argue that, in general terms, you will see high replacement cycles and probably also higher willingness to spend because people are investing in the home."

Ken, in terms of discretionary and remodel, essentially, a lot of these favorable trends that Marc alluded to, you know, the nesting, being at home, using your appliances more, has really resulted in consumers caring more about that experience. And that caring more results in them wanting to invest in those spaces, customize those spaces, really get exactly what they want to meet their family's needs. And so we generally see that as a favorable trend in this space in terms of their remodels and likely even suites and ensuring that they have all the right features and functionality. So we don't have perfect data here, but I would say the general trend and the sentiment is one that improves that position for us and makes consumers really want to invest more time and money to get exactly what they need for their family. And so I think we're going to continue to experience that here in the midterm. To Marc's point, people are still going to remain in a hybrid environment here, and so that's going to only bolster that position."

So I think you would see more and more consumers who are absolutely from, call it the household balance sheet capable of buying a home, just being frustrated about home prices or the lack of availability, who may shift some of these investments into, let's remodel the kitchen instead. So I would not be surprised if you see more and more of that happening going forward. And we've seen that in prior periods. 
So I think the segment of what we call the discretionary whole kitchen remodel, I think, will be an attractive segment going forward.

First of all, when you look in particular -- and I think your question refers to the U.S. market, the U.S. market, you have -- obviously, we have a large factory distribution and regional distribution center, but you also need to have smaller distribution centers down the field from, which you serve particular builder channel, the direct-to-consumer business, but also many of the home improvement centers. So as we reduced inventory last year, it basically came a particular expense for smaller distribution centers which basically ultimately translate into consumer service. So we had to rebalance some of them inventory, call it, downstream in order to better service consumer and reduce some of these wait times. 
Now couple that with transportation from one coast to another is just getting slower these days. It's just what it is. So you basically tie up a little bit more inventory in transportation than you would do in normal circumstances. And that's, I think, what you would have seen in Q3.

And I'd say, Mike, if I start with the first question here and say, when we look at Q4 and all that, as Marc alluded to earlier, we believe that right now, our guidance for the full year is we do believe that that's on the low end of where we'll be. So you take that into Q4 and the assumptions that we have around our ability to produce and get product out of the door continues to increase. And so you can pretty much back into from the guidance we've given on revenues where we expect our sales to be. But as we've said, we expect to continue to see throughput within our factories increase. And then when I look at just the dynamic of the market around us right now and say, okay. With where we are today, obviously we've done a very good job of understanding what the cost environment was going to do and offsetting that with cost-based price increases throughout the year. And as we look forward, and I think Marc alluded to this earlier, we do see some carryover benefits that still will continue to come. 
I think the other thing that I'd point to more historically even within our business and our ability to handle some of these dynamics, if you look back to like the 2018, '19 time frame, we also had cost increases within that and many of them were driven by tariffs, which we were able to offset with cost-based pricing back then. 
So again, the trends that we see right now, we believe we're taking the right actions to offset and we expect to continue to do that."

But again, I want to repeat what I said earlier, we basically saw that coming. We gave in April the inflation outlook, which probably many people perceived as, ""Oh, that's pessimistic."" But it turned out to be true, so I think we were pretty accurate in our reading of the broader markets, commodity markets and also the short-term markets. 
So -- and as such, probably that's also the prime reason why this Q3, which had a pretty brutal year-over-year increase of inflation of 6.5 points, but it didn't leave a dent in our bottom line. And that's, I would say, is pretty remarkable. 
So being able to read inflation outlook a little bit earlier than others helps you just deal with it earlier. And then I think we've demonstrated it in Q3. 
As it comes to next year, as I mentioned before, of course, there will be carryover. But there will be also a carryover from pricing, and I would again use Q3 as a proof point. We are able to operate in a pretty challenging dynamic environment, and we will continue to do so."

When you look at our North America business, what it indicates is that we believe that, that business will stay at above a 15% EBIT margin type of range right now. And so we feel very good about where we are. Remember, our previous guidance was 13% plus for that. So we do believe we've made a step change in the profitability within North America.

First of all, to already answer the second part of your question, I think it primarily demonstrates confidence in the market outlook. Because of the market demand, we just view it as very strong as it were before. 
Having said that and stepping back a little bit, it's couple of years ago when we were operating at 6% or 7% EBIT margin, if you just look at the pure financials, how you create economic value for the company, you know you have a higher lever on the margin expansion compared to revenue growth. We are operating on different levels. If you take the North America business, operating at 17% or 18%, by definition, if you just look at basic value creation, you can create even more value, economic value, if you drive the growth. So it all depends -- I wouldn't call it a shift. It just depends on where you are kind of in your margin progression and where you have going forward the highest lever for economic value creation. 
That picture, of course, is slightly different in Europe. In Europe, we will continue to drive a margin expansion very hard because we're not yet done with our turnaround. And again, it depends on the respective region where we are in the business, and that's where we kind of -- depending where we are, have a particular focus on margin expansion or revenue expansion. 
But again, the overriding theme is we're highly confident on a very strong market demand in the near and long term. 
So with that, I think we're coming to the end of this Q&A session. First of all, I appreciate everybody calling in, dialing in. There was a lot of material to absorb today because it was more than the earnings call, it was also about the long-term value creation goals, and I appreciate a lot of questions about these long-term value creation goals. 
And again, I just want to reiterate what I said both on the call. This is now after Q2 last year with 5 exceptionally strong quarters. But it's not just the 5 quarters, this is year #4 where we have year-after-year all-time record performance. And I think I think you would all agree, it was not particularly easy trading environment, no smooth sailing, but we delivered. In a certain way, you can almost say, well, give us a rough environment, we'll perform well. And I think that's the confidence you should also see going forward. We're not kind of planning or expecting that it's all going to be nice next year. It will continue to be challenging. But every quarter from this proof point, we have an agile organization, we have an agile business model and we can deal with what comes and we can perform exceptionally well in these circumstances.

We anticipate that in the third quarter, we would face both a constrained supply chain alongside elevated inflation. The exceptional execution of the actions we put in place and the sustained robust consumer demand delivered yet another quarter of very strong results. We delivered revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, which represents growth of 8% compared to 2019. 
Next, the decisive actions we took early this year delivered strong double-digit margins of 11.1%, which largely offset the expected cost inflation of 650 basis points.  
Additionally, we generated positive adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion, a $1.1 billion increase compared to a year ago. Cash generation was led by strong earnings and the successful completion of divestitures in the first half of the year.  
Lastly, we opportunistically executed $441 million in share buybacks in the third quarter and added to our previous investments in Elica India by acquiring the majority interest in the company.  
Our ability to successfully deliver strong results in a difficult operating environment gives us the confidence to increase our guidance to approximately $26.25 per share. 
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of our third quarter EBIT margin. Raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, resulted in an unfavorable impact of 650 basis points. This was fully offset by our combined price mix and net cost actions. Price and mix delivered 600 basis points of margin expansion led by the execution of the previously announced cost-based price increases. Additionally, ongoing cost productivity initiatives delivered 50 basis points of net cost margin improvement. Our ongoing cost initiatives more than offset increased logistics, labor and other supply chain premiums we and many companies are facing. Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and the continued impact from currency in Latin America impacted margins by a combined 75 basis points. Overall, we are very pleased to be delivering above our previous long-term EBIT margin commitments and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive very strong results throughout 2021 and beyond.
Now turning to Slide 7, I will discuss our revised full year 2021 guidance. We remain confident in both the actions we have put in place to protect margins and in the strong execution capabilities we continue to demonstrate. We expect to drive strong net sales growth of approximately 13% and EBIT margins of 10.8%. Additionally, we continue to expect to deliver $1.7 billion in adjusted free cash flow, or 7.7% of net sales. Finally, we are raising our ongoing EPS guidance to approximately $26.25, a year-over-year increase of over 40%. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show the drivers of our increased ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We continue to expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by price mix. We have increased our expectation for net cost takeout to 200 basis points as we realize further efficiencies and continue to focus on cost productivity.  
Within our net cost results, we are fully offsetting the inefficiencies across the supply chain, notably in distribution and labor. While our expectations remain unchanged, we continuously monitor cost inflation globally, -- largely in steel and resins, and still expect our business to be negatively impacted by about $1 billion, with the peak increase already realized in the third quarter. Inflation is fully offset by our price mix actions. 
We continue to expect increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, to impact margins by 125 basis points.  
Overall, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate in this environment and deliver 10.8% EBIT margin, representing our fourth consecutive year of margin expansion.  
Turning to Slide 9. we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. Our commitment to fund innovation and growth remains unchanged as we expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development.  
Next, with a clear focus on returning significant levels of cash to shareholders, we expect to repurchase over $940 million of shares in 2021, which includes over $300 million in the fourth quarter. Including dividends, we expect to return a total of over $1.2 billion to shareholders this year.  
Now I'll turn it over to Joe to review our regional results."

In North America, we delivered 5% revenue growth, with sustained and robust consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another quarter with strong EBIT margin driven by disciplined execution of cost-based price increases. Demand for our products remains high as we operate in a constrained environment which we expect to persist into 2022. Lastly, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model.  
Turning to Slide 12, I'll review our third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The region delivered stable revenue year-over-year, which represents growth of over 15% compared to 2019. Cost-based price increases partially offset the impact of inflation in the quarter. We remain confident in the actions we have in place. Our long-term turnaround plan for the region remains on track.  
Turning to Slide 13, I'll review our third quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased by 17%, led by cost-based price increases and strong demand across Mexico. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.7% despite supply constraints, inflation and continued negative impact from currency.  
Turning to Slide 14, I'll review our third quarter results for our Asia region. The region's revenue decline was entirely driven by the Whirlpool China divestiture. Excluding this, the region grew by 3% year-over-year or 10% compared to 2019. As expected, the region continued to recover from COVID-related shutdowns experienced in the first half of the year. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.6% driven by cost-based price actions and positive impact from our Whirlpool China divestiture. Lastly, our increased investments in Elica PB India enhances our built-in cooking product offering, strengthens our distribution network and is expected to be margin-accretive to the region. 
Now on Slide 16, I'll turn it back over to Marc to discuss our new long-term value creation goals."

We are a 110-year-old company with a legacy of success and a vision anchored on improving life at home. From our introduction of the first electric wringer-washer and first                  in early 1900s to our launch of a first French door built-in refrigerator and our leadership in connected appliances today.  We relentlessly reinvent ourselves with consumers at the heart of everything we do. These new long-term value creation goals build on our strong foundation, but reflect the fact that we are a very different Whirlpool than 10 years ago, operating in a very different world.
Today, we are operating in a supply-constrained and inflationary environment, which is negatively impacting most industries across the world. Yet, we are on track for a year of record performance.  
In 2020, the world was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, before that, numerous other unforeseen global challenges. We faced many significantly challenging environment, and yet we're on track for our fourth consecutive year of record results.  
We have an agile and resilient business model, which enables us to succeed in any operating environment. Our increased value creation growth demonstrate our confidence in our long-term success and are supported by strong underlying drivers, such as a positive outlook on housing, strong replacement demand and evolving consumer habits. Additionally, our demonstrated value-creating go-to-market approach, lower cost base and compelling innovation pipeline position us for continued success. Our new long-term value-creation goals reflect our confidence in the different Whirlpool in this different world.  
Now turning to Slide 17, you will see that we have exceeded our existing targets. We first introduced these targets in 2017 with a clear focus on value creation and a balanced approach to grow profitably. We've been consistently delivering at or above all of these targets. While we're pleased with our progress, we're not done yet. And turning to Slide 18, I will review our new long-term value creation goals.  
We now expect revenue to grow at the rate of 5% to 6%, almost doubling our previous goal of approximately 3%. Next, we are increasing our EBIT margin expectations from approximately 10% to a range of 11% to 12%. This is a level of performance that our business is absolutely capable of achieving.  
Additionally, we expect to continue to convert cash at a high level and have increased our adjusted free cash flow as a percent of net sales from 6% plus to a range of 7% to 8%.  
Lastly, we expect to deliver return on invested capital of 15% to 16%, an increase from our previous target of 12% to 14%.  
We are confident in our future success and that achieving these goals will continue to drive significant shareholder return.  
Now turning to Slide 19, I will discuss why we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%. Demand in our industry is segmented by 3 primary purchase drivers: housing, replacement and discretionary. We are entering a period with strong growth catalysts across all 3 categories.  
First, let's begin with new housing construction. Housing remained well below historical and structurally needed levels for over a decade. This is compounded by pent-up demand from millennials that we're only now beginning to see. Lastly, interest rates remain at historically low levels.  
Second, let me discuss replacement. We're entering a period in which the natural replacement cycle will move from a headwind to a tailwind. This is driven by elevated usage rates and a larger installed base of appliances which will need to be replaced. Also, with our installed base of connected appliances, we have clear data on how our consumers are using our products, and they're using them more. For example, consumers are using our connected wall ovens and freestanding ranges twice as often as before COVID. Even more important, with hybrid work models becoming more widespread, we do expect appliance usage levels to remain significantly higher than pre-COVID, ultimately driving shorter replacement cycles.
Third, let's review discretionary purchases. COVID has brought a fundamental reorientation of a consumer towards home which will not just go away. In addition, consumer remains healthy with increased disposable income and more equity in their home, which ultimately drives higher investments in the home. 
To recap, we have strong positive demand trends across all 3 segments. 
Next, turning to Slide 20, I will discuss additional revenue catalysts. During this pandemic, we all witnessed a significant increase in all e-commerce activities which we do not expect to revert back to pre-COVID level. Over the past years, we've built our own Whirlpool direct-to-consumer business that represents today approximately $1 billion. Our multiyear investment in our strategic digital transformation has been and will continue to deliver growth rates of over 25%. 
Lastly, we continue to enter and expand upon new ecosystems, which presents significant new revenue opportunities. This was demonstrated when we entered the consumable detergent segment business with the launch of our ultra-concentrated wash detergent. We offer an end-to-end experience that the consumer can fill his or her detergent for both dispenser in the unit, be alerted when replenishment is needed and order through our app for convenient at-home delivery. This is one of many applications where we have earned the right to win. 
Moving to Slide 21, I would like to address why we're positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and grow profitably. As we exited the Great Recession of 2009 to 2011, we took many difficult actions enabling the low fixed cost position we have today. We removed over $1 billion in costs while reducing our fixed asset base by over 30% in just the last 5 years. 
Next, we have a proven value-creating approach to promotions and a relentless focus on cost and complexity reduction. All of these are evidenced by our continued demonstration of financial success, and we're not done yet. For example, today, we are absorbing significant costs associated with operating in an inflationary environment. 
Lastly, we will continue to prioritize investments to drive innovation and growth. 
Now turning to Slide 22, I will review our adjusted free cash flow and return on invested capital expectations. Large acquisition-related items are behind us. Additionally, a seasonally balanced approach and disciplined working capital management position us to drive higher cash conversion. Next, we will opportunistically seek bolt-on acquisition targets that are EPS-accretive soon after acquisition. And with our significant reduced asset base, we are positioned to continue to deliver strong return on our investments. 
Now turning to Slide 23, let me recap what you heard over the past few minutes. Q3 again impressively demonstrated our ability to operate in a very challenging environment and deliver very strong operating results. Sustained housing market demand and strong operational execution gives us the confidence to increase our ongoing earnings per share to approximately $26.25 while delivering adjusted free cash flow of $1.7 billion. Next, we are unwavering on our commitment to drive strong shareholder value as we expect to deliver record ongoing EPS and return over $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021.  
As we look beyond 2021, we firmly believe we have demonstrated that our business is structurally different and well positioned to, again, build on our record results. 
Lastly, our new long-term value creation goals reflect the fact that we are a different Whirlpool operating in a different world. In early 2022, we plan to hold an Investor Day at which time we look forward to discussing our view of our business in greater depth. 
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

Obviously, an expression of confidence in your ability to continue growing the financial performance of the company, so thanks for that. I wanted to talk about a more immediate condition, being cost inflation. You're dealing with a fairly substantial level now. Inflation looks like it will continue into 2022. Can you just talk about your plans to mitigate the impact to profitability, the extent to which you feel further price increases are achievable to offset that pressure?"

So first of all, on the cost inflation, as you know, we -- ever since our Q1 earnings call, we guided to a significant cost inflation. We put out $1 billion as the cost inflation in April, and that's the same $1 billion which we have today. So probably one of the few companies who kind of didn't change the guidance. We saw it coming, and we're dealing with it. 
In this Q3, also as we expected, we probably saw the highest inflation increase ever year-over-year. I mean 6.5% which is sitting in the Q3 P&L. Frankly, in 22 years, I never had to [indiscernible] with that kind of inflation. But we dealt with it. And I would say Q3 is certainly a proof point, a strong proof point, that we can deal with exceptionally high inflation. 
So going forward, we don't expect that the inflation will quickly fall off and will be short term. By definition there is carry over into next year. But by definition, you will also have pricing carryover into next year. So I would say, as you know, around this time of year, we're not yet giving guidance on inflation for next year, we'll do that in January. But I would rather point to Q3 as a proof point. Even an extreme spike of inflation year-over-year like you had in Q3, we're dealing with it without even a blip on our margin. So I'm pretty confident that we can deal with the carryover which we will see to some extent from inflation."

But again, if you split in several pieces, it's kind of -- I think if there's anything which we've seen in the last 18 months is basically the consumer, call it the category price elasticity is very little. Typically, what you see in price list is more what you see promotional or cross price elasticity in the store. But with consumer, there is very limited price elasticity. Actually, in fact, over years, we've been running consumer research where we ask consumers before they enter the store, how much do you expect to pay versus what we actually paid. And they consistently overestimate how much we have to pay. So I think it's just the nature of an infrequent purchase that the consumer awareness of the exact price point is somewhat limited. 
On top of that, let's not also forget the disposable income in households is right now probably at an all-time high. So I think from that perspective, I'm less concerned. Will, at one point, promotional pressure in the market will get a little bit bigger? Yes. But right now, we're not seeing it in the current environment. And as long as the broader global supply chain constraints will exist, I think you will see very little pressure from that perspective."

When we saw a significant drop in volumes around the globe and significant disruption, our overall margins for that quarter only dropped to 5%. If you look at our North America business, it was actually 12% during that. So I think that's one beginning a proof point there. 
I think the second thing that we've always pointed to is when we came out of the recessionary period in 2011, 2012, a lot of the improvements we made really brought our overall margins up to that type of point and got our North America margins up to 8% at that time. And we've kept those fixed costs out and taken more out. 
So I think what you saw in a very extreme situation in 2020 proves that we can handle drops in volume as well as we can handle some of the shocks that come with these type of volatile environments."

So Sam, let me maybe first take it and then Joe Liotine, our COO, will kind of add to it.

So Sam, let me maybe first take it and then Joe Liotine, our COO, will kind of add to it. 
So first of all, on the long term, you've seen that beyond establishing a very healthy EBIT margin target in the long term of 11% to 12%, we kind of significantly increased our revenue growth goal to 5% to 6%. That is, as you pointed out, driven by both market demand and market share aspirations. 
The demand -- let me just comment this one, we're exceptionally positive in terms of the outlook going forward on the mid and long term. And that is driven by, as we pointed out earlier, the housing market is a strength, will be a strength. The housing market has been undersupplied for decades. Our position in the builder channel is a very strong one, it's probably been the strongest in 100 years. So we feel good about housing market. 
Replacement, and that's what still many people get a little bit wrong when they look at the market, replacement has been, as we pointed out, has been a headwind in the last couple of years because in a certain way you were cycling or comping against the low sales period of financial crisis. It now starts turning into a tailwind because you're now comping or replacing against the stronger installed years or strong growth years of post-financial crisis. 
On top of that, and I can't stress this enough, this COVID has brought increased appliance usage. So if you want to say so, you have a significantly higher wear and tear, which will further drive replacement cycles. 
And lastly, we're very bullish on the discretionary spend. As I mentioned before, there's high disposable income, consumer reorientation towards the home. 
To put that all together, I think we rarely had the scenario where all 3 demand components point in the right direction. That is the fundamental background of why we feel very good about the demand. 
But beyond this one, yes, we do believe we can further expand our share of that business, not just in North America, around the globe. It is -- and let Joe comment on this one --  kind of through existing tools. 
But the other thing which we also pointed out early in the presentation is there's different revenue streams. If you have a D2C business, it gives you a higher revenue per unit. If you have additional revenue sources like the detergent business or other kind of ecosystem revenues, that is additional revenue. So it is going beyond calling the natural or the traditional market share on a unit perspective. Joe?"

So we did not make progress on regaining market share in North America, that is correct. Let me give you a little bit of perspective. That has nothing to do with products or new products, as Joe pointed out. Has nothing to do with pricing. It's entirely to do with how much can we dial up production, okay? 
Now also here, to give you a little bit background, we finally produced in Q3 more than in Q3 2020 and more than in Q3 2019. 
Now you wonder why we didn't ship more. Last year Q3, we still were reducing inventory, i.e., we were selling off inventory. And now we -- because we had to rebound the inventory, we started to carefully build back up inventory. Carefully, because we -- we just have to make the logistics flow work. So that explains a little bit different. 
But frankly, yes, we would have liked to dial up production more. We're facing similar constraints, as you hear through the press, it's labor shortage, component shortage and transportation bottlenecks. 
Again, as you can read from production volumes, it's slowly getting better in Q3 and we expect that to also continue to slowly getting better. but it's not going to disappear overnight. So we will carry some of the constraints into next year. But right now, that is still the fundamental constraint against regaining certain market share levels. We feel very confident, and hopefully you heard that from Joe about our product range, which from a price perspective, well positioned. So it's just about how much we can further increase production."

Having said that, we also expect to continue to increase production every quarter. Now it's not going to dramatically increase, and that's very simply driven by the shortage in constraints, which we're all well aware of. But we continue to expect to increase production. And even against a continuous increase of demand, we should be sequentially able to regain some market share. But it's not going to be a dramatic shift overnight because, very simple, just you can't produce enough."

So I would say that, that, as Marc said earlier, that we kind of -- the guidance we've given is more at the low end. And so -- but we don't see that as a significant mover within there.
I'd say the second thing when you think about where we are from the perspective this year, obviously, if you look at our free cash flow, it's been very strong this year. And with that, we've increased the amount of cash we return to shareholders, whether it be through share buyback or dividends this year. And we have 5 different capital allocation priorities. Now as we look forward, share buyback will continue to be one of those. And especially in an environment right now where we don't have a different strategic purpose for the cash, we would continue to do that. But also some things that we've highlighted in there as we continue to invest or expect to continue to invest higher levels in our business. Especially coming out of this period right now where we haven't been able to implement large product launches in some of our factories, you should see our CapEx picking up along with, we will continue to look at opportunistic M&A, things that come along. And I think the acquisition we did of the remaining or additional stake in Elica within India is an example of how we balance all those priorities."

As we look at these options, as you can imagine, we have regular reviews with our Board to discuss the capital allocation, which ultimately comes back to where can we create the biggest return for shareholders for each allocated dollar, particularly in the share buyback. The ultimate decision about how attractive a share buyback, it's not a tactical decision. What we basically look at is what is the discounted value of our long-range plan versus market valuation right now for share price? And right now, we do see a fairly significant disconnect between these 2 numbers, and that's why we have, in accordance with our Board, we made the decision to buy back a significant amount of shares.

But I think as you pointed out, more importantly, because a lot of the question came up about the last 5 quarters, margin, can you keep them? That should be the best indication. We have all confidence that we can deliver on these margin levels. 
The real big change, I think is, as we pointed out, is moving our revenue goal from 3% to 5% to 6%. And that is really, I think, the biggest change in this value creation goals where -- and that is simply coming from longer-term strong demand trends.

And so certainly, that world, I think, is still going to be a bit challenged as we look forward across all different factors, labor, could be components, supplier disruptions, whatever it might be. And so I think that is inherent in what we've experienced and what we will expect here in the short term looking forward. 
To the point Jim made a little earlier in terms of our cash flow, there is -- as a consequence of these constraints, we had been a little bit more even throughout the year and less seasonality around either holidays or promotions or even business segments. So I think that has been a consequence of us being even every month as opposed to something else that we've experienced historically. 
How it impacts promotions with retailers? I really can't comment on that. That's really kind of for them to decide. But I would say, generally speaking, that is what we've experienced as a consequence of how we're managing our supply chain and how we're managing our production. And Marc touched on it as well, we are seeing an increase in production quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for us, and that's a positive.

First of all, in terms of how often they look at it. And I just want to repeat what I said in the earlier remarks, we know from our connected appliance, where we have a significant installed base of several hundred thousand units, we know actual usage data, not research, not reported, real usage data. And on freestanding ranges and ovens, we see 2x the usage of pre COVID. On washers, we see 27% higher increased usage rate. So -- and that doesn't go away quickly because the hybrid work, people will spend more time at home. 
So first of all, the consumers will see the product more often and use it more often. Second of all, because of all these nesting trends and investing in the home, consumers care more for about what they invest for home and what kind of products they have in there. So I would strongly argue that, in general terms, you will see high replacement cycles and probably also higher willingness to spend because people are investing in the home."

And so we generally see that as a favorable trend in this space in terms of their remodels and likely even suites and ensuring that they have all the right features and functionality. So we don't have perfect data here, but I would say the general trend and the sentiment is one that improves that position for us and makes consumers really want to invest more time and money to get exactly what they need for their family. And so I think we're going to continue to experience that here in the midterm. To Marc's point, people are still going to remain in a hybrid environment here, and so that's going to only bolster that position."

So I think you would see more and more consumers who are absolutely from, call it the household balance sheet capable of buying a home, just being frustrated about home prices or the lack of availability, who may shift some of these investments into, let's remodel the kitchen instead. So I would not be surprised if you see more and more of that happening going forward. And we've seen that in prior periods.

First of all, when you look in particular -- and I think your question refers to the U.S. market, the U.S. market, you have -- obviously, we have a large factory distribution and regional distribution center, but you also need to have smaller distribution centers down the field from, which you serve particular builder channel, the direct-to-consumer business, but also many of the home improvement centers. So as we reduced inventory last year, it basically came a particular expense for smaller distribution centers which basically ultimately translate into consumer service. So we had to rebalance some of them inventory, call it, downstream in order to better service consumer and reduce some of these wait times. 
Now couple that with transportation from one coast to another is just getting slower these days. It's just what it is. So you basically tie up a little bit more inventory in transportation than you would do in normal circumstances. And that's, I think, what you would have seen in Q3.

So you take that into Q4 and the assumptions that we have around our ability to produce and get product out of the door continues to increase. And so you can pretty much back into from the guidance we've given on revenues where we expect our sales to be. But as we've said, we expect to continue to see throughput within our factories increase. And then when I look at just the dynamic of the market around us right now and say, okay. With where we are today, obviously we've done a very good job of understanding what the cost environment was going to do and offsetting that with cost-based price increases throughout the year. And as we look forward, and I think Marc alluded to this earlier, we do see some carryover benefits that still will continue to come. 
I think the other thing that I'd point to more historically even within our business and our ability to handle some of these dynamics, if you look back to like the 2018, '19 time frame, we also had cost increases within that and many of them were driven by tariffs, which we were able to offset with cost-based pricing back then.

But again, I want to repeat what I said earlier, we basically saw that coming. We gave in April the inflation outlook, which probably many people perceived as, ""Oh, that's pessimistic."" But it turned out to be true, so I think we were pretty accurate in our reading of the broader markets, commodity markets and also the short-term markets. 
So -- and as such, probably that's also the prime reason why this Q3, which had a pretty brutal year-over-year increase of inflation of 6.5 points, but it didn't leave a dent in our bottom line. And that's, I would say, is pretty remarkable. 
So being able to read inflation outlook a little bit earlier than others helps you just deal with it earlier. And then I think we've demonstrated it in Q3. 
As it comes to next year, as I mentioned before, of course, there will be carryover. But there will be also a carryover from pricing, and I would again use Q3 as a proof point. We are able to operate in a pretty challenging dynamic environment, and we will continue to do so."

And we haven't really changed our targets in terms of our goals, in terms of the overall margin profitability there. 
When you look at our North America business, what it indicates is that we believe that, that business will stay at above a 15% EBIT margin type of range right now. And so we feel very good about where we are. Remember, our previous guidance was 13% plus for that. So we do believe we've made a step change in the profitability within North America. But a big driver that you shouldn't discount here is that the international, our businesses outside the U.S., will continue to expand margin."

And you achieved that goal in total, but it felt like there were a few years where you didn't grow 3%.

As you move forward, is the accelerated revenue growth representing mostly confidence in faster market growth? Or does that imply a different performance focused commitment to market share?"

First of all, to already answer the second part of your question, I think it primarily demonstrates confidence in the market outlook. Because of the market demand, we just view it as very strong as it were before. 
Having said that and stepping back a little bit, it's couple of years ago when we were operating at 6% or 7% EBIT margin, if you just look at the pure financials, how you create economic value for the company, you know you have a higher lever on the margin expansion compared to revenue growth. We are operating on different levels. If you take the North America business, operating at 17% or 18%, by definition, if you just look at basic value creation, you can create even more value, economic value, if you drive the growth. So it all depends -- I wouldn't call it a shift. It just depends on where you are kind of in your margin progression and where you have going forward the highest lever for economic value creation. 
That picture, of course, is slightly different in Europe. In Europe, we will continue to drive a margin expansion very hard because we're not yet done with our turnaround. And again, it depends on the respective region where we are in the business, and that's where we kind of -- depending where we are, have a particular focus on margin expansion or revenue expansion. 
But again, the overriding theme is we're highly confident on a very strong market demand in the near and long term. 
So with that, I think we're coming to the end of this Q&A session. First of all, I appreciate everybody calling in, dialing in. There was a lot of material to absorb today because it was more than the earnings call, it was also about the long-term value creation goals, and I appreciate a lot of questions about these long-term value creation goals. 
And again, I just want to reiterate what I said both on the call. This is now after Q2 last year with 5 exceptionally strong quarters. But it's not just the 5 quarters, this is year #4 where we have year-after-year all-time record performance. And I think I think you would all agree, it was not particularly easy trading environment, no smooth sailing, but we delivered. In a certain way, you can almost say, well, give us a rough environment, we'll perform well. And I think that's the confidence you should also see going forward. We're not kind of planning or expecting that it's all going to be nice next year. It will continue to be challenging. But every quarter from this proof point, we have an agile organization, we have an agile business model and we can deal with what comes and we can perform exceptionally well in these circumstances. 
With that in mind, I thank you all for calling in, and wish you all a nice Friday and a nice weekend."

We anticipate that in the third quarter, we would face both a constrained supply chain alongside elevated inflation. The exceptional execution of the actions we put in place and the sustained robust consumer demand delivered yet another quarter of very strong results. We delivered revenue growth of 4% year-over-year, which represents growth of 8% compared to 2019. 
Next, the decisive actions we took early this year delivered strong double-digit margins of 11.1%, which largely offset the expected cost inflation of 650 basis points.  
Additionally, we generated positive adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion, a $1.1 billion increase compared to a year ago. Cash generation was led by strong earnings and the successful completion of divestitures in the first half of the year.  
Lastly, we opportunistically executed $441 million in share buybacks in the third quarter and added to our previous investments in Elica India by acquiring the majority interest in the company.  
Our ability to successfully deliver strong results in a difficult operating environment gives us the confidence to increase our guidance to approximately $26.25 per share. 
Turning to Slide 6, we show the drivers of our third quarter EBIT margin. Raw material inflation, particularly steel and resins, resulted in an unfavorable impact of 650 basis points. This was fully offset by our combined price mix and net cost actions. Price and mix delivered 600 basis points of margin expansion led by the execution of the previously announced cost-based price increases. Additionally, ongoing cost productivity initiatives delivered 50 basis points of net cost margin improvement. Our ongoing cost initiatives more than offset increased logistics, labor and other supply chain premiums we and many companies are facing. Lastly, increased investments in marketing and technology and the continued impact from currency in Latin America impacted margins by a combined 75 basis points. Overall, we are very pleased to be delivering above our previous long-term EBIT margin commitments and are confident this positive momentum will continue to drive very strong results throughout 2021 and beyond.
Now turning to Slide 7, I will discuss our revised full year 2021 guidance. We remain confident in both the actions we have put in place to protect margins and in the strong execution capabilities we continue to demonstrate. We expect to drive strong net sales growth of approximately 13% and EBIT margins of 10.8%. Additionally, we continue to expect to deliver $1.7 billion in adjusted free cash flow, or 7.7% of net sales. Finally, we are raising our ongoing EPS guidance to approximately $26.25, a year-over-year increase of over 40%. 
Turning to Slide 8, we show the drivers of our increased ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We continue to expect 600 basis points of margin expansion driven by price mix. We have increased our expectation for net cost takeout to 200 basis points as we realize further efficiencies and continue to focus on cost productivity.  
Within our net cost results, we are fully offsetting the inefficiencies across the supply chain, notably in distribution and labor. While our expectations remain unchanged, we continuously monitor cost inflation globally, largely in steel and resins, and still expect our business to be negatively impacted by about $1 billion, with the peak increase already realized in the third quarter. Inflation is fully offset by our price mix actions. 
We continue to expect increased investments in marketing and technology and unfavorable currency, primarily in Latin America, to impact margins by 125 basis points.  
Overall, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate in this environment and deliver 10.8% EBIT margin, representing our fourth consecutive year of margin expansion.  
Turning to Slide 9. We provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for 2021. Our commitment to fund innovation and growth remains unchanged as we expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development.  
Next, with a clear focus on returning significant levels of cash to shareholders, we expect to repurchase over $940 million of shares in 2021, which includes over $300 million in the fourth quarter. Including dividends, we expect to return a total of over $1.2 billion to shareholders this year.  
Now I'll turn it over to Joe to review our regional results."

In North America, we delivered 5% revenue growth, with sustained and robust consumer demand in the region. Additionally, we delivered another quarter with strong EBIT margin driven by disciplined execution of cost-based price increases. Demand for our products remains high as we operate in a constrained environment which we expect to persist into 2022. Lastly, the region's outstanding results demonstrate the fundamental strength and agility of our business model.  
Turning to Slide 12, I'll review our third-quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The region delivered stable revenue year-over-year, which represents growth of over 15% compared to 2019. Cost-based price increases partially offset the impact of inflation in the quarter. We remain confident in the actions we have in place. Our long-term turnaround plan for the region remains on track.  
Turning to Slide 13, I'll review our third quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales increased by 17%, led by cost-based price increases and strong demand across Mexico. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.7% despite supply constraints, inflation and continued negative impact from currency.  
Turning to Slide 14, I'll review our third quarter results for our Asia region. The region's revenue decline was entirely driven by the Whirlpool China divestiture. Excluding this, the region grew by 3% year-over-year or 10% compared to 2019. As expected, the region continued to recover from COVID-related shutdowns experienced in the first half of the year. The region delivered very strong EBIT margins of 8.6% driven by cost-based price actions and positive impact from our Whirlpool China divestiture. Lastly, our increased investments in Elica PB India enhances our built-in cooking product offering, strengthens our distribution network and is expected to be margin-accretive to the region. 
Now on Slide 16, I'll turn it back over to Marc to discuss our new long-term value creation goals."

We are a 110-year-old company with a legacy of success and a vision anchored on improving life at home. From our introduction of the first electric wringer-washer and first stand mixer in early 1900s to our launch of a first French door built-in refrigerator and our leadership in connected appliances today.  We relentlessly reinvent ourselves with consumers at the heart of everything we do. These new long-term value creation goals build on our strong foundation, but reflect the fact that we are a very different Whirlpool than 10 years ago, operating in a very different world.
Today, we are operating in a supply-constrained and inflationary environment, which is negatively impacting most industries across the world. Yet, we are on track for a year of record performance.  
In 2020, the world was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, before that, numerous other unforeseen global challenges. We faced many significantly challenging environments, and yet we're on track for our fourth consecutive year of record results.  
We have an agile and resilient business model, which enables us to succeed in any operating environment. Our increased value creation growth demonstrate our confidence in our long-term success and are supported by strong underlying drivers, such as a positive outlook on housing, strong replacement demand and evolving consumer habits. Additionally, our demonstrated value-creating go-to-market approach, lower cost base and compelling innovation pipeline position us for continued success. Our new long-term value-creation goals reflect our confidence in the different Whirlpool in this different world.  
Now turning to Slide 17, you will see that we have exceeded our existing targets. We first introduced these targets in 2017 with a clear focus on value creation and a balanced approach to grow profitably. We've been consistently delivering at or above all of these targets. While we're pleased with our progress, we're not done yet. And turning to Slide 18, I will review our new long-term value creation goals.  
We now expect revenue to grow at a rate of 5% to 6%, almost doubling our previous goal of approximately 3%. Next, we are increasing our EBIT margin expectations from approximately 10% to a range of 11% to 12%. This is a level of performance that our business is absolutely capable of achieving.  
Additionally, we expect to continue to convert cash at a high level and have increased our adjusted free cash flow as a percent of net sales from 6% plus to a range of 7% to 8%.  
Lastly, we expect to deliver return on invested capital of 15% to 16%, an increase from our previous target of 12% to 14%.  
We are confident in our future success and that achieving these goals will continue to drive significant shareholder return.  
Now turning to Slide 19, I will discuss why we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%. Demand in our industry is segmented by 3 primary purchase drivers: housing, replacement and discretionary. We are entering a period with strong growth catalysts across all 3 categories.  
First, let's begin with new housing construction. Housing remained well below historical and structurally needed levels for over a decade. This is compounded by pent-up demand from millennials that we're only now beginning to see. Lastly, interest rates remain at historically low levels.  
Second, let me discuss replacement. We're entering a period in which the natural replacement cycle will move from a headwind to a tailwind. This is driven by elevated usage rates and a larger installed base of appliances which will need to be replaced. Also, with our installed base of connected appliances, we have clear data on how our consumers are using our products, and they're using them more. For example, consumers are using our connected wall ovens and freestanding ranges twice as often as before COVID. Even more important, with hybrid work models becoming more widespread, we do expect appliance usage levels to remain significantly higher than pre-COVID, ultimately driving shorter replacement cycles.
Third, let's review discretionary purchases. COVID has brought a fundamental reorientation of a consumer towards home which will not just go away. In addition, consumer remains healthy with increased disposable income and more equity in their home, which ultimately drives higher investments in the home. 
To recap, we have strong positive demand trends across all 3 segments. 
Next, turning to Slide 20, I will discuss additional revenue catalysts. During this pandemic, we all witnessed a significant increase in all e-commerce activities which we do not expect to revert back to pre-COVID level. Over the past years, we've built our own Whirlpool direct-to-consumer business that represents today approximately $1 billion. Our multiyear investment in our strategic digital transformation has been and will continue to deliver growth rates of over 25%. 
Lastly, we continue to enter and expand upon new ecosystems, which presents significant new revenue opportunities. This was demonstrated when we entered the consumable detergent segment business with the launch of our ultra-concentrated wash detergent. We offer an end-to-end experience that the consumer can fill his or her detergent for both dispenser in the unit, be alerted when replenishment is needed and order through our app for convenient at-home delivery. This is one of many applications where we have earned the right to win. 
Moving to Slide 21, I would like to address why we're positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and grow profitably. As we exited the Great Recession of 2009 to 2011, we took many difficult actions enabling the low fixed cost position we have today. We removed over $1 billion in costs while reducing our fixed asset base by over 30% in just the last 5 years. 
Next, we have a proven value-creating approach to promotions and a relentless focus on cost and complexity reduction. All of these are evidenced by our continued demonstration of financial success, and we're not done yet. For example, today, we are absorbing significant costs associated with operating in an inflationary environment. 
Lastly, we will continue to prioritize investments to drive innovation and growth. 
Now turning to Slide 22, I will review our adjusted free cash flow and return on invested capital expectations. Large acquisition-related items are behind us. Additionally, a seasonally balanced approach and disciplined working capital management position us to drive higher cash conversion. Next, we will opportunistically seek bolt-on acquisition targets that are EPS-accretive soon after acquisition. And with our significant reduced asset base, we are positioned to continue to deliver strong return on our investments. 
Now turning to Slide 23, let me recap what you heard over the past few minutes. Q3 again impressively demonstrated our ability to operate in a very challenging environment and deliver very strong operating results. Sustained housing market demand and strong operational execution gives us the confidence to increase our ongoing earnings per share to approximately $26.25 while delivering adjusted free cash flow of $1.7 billion. Next, we are unwavering on our commitment to drive strong shareholder value as we expect to deliver record ongoing EPS and return over $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2021.  
As we look beyond 2021, we firmly believe we have demonstrated that our business is structurally different and well positioned to, again, build on our record results. 
Lastly, our new long-term value creation goals reflect the fact that we are a different Whirlpool operating in a different world. In early 2022, we plan to hold an Investor Day at which time we look forward to discussing our view of our business in greater depth. 
Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions."

Obviously, an expression of confidence in your ability to continue growing the financial performance of the company, so thanks for that. I wanted to talk about a more immediate condition, being cost inflation. You're dealing with a fairly substantial level now. Inflation looks like it will continue into 2022. Can you just talk about your plans to mitigate the impact to profitability, the extent to which you feel further price increases are achievable to offset that pressure?"

So first of all, on the cost inflation, as you know, we -- ever since our Q1 earnings call, we guided to a significant cost inflation.

We saw it coming, and we're dealing with it. 
In this Q3, also as we expected, we probably saw the highest inflation increase ever year-over-year. I mean 6.5% which is sitting in the Q3 P&L. Frankly, in 22 years, I never had to [indiscernible] with that kind of inflation. But we dealt with it. And I would say Q3 is certainly a proof point, a strong proof point, that we can deal with exceptionally high inflation. 
So going forward, we don't expect that the inflation will quickly fall off and will be short term. By definition there is carryover into next year. But by definition, you will also have pricing carryover into next year. So I would say, as you know, around this time of year, we're not yet giving guidance on inflation for next year, we'll do that in January. But I would rather point to Q3 as a proof point. Even an extreme spike of inflation year-over-year like you had in Q3, we're dealing with it without even a blip on our margin. So I'm pretty confident that we can deal with the carryover which we will see to some extent from inflation."

Typically, what you see in price list is more what you see promotional or cross price elasticity in the store. But with consumer, there is very limited price elasticity. Actually, in fact, over years, we've been running consumer research where we ask consumers before they enter the store, how much do you expect to pay versus what we actually paid. And they consistently overestimate how much we have to pay. So I think it's just the nature of an infrequent purchase that the consumer awareness of the exact price point is somewhat limited. 
On top of that, let's not also forget the disposable income in households is right now probably at an all-time high. So I think from that perspective, I'm less concerned. Will, at one point, promotional pressure in the market will get a little bit bigger? Yes. But right now, we're not seeing it in the current environment. And as long as the broader global supply chain constraints will exist, I think you will see very little pressure from that perspective."

I think the second thing that we've always pointed to is when we came out of the recessionary period in 2011, 2012, a lot of the improvements we made really brought our overall margins up to that type of point and got our North America margins up to 8% at that time. And we've kept those fixed costs out and taken more out.

So Sam, let me maybe first take it and then Joe Liotine, our COO, will kind of add to it.

So Sam, let me maybe first take it and then Joe Liotine, our COO, will kind of add to it. 
So first of all, on the long term, you've seen that beyond establishing a very healthy EBIT margin target in the long term of 11% to 12%, we kind of significantly increased our revenue growth goal to 5% to 6%. That is, as you pointed out, driven by both market demand and market share aspirations. 
The demand -- let me just comment this one, we're exceptionally positive in terms of the outlook going forward on the mid and long term. And that is driven by, as we pointed out earlier, the housing market is a strength, will be a strength. The housing market has been undersupplied for decades. Our position in the builder channel is a very strong one, it's probably been the strongest in 100 years. So we feel good about housing market. 
Replacement, and that's what still many people get a little bit wrong when they look at the market, replacement has been, as we pointed out, has been a headwind in the last couple of years because in a certain way you were cycling or comping against the low sales period of financial crisis. It now starts turning into a tailwind because you're now comping or replacing against the stronger installed years or strong growth years of post-financial crisis. 
On top of that, and I can't stress this enough, this COVID has brought increased appliance usage. So if you want to say so, you have a significantly higher wear and tear, which will further drive replacement cycles. 
And lastly, we're very bullish on the discretionary spend. As I mentioned before, there's high disposable income, consumer reorientation towards the home. 
To put that all together, I think we rarely had a scenario where all 3 demand components point in the right direction. That is the fundamental background of why we feel very good about the demand. 
But beyond this one, yes, we do believe we can further expand our share of that business, not just in North America, around the globe. It is -- and I'll let Joe comment on this one --  kind of through existing tools. 
But the other thing which we also pointed out earlier in the presentation is there's different revenue streams. If you have a D2C business, it gives you a higher revenue per unit. If you have additional revenue sources like the detergent business or other kind of ecosystem revenues, that is additional revenue. So it is going beyond calling the natural or the traditional market share on a unit perspective. Joe?"

There's products in the new areas around detergents. Our Yummly Pro that we just recently launched as well that are just now getting in the marketplace and are essentially new areas of growth for us that we've not really participated in historically.

So we did not make progress on regaining market share in North America, that is correct. Let me give you a little bit of perspective. That has nothing to do with products or new products, as Joe pointed out. Has nothing to do with pricing. It's entirely to do with how much can we dial up production, okay? 
Now also here, to give you a little bit of background, we finally produced in Q3 more than in Q3 2020 and more than in Q3 2019. 
Now you wonder why we didn't ship more. Last year Q3, we still were reducing inventory, i.e., we were selling off inventory. And now we -- because we had to rebound the inventory, we started to carefully build back up inventory. Carefully, because we -- we just have to make the logistics flow work. So that explains a little bit different. 
But frankly, yes, we would have liked to dial up production more. We're facing similar constraints, as you hear throughout the press, it's labor shortage, component shortage and transportation bottlenecks. 
Again, as you can read from production volumes, it's slowly getting better in Q3 and we expect that to also continue to slowly getting better, but it's not going to disappear overnight. So we will carry some of the constraints into next year. But right now, that is still the fundamental constraint against regaining certain market share levels. We feel very confident, and hopefully you heard that from Joe about our product range, which from a price perspective, well positioned. So it's just about how much we can further increase production."

So I would say that, that, as Marc said earlier, that we kind of -- the guidance we've given is more at the low end. And so -- but we don't see that as a significant mover within there.
I'd say the second thing when you think about where we are from the perspective this year, obviously, if you look at our free cash flow, it's been very strong this year. And with that, we've increased the amount of cash we returned to shareholders, whether it be through share buyback or dividends this year. And we have 5 different capital allocation priorities. Now as we look forward, share buyback will continue to be one of those. And especially in an environment right now where we don't have a different strategic purpose for the cash, we would continue to do that. But also some things that we've highlighted in there as we continue to invest or expect to continue to invest higher levels in our business. Especially coming out of this period right now where we haven't been able to implement large product launches in some of our factories, you should see our CapEx picking up along with, we will continue to look at opportunistic M&A, things that come along.

As we look at these options, as you can imagine, we have regular reviews with our Board to discuss the capital allocation, which ultimately comes back to where can we create the biggest return for shareholders for each allocated dollar, particularly in the share buyback. The ultimate decision about how attractive a share buyback, it's not a tactical decision. What we basically look at is what is the discounted value of our long-range plan versus market valuation right now for share price? And right now, we do see a fairly significant disconnect between these 2 numbers, and that's why we have, in accordance with our Board, we made the decision to buy back a significant amount of shares.

The real big change, I think is, as we pointed out, is moving our revenue goal from 3% to 5% to 6%. And that is really, I think, the biggest change in this value creation goals where -- and that is simply coming from longer-term strong demand trends.

And so certainly, that world, I think, is still going to be a bit challenged as we look forward across all different factors, labor, could be components, supplier disruptions, whatever it might be. And so I think that is inherent in what we've experienced and what we will expect here in the short term looking forward. 
To the points Jim made a little earlier in terms of our cash flow, there is -- as a consequence of these constraints, we had been a little bit more even throughout the year and less seasonality around either holidays or promotions or even business segments. So I think that has been a consequence of us being even every month as opposed to something else that we've experienced historically. 
How it impacts promotions with retailers? I really can't comment on that. That's really kind of for them to decide. But I would say, generally speaking, that is what we've experienced as a consequence of how we're managing our supply chain and how we're managing our production.

First of all, in terms of how often they look at it. And I just want to repeat what I said in the earlier remarks is we know from our connected appliance, where we have a significant installed base of several hundred thousand units, we know actual usage data, not research, not reported, real usage data. And on freestanding ranges and ovens, we see 2x the usage of pre COVID. On washers, we see 27% higher increased usage rate. So -- and that doesn't go away quickly because the hybrid work, people will spend more time at home. 
So first of all, the consumers will see the product more often and use it more often. Second of all, because of all these nesting trends and investing in the home, consumers care more for about what they invest for home and what kind of products they have in there.

And so we generally see that as a favorable trend in this space in terms of their remodels and likely even suites and ensuring that they have all the right features and functionality. So we don't have perfect data here, but I would say the general trend and the sentiment is one that improves that position for us and makes consumers really want to invest more time and money to get exactly what they need for their family. And so I think we're going to continue to experience that here in the midterm. To Marc's point, people are still going to remain in a hybrid environment here, and so that's going to only bolster that position."

As consumers are looking at buying new homes, I mean, [ with simpler ] versus the home market, but new houses are still completely undersupplied, have been undersupplied for 10 years, and you -- as a result of that, despite strong demand, you had the very high price increases. So I think you would see more and more consumers who are absolutely from, call it the household balance sheet capable of buying a home, just being frustrated about home prices or the lack of availability, who may shift some of these investments into, let's remodel the kitchen instead. So I would not be surprised if you see more and more of that happening going forward. And we've seen that in prior periods. 
So I think the segment of what we call the discretionary whole kitchen remodel, I think, will be an attractive segment going forward. And I think with what we have in the suites, particularly our traditional retail is -- and the home improvement centers, we have some very attractive offerings there."

First of all, when you look in particular -- and I think your question refers to the U.S. market, the U.S. market, you have -- obviously, we have a large factory distribution and regional distribution center, but you also need to have smaller distribution centers down the field from, which you serve particular builder channel, the direct-to-consumer business, but also many of the home improvement centers. So as we reduced inventory last year, it basically became a particular expense of smaller distribution centers which basically ultimately translate into consumer service. So we had to rebalance some of the inventory, call it, downstream in order to better service consumer and reduce some of these wait times. 
Now couple that with transportation from one coast to another is just getting slower these days. It's just what it is. So you basically tie up a little bit more inventory in transportation than you would do in normal circumstances. And that's, I think, what you would have seen in Q3. But of course, rest assured, we're trying to reduce the backlog of orders which we have as quickly as possible."

It seems like your implied fourth-quarter guide, which is kind of flattish for total revs, would still suggest in a positive price environment that, that volume dynamic is likely to continue in 4Q. So could you just clarify that? 
But then the second question is more around your confidence in the inflationary environment. This has been such a dynamic environment for every company, as you acknowledged. So just what are you seeing that's giving you the confidence or the visibility in terms of this kind of being the peak as you look out?"

And I'd say, Mike, if I start with the first question here and say, when we look at Q4 and all that, as Marc alluded to earlier, we believe that right now, our guidance for the full year is we do believe that that's on the low end of where we'll be.",280,"Yes. And I'd say, Mike, if I start with the first question here and say, when we look at Q4 and all that, as Marc alluded to earlier, we believe that right now, our guidance for the full year is we do believe that that's on the low end of where we'll be. So you take that into Q4 and the assumptions that we have around our ability to produce and get product out of the door continues to increase. And so you can pretty much back into from the guidance we've given on revenues where we expect our sales to be. But as we've said, we expect to continue to see throughput within our factories increase. And then when I look at just the dynamic of the market around us right now and say, okay. With where we are today, obviously we've done a very good job of understanding what the cost environment was going to do and offsetting that with cost-based price increases throughout the year. And as we look forward, and I think Marc alluded to this earlier, we do see some carryover benefits that still will continue to come. 
I think the other thing that I'd point to more historically even within our business and our ability to handle some of these dynamics, if you look back to like the 2018, '19 time frame, we also had cost increases within that and many of them were driven by tariffs, which we were able to offset with cost-based pricing back then. 
So again, the trends that we see right now, we believe we're taking the right actions to offset and we expect to continue to do that."

But again, I want to repeat what I said earlier, we basically saw that coming. We gave in April the inflation outlook, which probably many people perceived as, ""Oh, that's pessimistic."" But it turned out to be true, so I think we were pretty accurate in our reading of the broader markets, commodity markets and also short-term markets. 
So -- and as such, probably that's also the prime reason why this Q3, which had a pretty brutal year-over-year increase of inflation of 6.5 points, but it didn't leave a dent in our bottom line. And that, I would say, is pretty remarkable.
So being able to read the inflation outlook a little bit earlier than others helps you just deal with it earlier. And then I think we've demonstrated that in Q3.
As it comes to next year, as I mentioned before, of course, there will be carryover. But there will be also a carryover from pricing, and I would again use Q3 as a proof point. We are able to operate in a pretty challenging dynamic environment, and we will continue to do so."

When you look at our North America business, what it indicates is that we believe that, that business will stay at above a 15% EBIT margin type of range right now. And so we feel very good about where we are. Remember, our previous guidance was 13% plus for that. So we do believe we've made a step change in the profitability within North America. But a big driver that you shouldn't discount here is that the international, our businesses outside the U.S., will continue to expand margin."

As you move forward, is the accelerated revenue growth representing mostly confidence in faster market growth? Or does that imply a different performance focused commitment to market share?"

First of all, to already answer the second part of your question, I think it primarily demonstrates confidence in the market outlook. Because of the market demand, we just view it as very strong as it were before. 
Having said that and stepping back a little bit, it's -- a couple years ago when we were operating at 6% or 7% EBIT margin, if you just look at the pure financials, how you create economic value for the company, you know you have a higher lever on the margin expansion compared to revenue growth. We aren't operating on different levels. If you take the North America business, operating at 17% or 18%, by definition, if you just look at basic value creation, you can create even more value, economic value, if you drive the growth. So it all depends -- I wouldn't call it a shift. It just depends on where you are kind of in your margin progression and where you have going forward the highest lever for economic value creation. 
That picture, of course, is slightly different in Europe. In Europe, we will continue to drive a margin expansion very hard because we're not yet done with our turnaround. And again, it depends on the respective region where we are in the business, and that's where we kind of -- depending where we are, have a particular focus on margin expansion or revenue expansion. 
But again, the overriding theme is we're highly confident on a very strong market demand in the near and long term. 
So with that, I think we're coming to the end of this Q&A session. First of all, I appreciate everybody calling in, dialing in. There was a lot of material to absorb today because it was more than the earnings call, it was also about the long-term value creation goals, and I appreciate a lot of questions about these long-term value creation goals. 
And again, I just want to reiterate what I said both on the call. This is now after Q2 last year with 5 exceptionally strong quarters. But it's not just the 5 quarters, this is year #4 where we have year-after-year all-time record performance. And I think I think you would all agree, it was not particularly easy trading environment, no smooth sailing, but we delivered. In a certain way, you can almost say, well, give us a rough environment, we'll perform well. And I think that's the confidence you should also see going forward. We're not kind of planning or expecting that it's all going to be nice next year. It will continue to be challenging. But every quarter from this proof point, we have an agile organization, we have an agile business model and we can deal with what comes and we can perform exceptionally well in these circumstances. 
With that in mind, I thank you all for calling in, and wish you all a nice Friday and a nice weekend."
