Earlier today, we announced 2020 fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. The quarter's results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand for Kirby's products and services, particularly in marine transportation, where we experienced low volumes and continued poor market dynamics and poor barge utilization. 
Across the company, we have tightly managed costs, which has helped maintain overall marine transportation margins near 10% and distribution and service margins near breakeven. 
Our fourth quarter earnings also included a tax benefit as a result of the CARES Act, which Bill will discuss in a few minutes. 
Looking at our segments. In Marine transportation, the inland and coastal markets experienced challenging market conditions, with low demand particularly for the transportation of refined products, crude oil and black oil. Although the economy showed some modest signs of improvement during the quarter, increasing cases of COVID-19, high product inventories and impacts from 2 Gulf Coast hurricanes contributed to a slight sequential decline in quarterly average refinery utilization. During the quarter, refinery utilization averaged 77% compared to a previous 5-year fourth quarter average of 90%, and it ended the quarter at 80%. 
Chemical plant utilization modestly improved 1% sequentially but remained below 2019 levels. 
Overall, for our inland and coastal businesses, there were minimal spot requirements, low barge utilization and additional pricing pressures throughout the quarter. 
In distribution and services, fourth quarter revenues sequentially improved, benefiting from the continued economic recovery, higher product sales in commercial and industrial and some pickup in activity in oil and gas distribution. 
In the commercial and industrial markets, we experienced increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses, higher product sales in Thermo King and increased deliveries of new marine engines. These gains were partially offset, however, by normal seasonality, including lower utilization in the power generation rental fleet following the hurricane season as well as reduced major overhauls in marine repair during the harvest and the dry cargo market. 
In the oil and gas market, activity continued to recover as many E&PS modestly increased spending during the fourth quarter and well completion activity improved. Active frac crews, which bottomed around 50 in the second quarter, improved every month during the fourth quarter and finished the year in excess of 150. This activity improvement contributed to higher demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our distribution businesses. 
In manufacturing, remanufacturing activity was steady, and we received additional new orders for environmental-friendly fracturing equipment. 
In a few moments, I'll talk about our outlook for 2021. But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our fourth quarter segment results and the balance sheet."

In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues dec",921,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 
In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%. 
Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues declined $21.2 million or 7% and operating income declined $3.2 million. The reductions are primarily due to significantly reduced pricing in inland, reductions in inland barge utilization and increased delay days as a result of seasonal weather. Aggressive cost reductions helped to limit the impact on operating margin. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 75% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization declined modestly into the high 60% range as a result of the second wave of COVID-19, continued weak refinery utilization and an extended hurricane season. 
Long-term inland marine transportation contracts are those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 70% of revenue, with 62% from time charters and 38% from contracts of affreightment. 
Term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter were down in the low double digits on average. 
Spot market rates declined approximately 10% sequentially and 25% year-on-year. 
During the fourth quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the low to mid-teens. 
In coastal, the market continued to be challenged by significantly reduced demand for refined products and black oil. We experienced weak spot market dynamics and some charted equipment was returned as term contracts expired. 
During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the mid-70% range, unchanged sequentially, but down from the mid-80% range in the 2019 fourth quarter. 
Average spot market rates were generally stable but term contracts continued to renew lower in the mid-single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, the percentage of coastal revenues under term contracts was approximately 85%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. 
Coastal's operating margin in the fourth quarter was in the negative low to single -- to mid-single digits. 
With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the fourth quarter as well as projections for 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2020 fourth quarter were $190.3 million with an operating loss of $2.9 million. 
Compared to the third quarter, revenues improved $14.4 million or 8%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to modest economic improvements and increased product sales in the commercial and industrial market. These gains were offset by lower revenues in the oil and gas market due to the timing of pressure pumping equipment deliveries and manufacturing. Segment operating income declined slightly during the quarter as a result of product and service sales mix. 
In commercial and industrial, modest sequential improvements resulted in increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses. Higher Thermo King product sales and the timing of new marine engine deliveries also contributed to sequential increases in revenue. These were partially offset by normal seasonality, including lower utilization of the power generation rental fleet and reduced major overhaul demand in marine repair. 
During the fourth quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 78% of segment revenue. Operating margin was in the low single digits and was impacted by a higher mix of product and parts revenue during the quarter. 
In oil and gas, revenues and operating income sequentially declined primarily due to reduced deliveries of new pressure pumping equipment and manufacturing. This reduction was partially offset by increased demand for new transmissions, parts and services in oil and gas distribution as U.S. frac activity continued to improve. 
During the fourth quarter, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 22% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the mid-teens. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had $80.3 million of cash, total debt was $1.47 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio was 32.2%. 
During the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $85.1 million and we repaid $109.8 million of debt. We also used cash flow and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures of $18.8 million. 
For the full year, we generated $296.7 million of free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. This amount was slightly below the low end of our previously disclosed guidance range of $300 million. This guidance range contemplated a significant income tax refund related to the CARES Act of over $100 million which was not received as expected prior to the end of the year. We now anticipate this refund will be received during the 2021 first quarter. At the end of the year, we had total available liquidity of $684 million. 
Looking forward, capital spending is expected to continue to trend down in 2021. While the full year, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. As a result, we expect to generate free cash flow of $230 million to $330 million, which includes the tax refund previously discussed. 
Before I close, I'd like to address income taxes. During the fourth quarter, we had an effective tax rate benefit as a result of net operating losses, which will carry back to prior higher tax rate years as allowed by the CARES Act legislation. In 2021, we expect our income tax rate will be around 25%. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David to discuss our operational outlook for 2021."

With 2020 in the rearview mirror, it goes without saying we are all hopeful for brighter days in the new year. As we look at our businesses thus far in 2021, we believe some green shoots are materializing. 
In marine transportation, refinery utilization has steadily improved into the low 80% range. Inland spot activity has modestly picked up and our barge utilization has bounced up off the bottom into the low to mid 90 -- mid-70% range. Demand in distribution and services has continued to recover, with an improving economy and more favorable commodity prices. 
While all of this is encouraging, the reality is that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. Demand for our products and services are still near all-time lows and uncertainty around the timing of material economic recovery remains. All of this makes predicting 2021 very challenging with a wide range of possible outcomes. 
In the near term, we expect tough market conditions to persist into the second quarter, particularly in marine transportation, where industry barge utilization is very low and we are experiencing very competitive pricing dynamics. As well, the latest wave of COVID-19 cases has resulted in some challenges crewing our vessels, particularly in coastal. 
In distribution and services, the magnitude and timing of the recovery is dependent on an economic recovery and stability in the oil and gas markets. 
That being said, although we are starting the year with near-term pressures and uncertainty, we are very optimistic that the second half of 2021 will be materially better. 
In the meantime, we intend to remain very focused on cost control, capital discipline, cash generation and debt reduction. 
Diving into the businesses, in the inland market, we expect the current challenging market dynamics to continue in the near term, with gradual improvement in the second quarter, followed by a more meaningful recovery in the second half of the year as demand improves. 
In the first quarter, we anticipate our results will sequentially decline and be the lowest of the year. Increased delays from normal seasonal winter weather as well as lower pricing on term contract renewals are expected to be more than offset -- expected to more than offset very modest improvements in our average barge utilization. 
Beyond the first quarter, activity should begin to recover with an improving economy, which should lead to more favorable spot market dynamics. Even with the pandemic, new petrochemical plants are still scheduled to come online, there has been very limited construction of new barges and significant retirement of barges are occurring across the industry. All of this should help improve the market and is expected to contribute to a meaningful improvement in barge utilization likely into the high 80% to low 90% range by the end of the year. 
With respect to pricing, we expect pressure to persist in the near term as rates typically move with barge utilization. As a result, although market conditions are looking more favorable later in the year, we expect full year revenues and operating margins to decline compared to 2020, driven by lower average barge utilization and the full year impact of lower pricing on term contract renewals. 
In coastal, tough market conditions and low barge utilization are expected to have a meaningful impact on 2021 coastal results and contribute to year-on-year reduction in revenues and operating losses in this business. During 2020, the majority of the coastal fleet operated under term contracts established in more favorable markets during 2019 and in early 2020. These contracts helped to minimize the financial impact as demand fell throughout the pandemic. However, with many of these contracts now starting to expire and low demand for refined products and black oil expected for a while longer, we now expect lower overall pricing in 2021 for the coastal business. As well, the retirement of 3 older large capacity coastal vessels in 2020 due to ballast water treatment requirements and the retirement of an additional barge scheduled for mid-2021 will contribute to lower revenue and operating margin compared to 2020. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect coastal revenues and operating margin will decline sequentially due to continued weakness in the spot market, pricing pressure and recent challenges crewing our vessels. Similar to inland, we expect coastal market conditions will improve as the year progresses, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of 2021. 
Looking at distribution and services, we expect a more robust economy and increased activity in the oilfield will result in material year-over-year improvements in demand for much of the segment. 
In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway, with increasing truck fleet miles, and an initial recovery in bus repair demand as activity resumes and work -- and return to work commences. We also anticipate some additional growth in on-highway part sales as a result of the recent launch of our new online sales platform. Elsewhere, demand for new installations, parts and services in power generation is expected to grow as demand for electrification and 24/7 power intensifies. 
In oil and gas, we expect current improved oil prices will contribute to increased rig counts and well completions during 2021. Industry analysts have predicted the average active frac crew count could climb back to near 200, which is a notable improvement from 2020 levels. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in distribution as well as increased remanufacturing activities on existing pressure pumping equipment. 
With respect to manufacturing of new equipment, the current excess of traditional pressure pumping capacity across the industry will likely restrain significant orders of conventional fleets. However, a heightened focus on ESG in both energy and industrial sectors is expected to result in increased demand for Kirby's extensive portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment throughout the year. 
Overall, in distribution and services, we expect 2021 revenues and operating income will materially improve as compared to 2020, with commercial and industrial representing approximately 70% and oil and gas representing 30% of segment revenues for the full year. Although the range is dependent on the timing of a material economic recovery, we expect segment operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest. We expect a normal seasonal reduction during the fourth quarter. 
To close out 2020, it was a difficult year with unprecedented challenges. The efforts of our dedicated employees to ensure business continuity, remain focused on safety and to aggressively reduce costs were commendable. I'm very proud of our accomplishments amidst a very challenging backdrop. 
Looking forward, although some near-term challenges and uncertainty remain, we are confident Kirby is in a strong position to meaningfully recover when the pandemic eases and demand for our products and services improves. 
In marine transportation, it was only 1 year ago that inland barge utilization was at an all-time high. Inland operating margins were near 20% and  prices were materially increasing in both inland and coastal. Although demand has significantly declined since that time because of the pandemic, industry supply is in check, with very limited new barge construction in inland, no incremental capacity plan in coastal and significant retirements across both sectors. All of this is very positive for our businesses and is expected to contribute to a meaningful tightening in the barge market once demand improves. When you consider our inland fleet expansion over the last 3 years, which is approximately 40% higher on barrel capacity basis, as well as our recent efforts to improve the efficiency of our inland and coastal fleets, we believe there is a significant earnings potential in marine transportation. 
In distribution and services, while managing through the pandemic and unprecedented downturn, we were very focused on improving our business during 2020. Throughout the year, we took aggressive and proactive steps to streamline and rightsize the business for the near term while strengthening it for the long term, including consolidating businesses, support functions and management teams; renewing and expanding OEM relationships and product offerings; completing the implementation of a common ERP system; rolling out a new online parts sales platform; and developing and prototyping new products for the expanding wave of electrification. Overall, we anticipate improved results as the economy grows and oilfield activity recovers. And our efforts during 2020 will meaningfully contribute to more favorable long-term returns of this segment. 
Finally, from a liquidity perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of nearly $300 million in a very difficult year and we made significant progress in paying down debt. We expect 2021 will be a strong cash flow year, with expectations of $230 million to $330 million of free cash flow for the full year. We intend to use this cash flow to pay down debt and enhance liquidity.

And I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on both inland and coastal, but I think we went into this downturn with about, call it 3,900 inland barges. Where do you think we're going to stand maybe at the end of 2021? How much capacity do you think the industry is going to take out just because of the difficulty we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months? And then I'd be curious to get your thoughts kind of looking at the coastal market the same way. How much capacity do you think is going to come out by the time we get to the other side of this?"

So the number of new large deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you",483,"Yes. So the number of new large deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. 
The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you this, because we do know Kirby's numbers, we had originally planned to retire only 10 barges in 2020. We ended up retiring about 95. So our retirement alone made a significant dent in that -- that impacted new barges. But I would say this, I fully expect the number of retirements will be north of 150 to maybe even north of 200 retirements in 2020. We'll see. Informa does a survey that comes out in March or April, and we'll get a better feel for the retirements. 
When we look at 2021, we know that there were 36 barges that carried over into 2021 that weren't delivered that were ordered pre pandemic. So there's not a lot of new construction on the horizon and retirements are continuing. We know, just from our network, that there's been a lot of retirements. We just don't have a good number on it. 
So net-net, I think barge capacity goes down considerably in -- considerably is hard to quantify, but it will be meaningful for 2021. 
And Jack, as we said in our prepared remarks, just prior to the pandemic, Kirby's utilization was at an all-time high. We were over 95% utilized. So that should bode well when demand comes back. 
But on the new build side, one, steel prices, scrap steel prices are up. That's actually helped the retirement, but it also has raised the cost of new barges. We're hearing in the market that just a new barge, whether it's a 10,000 barrel or a 30,000 barrel or a black oil or a clean barge, that because of steel prices and other costs, the pricing of new barges is up 25% to 35%. So that, to me, is a very good sign. That means it's going to be very expensive to build new capacity. 
So we're pretty bullish on the supply and demand situation on the inland side. And I would say it's even better on the coastal side. There's really no new capacity coming in. OSG had a couple of units that they had built for replacement. Those essentially have delivered. There's nothing really on order that I'm aware of. And I think that there's a very long lead time, right? I mean if you're going to order an offshore barge, it's -- even if you had the design in the drawer, it's probably at least 2 years before you would get it. So I think the elasticity in the coastal business is going to be even greater when it comes back. 
So we're pretty happy with the supply [ of ] demand situation right now."

Our renewals typically are ratable through the year, with the fourth quarter being the heaviest. If there's one quarter that's heavy, it's the fourth quarter, because everybody kind of has a year-end mindset or there's a lot of year-end mindset. So when we look at renewals, it's not particularly heavy here in the first half. 
I would say, look, you heard the numbers. We're not hiding from them in our prepared remarks. Spot pricing was down 10% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. And term pricing was down kind of low double digits on renewals in the fourth quarter. 
So look, that is part of our message today, is that margins are going to be under pressure this year as those prices roll through. 
But to your point, that will change as utility goes up. Pricing should start to go the other direction. And we have a pretty big spot portfolio. Right now, we're about 30% spot, 70% contract. And that's -- that's going to give us a good bit of equipment that can rise pretty quickly. 
And then there's the contracts that do renew in the first half. Those will be pretty low, but then the second half should be better. 
So we should get, as prices rise, it should come through pretty quick. But as you've seen in the past, it takes about 1 year for things to roll through in the margin, both on the upside and then on the downside. So it will take some while, but we do have that big slug of spot equipment that can reprice pretty quickly."

What you will see, and this will take some time for us to roll out, we've invested in R&D and new product developments. We alluded to it in the prepared comments. 
Look, electrification is happening. And Stewart & Stevenson, in particular, has some great technology and know-how and engineering resources. And we've got some really good ESG-centric products that are rolling out. So we're pretty excited about that. Some of that is being applied to the oilfield. 
We -- as you know, we've made a lot of electric fracs over the years. And those are the kind of the --  one style of electric frac is to use gas turbines to drive electric drive and then to a pump. But there's basically electric grids now that can drive electric pumps and using natural gas generation to generate the electric power. We're right in the square middle of that and that's getting some traction. But also importantly, those electrification products are -- can be used well outside the oilfield. And we're working hard on that. It's not anything we're ready to give you numbers for you to build into your model, but I will tell you, it's moving along with a lot of speed and there's a lot of excitement in the company about that. 
So when you roll that together with the lean cost structure, a rebound in the economy and commercial and industrial being about 75% of distribution and services, we're pretty excited about it. 
Now does that mean we'd put new capital in there? No. I think that's one of the great things about D&S is it doesn't require a lot of capital. It's got a pretty low capital base. It generally is around working capital is where you deploy the capital. So that's probably a long nonanswer, but I would characterize it as we're pretty excited about what we've got in front of us. We made a lot of good changes, a lot of investments during 2020. And I think KDS is poised to really contribute to Kirby's bottom line."

But let's stick with inland first. When you walked through your thoughts on the environment, so you've mentioned some new capacity, the continued retirements, but utilization at refineries creeping up from lows. Maybe you can talk about how long does it take for you to see that in rates? Is it something we -- you're talking about a quarter? Or is it longer than that? How long does it typically take to see that environment change?"

Right now -- well, let me talk to utilization for a quick second because that is what drives pricing, right? The view that utilization is tightening and it is tightening and that it's going to continue for a while, that mindset is what helps drive pricing. 
Our utilization in the fourth quarter kind of dipped to the high 60%, which is the lowest we've ever seen it. But we're starting to see it in the low 70s now. I think we're between 70% and 75% utility. And it keeps inching up. Part of that, to your point, is refinery utilization coming back. We've seen refinery utilization ticked up. But be careful with refinery utilization because there's a mathematical thing going on, as they shut down some of the refineries, the denominator fell a bit. So even though the nameplate utilization is higher, it's probably 2% to 3% higher than on a constant capacity basis. But the key is that, that refinery utilization keeps ticking up, which helps our utility and the volumes we move. And so we're starting to see it climb. Very encouraged with where utility is going so far this year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that says that, that's not going to continue. And it won't take long to get -- get pricing to stop its decline and to start its climb. I wish I could give you a definitive date. Does that happen in the first quarter or the second quarter or even the third quarter? I'm not sure. But I do think it happens this year, and I think it will move pretty quickly because there hasn't been a lot of building. As we talked about earlier, the supply and demand balance should tighten really rapidly, and that should get the pricing go in the other direction rather quickly. Sorry, I can't be more definitive on that. 
And you mentioned coastal having a tough time. It's the same dynamic in coastal, except I actually think the elasticity in coastals is stronger because they're just bigger units and they move further. Now that said, though, as you know, coastal is a lot more refined products. So it's been impacted a little harder in terms of structure of the industry than inland. But again, I think the same dynamics hold, as utility comes up, you'll see pricing snap back pretty quickly and you'll see things go back on contract. We've seen more equipment move from term to spot because our customers just didn't have the volumes. We look forward to that changing. And I think it's starting to change now. 
I mean, the encouraging thing we saw in the COVID statistics is there was a pretty strong downward trend in a number of new infections. So I guess it looks like everything's headed in the right direction."

So on these very expensive units, you can use a week's -- a week's charter hire just going through that process of getting it to shore, getting the crew off, recrewing it after you sanitize it. So yes, it can be meaningful if you get a lot of that. And we've had some. We had some in the fourth quarter. We've had some in the first quarter. Take a unit that's earning $30,000, $40,000 a day, and you lose that for a week, it starts to add up pretty quickly. 
But the bigger issue is just demand decline that had happened. And our hope is that, that's about to turn the other direction."

No. The sequential decline, we foreshadowed, we talked about it. But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, you typically get, one, a lot of rental income on power generation",416,"Yes. No. The sequential decline, we foreshadowed, we talked about it. But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, you typically get, one, a lot of rental income on power generation because of the hurricane season, and that carries over a little bit into the fourth quarter. But typically, we'll see our rental utilization fall in the fourth quarter for power, standby backup power that gets deployed during hurricane season. That happened in the fourth quarter kind of as we predicted. And so that's part of it. 
The other part of it is our marine repair, diesel engine marine repair and gearbox repair business has some seasonality in the fourth quarter as well because the dry cargo fleet goes to work in the fourth quarter to move the harvest. So basically, we get a little more business in the third quarter and then the dry cargo operators put all their equipment to work. And so we don't have as much work -- repair work in the fourth quarter. 
So both of those contribute to the seasonality that we see and the sequential decline. Some of that will start to reverse in the first quarter. You'll see some more maintenance on the marine repair. But hopefully, we don't have any hurricanes hit us in the first quarter. So we'll get some snapback on that. 
But what really is going to help D&S is some of the product deliveries and the U.S. economy coming back. We sell a lot of spare parts and a lot of truck parts and a lot of backup power, a lot of bus repair, all of that is economic-driven. And as the economy comes back, that should start to drive the profitability. 
And then on oil and gas, we took some orders in the fourth quarter. Those will start to deliver in the first and second quarter. So we should start to see some profitability from that. 
In terms of when do we go profitable in the quarter, I'm not prepared to say that. But I think we've said for the full year, we expect D&S to be kind of mid-single -- low to mid single-digit operating margins with revenue up. And I'll give you a little feel for revenue. It could be up 10% to 30%, just depending on when the U.S. economy starts to get really really humming. So we're pretty optimistic about KDS for 2021."

But you did bring up wind, and that is an exciting area. I think if you look at some of the plans, particularly on the East Coast, the number of projects is enormous. I think there's, what is it, 28 gig of wind power that's planned. That's an enormous amount of work for Jones Act-compliant vessels. The good news is President Biden came out and supported the Jones Act just recently. I think there'll be opportunities for Jones Act marine companies to support the development of wind. And that can take -- there's a number of different types of vessels that can go out there. There's the installation type vessels. There's transportation to get the equipment out to -- out to the sites where the wind mills are. And then, of course, there's maintenance and repair and crewing vessels. So that could be a significant growth area. Clearly, Kirby is looking at that. We're one of the largest marine companies in the United States. We're in discussions. We're not in liberty to really say much more than that. But it could be a meaningful growth opportunity. 
But as you know, Randy, Kirby is very disciplined about its capital deployment. And we'll be smart and make sure we've got good prospects with decent contract cover before we deploy significant capital."

They were just over-levered and they were trying to do their best and did their best. They just had way too much leverage for the downturn that we run through. 
I think there are a number of companies that are severely levered right now. But as you know, we were able to pick up Higman because they were overlevered in a declining market. 
And so it's out there. The bankruptcies, it always seems like they can last longer than you would think when they get over levered. But certainly, there are some people that are very, very stressed here in this current environment. We've seen some pricing go down below cash cost, which is very frustrating, right? Either they're desperate or they don't really understand their cost structure in order to do that. But it's a sign of how bad the market got. 
I'm encouraged with what we're seeing in utility, and I think it will come back pretty quickly. We're starting to see utility move north, which was really good. 
But there are undoubtedly some people out there that are close to bankruptcy. It's probably good for me not to comment specifically about anybody, whether it's on the inland side or the offshore side. I mean you mentioned one of them anyway. 
Yes, it has been 5 years. It's been a tough 5 years. But again, I think we're part of a critical infrastructure to run the U.S. economy. And ultimately, things come back.

And I would tell you, almost all the new construction has been biofuel or electric. And our inbound in the fourth quarter was around all of that. 
So you're spot on. There are a lot of ESG-driven upgrades, which actually do give the owners lower cost of operation. Electric has a little less maintenance. And these biofuel -- [ bi-fuel ] engines give them less cost in terms of fuel. Natural gas is still pretty cheap.

We have heard that there is one refinery that's looking to restart, and that's really good news because it had some large barge utility with it. 
So some of them will restart. I don't think all of them will restart. I think some of them were inherently disadvantaged from a refinery complexity standpoint and refinery efficiency standpoint. 
The other thing is you're seeing biofuel and other environmentally friendly products that our refining customers are adding to their portfolios. And we're starting to see some of those type moves emerge. 
So I don't think there's anything systemically that makes it all go away. EVs, obviously, will have a longer-term impact, but there's a debate about how long that takes and if some of that demand destruction is absorbed or replaced by emerging market demand growth. If you think of the developing economies, typically, they start to burn more energy as they develop. And I don't think that, that phenomena changes. 
So -- but longer term, obviously, we're all thinking about the impact of EVs and what that can do to demand. But I think it's got multiple years, if not decades, to play out. I know some friends with EVs, but they also have a suburban in their garage. So I think it's got a ways to play out."

Earlier today, we announced 2020 fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. The quarter's results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand for Kirby's products and services, particularly in marine transportation, where we experienced low volumes and continued poor market dynamics and poor barge utilization. 
Across the company, we have tightly managed costs, which has helped maintain overall marine transportation margins near 10% and distribution and service margins near breakeven. 
Our fourth quarter earnings also included a tax benefit as a result of the CARES Act, which Bill will discuss in a few minutes. 
Looking at our segments. In Marine transportation, the inland and coastal markets experienced challenging market conditions, with low demand particularly for the transportation of refined products, crude oil and black oil. Although the economy showed some modest signs of improvement during the quarter, increasing cases of COVID-19, high product inventories and impacts from 2 Gulf Coast hurricanes contributed to a slight sequential decline in quarterly average refinery utilization. During the quarter, refinery utilization averaged 77% compared to a previous 5-year fourth quarter average of 90%, and it ended the quarter at 80%. 
Chemical plant utilization modestly improved 1% sequentially but remained below 2019 levels. 
Overall, for our inland and coastal businesses, there were minimal spot requirements, low barge utilization and additional pricing pressures throughout the quarter. 
In distribution and services, fourth quarter revenues sequentially improved, benefiting from the continued economic recovery, higher product sales in commercial and industrial and some pickup in activity in oil and gas distribution. 
In the commercial and industrial markets, we experienced increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses, higher product sales in Thermo King and increased deliveries of new marine engines. These gains were partially offset, however, by normal seasonality, including lower utilization in the power generation rental fleet following the hurricane season as well as reduced major overhauls in marine repair during the harvest and the dry cargo market. 
In the oil and gas market, activity continued to recover as many E&PS modestly increased spending during the fourth quarter and well completion activity improved. Active frac crews, which bottomed around 50 in the second quarter, improved every month during the fourth quarter and finished the year in excess of 150. This activity improvement contributed to higher demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our distribution businesses. 
In manufacturing, remanufacturing activity was steady, and we received additional new orders for environmental-friendly fracturing equipment. 
In a few moments, I'll talk about our outlook for 2021. But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our fourth quarter segment results and the balance sheet."
283986,700852398,2183748,"Kirby Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues dec",921,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 
In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%. 
Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues declined $21.2 million or 7% and operating income declined $3.2 million. The reductions are primarily due to significantly reduced pricing in inland, reductions in inland barge utilization and increased delay days as a result of seasonal weather. Aggressive cost reductions helped to limit the impact on operating margin. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 75% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization declined modestly into the high 60% range as a result of the second wave of COVID-19, continued weak refinery utilization and an extended hurricane season. 
Long-term inland marine transportation contracts are those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 70% of revenue, with 62% from time charters and 38% from contracts of affreightment. 
Term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter were down in the low double digits on average. 
Spot market rates declined approximately 10% sequentially and 25% year-on-year. 
During the fourth quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the low to mid-teens. 
In coastal, the market continued to be challenged by significantly reduced demand for refined products and black oil. We experienced weak spot market dynamics and some charted equipment was returned as term contracts expired. 
During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the mid-70% range, unchanged sequentially, but down from the mid-80% range in the 2019 fourth quarter. 
Average spot market rates were generally stable but term contracts continued to renew lower in the mid-single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, the percentage of coastal revenues under term contracts was approximately 85%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. 
Coastal's operating margin in the fourth quarter was in the negative low to single -- to mid-single digits. 
With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the fourth quarter as well as projections for 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2020 fourth quarter were $190.3 million with an operating loss of $2.9 million. 
Compared to the third quarter, revenues improved $14.4 million or 8%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to modest economic improvements and increased product sales in the commercial and industrial market. These gains were offset by lower revenues in the oil and gas market due to the timing of pressure pumping equipment deliveries and manufacturing. Segment operating income declined slightly during the quarter as a result of product and service sales mix. 
In commercial and industrial, modest sequential improvements resulted in increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses. Higher Thermo King product sales and the timing of new marine engine deliveries also contributed to sequential increases in revenue. These were partially offset by normal seasonality, including lower utilization of the power generation rental fleet and reduced major overhaul demand in marine repair. 
During the fourth quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 78% of segment revenue. Operating margin was in the low single digits and was impacted by a higher mix of product and parts revenue during the quarter. 
In oil and gas, revenues and operating income sequentially declined primarily due to reduced deliveries of new pressure pumping equipment and manufacturing. This reduction was partially offset by increased demand for new transmissions, parts and services in oil and gas distribution as U.S. frac activity continued to improve. 
During the fourth quarter, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 22% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the mid-teens. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had $80.3 million of cash, total debt was $1.47 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio was 32.2%. 
During the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $85.1 million and we repaid $109.8 million of debt. We also used cash flow and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures of $18.8 million. 
For the full year, we generated $296.7 million of free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. This amount was slightly below the low end of our previously disclosed guidance range of $300 million. This guidance range contemplated a significant income tax refund related to the CARES Act of over $100 million which was not received as expected prior to the end of the year. We now anticipate this refund will be received during the 2021 first quarter. At the end of the year, we had total available liquidity of $684 million. 
Looking forward, capital spending is expected to continue to trend down in 2021. While the full year, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. As a result, we expect to generate free cash flow of $230 million to $330 million, which includes the tax refund previously discussed. 
Before I close, I'd like to address income taxes. During the fourth quarter, we had an effective tax rate benefit as a result of net operating losses, which will carry back to prior higher tax rate years as allowed by the CARES Act legislation. In 2021, we expect our income tax rate will be around 25%. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David to discuss our operational outlook for 2021."

With 2020 in the rearview mirror, it goes without saying we are all hopeful for brighter days in the new year. As we look at our businesses thus far in 2021, we believe some green shoots are materializing. 
In marine transportation, refinery utilization has steadily improved into the low 80% range. Inland spot activity has modestly picked up and our barge utilization has bounced up off the bottom into the low to mid 90 -- mid-70% range. Demand in distribution and services has continued to recover, with an improving economy and more favorable commodity prices. 
While all of this is encouraging, the reality is that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. Demand for our products and services are still near all-time lows and uncertainty around the timing of material economic recovery remains. All of this makes predicting 2021 very challenging with a wide range of possible outcomes. 
In the near term, we expect tough market conditions to persist into the second quarter, particularly in marine transportation, where industry barge utilization is very low and we are experiencing very competitive pricing dynamics. As well, the latest wave of COVID-19 cases has resulted in some challenges crewing our vessels, particularly in coastal. 
In distribution and services, the magnitude and timing of the recovery is dependent on an economic recovery and stability in the oil and gas markets. 
That being said, although we are starting the year with near-term pressures and uncertainty, we are very optimistic that the second half of 2021 will be materially better. 
In the meantime, we intend to remain very focused on cost control, capital discipline, cash generation and debt reduction. 
Diving into the businesses, in the inland market, we expect the current challenging market dynamics to continue in the near term, with gradual improvement in the second quarter, followed by a more meaningful recovery in the second half of the year as demand improves. 
In the first quarter, we anticipate our results will sequentially decline and be the lowest of the year. Increased delays from normal seasonal winter weather as well as lower pricing on term contract renewals are expected to be more than offset -- expected to more than offset very modest improvements in our average barge utilization. 
Beyond the first quarter, activity should begin to recover with an improving economy, which should lead to more favorable spot market dynamics. Even with the pandemic, new petrochemical plants are still scheduled to come online, there has been very limited construction of new barges and significant retirement of barges are occurring across the industry. All of this should help improve the market and is expected to contribute to a meaningful improvement in barge utilization likely into the high 80% to low 90% range by the end of the year. 
With respect to pricing, we expect pressure to persist in the near term as rates typically move with barge utilization. As a result, although market conditions are looking more favorable later in the year, we expect full year revenues and operating margins to decline compared to 2020, driven by lower average barge utilization and the full year impact of lower pricing on term contract renewals. 
In coastal, tough market conditions and low barge utilization are expected to have a meaningful impact on 2021 coastal results and contribute to year-on-year reduction in revenues and operating losses in this business. During 2020, the majority of the coastal fleet operated under term contracts established in more favorable markets during 2019 and in early 2020. These contracts helped to minimize the financial impact as demand fell throughout the pandemic. However, with many of these contracts now starting to expire and low demand for refined products and black oil expected for a while longer, we now expect lower overall pricing in 2021 for the coastal business. As well, the retirement of 3 older large capacity coastal vessels in 2020 due to ballast water treatment requirements and the retirement of an additional barge scheduled for mid-2021 will contribute to lower revenue and operating margin compared to 2020. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect coastal revenues and operating margin will decline sequentially due to continued weakness in the spot market, pricing pressure and recent challenges crewing our vessels. Similar to inland, we expect coastal market conditions will improve as the year progresses, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of 2021. 
Looking at distribution and services, we expect a more robust economy and increased activity in the oilfield will result in material year-over-year improvements in demand for much of the segment. 
In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway, with increasing truck fleet miles, and an initial recovery in bus repair demand as activity resumes and work -- and return to work commences. We also anticipate some additional growth in on-highway part sales as a result of the recent launch of our new online sales platform. Elsewhere, demand for new installations, parts and services in power generation is expected to grow as demand for electrification and 24/7 power intensifies. 
In oil and gas, we expect current improved oil prices will contribute to increased rig counts and well completions during 2021. Industry analysts have predicted the average active frac crew count could climb back to near 200, which is a notable improvement from 2020 levels. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in distribution as well as increased remanufacturing activities on existing pressure pumping equipment. 
With respect to manufacturing of new equipment, the current excess of traditional pressure pumping capacity across the industry will likely restrain significant orders of conventional fleets. However, a heightened focus on ESG in both energy and industrial sectors is expected to result in increased demand for Kirby's extensive portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment throughout the year. 
Overall, in distribution and services, we expect 2021 revenues and operating income will materially improve as compared to 2020, with commercial and industrial representing approximately 70% and oil and gas representing 30% of segment revenues for the full year. Although the range is dependent on the timing of a material economic recovery, we expect segment operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest. We expect a normal seasonal reduction during the fourth quarter. 
To close out 2020, it was a difficult year with unprecedented challenges. The efforts of our dedicated employees to ensure business continuity, remain focused on safety and to aggressively reduce costs were commendable. I'm very proud of our accomplishments amidst a very challenging backdrop. 
Looking forward, although some near-term challenges and uncertainty remain, we are confident Kirby is in a strong position to meaningfully recover when the pandemic eases and demand for our products and services improves. 
In marine transportation, it was only 1 year ago that inland barge utilization was at an all-time high. Inland operating margins were near 20% and  prices were materially increasing in both inland and coastal. Although demand has significantly declined since that time because of the pandemic, industry supply is in check, with very limited new barge construction in inland, no incremental capacity plan in coastal and significant retirements across both sectors. All of this is very positive for our businesses and is expected to contribute to a meaningful tightening in the barge market once demand improves. When you consider our inland fleet expansion over the last 3 years, which is approximately 40% higher on barrel capacity basis, as well as our recent efforts to improve the efficiency of our inland and coastal fleets, we believe there is a significant earnings potential in marine transportation. 
In distribution and services, while managing through the pandemic and unprecedented downturn, we were very focused on improving our business during 2020. Throughout the year, we took aggressive and proactive steps to streamline and rightsize the business for the near term while strengthening it for the long term, including consolidating businesses, support functions and management teams; renewing and expanding OEM relationships and product offerings; completing the implementation of a common ERP system; rolling out a new online parts sales platform; and developing and prototyping new products for the expanding wave of electrification. Overall, we anticipate improved results as the economy grows and oilfield activity recovers. And our efforts during 2020 will meaningfully contribute to more favorable long-term returns of this segment. 
Finally, from a liquidity perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of nearly $300 million in a very difficult year and we made significant progress in paying down debt. We expect 2021 will be a strong cash flow year, with expectations of $230 million to $330 million of free cash flow for the full year. We intend to use this cash flow to pay down debt and enhance liquidity.

And I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on both inland and coastal, but I think we went into this downturn with about, call it 3,900 inland barges. Where do you think we're going to stand maybe at the end of 2021? How much capacity do you think the industry is going to take out just because of the difficulty we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months? And then I'd be curious to get your thoughts kind of looking at the coastal market the same way. How much capacity do you think is going to come out by the time we get to the other side of this?"

So the number of new large deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you",483,"Yes. So the number of new large deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. 
The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you this, because we do know Kirby's numbers, we had originally planned to retire only 10 barges in 2020. We ended up retiring about 95. So our retirement alone made a significant dent in that -- that impacted new barges. But I would say this, I fully expect the number of retirements will be north of 150 to maybe even north of 200 retirements in 2020. We'll see. Informa does a survey that comes out in March or April, and we'll get a better feel for the retirements. 
When we look at 2021, we know that there were 36 barges that carried over into 2021 that weren't delivered that were ordered pre pandemic. So there's not a lot of new construction on the horizon and retirements are continuing. We know, just from our network, that there's been a lot of retirements. We just don't have a good number on it. 
So net-net, I think barge capacity goes down considerably in -- considerably is hard to quantify, but it will be meaningful for 2021. 
And Jack, as we said in our prepared remarks, just prior to the pandemic, Kirby's utilization was at an all-time high. We were over 95% utilized. So that should bode well when demand comes back. 
But on the new build side, one, steel prices, scrap steel prices are up. That's actually helped the retirement, but it also has raised the cost of new barges. We're hearing in the market that just a new barge, whether it's a 10,000 barrel or a 30,000 barrel or a black oil or a clean barge, that because of steel prices and other costs, the pricing of new barges is up 25% to 35%. So that, to me, is a very good sign. That means it's going to be very expensive to build new capacity. 
So we're pretty bullish on the supply and demand situation on the inland side. And I would say it's even better on the coastal side. There's really no new capacity coming in. OSG had a couple of units that they had built for replacement. Those essentially have delivered. There's nothing really on order that I'm aware of. And I think that there's a very long lead time, right? I mean if you're going to order an offshore barge, it's -- even if you had the design in the drawer, it's probably at least 2 years before you would get it. So I think the elasticity in the coastal business is going to be even greater when it comes back. 
So we're pretty happy with the supply [ of ] demand situation right now."

Our renewals typically are ratable through the year, with the fourth quarter being the heaviest. If there's one quarter that's heavy, it's the fourth quarter, because everybody kind of has a year-end mindset or there's a lot of year-end mindset. So when we look at renewals, it's not particularly heavy here in the first half. 
I would say, look, you heard the numbers. We're not hiding from them in our prepared remarks. Spot pricing was down 10% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. And term pricing was down kind of low double digits on renewals in the fourth quarter. 
So look, that is part of our message today, is that margins are going to be under pressure this year as those prices roll through. 
But to your point, that will change as utility goes up. Pricing should start to go the other direction. And we have a pretty big spot portfolio. Right now, we're about 30% spot, 70% contract. And that's -- that's going to give us a good bit of equipment that can rise pretty quickly. 
And then there's the contracts that do renew in the first half. Those will be pretty low, but then the second half should be better. 
So we should get, as prices rise, it should come through pretty quick. But as you've seen in the past, it takes about 1 year for things to roll through in the margin, both on the upside and then on the downside. So it will take some while, but we do have that big slug of spot equipment that can reprice pretty quickly."

With a little bit of green shoots in the oil patch, with consolidation kind of picking up and with you having about as lean of a structure as you can possibly have in that business, when you think about the next couple of years, do you think that you're long for the business? Or maybe the complete opposite, now that you have this kind of, hopefully, lean and mean structure that benefits from an upturn, is there more to do as far as capital deployment in that business?"

What you will see, and this will take some time for us to roll out, we've invested in R&D and new product developments. We alluded to it in the prepared comments. 
Look, electrification is happening. And Stewart & Stevenson, in particular, has some great technology and know-how and engineering resources. And we've got some really good ESG-centric products that are rolling out. So we're pretty excited about that. Some of that is being applied to the oilfield. 
We -- as you know, we've made a lot of electric fracs over the years. And those are the kind of the --  one style of electric frac is to use gas turbines to drive electric drive and then to a pump. But there's basically electric grids now that can drive electric pumps and using natural gas generation to generate the electric power. We're right in the square middle of that and that's getting some traction. But also importantly, those electrification products are -- can be used well outside the oilfield. And we're working hard on that. It's not anything we're ready to give you numbers for you to build into your model, but I will tell you, it's moving along with a lot of speed and there's a lot of excitement in the company about that. 
So when you roll that together with the lean cost structure, a rebound in the economy and commercial and industrial being about 75% of distribution and services, we're pretty excited about it. 
Now does that mean we'd put new capital in there? No. I think that's one of the great things about D&S is it doesn't require a lot of capital. It's got a pretty low capital base. It generally is around working capital is where you deploy the capital. So that's probably a long nonanswer, but I would characterize it as we're pretty excited about what we've got in front of us. We made a lot of good changes, a lot of investments during 2020. And I think KDS is poised to really contribute to Kirby's bottom line."

But let's stick with inland first. When you walked through your thoughts on the environment, so you've mentioned some new capacity, the continued retirements, but utilization at refineries creeping up from lows. Maybe you can talk about how long does it take for you to see that in rates? Is it something we -- you're talking about a quarter? Or is it longer than that?

Right now -- well, let me talk to utilization for a quick second because that is what drives pricing, right? The view that utilization is tightening and it is tightening and that it's going to continue for a while, that mindset is what helps drive pricing. 
Our utilization in the fourth quarter kind of dipped to the high 60%, which is the lowest we've ever seen it. But we're starting to see it in the low 70s now. I think we're between 70% and 75% utility. And it keeps inching up. Part of that, to your point, is refinery utilization coming back. We've seen refinery utilization ticked up. But be careful with refinery utilization because there's a mathematical thing going on, as they shut down some of the refineries, the denominator fell a bit. So even though the nameplate utilization is higher, it's probably 2% to 3% higher than on a constant capacity basis. But the key is that, that refinery utilization keeps ticking up, which helps our utility and the volumes we move. And so we're starting to see it climb. Very encouraged with where utility is going so far this year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that says that, that's not going to continue. And it won't take long to get -- get pricing to stop its decline and to start its climb. I wish I could give you a definitive date. Does that happen in the first quarter or the second quarter or even the third quarter? I'm not sure. But I do think it happens this year, and I think it will move pretty quickly because there hasn't been a lot of building. As we talked about earlier, the supply and demand balance should tighten really rapidly, and that should get the pricing go in the other direction rather quickly. Sorry, I can't be more definitive on that. 
And you mentioned coastal having a tough time. It's the same dynamic in coastal, except I actually think the elasticity in coastals is stronger because they're just bigger units and they move further. Now that said, though, as you know, coastal is a lot more refined products. So it's been impacted a little harder in terms of structure of the industry than inland. But again, I think the same dynamics hold, as utility comes up, you'll see pricing snap back pretty quickly and you'll see things go back on contract. We've seen more equipment move from term to spot because our customers just didn't have the volumes. We look forward to that changing. And I think it's starting to change now. 
I mean, the encouraging thing we saw in the COVID statistics is there was a pretty strong downward trend in a number of new infections. So I guess it looks like everything's headed in the right direction."

So on these very expensive units, you can use a week's -- a week's charter hire just going through that process of getting it to shore, getting the crew off, recrewing it after you sanitize it. So yes, it can be meaningful if you get a lot of that. And we've had some. We had some in the fourth quarter. We've had some in the first quarter. Take a unit that's earning $30,000, $40,000 a day, and you lose that for a week, it starts to add up pretty quickly. 
But the bigger issue is just demand decline that had happened. And our hope is that, that's about to turn the other direction."

No. The sequential decline, we foreshadowed, we talked about it. But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, you typically get, one, a lot of rental income on power generation",416,"Yes. No. The sequential decline, we foreshadowed, we talked about it. But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, you typically get, one, a lot of rental income on power generation because of the hurricane season, and that carries over a little bit into the fourth quarter. But typically, we'll see our rental utilization fall in the fourth quarter for power, standby backup power that gets deployed during hurricane season. That happened in the fourth quarter kind of as we predicted. And so that's part of it. 
The other part of it is our marine repair, diesel engine marine repair and gearbox repair business has some seasonality in the fourth quarter as well because the dry cargo fleet goes to work in the fourth quarter to move the harvest. So basically, we get a little more business in the third quarter and then the dry cargo operators put all their equipment to work. And so we don't have as much work -- repair work in the fourth quarter. 
So both of those contribute to the seasonality that we see and the sequential decline. Some of that will start to reverse in the first quarter. You'll see some more maintenance on the marine repair. But hopefully, we don't have any hurricanes hit us in the first quarter. So we'll get some snapback on that. 
But what really is going to help D&S is some of the product deliveries and the U.S. economy coming back. We sell a lot of spare parts and a lot of truck parts and a lot of backup power, a lot of bus repair, all of that is economic-driven. And as the economy comes back, that should start to drive the profitability. 
And then on oil and gas, we took some orders in the fourth quarter. Those will start to deliver in the first and second quarter. So we should start to see some profitability from that. 
In terms of when do we go profitable in the quarter, I'm not prepared to say that. But I think we've said for the full year, we expect D&S to be kind of mid-single -- low to mid single-digit operating margins with revenue up. And I'll give you a little feel for revenue. It could be up 10% to 30%, just depending on when the U.S. economy starts to get really really humming. So we're pretty optimistic about KDS for 2021."

But you did bring up wind, and that is an exciting area. I think if you look at some of the plans, particularly on the East Coast, the number of projects is enormous. I think there's, what is it, 28 gig of wind power that's planned. That's an enormous amount of work for Jones Act-compliant vessels. The good news is President Biden came out and supported the Jones Act just recently. I think there'll be opportunities for Jones Act marine companies to support the development of wind. And that can take -- there's a number of different types of vessels that can go out there. There's the installation type vessels. There's transportation to get the equipment out to -- out to the sites where the wind mills are. And then, of course, there's maintenance and repair and crewing vessels. So that could be a significant growth area. Clearly, Kirby is looking at that. We're one of the largest marine companies in the United States. We're in discussions. We're not in liberty to really say much more than that. But it could be a meaningful growth opportunity. 
But as you know, Randy, Kirby is very disciplined about its capital deployment. And we'll be smart and make sure we've got good prospects with decent contract cover before we deploy significant capital."

They were just over-levered and they were trying to do their best and did their best. They just had way too much leverage for the downturn that we run through. 
I think there are a number of companies that are severely levered right now. But as you know, we were able to pick up Higman because they were overlevered in a declining market. 
And so it's out there. The bankruptcies, it always seems like they can last longer than you would think when they get over levered. But certainly, there are some people that are very, very stressed here in this current environment. We've seen some pricing go down below cash cost, which is very frustrating, right? Either they're desperate or they don't really understand their cost structure in order to do that. But it's a sign of how bad the market got. 
I'm encouraged with what we're seeing in utility, and I think it will come back pretty quickly. We're starting to see utility move north, which was really good. 
But there are undoubtedly some people out there that are close to bankruptcy. It's probably good for me not to comment specifically about anybody, whether it's on the inland side or the offshore side. I mean you mentioned one of them anyway. 
Yes, it has been 5 years. It's been a tough 5 years. But again, I think we're part of a critical infrastructure to run the U.S. economy. And ultimately, things come back.

And I would tell you, almost all the new construction has been biofuel or electric. And our inbound in the fourth quarter was around all of that. 
So you're spot on. There are a lot of ESG-driven upgrades, which actually do give the owners lower cost of operation. Electric has a little less maintenance. And these biofuel -- [ bi-fuel ] engines give them less cost in terms of fuel. Natural gas is still pretty cheap.

We have heard that there is one refinery that's looking to restart, and that's really good news because it had some large barge utility with it. 
So some of them will restart. I don't think all of them will restart. I think some of them were inherently disadvantaged from a refinery complexity standpoint and refinery efficiency standpoint. 
The other thing is you're seeing biofuel and other environmentally friendly products that our refining customers are adding to their portfolios. And we're starting to see some of those type moves emerge. 
So I don't think there's anything systemically that makes it all go away. EVs, obviously, will have a longer-term impact, but there's a debate about how long that takes and if some of that demand destruction is absorbed or replaced by emerging market demand growth. If you think of the developing economies, typically, they start to burn more energy as they develop. And I don't think that, that phenomena changes. 
So -- but longer term, obviously, we're all thinking about the impact of EVs and what that can do to demand. But I think it's got multiple years, if not decades, to play out. I know some friends with EVs, but they also have a suburban in their garage. So I think it's got a ways to play out."

Earlier today, we announced 2020 fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. The quarter's results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand for Kirby's products and services, particularly in marine transportation, where we experienced low volumes and continued poor market dynamics and poor barge utilization. 
Across the company, we have tightly managed costs, which has helped maintain overall marine transportation margins near 10% and distribution and service margins near breakeven. Our fourth quarter earnings also included a tax benefit as a result of the CARES Act, which Bill will discuss in a few minutes. 
Looking at our segments. In Marine transportation, the inland and coastal markets experienced challenging market conditions, with low demand particularly for the transportation of refined products, crude oil and black oil. Although the economy showed some modest signs of improvement during the quarter, increasing cases of COVID-19, high product inventories and impacts from 2 Gulf Coast hurricanes contributed to a slight sequential decline in quarterly average refinery utilization. During the quarter, refinery utilization averaged 77% compared to a previous 5-year fourth quarter average of 90%, and it ended the quarter at 80%. 
Chemical plant utilization modestly improved 1% sequentially but remained below 2019 levels. 
Overall, for our inland and coastal businesses, there were minimal spot requirements, low barge utilization and additional pricing pressures throughout the quarter. 
In distribution and services, fourth quarter revenues sequentially improved, benefiting from the continued economic recovery, higher product sales in commercial and industrial and some pickup in activity in oil and gas distribution. 
In the commercial and industrial markets, we experienced increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses, higher product sales in Thermo King and increased deliveries of new marine engines. These gains were partially offset, however, by normal seasonality, including lower utilization in the power generation rental fleet following the hurricane season as well as reduced major overhauls in marine repair during the harvest and the dry cargo market. 
In the oil and gas market, activity continued to recover as many E&Ps modestly increased spending during the fourth quarter and well completion activity improved. Active frac crews, which bottomed around 50 in the second quarter, improved every month during the fourth quarter and finished the year in excess of 150. This activity improvement contributed to higher demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our distribution businesses. 
In manufacturing, remanufacturing activity was steady, and we received additional new orders for environmental-friendly fracturing equipment. 
In a few moments, I'll talk about our outlook for 2021. But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our fourth quarter segment results and the balance sheet."
283986,700852398,2184137,"Kirby Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%.  Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues decl",921,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 
In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%.  Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues declined $21.2 million or 7% and operating income declined $3.2 million. The reductions are primarily due to significantly reduced pricing in inland, reductions in inland barge utilization and increased delay days as a result of seasonal weather. Aggressive cost reductions helped to limit the impact on operating margin. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 75% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization declined modestly into the high 60% range as a result of the second wave of COVID-19, continued weak refinery utilization and an extended hurricane season.  Long-term inland marine transportation contracts are those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 70% of revenue, with 62% from time charters and 38% from contracts of affreightment. 
Term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter were down in the low double digits on average. Spot market rates declined approximately 10% sequentially and 25% year-on-year. 
During the fourth quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the low to mid-teens. 
In coastal, the market continued to be challenged by significantly reduced demand for refined products and black oil. We experienced weak spot market dynamics and some charted equipment was returned as term contracts expired. During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the mid-70% range, unchanged sequentially, but down from the mid-80% range in the 2019 fourth quarter.  Average spot market rates were generally stable but term contracts continued to renew lower in the mid-single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, the percentage of coastal revenues under term contracts was approximately 85%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. 
Coastal's operating margin in the fourth quarter was in the negative low to single -- to mid-single digits. 
With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the fourth quarter as well as projections for 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2020 fourth quarter were $190.3 million with an operating loss of $2.9 million.  Compared to the third quarter, revenues improved $14.4 million or 8%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to modest economic improvements and increased product sales in the commercial and industrial market. These gains were offset by lower revenues in the oil and gas market due to the timing of pressure pumping equipment deliveries and manufacturing. Segment operating income declined slightly during the quarter as a result of product and service sales mix. 
In commercial and industrial, modest sequential improvements resulted in increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses. Higher Thermo King product sales and the timing of new marine engine deliveries also contributed to sequential increases in revenue. These were partially offset by normal seasonality, including lower utilization of the power generation rental fleet and reduced major overhaul demand in marine repair. 
During the fourth quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 78% of segment revenue. Operating margin was in the low single digits and was impacted by a higher mix of product and parts revenue during the quarter. 
In oil and gas, revenues and operating income sequentially declined primarily due to reduced deliveries of new pressure pumping equipment and manufacturing. This reduction was partially offset by increased demand for new transmissions, parts and services in oil and gas distribution as U.S. frac activity continued to improve.  During the fourth quarter, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 22% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the mid-teens. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had $80.3 million of cash, total debt was $1.47 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio was 32.2%. 
During the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $85.1 million and we repaid $109.8 million of debt. We also used cash flow and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures of $18.8 million. 
For the full year, we generated $296.7 million of free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. This amount was slightly below the low end of our previously disclosed guidance range of $300 million. This guidance range contemplated a significant income tax refund related to the CARES Act of over $100 million which was not received as expected prior to the end of the year. We now anticipate this refund will be received during the 2021 first quarter. At the end of the year, we had total available liquidity of $684 million. 
Looking forward, capital spending is expected to continue to trend down in 2021. While the full year, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. As a result, we expect to generate free cash flow of $230 million to $330 million, which includes the tax refund previously discussed. 
Before I close, I'd like to address income taxes. During the fourth quarter, we had an effective tax rate benefit as a result of net operating losses, which will carry back to prior higher tax rate years as allowed by the CARES Act legislation. In 2021, we expect our income tax rate will be around 25%. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David to discuss our operational outlook for 2021."

With 2020 in the rearview mirror, it goes without saying we are all hopeful for brighter days in the new year. As we look at our businesses thus far in 2021, we believe some green shoots are materializing. 
In marine transportation, refinery utilization has steadily improved into the low 80% range. Inland spot activity has modestly picked up and our barge utilization has bounced up off the bottom into the low to mid 90 -- mid-70% range. Demand in distribution and services has continued to recover, with an improving economy and more favorable commodity prices. 
While all of this is encouraging, the reality is that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. Demand for our products and services are still near all-time lows and uncertainty around the timing of material economic recovery remains. All of this makes predicting 2021 very challenging with a wide range of possible outcomes. 
In the near term, we expect tough market conditions to persist into the second quarter, particularly in marine transportation, where industry barge utilization is very low and we are experiencing very competitive pricing dynamics. As well, the latest wave of COVID-19 cases has resulted in some challenges crewing our vessels, particularly in coastal. 
In distribution and services, the magnitude and timing of the recovery is dependent on an economic recovery and stability in the oil and gas markets. 
That being said, although we are starting the year with near-term pressures and uncertainty, we are very optimistic that the second half of 2021 will be materially better. In the meantime, we intend to remain very focused on cost control, capital discipline, cash generation and debt reduction.  
Diving into the businesses, in the inland market, we expect the current challenging market dynamics to continue in the near term, with gradual improvement in the second quarter, followed by a more meaningful recovery in the second half of the year as demand improves. 
In the first quarter, we anticipate our results will sequentially decline and be the lowest of the year. Increased delays from normal seasonal winter weather as well as lower pricing on term contract renewals are expected to be more than offset -- expected to more than offset very modest improvements in our average barge utilization. 
Beyond the first quarter, activity should begin to recover with an improving economy, which should lead to more favorable spot market dynamics. Even with the pandemic, new petrochemical plants are still scheduled to come online. There has been very limited construction of new barges and significant retirement of barges are occurring across the industry. All of this should help improve the market and is expected to contribute to a meaningful improvement in barge utilization likely into the high 80% to low 90% range by the end of the year. 
With respect to pricing, we expect pressure to persist in the near term as rates typically move with barge utilization. As a result, although market conditions are looking more favorable later in the year, we expect full year revenues and operating margins to decline compared to 2020, driven by lower average barge utilization and the full year impact of lower pricing on term contract renewals. 
In coastal, tough market conditions and low barge utilization are expected to have a meaningful impact on 2021 coastal results and contribute to year-on-year reduction in revenues and operating losses in this business. During 2020, the majority of the coastal fleet operated under term contracts established in more favorable markets during 2019 and in early 2020. These contracts helped to minimize the financial impact as demand fell throughout the pandemic. However, with many of these contracts now starting to expire and low demand for refined products and black oil expected for a while longer, we now expect lower overall pricing in 2021 for the coastal business. As well, the retirement of 3 older large capacity coastal vessels in 2020 due to ballast water treatment requirements and the retirement of an additional barge scheduled for mid-2021 will contribute to lower revenue and operating margin compared to 2020. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect coastal revenues and operating margin will decline sequentially due to continued weakness in the spot market, pricing pressure and recent challenges crewing our vessels. Similar to inland, we expect coastal market conditions will improve as the year progresses, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of 2021. 
Looking at distribution and services, we expect a more robust economy and increased activity in the oilfield will result in material year-over-year improvements in demand for much of the segment. 
In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway, with increasing truck fleet miles, and an initial recovery in bus repair demand as activity resumes and work -- and return to work commences. We also anticipate some additional growth in on-highway part sales as a result of the recent launch of our new online sales platform. Elsewhere, demand for new installations, parts and services in power generation is expected to grow as demand for electrification and 24/7 power intensifies. 
In oil and gas, we expect current improved oil prices will contribute to increased rig counts and well completions during 2021. Industry analysts have predicted the average active frac crew count could climb back to near 200, which is a notable improvement from 2020 levels. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in distribution as well as increased remanufacturing activities on existing pressure pumping equipment. 
With respect to manufacturing of new equipment, the current excess of traditional pressure pumping capacity across the industry will likely restrain significant orders of conventional fleets. However, a heightened focus on ESG in both energy and industrial sectors is expected to result in increased demand for Kirby's extensive portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment throughout the year. 
Overall, in distribution and services, we expect 2021 revenues and operating income will materially improve as compared to 2020, with commercial and industrial representing approximately 70% and oil and gas representing 30% of segment revenues for the full year. Although the range is dependent on the timing of a material economic recovery, we expect segment operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest. We expect a normal seasonal reduction during the fourth quarter. 
To close out 2020, it was a difficult year with unprecedented challenges. The efforts of our dedicated employees to ensure business continuity, remain focused on safety and to aggressively reduce costs were commendable. I'm very proud of our accomplishments amidst a very challenging backdrop. 
Looking forward, although some near-term challenges and uncertainty remain, we are confident Kirby is in a strong position to meaningfully recover when the pandemic eases and demand for our products and services improves. 
In marine transportation, it was only 1 year ago that inland barge utilization was at an all-time high. Inland operating margins were near 20% and  prices were materially increasing in both inland and coastal. Although demand has significantly declined since that time because of the pandemic, industry supply is in check, with very limited new barge construction in inland, no incremental capacity plan in coastal and significant retirements across both sectors. All of this is very positive for our businesses and is expected to contribute to a meaningful tightening in the barge market once demand improves. When you consider our inland fleet expansion over the last 3 years, which is approximately 40% higher on barrel capacity basis, as well as our recent efforts to improve the efficiency of our inland and coastal fleets, we believe there is a significant earnings potential in marine transportation. 
In distribution and services, while managing through the pandemic and unprecedented downturn, we were very focused on improving our business during 2020. Throughout the year, we took aggressive and proactive steps to streamline and rightsize the business for the near term while strengthening it for the long term, including consolidating businesses, support functions and management teams; renewing and expanding OEM relationships and product offerings; completing the implementation of a common ERP system; rolling out a new online parts sales platform; and developing and prototyping new products for the expanding wave of electrification. Overall, we anticipate improved results as the economy grows and oilfield activity recovers. And our efforts during 2020 will meaningfully contribute to more favorable long-term returns of this segment. 
Finally, from a liquidity perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of nearly $300 million in a very difficult year and we made significant progress in paying down debt. We expect 2021 will be a strong cash flow year, with expectations of $230 million to $330 million of free cash flow for the full year. We intend to use this cash flow to pay down debt and enhance liquidity.

And I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on both inland and coastal, but I think we went into this downturn with about, call it 3,900 inland barges. Where do you think we're going to stand maybe at the end of 2021? How much capacity do you think the industry is going to take out just because of the difficulty we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months? And then I'd be curious to get your thoughts kind of looking at the coastal market the same way. How much capacity do you think is going to come out by the time we get to the other side of this?"

So the number of new barge deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you",481,"Yes. So the number of new barge deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. 
The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you this, because we do know Kirby's numbers. We had originally planned to retire only 10 barges in 2020, we ended up retiring about 95. So our retirement alone made a significant dent in that -- that impacted new barges. But I would say this, I fully expect the number of retirements will be north of 150 to maybe even north of 200 retirements in 2020. We'll see. Informa does a survey that comes out in March or April, and we'll get a better feel for the retirements. 
When we look at 2021, we know that there were 36 barges that carried over into 2021 that weren't delivered, that were ordered pre pandemic. So there's not a lot of new construction on the horizon and retirements are continuing. We know, just from our network, that there's been a lot of retirements. We just don't have a good number on it. 
So net-net, I think barge capacity goes down considerably in -- considerably is hard to quantify, but it will be meaningful for 2021.  And Jack, as we said in our prepared remarks, just prior to the pandemic, Kirby's utilization was at an all-time high. We were over 95% utilized. So that should bode well when demand comes back. 
But on the new build side, one, steel prices, scrap steel prices are up, that's actually helped the retirement, but it also has raised the cost of new barges. We're hearing in the market that just a new barge, whether it's a 10,000 barrel or a 30,000 barrel or a black oil or a clean barge, that because of steel prices and other costs, the pricing of new barges is up 25% to 35%. So that, to me, is a very good sign. That means it's going to be very expensive to build new capacity. 
So we're pretty bullish on the supply and demand situation on the inland side. And I would say it's even better on the coastal side. There's really no new capacity coming in. OSG had a couple of units that they had built for replacement. Those essentially have delivered. There's nothing really on order that I'm aware of. And I think that there's a very long lead time, right? I mean if you're going to order an offshore barge, it's -- even if you had the design in the drawer, it's probably at least 2 years before you would get it. So I think the elasticity in the coastal business is going to be even greater when it comes back.  So we're pretty happy with the supply and demand situation right now."

Our renewals typically are ratable through the year, with the fourth quarter being the heaviest. If there's one quarter that's heavy, it's the fourth quarter, because everybody kind of has a year-end mindset or there's a lot of year-end mindset. So when we look at renewals, it's not particularly heavy here in the first half. 
I would say, look, you heard the numbers. We're not hiding them in our prepared remarks. Spot pricing was down 10% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. And term pricing was down kind of low double digits on renewals in the fourth quarter.  So look, that is part of our message today, is that margins are going to be under pressure this year as those prices roll through. 
But to your point, that will change as utility goes up. Pricing should start to go the other direction. And we have a pretty big spot portfolio. Right now, we're about 30% spot, 70% contract. And that's -- that's going to give us a good bit of equipment that can rise pretty quickly.  And then there's the contracts that do renew in the first half. Those will be pretty low, but then the second half should be better. 
So we should get, as prices rise, it should come through pretty quick. But as you've seen in the past, it takes about 1 year for things to roll through in the margin, both on the upside and then on the downside. So it will take some while, but we do have that big slug of spot equipment that can reprice pretty quickly."

What you will see, and this will take some time for us to roll out. We've invested in R&D and new product developments. We alluded to it in the prepared comments. 
Look, electrification is happening. And Stewart & Stevenson, in particular, has some great technology and know-how and engineering resources. And we've got some really good ESG-centric products that are rolling out. So we're pretty excited about that. Some of that is being applied to the oilfield. 
We -- as you know, we've made a lot of electric fracs over the years. And those are the kind of the --  one style of electric frac is to use gas turbines to drive electric drive and then to a pump. But there's basically electric grids now that can drive electric pumps and using natural gas generation to generate the electric power. We're right in the square middle of that and that's getting some traction. But also importantly, those electrification products are -- can be used well outside the oilfield. And we're working hard on that. It's not anything we're ready to give you numbers for you to build into your model, but I will tell you, it's moving along with a lot of speed and there's a lot of excitement in the company about that.  So when you roll that together with the lean cost structure, a rebound in the economy and commercial and industrial being about 75% of distribution and services, we're pretty excited about it. 
Now does that mean we'd put new capital in there? No. I think that's one of the great things about D&S is it doesn't require a lot of capital. It's got a pretty low capital base. It generally is around working capital is where you deploy the capital. So that's probably a long nonanswer, but I would characterize it as we're pretty excited about what we've got in front of us. We made a lot of good changes, a lot of investments during 2020. And I think KDS is poised to really contribute to Kirby's bottom line."

But let's stick with inland first. When you walked through your thoughts on the environment, so you've mentioned some new capacity, the continued retirements, but utilization at refineries creeping up from lows. Maybe you can talk about how long does it take for you to see that in rates? Is it something we -- you're talking about a quarter? Or is it longer than that?

Right now -- well, let me talk to utilization for a quick second because that is what drives pricing, right? The view that utilization is tightening and it is tightening and that it's going to continue for a while, that mindset is what helps drive pricing. 
Our utilization in the fourth quarter kind of dipped to the high 60%, which is the lowest we've ever seen it. But we're starting to see it in the low 70s now. I think we're between 70% and 75% utility. And it keeps inching up. Part of that, to your point, is refinery utilization coming back. We've seen refinery utilization tick up. But be careful with refinery utilization because there's a mathematical thing going on, as they shut down some of the refineries, the denominator fell a bit. So even though the nameplate utilization is higher, it's probably 2% to 3% higher than on a constant capacity basis. 
But the key is that, that refinery utilization keeps ticking up, which helps our utility and the volumes we move. And so we're starting to see it climb. Very encouraged with where utility is going so far this year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that says that, that's not going to continue. And it won't take long to get -- get pricing to stop its decline and to start its climb. I wish I could give you a definitive date. Does that happen in the first quarter or the second quarter or even the third quarter? I'm not sure. But I do think it happens this year, and I think it will move pretty quickly because there hasn't been a lot of building. As we talked about earlier, the supply and demand balance should tighten really rapidly, and that should get the pricing go in the other direction rather quickly. Sorry, I can't be more definitive on that. 
And you mentioned coastal having a tough time. It's the same dynamic in coastal, except I actually think the elasticity in coastals is stronger because they're just bigger units and they move further. Now that said, though, as you know, coastal is a lot more refined products. So it's been impacted a little harder in terms of structure of the industry than inland. But again, I think the same dynamics hold, as utility comes up. You'll see pricing snap back pretty quickly and you'll see things go back on contract. We've seen more equipment move from term to spot because our customers just didn't have the volumes. We look forward to that changing and I think it's starting to change now. 
I mean, the encouraging thing we saw in the COVID statistics is there was a pretty strong downward trend in a number of new infections. So I guess it looks like everything's headed in the right direction."

So on these very expensive units, you can use a week's -- a week's charter hire just going through that process of getting it to shore, getting the crew off, recrewing it after you sanitize it. So yes, it can be meaningful if you get a lot of that. And we've had some. We had some in the fourth quarter. We've had some in the first quarter. Take a unit that's earning $30,000, $40,000 a day, and you lose that for a week, it starts to add up pretty quickly. But the bigger issue is just demand decline that had happened.

No. The sequential decline, we foreshadowed, we talked about it. But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, you typically get, one, a lot of rental income on power generation",416,"Yes. No. The sequential decline, we foreshadowed, we talked about it. But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, you typically get, one, a lot of rental income on power generation because of the hurricane season, and that carries over a little bit into the fourth quarter. But typically, we'll see our rental utilization fall in the fourth quarter for power, standby backup power that gets deployed during hurricane season. That happened in the fourth quarter kind of as we predicted. And so that's part of it. 
The other part of it is our marine repair, diesel engine marine repair and gearbox repair business has some seasonality in the fourth quarter as well because the dry cargo fleet goes to work in the fourth quarter to move the harvest. So basically, we get a little more business in the third quarter and then the dry cargo operators put all their equipment to work. And so we don't have as much work -- repair work in the fourth quarter. 
So both of those contribute to the seasonality that we see and the sequential decline. Some of that will start to reverse in the first quarter. You'll see some more maintenance on the marine repair. But hopefully, we don't have any hurricanes hit us in the first quarter. So we'll get some snapback on that. But what really is going to help D&S is some of the product deliveries and the U.S. economy coming back. We sell a lot of spare parts and a lot of truck parts and a lot of backup power, a lot of bus repair, all of that is economic-driven. And as the economy comes back, that should start to drive the profitability. 
And then on oil and gas, we took some orders in the fourth quarter. Those will start to deliver in the first and second quarter. So we should start to see some profitability from that.  In terms of when do we go profitable in the quarter, I'm not prepared to say that. But I think we've said for the full year, we expect D&S to be kind of mid-single -- low to mid single-digit operating margins with revenue up. And I'll give you a little feel for revenue. It could be up 10% to 30%, just depending on when the U.S. economy starts to get really, really humming. So we're pretty optimistic about KDS for 2021."

But you did bring up wind, and that is an exciting area. I think if you look at some of the plans, particularly on the East Coast, the number of projects is enormous. I think there's, what is it, 28 gig of wind power that's planned. That's an enormous amount of work for Jones Act compliant vessels. The good news is President Biden came out and supported the Jones Act just recently. I think there'll be opportunities for Jones Act marine companies to support the development of wind. And that can take -- there's a number of different types of vessels that can go out there. There's the installation type vessels. There's transportation to get the equipment out to -- out to the sites where the wind mills are. 
And then, of course, there's maintenance and repair and crewing vessels. So that could be a significant growth area. Clearly, Kirby is looking at that. We're one of the largest marine companies in the United States. We're in discussions. We're not in liberty to really say much more than that. But it could be a meaningful growth opportunity.

I think there are a number of companies that are severely levered right now. But as you know, we were able to pick up Higman because they were overlevered in a declining market. 
And so it's out there. The bankruptcies, it always seems like they can last longer than you would think when they get overlevered. But certainly, there are some people that are very, very stressed here in this current environment. We've seen some pricing go down below cash cost, which is very frustrating, right? Either they're desperate or they don't really understand their cost structure in order to do that. But it's a sign of how bad the market got.  I'm encouraged with what we're seeing in utility, and I think it will come back pretty quickly. We're starting to see utility move north, which was really good.

And I would tell you, almost all the new construction has been biofuel or electric. And our inbound in the fourth quarter was around all of that. 
So you're spot on. There are a lot of ESG-driven upgrades, which actually do give the owners lower cost of operation. Electric has a little less maintenance. And these biofuel -- bi-fuel engines give them less cost in terms of fuel. Natural gas is still pretty cheap.  And so there have been a number of conversions.

We have heard that there is one refinery that's looking to restart, and that's really good news because it had some barge utility with it. So some of them will restart. I don't think all of them will restart. I think some of them were inherently disadvantaged from a refinery complexity standpoint and refinery efficiency standpoint.  The other thing is you're seeing biofuel and other environmentally friendly products that our refining customers are adding to their portfolios. And we're starting to see some of those type moves emerge. 
So I don't think there's anything systemically that makes it all go away. EVs, obviously, will have a longer-term impact, but there's a debate about how long that takes and if some of that demand destruction is absorbed or replaced by emerging market demand growth. If you think of the developing economies, typically, they start to burn more energy as they develop. And I don't think that, that phenomena changes. 
So -- but longer term, obviously, we're all thinking about the impact of EVs and what that can do to demand. But I think it's got multiple years, if not decades, to play out. I know some friends with EVs, but they also have a suburban in their garage. So I think it's got a ways to play out."

Earlier today, we announced 2020 fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. The quarter's results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand for Kirby's products and services, particularly in marine transportation, where we experienced low volumes and continued poor market dynamics and poor barge utilization. 
Across the company, we have tightly managed costs, which has helped maintain overall marine transportation margins near 10% and distribution and service margins near breakeven. Our fourth quarter earnings also included a tax benefit as a result of the CARES Act, which Bill will discuss in a few minutes. 
Looking at our segments. In Marine transportation, the inland and coastal markets experienced challenging market conditions, with low demand particularly for the transportation of refined products, crude oil and black oil. Although the economy showed some modest signs of improvement during the quarter, increasing cases of COVID-19, high product inventories and impacts from 2 Gulf Coast hurricanes contributed to a slight sequential decline in quarterly average refinery utilization. During the quarter, refinery utilization averaged 77% compared to a previous 5-year fourth quarter average of 90%, and it ended the quarter at 80%. 
Chemical plant utilization modestly improved 1% sequentially but remained below 2019 levels. 
Overall, for our inland and coastal businesses, there were minimal spot requirements, low barge utilization and additional pricing pressures throughout the quarter. 
In distribution and services, fourth quarter revenues sequentially improved, benefiting from the continued economic recovery, higher product sales in commercial and industrial and some pickup in activity in oil and gas distribution. 
In the commercial and industrial markets, we experienced increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses, higher product sales in Thermo King and increased deliveries of new marine engines. These gains were partially offset, however, by normal seasonality, including lower utilization in the power generation rental fleet following the hurricane season as well as reduced major overhauls in marine repair during the harvest and the dry cargo market. 
In the oil and gas market, activity continued to recover as many E&Ps modestly increased spending during the fourth quarter and well completion activity improved. Active frac crews, which bottomed around 50 in the second quarter, improved every month during the fourth quarter and finished the year in excess of 150. This activity improvement contributed to higher demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our distribution businesses. 
In manufacturing, remanufacturing activity was steady, and we received additional new orders for environmental-friendly fracturing equipment. 
In a few moments, I'll talk about our outlook for 2021. But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our fourth quarter segment results and the balance sheet."
283986,700852398,2252277,"Kirby Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%.

In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues declined $21.2 million or 7% and operating income declined $3.2 million. The reductions are primarily due to significantly reduced pricing in inland, reductions in inland barge utilization and increased delay days as a result of seasonal weather. Aggressive cost reductions helped to limit the impact on operating margin. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 75% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization declined modestly into the high 60% range as a result of the second wave of COVID-19, continued weak refinery utilization and an extended hurricane season. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts are those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 70% of revenue, with 62% from time charters and 38% from contracts of affreightment. 
Term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter were down in the low double digits on average. Spot market rates declined approximately 10% sequentially and 25% year-on-year. 
During the fourth quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the low to mid-teens. 
In coastal, the market continued to be challenged by significantly reduced demand for refined products and black oil. We experienced weak spot market dynamics and some charted equipment was returned as term contracts expired. During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the mid-70% range, unchanged sequentially, but down from the mid-80% range in the 2019 fourth quarter. Average spot market rates were generally stable but term contracts continued to renew lower in the mid-single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, the percentage of coastal revenues under term contracts was approximately 85%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. Coastal's operating margin in the fourth quarter was in the negative low to single -- to mid-single digits. 
With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the fourth quarter as well as projections for 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2020 fourth quarter were $190.3 million with an operating loss of $2.9 million. Compared to the third quarter, revenues improved $14.4 million or 8%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to modest economic improvements and increased product sales in the commercial and industrial market. These gains were offset by lower revenues in the oil and gas market due to the timing of pressure pumping equipment deliveries and manufacturing. Segment operating income declined slightly during the quarter as a result of product and service sales mix. 
In commercial and industrial, modest sequential improvements resulted in increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses. Higher Thermo King product sales and the timing of new marine engine deliveries also contributed to sequential increases in revenue. These were partially offset by normal seasonality, including lower utilization of the power generation rental fleet and reduced major overhaul demand in marine repair. 
During the fourth quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 78% of segment revenue. Operating margin was in the low single digits and was impacted by a higher mix of product and parts revenue during the quarter. 
In oil and gas, revenues and operating income sequentially declined primarily due to reduced deliveries of new pressure pumping equipment and manufacturing. This reduction was partially offset by increased demand for new transmissions, parts and services in oil and gas distribution as U.S. frac activity continued to improve. During the fourth quarter, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 22% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the mid-teens. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had $80.3 million of cash, total debt was $1.47 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio was 32.2%. 
During the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $85.1 million and we repaid $109.8 million of debt. We also used cash flow and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures of $18.8 million. 
For the full year, we generated $296.7 million of free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. This amount was slightly below the low end of our previously disclosed guidance range of $300 million. This guidance range contemplated a significant income tax refund related to the CARES Act of over $100 million which was not received as expected prior to the end of the year. We now anticipate this refund will be received during the 2021 first quarter. At the end of the year, we had total available liquidity of $684 million. 
Looking forward, capital spending is expected to continue to trend down in 2021. While the full year, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. As a result, we expect to generate free cash flow of $230 million to $330 million, which includes the tax refund previously discussed. 
Before I close, I'd like to address income taxes. During the fourth quarter, we had an effective tax rate benefit as a result of net operating losses, which will carry back to prior higher tax rate years as allowed by the CARES Act legislation. In 2021, we expect our income tax rate will be around 25%. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David to discuss our operational outlook for 2021."

With 2020 in the rearview mirror, it goes without saying we are all hopeful for brighter days in the new year. As we look at our businesses thus far in 2021, we believe some green shoots are materializing. 
In marine transportation, refinery utilization has steadily improved into the low 80% range. Inland spot activity has modestly picked up and our barge utilization has bounced up off the bottom into the low to mid 90 -- mid-70% range. Demand in distribution and services has continued to recover, with an improving economy and more favorable commodity prices. 
While all of this is encouraging, the reality is that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. Demand for our products and services are still near all-time lows and uncertainty around the timing of material economic recovery remains. All of this makes predicting 2021 very challenging with a wide range of possible outcomes. 
In the near term, we expect tough market conditions to persist into the second quarter, particularly in marine transportation, where industry barge utilization is very low and we are experiencing very competitive pricing dynamics. As well, the latest wave of COVID-19 cases has resulted in some challenges crewing our vessels, particularly in coastal. 
In distribution and services, the magnitude and timing of the recovery is dependent on an economic recovery and stability in the oil and gas markets. 
That being said, although we are starting the year with near-term pressures and uncertainty, we are very optimistic that the second half of 2021 will be materially better. In the meantime, we intend to remain very focused on cost control, capital discipline, cash generation and debt reduction. 
Diving into the businesses, in the inland market, we expect the current challenging market dynamics to continue in the near term, with gradual improvement in the second quarter, followed by a more meaningful recovery in the second half of the year as demand improves. 
In the first quarter, we anticipate our results will sequentially decline and be the lowest of the year. Increased delays from normal seasonal winter weather as well as lower pricing on term contract renewals are expected to be more than offset -- expected to more than offset very modest improvements in our average barge utilization. 
Beyond the first quarter, activity should begin to recover with an improving economy, which should lead to more favorable spot market dynamics. Even with the pandemic, new petrochemical plants are still scheduled to come online. There has been very limited construction of new barges and significant retirement of barges are occurring across the industry. All of this should help improve the market and is expected to contribute to a meaningful improvement in barge utilization likely into the high 80% to low 90% range by the end of the year. 
With respect to pricing, we expect pressure to persist in the near term as rates typically move with barge utilization. As a result, although market conditions are looking more favorable later in the year, we expect full year revenues and operating margins to decline compared to 2020, driven by lower average barge utilization and the full year impact of lower pricing on term contract renewals. 
In coastal, tough market conditions and low barge utilization are expected to have a meaningful impact on 2021 coastal results and contribute to year-on-year reduction in revenues and operating losses in this business. During 2020, the majority of the coastal fleet operated under term contracts established in more favorable markets during 2019 and in early 2020. These contracts helped to minimize the financial impact as demand fell throughout the pandemic. However, with many of these contracts now starting to expire and low demand for refined products and black oil expected for a while longer, we now expect lower overall pricing in 2021 for the coastal business. As well, the retirement of 3 older large capacity coastal vessels in 2020 due to ballast water treatment requirements and the retirement of an additional barge scheduled for mid-2021 will contribute to lower revenue and operating margin compared to 2020. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect coastal revenues and operating margin will decline sequentially due to continued weakness in the spot market, pricing pressure and recent challenges crewing our vessels. Similar to inland, we expect coastal market conditions will improve as the year progresses, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of 2021. 
Looking at distribution and services, we expect a more robust economy and increased activity in the oilfield will result in material year-over-year improvements in demand for much of the segment. 
In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway, with increasing truck fleet miles, and an initial recovery in bus repair demand as activity resumes and work -- and return to work commences. We also anticipate some additional growth in on-highway part sales as a result of the recent launch of our new online sales platform. Elsewhere, demand for new installations, parts and services in power generation is expected to grow as demand for electrification and 24/7 power intensifies. 
In oil and gas, we expect current improved oil prices will contribute to increased rig counts and well completions during 2021. Industry analysts have predicted the average active frac crew count could climb back to near 200, which is a notable improvement from 2020 levels. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in distribution as well as increased remanufacturing activities on existing pressure pumping equipment. 
With respect to manufacturing of new equipment, the current excess of traditional pressure pumping capacity across the industry will likely restrain significant orders of conventional fleets. However, a heightened focus on ESG in both energy and industrial sectors is expected to result in increased demand for Kirby's extensive portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment throughout the year. 
Overall, in distribution and services, we expect 2021 revenues and operating income will materially improve as compared to 2020, with commercial and industrial representing approximately 70% and oil and gas representing 30% of segment revenues for the full year. Although the range is dependent on the timing of a material economic recovery, we expect segment operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest. We expect a normal seasonal reduction during the fourth quarter. 
To close out 2020, it was a difficult year with unprecedented challenges. The efforts of our dedicated employees to ensure business continuity, remain focused on safety and to aggressively reduce costs were commendable. I'm very proud of our accomplishments amidst a very challenging backdrop. 
Looking forward, although some near-term challenges and uncertainty remain, we are confident Kirby is in a strong position to meaningfully recover when the pandemic eases and demand for our products and services improves. 
In marine transportation, it was only 1 year ago that inland barge utilization was at an all-time high. Inland operating margins were near 20% and prices were materially increasing in both inland and coastal. Although demand has significantly declined since that time because of the pandemic, industry supply is in check, with very limited new barge construction in inland, no incremental capacity plan in coastal and significant retirements across both sectors. All of this is very positive for our businesses and is expected to contribute to a meaningful tightening in the barge market once demand improves. When you consider our inland fleet expansion over the last 3 years, which is approximately 40% higher on barrel capacity basis as well as our recent efforts to improve the efficiency of our inland and coastal fleets, we believe there is a significant earnings potential in marine transportation. 
In distribution and services, while managing through the pandemic and unprecedented downturn, we were very focused on improving our business during 2020. Throughout the year, we took aggressive and proactive steps to streamline and rightsize the business for the near term while strengthening it for the long term, including consolidating businesses, support functions and management teams; renewing and expanding OEM relationships and product offerings; completing the implementation of a common ERP system; rolling out a new online parts sales platform; and developing and prototyping new products for the expanding wave of electrification. Overall, we anticipate improved results as the economy grows and oilfield activity recovers. And our efforts during 2020 will meaningfully contribute to more favorable long-term returns of this segment. 
Finally, from a liquidity perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of nearly $300 million in a very difficult year and we made significant progress in paying down debt. We expect 2021 will be a strong cash flow year, with expectations of $230 million to $330 million of free cash flow for the full year. We intend to use this cash flow to pay down debt and enhance liquidity.

And I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on both inland and coastal, but I think we went into this downturn with about, call it 3,900 inland barges. Where do you think we're going to stand maybe at the end of 2021? How much capacity do you think the industry is going to take out just because of the difficulty we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months? And then I'd be curious to get your thoughts kind of looking at the coastal market the same way. How much capacity do you think is going to come out by the time we get to the other side of this?"

So the number of new barge deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you",481,"Yes. So the number of new barge deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. 
The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you this, because we do know Kirby's numbers. We had originally planned to retire only 10 barges in 2020, we ended up retiring about 95. So our retirement alone made a significant dent in that -- that impacted new barges. But I would say this, I fully expect the number of retirements will be north of 150 to maybe even north of 200 retirements in 2020. We'll see. Informa does a survey that comes out in March or April, and we'll get a better feel for the retirements. 
When we look at 2021, we know that there were 36 barges that carried over into 2021 that weren't delivered, that were ordered pre pandemic. So there's not a lot of new construction on the horizon and retirements are continuing. We know, just from our network, that there's been a lot of retirements. We just don't have a good number on it. 
So net-net, I think barge capacity goes down considerably in -- considerably is hard to quantify, but it will be meaningful for 2021. And Jack, as we said in our prepared remarks, just prior to the pandemic, Kirby's utilization was at an all-time high. We were over 95% utilized. So that should bode well when demand comes back. 
But on the new build side, one, steel prices, scrap steel prices are up, that's actually helped the retirement, but it also has raised the cost of new barges. We're hearing in the market that just a new barge, whether it's a 10,000 barrel or a 30,000 barrel or a black oil or a clean barge, that because of steel prices and other costs, the pricing of new barges is up 25% to 35%. So that, to me, is a very good sign. That means it's going to be very expensive to build new capacity. 
So we're pretty bullish on the supply and demand situation on the inland side. And I would say it's even better on the coastal side. There's really no new capacity coming in. OSG had a couple of units that they had built for replacement. Those essentially have delivered. There's nothing really on order that I'm aware of. And I think that there's a very long lead time, right? I mean if you're going to order an offshore barge, it's -- even if you had the design in the drawer, it's probably at least 2 years before you would get it. So I think the elasticity in the coastal business is going to be even greater when it comes back. So we're pretty happy with the supply and demand situation right now."

Our renewals typically are ratable through the year, with the fourth quarter being the heaviest. If there's one quarter that's heavy, it's the fourth quarter, because everybody kind of has a year-end mindset or there's a lot of year-end mindset. So when we look at renewals, it's not particularly heavy here in the first half. 
I would say, look, you heard the numbers. We're not hiding them in our prepared remarks. Spot pricing was down 10% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. And term pricing was down kind of low double digits on renewals in the fourth quarter. So look, that is part of our message today, is that margins are going to be under pressure this year as those prices roll through. 
But to your point, that will change as utility goes up. Pricing should start to go the other direction. And we have a pretty big spot portfolio. Right now, we're about 30% spot, 70% contract. And that's -- that's going to give us a good bit of equipment that can rise pretty quickly. And then there's the contracts that do renew in the first half. Those will be pretty low, but then the second half should be better. 
So we should get, as prices rise, it should come through pretty quick. But as you've seen in the past, it takes about 1 year for things to roll through in the margin, both on the upside and then on the downside. So it will take some while, but we do have that big slug of spot equipment that can reprice pretty quickly."

What you will see, and this will take some time for us to roll out. We've invested in R&D and new product developments. We alluded to it in the prepared comments. 
Look, electrification is happening. And Stewart & Stevenson, in particular, has some great technology and know-how and engineering resources. And we've got some really good ESG-centric products that are rolling out. So we're pretty excited about that. Some of that is being applied to the oilfield. 
We -- as you know, we've made a lot of electric fracs over the years. And those are the kind of the -- one style of electric frac is to use gas turbines to drive electric drive and then to a pump. But there's basically electric grids now that can drive electric pumps and using natural gas generation to generate the electric power. We're right in the square middle of that and that's getting some traction. But also importantly, those electrification products are -- can be used well outside the oilfield. And we're working hard on that. It's not anything we're ready to give you numbers for you to build into your model, but I will tell you, it's moving along with a lot of speed and there's a lot of excitement in the company about that. So when you roll that together with the lean cost structure, a rebound in the economy and commercial and industrial being about 75% of distribution and services, we're pretty excited about it. 
Now does that mean we'd put new capital in there? No. I think that's one of the great things about D&S is it doesn't require a lot of capital. It's got a pretty low capital base. It generally is around working capital is where you deploy the capital. So that's probably a long nonanswer, but I would characterize it as we're pretty excited about what we've got in front of us. We made a lot of good changes, a lot of investments during 2020. And I think KDS is poised to really contribute to Kirby's bottom line."

But let's stick with inland first. When you walked through your thoughts on the environment, so you've mentioned some new capacity, the continued retirements, but utilization at refineries creeping up from lows. Maybe you can talk about how long does it take for you to see that in rates? Is it something we -- you're talking about a quarter? Or is it longer than that? How long does it typically take to see that environment change?"

Right now -- well, let me talk to utilization for a quick second because that is what drives pricing, right? The view that utilization is tightening and it is tightening and that it's going to continue for a while, that mindset is what helps drive pricing. 
Our utilization in the fourth quarter kind of dipped to the high 60%, which is the lowest we've ever seen it. But we're starting to see it in the low 70s now. I think we're between 70% and 75% utility. And it keeps inching up. Part of that, to your point, is refinery utilization coming back. We've seen refinery utilization tick up. But be careful with refinery utilization because there's a mathematical thing going on, as they shut down some of the refineries, the denominator fell a bit. So even though the nameplate utilization is higher, it's probably 2% to 3% higher than on a constant capacity basis. 
But the key is that, that refinery utilization keeps ticking up, which helps our utility and the volumes we move. And so we're starting to see it climb. Very encouraged with where utility is going so far this year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that says that, that's not going to continue. And it won't take long to get -- get pricing to stop its decline and to start its climb. I wish I could give you a definitive date. Does that happen in the first quarter or the second quarter or even the third quarter? I'm not sure. But I do think it happens this year, and I think it will move pretty quickly because there hasn't been a lot of building. As we talked about earlier, the supply and demand balance should tighten really rapidly, and that should get the pricing go in the other direction rather quickly. Sorry, I can't be more definitive on that. 
And you mentioned coastal having a tough time. It's the same dynamic in coastal, except I actually think the elasticity in coastals is stronger because they're just bigger units and they move further. Now that said, though, as you know, coastal is a lot more refined products. So it's been impacted a little harder in terms of structure of the industry than inland. But again, I think the same dynamics hold, as utility comes up. You'll see pricing snap back pretty quickly and you'll see things go back on contract. We've seen more equipment move from term to spot because our customers just didn't have the volumes. We look forward to that changing and I think it's starting to change now. 
I mean, the encouraging thing we saw in the COVID statistics is there was a pretty strong downward trend in a number of new infections. So I guess it looks like everything's headed in the right direction."

So on these very expensive units, you can use a week's -- a week's charter hire just going through that process of getting it to shore, getting the crew off, recrewing it after you sanitize it. So yes, it can be meaningful if you get a lot of that. And we've had some. We had some in the fourth quarter. We've had some in the first quarter. Take a unit that's earning $30,000, $40,000 a day, and you lose that for a week, it starts to add up pretty quickly. But the bigger issue is just demand decline that had happened.

No. The sequential decline, we foreshadowed, we talked about it. But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.

But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, you typically get, one, a lot of rental income on power generation because of the hurricane season, and that carries over a little bit into the fourth quarter. But typically, we'll see our rental utilization fall in the fourth quarter for power, standby backup power that gets deployed during hurricane season. That happened in the fourth quarter kind of as we predicted. And so that's part of it. 
The other part of it is our marine repair, diesel engine marine repair and gearbox repair business has some seasonality in the fourth quarter as well because the dry cargo fleet goes to work in the fourth quarter to move the harvest. So basically, we get a little more business in the third quarter and then the dry cargo operators put all their equipment to work. And so we don't have as much work -- repair work in the fourth quarter. 
So both of those contribute to the seasonality that we see and the sequential decline. Some of that will start to reverse in the first quarter. You'll see some more maintenance on the marine repair. But hopefully, we don't have any hurricanes hit us in the first quarter. So we'll get some snapback on that. But what really is going to help D&S is some of the product deliveries and the U.S. economy coming back. We sell a lot of spare parts and a lot of truck parts and a lot of backup power, a lot of bus repair, all of that is economic-driven. And as the economy comes back, that should start to drive the profitability. 
And then on oil and gas, we took some orders in the fourth quarter. Those will start to deliver in the first and second quarter. So we should start to see some profitability from that. In terms of when do we go profitable in the quarter, I'm not prepared to say that. But I think we've said for the full year, we expect D&S to be kind of mid-single -- low to mid-single-digit operating margins with revenue up. And I'll give you a little feel for revenue. It could be up 10% to 30%, just depending on when the U.S. economy starts to get really, really humming. So we're pretty optimistic about KDS for 2021."

But you did bring up wind, and that is an exciting area. I think if you look at some of the plans, particularly on the East Coast, the number of projects is enormous. I think there's, what is it, 28 gig of wind power that's planned. That's an enormous amount of work for Jones Act compliant vessels. The good news is President Biden came out and supported the Jones Act just recently. I think there'll be opportunities for Jones Act marine companies to support the development of wind. And that can take -- there's a number of different types of vessels that can go out there. There's the installation type vessels. There's transportation to get the equipment out to -- out to the sites where the wind mills are. 
And then, of course, there's maintenance and repair and crewing vessels. So that could be a significant growth area. Clearly, Kirby is looking at that. We're one of the largest marine companies in the United States. We're in discussions. We're not in liberty to really say much more than that. But it could be a meaningful growth opportunity.

I think there are a number of companies that are severely levered right now. But as you know, we were able to pick up Higman because they were overlevered in a declining market. 
And so it's out there. The bankruptcies, it always seems like they can last longer than you would think when they get overlevered. But certainly, there are some people that are very, very stressed here in this current environment. We've seen some pricing go down below cash cost, which is very frustrating, right? Either they're desperate or they don't really understand their cost structure in order to do that. But it's a sign of how bad the market got. I'm encouraged with what we're seeing in utility, and I think it will come back pretty quickly. We're starting to see utility move north, which was really good.

And I would tell you, almost all the new construction has been biofuel or electric. And our inbound in the fourth quarter was around all of that. 
So you're spot on. There are a lot of ESG-driven upgrades, which actually do give the owners lower cost of operation. Electric has a little less maintenance. And these biofuel -- bi-fuel engines give them less cost in terms of fuel. Natural gas is still pretty cheap. And so there have been a number of conversions.

We have heard that there is one refinery that's looking to restart, and that's really good news because it had some barge utility with it. So some of them will restart. I don't think all of them will restart. I think some of them were inherently disadvantaged from a refinery complexity standpoint and refinery efficiency standpoint. The other thing is you're seeing biofuel and other environmentally friendly products that our refining customers are adding to their portfolios. And we're starting to see some of those type moves emerge. 
So I don't think there's anything systemically that makes it all go away. EVs, obviously, will have a longer-term impact, but there's a debate about how long that takes and if some of that demand destruction is absorbed or replaced by emerging market demand growth. If you think of the developing economies, typically, they start to burn more energy as they develop. And I don't think that, that phenomena changes. 
So -- but longer term, obviously, we're all thinking about the impact of EVs and what that can do to demand. But I think it's got multiple years, if not decades, to play out. I know some friends with EVs, but they also have a suburban in their garage. So I think it's got a ways to play out."

Earlier today, we announced 2020 fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. The quarter's results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand for Kirby's products and services, particularly in marine transportation, where we experienced low volumes and continued poor market dynamics and poor barge utilization. 
Across the company, we have tightly managed costs, which has helped maintain overall marine transportation margins near 10% and distribution and service margins near breakeven. Our fourth quarter earnings also included a tax benefit as a result of the CARES Act, which Bill will discuss in a few minutes. 
Looking at our segments. In Marine transportation, the inland and coastal markets experienced challenging market conditions, with low demand particularly for the transportation of refined products, crude oil and black oil. Although the economy showed some modest signs of improvement during the quarter, increasing cases of COVID-19, high product inventories and impacts from 2 Gulf Coast hurricanes contributed to a slight sequential decline in quarterly average refinery utilization. During the quarter, refinery utilization averaged 77% compared to a previous 5-year fourth quarter average of 90%, and it ended the quarter at 80%. 
Chemical plant utilization modestly improved 1% sequentially but remained below 2019 levels. 
Overall, for our inland and coastal businesses, there were minimal spot requirements, low barge utilization and additional pricing pressures throughout the quarter. 
In distribution and services, fourth quarter revenues sequentially improved, benefiting from the continued economic recovery, higher product sales in commercial and industrial and some pickup in activity in oil and gas distribution. 
In the commercial and industrial markets, we experienced increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses, higher product sales in Thermo King and increased deliveries of new marine engines. These gains were partially offset, however, by normal seasonality, including lower utilization in the power generation rental fleet following the hurricane season as well as reduced major overhauls in marine repair during the harvest and the dry cargo market. 
In the oil and gas market, activity continued to recover as many E&Ps modestly increased spending during the fourth quarter and well completion activity improved. Active frac crews, which bottomed around 50 in the second quarter, improved every month during the fourth quarter and finished the year in excess of 150. This activity improvement contributed to higher demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our distribution businesses. 
In manufacturing, remanufacturing activity was steady, and we received additional new orders for environmental-friendly fracturing equipment. 
In a few moments, I'll talk about our outlook for 2021. But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our fourth quarter segment results and the balance sheet."
283986,700852398,2252279,"Kirby Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%.

In the fourth quarter, marine transportation revenues were $299.4 million, with an operating income of $29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues declined $21.2 million or 7% and operating income declined $3.2 million. The reductions are primarily due to significantly reduced pricing in inland, reductions in inland barge utilization and increased delay days as a result of seasonal weather. Aggressive cost reductions helped to limit the impact on operating margin. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 75% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization declined modestly into the high 60% range as a result of the second wave of COVID-19, continued weak refinery utilization and an extended hurricane season. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts are those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 70% of revenue, with 62% from time charters and 38% from contracts of affreightment. 
Term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter were down in the low double digits on average. Spot market rates declined approximately 10% sequentially and 25% year-on-year. 
During the fourth quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the low to mid-teens. 
In coastal, the market continued to be challenged by significantly reduced demand for refined products and black oil. We experienced weak spot market dynamics and some charted equipment was returned as term contracts expired. During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the mid-70% range, unchanged sequentially, but down from the mid-80% range in the 2019 fourth quarter. Average spot market rates were generally stable but term contracts continued to renew lower in the mid-single digits. 
During the fourth quarter, the percentage of coastal revenues under term contracts was approximately 85%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. Coastal's operating margin in the fourth quarter was in the negative low to single -- to mid-single digits. 
With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the fourth quarter as well as projections for 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2020 fourth quarter were $190.3 million with an operating loss of $2.9 million. Compared to the third quarter, revenues improved $14.4 million or 8%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to modest economic improvements and increased product sales in the commercial and industrial market. These gains were offset by lower revenues in the oil and gas market due to the timing of pressure pumping equipment deliveries and manufacturing. Segment operating income declined slightly during the quarter as a result of product and service sales mix. 
In commercial and industrial, modest sequential improvements resulted in increased demand for parts and service in the on-highway and power generation businesses. Higher Thermo King product sales and the timing of new marine engine deliveries also contributed to sequential increases in revenue. These were partially offset by normal seasonality, including lower utilization of the power generation rental fleet and reduced major overhaul demand in marine repair. 
During the fourth quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 78% of segment revenue. Operating margin was in the low single digits and was impacted by a higher mix of product and parts revenue during the quarter. 
In oil and gas, revenues and operating income sequentially declined primarily due to reduced deliveries of new pressure pumping equipment and manufacturing. This reduction was partially offset by increased demand for new transmissions, parts and services in oil and gas distribution as U.S. frac activity continued to improve. During the fourth quarter, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 22% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the mid-teens. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had $80.3 million of cash, total debt was $1.47 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio was 32.2%. 
During the quarter, we had strong cash flow from operations of $85.1 million and we repaid $109.8 million of debt. We also used cash flow and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures of $18.8 million. 
For the full year, we generated $296.7 million of free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. This amount was slightly below the low end of our previously disclosed guidance range of $300 million. This guidance range contemplated a significant income tax refund related to the CARES Act of over $100 million which was not received as expected prior to the end of the year. We now anticipate this refund will be received during the 2021 first quarter. At the end of the year, we had total available liquidity of $684 million. 
Looking forward, capital spending is expected to continue to trend down in 2021. While the full year, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. As a result, we expect to generate free cash flow of $230 million to $330 million, which includes the tax refund previously discussed. 
Before I close, I'd like to address income taxes. During the fourth quarter, we had an effective tax rate benefit as a result of net operating losses, which will carry back to prior higher tax rate years as allowed by the CARES Act legislation. In 2021, we expect our income tax rate will be around 25%. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David to discuss our operational outlook for 2021."

With 2020 in the rearview mirror, it goes without saying we are all hopeful for brighter days in the new year. As we look at our businesses thus far in 2021, we believe some green shoots are materializing. 
In marine transportation, refinery utilization has steadily improved into the low 80% range. Inland spot activity has modestly picked up and our barge utilization has bounced up off the bottom into the low to mid 90 -- mid-70% range. Demand in distribution and services has continued to recover, with an improving economy and more favorable commodity prices. 
While all of this is encouraging, the reality is that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic. Demand for our products and services are still near all-time lows and uncertainty around the timing of material economic recovery remains. All of this makes predicting 2021 very challenging with a wide range of possible outcomes. 
In the near term, we expect tough market conditions to persist into the second quarter, particularly in marine transportation, where industry barge utilization is very low and we are experiencing very competitive pricing dynamics. As well, the latest wave of COVID-19 cases has resulted in some challenges crewing our vessels, particularly in coastal. 
In distribution and services, the magnitude and timing of the recovery is dependent on an economic recovery and stability in the oil and gas markets. 
That being said, although we are starting the year with near-term pressures and uncertainty, we are very optimistic that the second half of 2021 will be materially better. In the meantime, we intend to remain very focused on cost control, capital discipline, cash generation and debt reduction. 
Diving into the businesses, in the inland market, we expect the current challenging market dynamics to continue in the near term, with gradual improvement in the second quarter, followed by a more meaningful recovery in the second half of the year as demand improves. 
In the first quarter, we anticipate our results will sequentially decline and be the lowest of the year. Increased delays from normal seasonal winter weather as well as lower pricing on term contract renewals are expected to be more than offset -- expected to more than offset very modest improvements in our average barge utilization. 
Beyond the first quarter, activity should begin to recover with an improving economy, which should lead to more favorable spot market dynamics. Even with the pandemic, new petrochemical plants are still scheduled to come online. There has been very limited construction of new barges and significant retirement of barges are occurring across the industry. All of this should help improve the market and is expected to contribute to a meaningful improvement in barge utilization likely into the high 80% to low 90% range by the end of the year. 
With respect to pricing, we expect pressure to persist in the near term as rates typically move with barge utilization. As a result, although market conditions are looking more favorable later in the year, we expect full year revenues and operating margins to decline compared to 2020, driven by lower average barge utilization and the full year impact of lower pricing on term contract renewals. 
In coastal, tough market conditions and low barge utilization are expected to have a meaningful impact on 2021 coastal results and contribute to year-on-year reduction in revenues and operating losses in this business. During 2020, the majority of the coastal fleet operated under term contracts established in more favorable markets during 2019 and in early 2020. These contracts helped to minimize the financial impact as demand fell throughout the pandemic. However, with many of these contracts now starting to expire and low demand for refined products and black oil expected for a while longer, we now expect lower overall pricing in 2021 for the coastal business. As well, the retirement of 3 older large capacity coastal vessels in 2020 due to ballast water treatment requirements and the retirement of an additional barge scheduled for mid-2021 will contribute to lower revenue and operating margin compared to 2020. 
Looking at the first quarter, we expect coastal revenues and operating margin will decline sequentially due to continued weakness in the spot market, pricing pressure and recent challenges crewing our vessels. Similar to inland, we expect coastal market conditions will improve as the year progresses, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of 2021. 
Looking at distribution and services, we expect a more robust economy and increased activity in the oilfield will result in material year-over-year improvements in demand for much of the segment. 
In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway, with increasing truck fleet miles, and an initial recovery in bus repair demand as activity resumes and work -- and return to work commences. We also anticipate some additional growth in on-highway part sales as a result of the recent launch of our new online sales platform. Elsewhere, demand for new installations, parts and services in power generation is expected to grow as demand for electrification and 24/7 power intensifies. 
In oil and gas, we expect current improved oil prices will contribute to increased rig counts and well completions during 2021. Industry analysts have predicted the average active frac crew count could climb back to near 200, which is a notable improvement from 2020 levels. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in distribution as well as increased remanufacturing activities on existing pressure pumping equipment. 
With respect to manufacturing of new equipment, the current excess of traditional pressure pumping capacity across the industry will likely restrain significant orders of conventional fleets. However, a heightened focus on ESG in both energy and industrial sectors is expected to result in increased demand for Kirby's extensive portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment throughout the year. 
Overall, in distribution and services, we expect 2021 revenues and operating income will materially improve as compared to 2020, with commercial and industrial representing approximately 70% and oil and gas representing 30% of segment revenues for the full year. Although the range is dependent on the timing of a material economic recovery, we expect segment operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest. We expect a normal seasonal reduction during the fourth quarter. 
To close out 2020, it was a difficult year with unprecedented challenges. The efforts of our dedicated employees to ensure business continuity, remain focused on safety and to aggressively reduce costs were commendable. I'm very proud of our accomplishments amidst a very challenging backdrop. 
Looking forward, although some near-term challenges and uncertainty remain, we are confident Kirby is in a strong position to meaningfully recover when the pandemic eases and demand for our products and services improves. 
In marine transportation, it was only 1 year ago that inland barge utilization was at an all-time high. Inland operating margins were near 20% and prices were materially increasing in both inland and coastal. Although demand has significantly declined since that time because of the pandemic, industry supply is in check, with very limited new barge construction in inland, no incremental capacity plan in coastal and significant retirements across both sectors. All of this is very positive for our businesses and is expected to contribute to a meaningful tightening in the barge market once demand improves. When you consider our inland fleet expansion over the last 3 years, which is approximately 40% higher on barrel capacity basis as well as our recent efforts to improve the efficiency of our inland and coastal fleets, we believe there is a significant earnings potential in marine transportation. 
In distribution and services, while managing through the pandemic and unprecedented downturn, we were very focused on improving our business during 2020. Throughout the year, we took aggressive and proactive steps to streamline and rightsize the business for the near term while strengthening it for the long term, including consolidating businesses, support functions and management teams; renewing and expanding OEM relationships and product offerings; completing the implementation of a common ERP system; rolling out a new online parts sales platform; and developing and prototyping new products for the expanding wave of electrification. Overall, we anticipate improved results as the economy grows and oilfield activity recovers. And our efforts during 2020 will meaningfully contribute to more favorable long-term returns of this segment. 
Finally, from a liquidity perspective, we generated strong free cash flow of nearly $300 million in a very difficult year and we made significant progress in paying down debt. We expect 2021 will be a strong cash flow year, with expectations of $230 million to $330 million of free cash flow for the full year. We intend to use this cash flow to pay down debt and enhance liquidity.

And I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on both inland and coastal, but I think we went into this downturn with about, call it 3,900 inland barges. Where do you think we're going to stand maybe at the end of 2021? How much capacity do you think the industry is going to take out just because of the difficulty we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months? And then I'd be curious to get your thoughts kind of looking at the coastal market the same way. How much capacity do you think is going to come out by the time we get to the other side of this?"

So the number of new barge deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you",481,"Yes. So the number of new barge deliveries in 2020 was approximately 140 to 145. I think if you look at Sandor Toth, who does River Transport News, his number was 143. We think that's about right. 
The retirements are what we don't know. I will tell you this, because we do know Kirby's numbers. We had originally planned to retire only 10 barges in 2020, we ended up retiring about 95. So our retirement alone made a significant dent in that -- that impacted new barges. But I would say this, I fully expect the number of retirements will be north of 150 to maybe even north of 200 retirements in 2020. We'll see. Informa does a survey that comes out in March or April, and we'll get a better feel for the retirements. 
When we look at 2021, we know that there were 36 barges that carried over into 2021 that weren't delivered, that were ordered pre pandemic. So there's not a lot of new construction on the horizon and retirements are continuing. We know, just from our network, that there's been a lot of retirements. We just don't have a good number on it. 
So net-net, I think barge capacity goes down considerably in -- considerably is hard to quantify, but it will be meaningful for 2021. And Jack, as we said in our prepared remarks, just prior to the pandemic, Kirby's utilization was at an all-time high. We were over 95% utilized. So that should bode well when demand comes back. 
But on the new build side, one, steel prices, scrap steel prices are up, that's actually helped the retirement, but it also has raised the cost of new barges. We're hearing in the market that just a new barge, whether it's a 10,000 barrel or a 30,000 barrel or a black oil or a clean barge, that because of steel prices and other costs, the pricing of new barges is up 25% to 35%. So that, to me, is a very good sign. That means it's going to be very expensive to build new capacity. 
So we're pretty bullish on the supply and demand situation on the inland side. And I would say it's even better on the coastal side. There's really no new capacity coming in. OSG had a couple of units that they had built for replacement. Those essentially have delivered. There's nothing really on order that I'm aware of. And I think that there's a very long lead time, right? I mean if you're going to order an offshore barge, it's -- even if you had the design in the drawer, it's probably at least 2 years before you would get it. So I think the elasticity in the coastal business is going to be even greater when it comes back. So we're pretty happy with the supply and demand situation right now."

And term pricing was down kind of low double digits on renewals in the fourth quarter. So look, that is part of our message today, is that margins are going to be under pressure this year as those prices roll through. 
But to your point, that will change as utility goes up. Pricing should start to go the other direction. And we have a pretty big spot portfolio. Right now, we're about 30% spot, 70% contract. And that's -- that's going to give us a good bit of equipment that can rise pretty quickly. And then there's the contracts that do renew in the first half. Those will be pretty low, but then the second half should be better. 
So we should get, as prices rise, it should come through pretty quick. But as you've seen in the past, it takes about 1 year for things to roll through in the margin, both on the upside and then on the downside. So it will take some while, but we do have that big slug of spot equipment that can reprice pretty quickly."

What you will see, and this will take some time for us to roll out. We've invested in R&D and new product developments. We alluded to it in the prepared comments. 
Look, electrification is happening. And Stewart & Stevenson, in particular, has some great technology and know-how and engineering resources. And we've got some really good ESG-centric products that are rolling out. So we're pretty excited about that. Some of that is being applied to the oilfield. 
We -- as you know, we've made a lot of electric fracs over the years. And those are the kind of the -- one style of electric frac is to use gas turbines to drive electric drive and then to a pump. But there's basically electric grids now that can drive electric pumps and using natural gas generation to generate the electric power. We're right in the square middle of that and that's getting some traction. But also importantly, those electrification products are -- can be used well outside the oilfield. And we're working hard on that. It's not anything we're ready to give you numbers for you to build into your model, but I will tell you, it's moving along with a lot of speed and there's a lot of excitement in the company about that. So when you roll that together with the lean cost structure, a rebound in the economy and commercial and industrial being about 75% of distribution and services, we're pretty excited about it. 
Now does that mean we'd put new capital in there? No. I think that's one of the great things about D&S is it doesn't require a lot of capital. It's got a pretty low capital base. It generally is around working capital is where you deploy the capital. So that's probably a long nonanswer, but I would characterize it as we're pretty excited about what we've got in front of us. We made a lot of good changes, a lot of investments during 2020. And I think KDS is poised to really contribute to Kirby's bottom line."

But let's stick with inland first. When you walked through your thoughts on the environment, so you've mentioned some new capacity, the continued retirements, but utilization at refineries creeping up from lows.

Right now -- well, let me talk to utilization for a quick second because that is what drives pricing, right? The view that utilization is tightening and it is tightening and that it's going to continue for a while, that mindset is what helps drive pricing. 
Our utilization in the fourth quarter kind of dipped to the high 60%, which is the lowest we've ever seen it. But we're starting to see it in the low 70s now. I think we're between 70% and 75% utility. And it keeps inching up. Part of that, to your point, is refinery utilization coming back. We've seen refinery utilization tick up. But be careful with refinery utilization because there's a mathematical thing going on, as they shut down some of the refineries, the denominator fell a bit. So even though the nameplate utilization is higher, it's probably 2% to 3% higher than on a constant capacity basis. 
But the key is that, that refinery utilization keeps ticking up, which helps our utility and the volumes we move. And so we're starting to see it climb. Very encouraged with where utility is going so far this year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that says that, that's not going to continue. And it won't take long to get -- get pricing to stop its decline and to start its climb. I wish I could give you a definitive date. Does that happen in the first quarter or the second quarter or even the third quarter? I'm not sure. But I do think it happens this year, and I think it will move pretty quickly because there hasn't been a lot of building. As we talked about earlier, the supply and demand balance should tighten really rapidly, and that should get the pricing go in the other direction rather quickly. Sorry, I can't be more definitive on that. 
And you mentioned coastal having a tough time. It's the same dynamic in coastal, except I actually think the elasticity in coastals is stronger because they're just bigger units and they move further. Now that said, though, as you know, coastal is a lot more refined products. So it's been impacted a little harder in terms of structure of the industry than inland. But again, I think the same dynamics hold, as utility comes up. You'll see pricing snap back pretty quickly and you'll see things go back on contract. We've seen more equipment move from term to spot because our customers just didn't have the volumes. We look forward to that changing and I think it's starting to change now. 
I mean, the encouraging thing we saw in the COVID statistics is there was a pretty strong downward trend in a number of new infections. So I guess it looks like everything's headed in the right direction."

So on these very expensive units, you can use a week's -- a week's charter hire just going through that process of getting it to shore, getting the crew off, recrewing it after you sanitize it. So yes, it can be meaningful if you get a lot of that. And we've had some. We had some in the fourth quarter. We've had some in the first quarter. Take a unit that's earning $30,000, $40,000 a day, and you lose that for a week, it starts to add up pretty quickly. But the bigger issue is just demand decline that had happened.

No. The sequential decline, we foreshadowed, we talked about it. But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.

But a big part of it is we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In the third quarter, you typically get, one, a lot of rental income on power generation because of the hurricane season, and that carries over a little bit into the fourth quarter. But typically, we'll see our rental utilization fall in the fourth quarter for power, standby backup power that gets deployed during hurricane season. That happened in the fourth quarter kind of as we predicted. And so that's part of it. 
The other part of it is our marine repair, diesel engine marine repair and gearbox repair business has some seasonality in the fourth quarter as well because the dry cargo fleet goes to work in the fourth quarter to move the harvest. So basically, we get a little more business in the third quarter and then the dry cargo operators put all their equipment to work. And so we don't have as much work -- repair work in the fourth quarter. 
So both of those contribute to the seasonality that we see and the sequential decline. Some of that will start to reverse in the first quarter. You'll see some more maintenance on the marine repair. But hopefully, we don't have any hurricanes hit us in the first quarter. So we'll get some snapback on that. But what really is going to help D&S is some of the product deliveries and the U.S. economy coming back. We sell a lot of spare parts and a lot of truck parts and a lot of backup power, a lot of bus repair, all of that is economic-driven. And as the economy comes back, that should start to drive the profitability. 
And then on oil and gas, we took some orders in the fourth quarter. Those will start to deliver in the first and second quarter. So we should start to see some profitability from that. In terms of when do we go profitable in the quarter, I'm not prepared to say that. But I think we've said for the full year, we expect D&S to be kind of mid-single -- low to mid-single-digit operating margins with revenue up. And I'll give you a little feel for revenue. It could be up 10% to 30%, just depending on when the U.S. economy starts to get really, really humming. So we're pretty optimistic about KDS for 2021."

But you did bring up wind, and that is an exciting area. I think if you look at some of the plans, particularly on the East Coast, the number of projects is enormous. I think there's, what is it, 28 gig of wind power that's planned. That's an enormous amount of work for Jones Act compliant vessels. The good news is President Biden came out and supported the Jones Act just recently. I think there'll be opportunities for Jones Act marine companies to support the development of wind. And that can take -- there's a number of different types of vessels that can go out there. There's the installation type vessels. There's transportation to get the equipment out to -- out to the sites where the wind mills are. 
And then, of course, there's maintenance and repair and crewing vessels. So that could be a significant growth area. Clearly, Kirby is looking at that. We're one of the largest marine companies in the United States. We're in discussions. We're not in liberty to really say much more than that. But it could be a meaningful growth opportunity.

I think there are a number of companies that are severely levered right now. But as you know, we were able to pick up Higman because they were overlevered in a declining market. 
And so it's out there. The bankruptcies, it always seems like they can last longer than you would think when they get overlevered. But certainly, there are some people that are very, very stressed here in this current environment. We've seen some pricing go down below cash cost, which is very frustrating, right? Either they're desperate or they don't really understand their cost structure in order to do that. But it's a sign of how bad the market got. I'm encouraged with what we're seeing in utility, and I think it will come back pretty quickly. We're starting to see utility move north, which was really good.

And I would tell you, almost all the new construction has been biofuel or electric. And our inbound in the fourth quarter was around all of that. 
So you're spot on. There are a lot of ESG-driven upgrades, which actually do give the owners lower cost of operation. Electric has a little less maintenance. And these biofuel -- bi-fuel engines give them less cost in terms of fuel. Natural gas is still pretty cheap. And so there have been a number of conversions.

We have heard that there is one refinery that's looking to restart, and that's really good news because it had some barge utility with it. So some of them will restart. I don't think all of them will restart. I think some of them were inherently disadvantaged from a refinery complexity standpoint and refinery efficiency standpoint. The other thing is you're seeing biofuel and other environmentally friendly products that our refining customers are adding to their portfolios. And we're starting to see some of those type moves emerge. 
So I don't think there's anything systemically that makes it all go away. EVs, obviously, will have a longer-term impact, but there's a debate about how long that takes and if some of that demand destruction is absorbed or replaced by emerging market demand growth. If you think of the developing economies, typically, they start to burn more energy as they develop. And I don't think that, that phenomena changes. 
So -- but longer term, obviously, we're all thinking about the impact of EVs and what that can do to demand. But I think it's got multiple years, if not decades, to play out. I know some friends with EVs, but they also have a suburban in their garage. So I think it's got a ways to play out."

Is this still sort of a mid to high single digits, call it mid-cycle run rate operating business? Or is there any chance that you've been able to fine-tune that businesses now so that you can kind of eke out an extra 4 -- 3%, 4%, something like that?"

Earlier today, we announced a net loss of $0.06 a share for the 2021 first quarter. The quarter's results were heavily impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and winter storm Uri, which brought extreme cold temperatures the Gulf close during February and virtually shut down the Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical industry for the balance of the quarter. 
I'd like to start by talking specifically about the major winter storm and the significant impact it had on Kirby and our customers. It has essentially pushed back our recovery a full quarter. The storm descended into Texas and Louisiana in mid-February, bringing with it a severe cold wave. During the storm, the Texas electric grid collapsed, plant infrastructure and pipeline froze and business came to an abrupt halt. Our customers' facilities were forced into hard emergency shutdowns, which contributed to unit damage even beyond what typically happens with events like hurricanes, where an orderly shutdown can be planned and implemented. 
As a result, refinery and chemical plant utilization and production levels plummeted for an extended period. In the refining complex, utilization in PADD III, which is the Gulf Coast, declined to 41%. This represents the lowest level on record in EIA's published data. It did not fully recover back above 80% until the end of March. In petrochemicals, the impact was also extensive, stretching across the entire Gulf Coast petrochemical complex and impacting our major customers. 
Operating rates at nameplate ethylene plants in Texas declined from 86% in January to the year, 40% in February and March, corresponding to a 51% decline in production and feedstock consumption. At the height of the storm, the majority of capacity and production was off-line, including 75% of U.S. ethylene capacity. More than 80% of U.S. olefins capacity, 90% of ethylene glycol production, more than 80% of polypropylene production, 65% of propylene production and over 60% of epoxy resins production. 
Overall, the damage was so widespread and severe that some of our largest customers have just recently restarted their plants and are not yet back to full production levels. With this impact on our customers, it goes without saying that Kirby's businesses were also significantly impacted. 
Particularly in inland, where demand and overall volumes materially declined in February and through a large portion of March. As you would expect, this had a negative impact on pricing, which had stabilized prior to the storm. Distribution and services was also impacted by the storm, with most of our locations in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana closed for several days contributing to reduced activity, lower revenue and project delays. Overall, we estimate the winter storm directly contributed to losses totaling approximately $0.09 per share during the first quarter. 
Looking at our segments. In Marine transportation, the inland market started the quarter with gradually improving demand as economic activity was improving and refinery utilization has returned to levels not seen since the summer of 2020. However, this upward momentum sharply reversed as the winter storm set in and refineries and chemical plants along the Gulf Coast abruptly shut down. 
These weak market conditions contributed to continued pricing pressure in the quarter, with further reductions in both average term and spot pricing. However, towards the end of the quarter, refinery utilization recovered to over 80%, and most chemical plants came back online. As a result, our barge utilization recovered late in the quarter and by early April, it was over 80%. Importantly, this improvement contributed to stabilization and modest gains in spot market pricing in the last few weeks. In coastal, for the quarter, market dynamics were largely unchanged sequentially with continued low demand for refined products and black oil transportation. This contributed to minimal spot requirements and low barge utilization. 
In distribution and services, we experienced improved demand throughout much of the segment, which contributed to sequentially higher revenues and a return to positive operating income. The most significant improvement came from our oil and gas businesses, which experienced increased demand as U.S. rig counts and frac activity continue to recover from lows seen in the pandemic. In manufacturing, incremental orders and deliveries of new environmentally friendly and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment as well as some seismic equipment contributed to the quarter's results. There was also increased demand for new transmission parts and service in our oil and gas distribution business from major oilfield customers. 
In commercial and industrial, the continued recovery resulted in sequential improved demand levels in our on-highway and power generation businesses. 
Marine repair activity also increased with higher demand for major overhauls following the dry cargo harvest season in the fourth quarter. These gains, however, were offset by reduced product sales in Thermo-King as a result of supply chain delays and lower new engines sales in Marine repair. When combined with closures and lower activity associated with the storm, there was an overall sequential reduction in commercial and industrial revenues. 
In summary, the first quarter was tough and the freeze ultimately pushed back our recovery. In a few moments, I'll talk about the remainder of 2021, including our more favorable outlook in the second half of the year. 
In the meantime, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our first quarter segment results and the balance sheet."

In the 2021 first quarter, marine transportation revenues were $301 million with an operating income of $1.9 million and an operating margin of 0.6%. Compared to the 2020 first quarter, marine revenues decline",1000,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the 2021 first quarter, marine transportation revenues were $301 million with an operating income of $1.9 million and an operating margin of 0.6%. Compared to the 2020 first quarter, marine revenues declined $102.3 million or 25%, and operating income declined $48.8 million. The reductions are primarily due to lower inland and coastal barge utilization, significantly reduced pricing in inland and the impact of the winter storm. These reductions were partially offset by the savage in the Marine asset acquisition, which closed on April 1, 2020. Compared to the 2020 fourth quarter, revenues increased slightly by [ $1.5 billion, ] inclusive of increased rebuilds related to higher fuel prices, partially offset by a reduction in freight revenue. The reduction of freight revenue included lower pricing and volume reductions as a result of the winter storm. These were partially offset by a modest sequential increase in overall barge utilization. Operating income declined $27.2 million, largely due to the impact of significant disruptions and winter store-related volume reductions particularly as it related to contracts of affreightment as well as lower term and spot pricing in inland, also contributing for seasonal wind and fog along the Gulf Coast flooding on the Mississippi River and ice on the Illinois River. Additionally, we did incur increased maintenance employee costs in the quarter's results as we began to ramp up our operations in anticipation of increased activity levels. This will continue in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 75% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization was in the mid-70s range, representing a significant reduction as compared to the low to mid-90s range in the 2020 first quarter, but up from the high 60s range in the 2020 fourth quarter. Barge utilization continued to be impacted by the effects of COVID-19 as well as reduced refinery and chemical plant volumes as a result of the winter storm. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts are those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue with 61% from time charters and 39% from contracts of affreightment. Term contracts that renewed during the first quarter were down in the high single digits on average. Average spot market rates declined approximately 5% sequentially and 25% to 30% year-on-year. However, late in the first quarter, rates stabilized and started to move off the bottom. During the first quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the low to mid-single digits. In coastal, our business continued to be challenged by significantly reduced demand for refined products in black oil as well as weak spot market dynamics. 
During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the mid-70s range, which was unchanged sequentially, but down from the low to mid-80s range in the 2020 first quarter. Average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were generally stable. During the first quarter, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. Coastal's operating margin in the first quarter was in the negative mid-single digits. With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the first quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2021 first quarter were $195.9 million with an operating income of $2.9 million and an operating margin of 1.5% compared to the 2020 first quarter, distribution and services revenues declined $44.8 million or 19%, and operating income declined $0.8 million. These reductions are primarily due to the pandemic lower oilfield activity in the winter storm, with the impact to operating margins mitigated by significant cost reductions throughout 2020. 
Compared to the 2020 fourth quarter, overall demand for our products and services steadily improved, with revenues increasing $5.6 million or 3% and operating income increasing $5.8 million. Favorable sales mix contributed to the increase in operating income. In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity results in improved demands for parts and services in the on-highway power generation and marine repair businesses. However, lower sales of Thermo-King products reduced deliveries of new marine engines and closures associated with the winter storm resulted in an overall sequential reduction in commercial and industrial revenues. 
During the first quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 68% of segment revenue. Operating margin was in the mid-single digits and benefited from favorable sales mix. In oil and gas, improving market dynamics in the oilfield contributed to sequential increase in revenues and operating income during the first quarter. Our manufacturing businesses experienced sequential improvement with increased orders of new environmentally friendly and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment for domestic markets and seismic units for international markets. Our oil and gas distribution businesses also improved sequentially with improved demand for new transmissions, parts and services by major oilfield customers, but was partially offset by facility closures during the winter storm. 
For the first quarter, the oil and gas related businesses represented approximately 32% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the mid-single digits. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had $52 million of cash and total debt of $1.35 billion, with a debt-to-cap ratio of 30.4%. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $103 million, which included a tax refund of $117 million. In the quarter, we repaid $120 million of debt and use cash flow and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures of $14 million. At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $776 million. 
Looking forward, capital spending in 2021 is expected to be approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for marine fleet. We expect to generate free cash flow of $230 million to $310 million in 2021. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."
283986,710504111,2262469,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Although the first quarter was very challenging. Many of Kirby's businesses are seeing more favorable market conditions and improving levels of demand. I'll talk more about the anticipated recovery in each of our major businesses in a mom",1075,"Thank you, Bill. Although the first quarter was very challenging. Many of Kirby's businesses are seeing more favorable market conditions and improving levels of demand. I'll talk more about the anticipated recovery in each of our major businesses in a moment, but overall, we expect a sequential increase in revenues and a return to profitability in the second quarter. That said, the improvement in the second quarter will be muted due to the effect of lower pricing on contracts renewed in recent quarters as well as increased spending in anticipation of a much busier second half. We anticipate improvement in the third and fourth quarters as the economy continues to recover, refinery and chemical plant production continues to grow and our barge utilization improves above the 82% to 84% we've seen in April. 
In the inland market, with our barge utilization starting in the second quarter over 80%, most refineries and chemical plants back online and improving weather conditions, we expect better results going forward. 
From a macro viewpoint, the economy is steadily improving and pent-up demand is significant. The winter storm reduced product inventories and with higher commodity and product prices and increasing crack spreads, the economics for our customers are becoming increasingly more favorable. We believe this will drive increased production in the coming months, which should bode well for the inland market. 
With little construction of new barges and retirements of barges occurring across the industry, we expect an improvement in the spot market and our barge utilization to move up into the high 80% to low 90% range in the second half of the year. Market conditions are looking more favorable and spot market pricing appears to have bottomed as we are now seeing some positive momentum. 
However, we expect it to take some time for reduced pricing on term contracts, which were renewed lower last year and during the first quarter to reset. Overall, in the second quarter, we expect revenues and operating income will sequentially improve due to the higher barge utilization, improved weather and more favorable operating conditions. However, as mentioned, certain costs, including maintenance horsepower and labor are expected to increase in the second quarter as operations ramp up. 
Beyond the second quarter, we do expect third and fourth quarter revenues and operating income to meaningfully improve with better spot market dynamics. On a full year basis, as compared to 2020, given the tough first quarter and second quarter -- anticipated second quarter, we continue to expect revenues and operating income will be down year-over-year. The lower average barge utilization reduced term contract pricing and the impact from the recent storm are the main drivers for the anticipated year-over-year decline. 
In coastal, our outlook has not materially changed. We expect coastal second quarter revenues and operating margin will be similar to the first quarter. However, we do expect coastal market conditions will begin to improve in the second half-half of the year as demand for refined products and black oil increases, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of the year. 
Looking at distribution and services, we expect further growth in the second quarter and the remainder of 2021, driven by a more robust economy and increased activity in the oilfield. In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway with increasing truck fleet miles, some recovery in bus repair and increased part sales as a result of our new online sales platform. We also expect increased thermal product -- Thermo-King product sales and in power generation, demand for new equipment parts and services is expected to grow as the need for 24/7 power becomes increasingly more important. 
In marine repair, although activities remain strong, we do expect a year-on-year reduction in revenues, primarily due to reduced new engine sales. In oil and gas, we believe current oil prices will contribute to increased rig count and well completions at 2021 progresses. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and service and distribution as well as increased remanufacturing activities on existing pressure pumping equipment in the coming quarters. With respect to manufacturing of new equipment, and intensifying focus on sustainability and the desire of many of our customers to reduce their carbon footprint will likely result and increased demand for Kirby's portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment during the remainder of the year. 
Currently, we anticipate increased sales of new electric and dual fuel pressure pumping equipment as well as natural gas power generation equipment. 
For distribution and services in the second quarter, we expect the economic growth anticipated manufacturing deliveries and increased Thermo-King product sales will drive sequential improvements in segment revenues and operating income with margins rising into the low to mid-single digits. 
For the full year, our expectations have not materially changed. We anticipate significant year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income with commercial and industrial representing approximately 70% of segment revenues in oil and gas, representing the balance of 30%. 
We expect E&S margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest, with the expectation that normal seasonality will likely result in some reduction in operating margins in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, the first quarter's results were disappointing. Although we expected lower pricing and winter weather to contribute to a sequential reduction in first quarter revenues and earnings, the winter storm through us and many of our customers a curveball. 
Ultimately, the storm was a disaster for the state of Texas and created significant disruptions across the industry supply chain that will likely be felt for many months to come. We do anticipate improving markets as the pandemic eases and demand continues to rise, especially since product inventories for certain refined products and chemicals have fallen significantly in a very short period of time. Also, prices for many finished goods, including refined products, plastics and other consumer products are escalating at rapid rates. As a result, many of our customers are working hard to ramp up production, which will ultimately be positive for our outlook. So while the winter storm pushed back our recovery, looking forward, the underlying economic outlook remains strong. As a result, we firmly believe we will see improving results for the balance of the year. 
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions."

That said, first quarter was tough, and we saw seque",428,"Yes. Well, let me take the last question first because we're there. As of this morning, we hit -- we were above 85% utility. In the last couple of weeks, we've seen spot market pricing improve a little. That said, first quarter was tough, and we saw sequential decline in spot pricing. It was down sequentially 5% on spot pricing. Term contracts rolled over, down maybe high single digits. So first quarter is really tough, and we've got to work through that term contract portfolio. About 65% of our revenues are term contracts, 2/3 of those roll over in about 12 months. So to your point, we need contract pricing to start to move upward. The first step is really to get spot pricing moving and that's starting now. We're extremely busy. As you heard in our prepared remarks, there's a lot of good news out there. Our customers across the board are returning to profitability. You can see the refiners are making money now, the integrators are making money now, the chemical companies are making money now and even pressure pumpers are doing better. So things are really improving. Refinery utility hit 89% in PAD 3 last week. Some of our public company refining customers said that they were going to be in the low 90s in terms of refinery utilization here in the second quarter. Commodity prices are up. Crack spreads are up. Airlines are hiring pilots now. And even the CDC came out and said that cruise lines could start operating in July. So when we look at that and we see how much our utility has jumped up in the last few weeks, we're pretty constructive -- more than pretty constructive, we're downright positive. Our activity is growing, and it's going to get really sporty here. We've been hiring mariners. We've started up our school in January in anticipation of more volumes coming our way and what's happening. So that's a long-winded answer to say the utility is improving. And as you know, Jack, once that utility starts to get above the mid-80%, pricing starts to go the other way. And particularly given the outlook, I think it's going to stay that way and start to ramp up. Now in terms of when everything price resets, as you know, with term contracts, it's going to take a while, right? I mean they roll off kind of ratably over 12 months. So it will take a while. The good news is 35% of our portfolio is spot pricing, and that will move a little faster."

We feel that we've got a lot of earnings leverage and we can on inland, get back into kind of the 20% margin. I would tell you, look, second quarter is going to be muted. We still have the low pricing that we're working our way out of. And as utility ramps up, we're having to spend some money to get utility back, get some equipment off the bank. So I think second quarter margins are going to be muted that they should be better than first quarter, but it will still be a tough quarter. But as we get into third quarter, it's going to start to ramp. I think we'll see inland margins into the double digits in the third and fourth quarter. I do think it's hard to predict, but 2022, we could start to get in the mid-teens and higher, maybe in the high teens. We'll see how that all plays out. As you know, a lot can change in a short period of time with the economy. I do think inflation is a positive thing for Kirby. Clearly, wage inflation is a headwind, but when you think about commodity inflation and just inflation in general, when you've got a huge fixed asset base like we do with our barges and their long life assets, the replacement cost of that asset base goes up with inflation. And of course, that makes it harder for new supply to come into the barge market, which is a good thing. So in general, inflation is a good thing for us outside of kind of wage inflation. We are seeing some pressure on hiring. It's harder to hire people but that said, we've started classes at our school here at Kirby. As you know, we've got the only school that can issue a coast guard license to our mariners. And we've been -- we've started classes in January, ramping up in anticipation of what we're starting to see now. On the inland marine side, for instance, one thing that's happened over the last year has not just been hunkering down, but they are really huge strides in a lot of areas, like, for instance, when you look at the acquisition of Savage, there's less SG&A number just now than there was before Savage. So I think there's been a lot of steps taken there to not just focusing, we could just get better. So I really do think that the actual in the marine business is better now than it was a year ago."

So in D&S, as you know, we've got our manufacturing business, which is largely oilfield related, and then we've got the commercial and industrial business. What we're starting to see is the manufacturing business is starting to ramp up our labor utilizations in the the mid- to high 90% range. We're hiring people. And what that's about, Randy, is our customers are very sensitive to their carbon footprint, and we have been taking orders for environmentally friendly frac equipment, for example, electric frac equipment, power generation equipment that drives electric frac equipment. It's -- the inbound has been pretty good, but as you know, we use -- we don't have the percentage completion accounting. So it's kind of -- we can't book the revenue until it ships. So that's going to take a while to come through the income statement. As you heard in our prepared remarks, the third quarter is going to be a little better. First quarter was the worse. And I think second quarter will be better than first quarter. Third quarter will be the best and then seasonality will impact the fourth quarter. But when you look at E&S in general, revenue year-over-year will be up. I think earlier in the year, we said [indiscernible] to 30%. I would tell you, it's about 20% now, maybe better than that because we're getting a lot of traction with our environmentally friendly equipment. In commercial and industrial, we're starting to see the on-highway business start to pick up. Our labor utilization has been improving. We've been hiring there as well. So in general, it's getting better across E&S year-over-year, up 20% revenue. Margins this year -- well, this quarter, we're kind of low single digits. I think for the year, we'll average around 5% kind of mid-single digits. I think as we get into next year, given our cost structure is so much leaner in that business, I think we'll get into the high single-digit margins next year."

It's -- we just have to have spot pricing get back above contract pricing, which it will, and it's starting that before you start to see the term contracts move. The good news, and you've heard us say this before, when you get utility in that mid-80% range, and it looks like it's going to stay there. And actually, right now, it looks like it's going to get even more sporty than that. Pricing should move really, really nicely in the coming quarters. So I'm not sure if that answers your question, but all the things are lining up for for improvement. Now I don't think we get back to the pricing we saw pre pandemic for a few quarters. It just takes a while. I mean it's like turning an aircraft carrier, right, to get all these contracts to roll over, and it just takes time. It's -- the average length of the term contract is probably 12 months, right? I mean we do have some multiyear but the average is 12 months, and they kind of roll ratably per quarter.

And I think the faster that utility goes up, the more the faster the spot pricing will go, is it going to be similar to what we've seen in past cycles. It actually -- pricing may increase faster than in prior up cycles, just because the snapback has been so strong. But there's no guarantees to that. There a lot goes into pricing, but this is a pretty good environment right now. And across our industry, we're pretty hungry. We've been -- it's been a tough 1.5 years, and all of our competitors are -- have been hurting, including us. So -- and then the other thing is there's been limited new construction. I think the order book this year is essentially any new orders has been nonexistent. We understand from our polls that there's about 36 barges to be delivered this year. All of those were ordered essentially over a year ago. So no new construction, pretty sharp snapback in utility, a bunch of hungry barge operators here that have been really suffering.

Steel is obviously a whole another ball game, but we're happy with steel prices going up because that means nobody will build or there will be muted building.

I don't know if you've flown in a while. But look, the leisure traveler is back. Leisure travels way up, the business travel really hasn't come back as much yet. So the refiners still a little hungry to see more jet fuel. That said, the airlines are hiring pilots in anticipation of a much stronger June is what some of them have said.

We're doing that, but it's all going in the right direction."

So there's that dynamic that said, I think one of our major customers said that there's about 10% to 12% retires equipment -- percent equipment retired in a year. And I think anything new that's being added is really ESG-centric. They're going to replace things with either electric or dynamic gas blending, just to reduce the carbon footprint. So that's playing out. I think the good news for Kirby is that we have a great product offering in both electric track and electrification of the well site or where they're doing the completions. So we're pretty excited about that. There is some remanufacturing for sure. We're starting to see that pick up a little bit, but it's -- I think it's going to be a gradual bill. There is still a lot of capital discipline, which is good. I think it's healthy. Both the E&P companies and the pressure pumping companies are very capital disciplined. So I don't think it's going to be a big spike up like we saw like in 2011 in the frac industry where everybody is building as much as they could. It's going to be more gradual, more ratable, more ESG-focused. And I think that just continues to build momentum into '22."

I'm curious if you think that might be the case here that maybe the industry ramp-up of supply might not be so easy given sort of the stressed balance sheets and equipment that probably needs repair and everything else?

So just Kirby kind of balances that 36 out. That said, I think other people are doing just what you said. They put some of their older, worse equipment on the bank. We, as an industry, are still suffering from very low prices. So I think muted maintenance spending and some of that stuff may be just scraped. With scrap steel prices up a bit, the economic decision might drive more retirements. I don't have a great feel for that. I wish I could say it's going to be 120 to 150 barges this year, just don't know. When things start to get sporty, it's amazing how much equipment can come back into the market. That said, it's still a lot of work to get that equipment back and very expensive because as you say, we all signed up our older equipment and it tends to be the worst equipment. And when it's sitting idle, doesn't get better, it deteriorates, as you know. So that's a long run answer. Sorry, Ben, I wish I could be more precise, but what we do know is 36 on the order book, and we're going to retire 25. We feel pretty comfortable about that, but the bigger picture is how much actually does get cut up across the industry. I'm not sure it's certainly north of our 25. It could be in the 100 -- north of 100. Just hard to say at this point."

So it's a much smaller market so when things start to move and get sporty, it's just a longer process when you think about bringing new capacity in, right, because it takes a good pull-through years to build a whole new unit. So when that market starts to come back, it will snap back probably stronger and stay up longer. It's just a much longer cycle. All that said, as you heard, we're losing money in coastal, it's still a tough market. We're starting to see refined products come back, so that's getting better. With the infrastructure plan, that could be better because there could be a lot of asphalt. We move a lot of asphalt and Black oil products offshore. That said, there's also the overhang of one of our competitors that just went through bankruptcy, and we'll see what happens to that equipment. It's been tied up and under maintained. So it's going to cost a lot of money for to be enter the market. But that overhangs out there. We're watching it carefully. Long and short of it, I feel pretty good about the supply and demand situation in the coastal market because there's no new delivery scheduled and it takes 2 years to build new equipment.

The quarter's results were heavily impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Winter Storm Uri, which bro",884,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced a net loss of $0.06 a share for the 2021 first quarter. The quarter's results were heavily impacted by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Winter Storm Uri, which brought extreme cold temperatures to the Gulf Coast during February and virtually shut down the Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical industry for the balance of the quarter.
I'd like to start by talking specifically about the major winter storm and the significant impact it had on Kirby and our customers. It has essentially pushed back our recovery a full quarter. The storm descended into Texas and Louisiana in mid-February, bringing with it a severe cold wave. During the storm, the Texas electric grid collapsed, plant infrastructure and pipelines froze and business came to an abrupt halt. Our customers' facilities were forced into hard emergency shutdowns, which contributed to unit damage even beyond what typically happens with events like hurricanes, where an orderly shutdown can be planned and implemented. As a result, refinery and chemical plant utilization and production levels plummeted for an extended period.
In the refining complex, utilization in PADD 3, which is the Gulf Coast, declined to 41%. This represents the lowest level on record in EIA's published data. It did not fully recover back above 80% until the end of March. In petrochemicals, the impact was also extensive, stretching across the entire Gulf Coast petrochemical complex and impacting our major customers.
Operating rates at nameplate ethylene plants in Texas declined from 86% in January to the year, 40% in February and March, corresponding to the 51% decline in production and feedstock consumption. At the height of the storm, the majority of capacity and production was off-line, including 75% of U.S. ethylene capacity, more than 80% of U.S. olefins capacity, 90% of ethylene glycol production, more than 80% of polypropylene production, 65% of propylene production and over 60% of epoxy resins production. Overall, the damage was so widespread and severe that some of our largest customers have just recently restarted their plants and are not yet back to full production levels.
With this impact on our customers, it goes without saying that Kirby's businesses were also significantly impacted, particularly in inland where demand and overall volumes materially declined in February and through a large portion of March. As you would expect, this had a negative impact on pricing, which had stabilized prior to the storm. Distribution and services was also impacted by the storm with most of our locations in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana closed for several days, contributing to reduced activity, lower revenue and project delays. Overall, we estimate the winter storm directly contributed to losses totaling approximately $0.09 per share during the first quarter.
Looking at our segments. In Marine Transportation, the inland market started the quarter with gradually improving demand as economic activity was improving and refinery utilization had returned to levels not seen since the summer of 2020. However, this upward momentum sharply reversed as the winter storm set in, and refineries and chemical plants along the Gulf Coast abruptly shut down. These weak market conditions contributed to continued pricing pressure in the quarter with further reductions in both average term and spot pricing. However, towards the end of the quarter, refinery utilization recovered to over 80%, and most chemical plants came back online. As a result, our barge utilization recovered late in the quarter. And by early April, it was over 80%. Importantly, this improvement contributed to stabilization and modest gains in spot market pricing in the last few weeks. In coastal, for the quarter, market dynamics were largely unchanged sequentially with continued low demand for refined products and black oil transportation. This contributed to minimal spot requirements and low barge utilization.
In Distribution & Services, we experienced improved demand throughout much of the segment, which contributed to sequentially higher revenues and a return to positive operating income. The most significant improvement came from our oil and gas businesses, which experienced increased demand as U.S. rig counts and frac activity continue to recover from lows seen in the pandemic. In manufacturing, incremental orders and deliveries of new environmentally friendly and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment as well as some seismic equipment contributed to the quarter's results. There was also increased demand for new transmission parts and service in our oil and gas distribution business from major oilfield customers.
In commercial and industrial, the continued recovery resulted in sequential improved demand levels in our on-highway and power generation businesses. Marine repair activity also increased with higher demand for major overhauls following the dry cargo harvest season in the fourth quarter. These gains, however, were offset by reduced product sales in Thermo-King as a result of supply chain delays and lower new engines sales in marine repair. When combined with closures and lower activity associated with the storm, there was an overall sequential reduction in commercial and industrial revenues.
In summary, the first quarter was tough and the freeze ultimately pushed back our recovery. In a few moments, I'll talk about the remainder of 2021, including our more favorable outlook in the second half of the year. In the meantime, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our first quarter segment results and the balance sheet."

In the 2021 first quarter, Marine Transportation revenues were $301 million with an operating income of $1.9 million and an operating margin of 0.6%. Compared to the 2020 first quarter, marine revenues decline",1007,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the 2021 first quarter, Marine Transportation revenues were $301 million with an operating income of $1.9 million and an operating margin of 0.6%. Compared to the 2020 first quarter, marine revenues declined $102.3 million or 25%, and operating income declined $48.8 million. The reductions are primarily due to lower inland and coastal barge utilization, significantly reduced pricing in inland and the impact of the winter storm. These reductions were partially offset by the Savage Inland Marine asset acquisition, which closed on April 1, 2020.
Compared to the 2020 fourth quarter, revenues increased slightly by $1.5 million (sic) [ $1.6 million ], inclusive of increased rebuilds related to higher fuel prices, partially offset by a reduction in freight revenue. The reduction in freight revenue included lower pricing and volume reductions as a result of the winter storm. These were partially offset by a modest sequential increase in overall barge utilization.
Operating income declined $27.2 million (sic) [ $27.3 million ], largely due to the impact of significant disruptions and winter storm-related volume reductions, particularly as it related to contracts of affreightment as well as lower term and spot pricing in inland. Also contributing were seasonal wind and fog along the Gulf Coast, flooding on the Mississippi River and ice on the Illinois River. Additionally, we did incur increased maintenance employee costs in the quarter's results as we began to ramp up our operations in anticipation of increased activity levels. This will continue in the second quarter.
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 75% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization was in the mid-70s range, representing a significant reduction as compared to the low to mid-90s range in the 2020 first quarter but up from the high 60s range in the 2020 fourth quarter. Barge utilization continued to be impacted by the effects of COVID-19 as well as reduced refinery and chemical plant volumes as a result of the winter storm. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, or those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer, contributed approximately 65% of revenue, with 61% from time charters and 39% from contracts of affreightment. Term contracts that renewed during the first quarter were down in the high single digits on average. Average spot market rates declined approximately 5% sequentially and 25% to 30% year-on-year. However, late in the first quarter, rates stabilized and started to move off the bottom. During the first quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the low to mid-single digits.
In coastal, our business continued to be challenged by significantly reduced demand for refined products in black oil as well as weak spot market dynamics. During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the mid-70s range, which was unchanged sequentially but down from the low to mid-80s range in the 2020 first quarter. Average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were generally stable. During the first quarter, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. Coastal's operating margin in the first quarter was in the negative mid-single digits. With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the first quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website.
Moving to Distribution & Services. Revenues for the 2021 first quarter were $195.9 million with an operating income of $2.9 million and an operating margin of 1.5%. Compared to the 2020 first quarter, Distribution & Services revenues declined $44.8 million or 19%, and operating income declined $0.8 million. These reductions are primarily due to the pandemic, lower oilfield activity and the winter storm, with the impact to operating margins mitigated by significant cost reductions throughout 2020. Compared to the 2020 fourth quarter, overall demand for our products and services steadily improved, with revenues increasing $5.6 million or 3% and operating income increasing $5.8 million. Favorable sales mix contributed to the increase in operating income.
In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity results in improved demands for parts and services in the on-highway, power generation and marine repair businesses. However, lower sales of Thermo-King products reduced deliveries of new marine engines, and closures associated with the winter storm resulted in an overall sequential reduction in commercial and industrial revenues. During the first quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 68% of segment revenue. Operating margin was in the mid-single digits and benefited from favorable sales mix.
In oil and gas, improving market dynamics in the oilfield contributed to sequential increase in revenues and operating income during the first quarter. Our manufacturing businesses experienced sequential improvement with increased orders of new and environmentally friendly and remanufactured pressure pumping equipment for domestic markets and seismic units for international markets. Our oil and gas distribution businesses also improved sequentially with improved demand for new transmissions, parts and services by major oilfield customers but was partially offset by facility closures during the winter storm. For the first quarter, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 32% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the mid-single digits.
Turning to the balance sheet. As of March 31, we had $52 million of cash and total debt of $1.35 billion with a debt-to-cap ratio of 30.4%. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $103 million, which included a tax refund of $117 million. In the quarter, we repaid $120 million of debt and use cash flow and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures of $14 million. At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $776 million. Looking forward, capital spending in 2021 is expected to be approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for marine fleet. We expect to generate free cash flow of $230 million to $310 million in 2021.
I'll now turn the call back over to David."

Although the first quarter was very challenging, many of Kirby's businesses are seeing more favorable market conditions and improving levels of demand. I'll talk more about the anticipated recovery in each of our major businesses in a mom",1070,"Thank you, Bill. Although the first quarter was very challenging, many of Kirby's businesses are seeing more favorable market conditions and improving levels of demand. I'll talk more about the anticipated recovery in each of our major businesses in a moment. But overall, we expect a sequential increase in revenues and a return to profitability in the second quarter. That said, the improvement in the second quarter will be muted due to the effect of lower pricing on contracts renewed in recent quarters as well as increased spending in anticipation of a much busier second half. We anticipate improvement in the third and fourth quarters as the economy continues to recover, refinery and chemical plant production continues to grow and our barge utilization improves above the 82% to 84% we've seen in April.
In the inland market, with our barge utilization starting in the second quarter over 80%, most refineries and chemical plants back online and improving weather conditions, we expect better results going forward. From a macro viewpoint, the economy is steadily improving and pent-up demand is significant. The winter storm reduced product inventories. And with higher commodity and product prices and increasing crack spreads, the economics for our customers are becoming increasingly more favorable. We believe this will drive increased production in the coming months, which should bode well for the inland market.
With little construction of new barges and retirement of barges occurring across the industry, we expect an improvement in the spot market and our barge utilization to move up into the high 80% to low 90% range in the second half of the year. Market conditions are looking more favorable and spot market pricing appears to have bottomed as we are now seeing some positive momentum. However, we expect it to take some time for reduced pricing on term contracts, which were renewed lower last year and during the first quarter, to reset. Overall, in the second quarter, we expect revenues and operating income will sequentially improve due to higher barge utilization, improved weather and more favorable operating conditions. However, as mentioned, certain costs, including maintenance, horsepower and labor, are expected to increase in the second quarter as operations ramp up.
Beyond the second quarter, we do expect third and fourth quarter revenues and operating income to meaningfully improve with better spot market dynamics. On a full year basis, as compared to 2020, given the tough first quarter and second quarter -- anticipated second quarter, we continue to expect revenues and operating income will be down year-over-year. The lower average barge utilization, reduced term contract pricing and the impact from the recent storm are the main drivers for the anticipated year-over-year decline.
In coastal, our outlook has not materially changed. We expect coastal second quarter revenues and operating margin will be similar to the first quarter. However, we do expect coastal market conditions will begin to improve in the second half of the year as demand for refined products and black oil increases, resulting in higher barge utilization and reduced operating losses in the second half of the year.
Looking at Distribution & Services, we expect further growth in the second quarter and the remainder of 2021 driven by a more robust economy and increased activity in the oilfield. In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway with increasing truck fleet miles, some recovery in bus repair and increased parts sales as a result of our new online sales platform. We also expect increased Thermo-King product sales. And in power generation, demand for new equipment, parts and services is expected to grow as the need for 24/7 power becomes increasingly more important. In marine repair, although activities remain strong, we do expect a year-on-year reduction in revenues, primarily due to reduced new engine sales.
In oil and gas, we believe current oil prices will contribute to increased rig count and well completions as 2021 progresses. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and service and distribution as well as increased remanufacturing activities on existing pressure pumping equipment in the coming quarters. With respect to manufacturing of new equipment, an intensifying focus on sustainability and the desire of many of our customers to reduce their carbon footprint will likely result in increased demand for Kirby's portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment during the remainder of the year. Currently, we anticipate increased sales of new electric and dual-fuel pressure pumping equipment as well as natural gas power generation equipment.
For Distribution & Services, in the second quarter, we expect the economic growth, anticipated manufacturing deliveries and increased Thermo-King product sales will drive sequential improvements in segment revenues and operating income with margins rising into the low to mid-single digits. For the full year, our expectations have not materially changed. We anticipate significant year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income, with commercial and industrial representing approximately 70% of segment revenues; and oil and gas, representing the balance of 30%. We expect D&S margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year, with the first quarter being the lowest and the third quarter being the highest, with the expectation that normal seasonality will likely result in some reduction in operating margins in the fourth quarter.
In conclusion, the first quarter's results were disappointing. Although we expected lower pricing and winter weather to contribute to a sequential reduction in first quarter revenues and earnings, the winter storm threw us and many of our customers a curveball. Ultimately, the storm was a disaster for the State of Texas and created significant disruptions across the industry supply chain that will likely be felt for many months to come. We do anticipate improving markets as the pandemic eases and demand continues to rise, especially since product inventories for certain refined products and chemicals have fallen significantly in a very short period of time. Also, prices for many finished goods, including refined products, plastics and other consumer products are escalating at rapid rates. As a result, many of our customers are working hard to ramp up production, which will ultimately be positive for our outlook. So while the winter storm pushed back our recovery, looking forward, the underlying economic outlook remains strong. As a result, we firmly believe we will see improving results for the balance of the year.
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions."

Well, let me take the last question first because we're there. As of this morning, we hit -- we were above 85% utility. In the last couple of weeks, we've seen spot market pricing improve a little. That said, first quarter was tough, and we saw seque",428,"Yes. Well, let me take the last question first because we're there. As of this morning, we hit -- we were above 85% utility. In the last couple of weeks, we've seen spot market pricing improve a little. That said, first quarter was tough, and we saw sequential decline in spot pricing. It was down sequentially 5% on spot pricing. Term contracts rolled over, down maybe high single digits. So first quarter is really tough, and we've got to work through that term contract portfolio. About 65% of our revenues are term contracts, 2/3 of those roll over in about 12 months. So to your point, we need contract pricing to start to move upward. The first step is really to get spot pricing moving, and that's starting now.
We're extremely busy. As you heard in our prepared remarks, there's a lot of good news out there. Our customers across the board are returning to profitability. You can see the refiners are making money now. The integrators are making money now. The chemical companies are making money now. And even pressure pumpers are doing better. So things are really improving. Refinery utility hit 89% in PADD 3 last week. Some of our public company refining customers said that they were going to be in the low 90s in terms of refinery utilization here in the second quarter. Commodity prices are up. Crack spreads are up. Airlines are hiring pilots now. And even the CDC came out and said that cruise lines could start operating in July. So when we look at that and we see how much our utility has jumped up in the last few weeks, we're pretty constructive. More than pretty constructive, we're downright positive. Our activity is growing, and it's going to get really sporty here. We've been hiring mariners. We've started up our school in January in anticipation of more volumes coming our way and what's happening.
So that's a long-winded answer to say the utility is improving. And as you know, Jack, once that utility starts to get above the mid-80%, pricing starts to go the other way. And particularly given the outlook, I think it's going to stay that way and start to ramp up. Now in terms of when everything -- price resets, as you know, with term contracts, it's going to take a while, right? I mean they roll off kind of ratably over 12 months, so it will take a while. The good news is 35% of our portfolio is spot pricing, and that will move a little faster."

I guess my follow-up question, David, I think as we look forward, there's a substantial amount of earnings power within your 3 different business lines.

I would tell you, look, second quarter is going to be muted. We still have the low pricing that we're working our way out of. And as utility ramps up, we're having to spend some money to get utility back, get some equipment off the bank. So I think second quarter margins are going to be muted. They should be better than the first quarter, but it will still be a tough quarter. But as we get into third quarter, it's going to start to ramp. I think we'll see inland margins into the double digits in the third and fourth quarter. I do think it's hard to predict, but 2022, we could start to get in the mid-teens and higher, maybe in the high teens. We'll see how that all plays out. As you know, a lot can change in a short period of time with the economy.
I do think inflation is a positive thing for Kirby. Clearly, wage inflation is a headwind, but when you think about commodity inflation and just inflation in general, when you've got a huge fixed asset base like we do with our barges and their long-lived assets, the replacement cost of that asset base goes up with inflation. And of course, that makes it harder for new supply to come into the barge market, which is a good thing. So in general, inflation is a good thing for us outside of kind of wage inflation. We are seeing some pressure on hiring. It's harder to hire people. But that said, we've started classes at our school here. At Kirby, as you know, we've got the only school that can issue a Coast Guard license to our mariners. And we've been -- we started classes in January, ramping up in anticipation of what we're starting to see now."

So in D&S, as you know, we've got our manufacturing business, which is largely oilfield related, and then we've got the commercial and industrial business. What we're starting to see is the manufacturing business is starting to ramp up. Our labor utilization is in the mid- to high-90% range. We're hiring people. And what that's about, Randy, is our customers are very sensitive to their carbon footprint, and we have been taking orders for environmentally friendly frac equipment, for example, electric frac equipment, power generation equipment that drives electric frac equipment. It's -- the inbound has been pretty good. But as you know, we use -- we don't have the percentage completion accounting. So it's kind of -- we can't book the revenue until it ships. So that's going to take a while to come through the income statement.
As you heard in our prepared remarks, the third quarter is going to be a little better. First quarter was the worse. And I think second quarter will be better than first quarter. Third quarter will be the best, and then seasonality will impact the fourth quarter. But when you look at D&S in general, revenue year-over-year will be up. I think earlier in the year, we said 30%. I would tell you, it's about 20% now, maybe better than that because we're getting a lot of traction with our environmentally friendly equipment. In commercial and industrial, we're starting to see the on-highway business start to pick up. Our labor utilization has been improving. We've been hiring there as well. So in general, it's getting better across D&S year-over-year, up 20% in revenue. Margins this year -- well, this quarter, were kind of low single digits. I think for the year, we'll average around 5% kind of mid-single digits. I think as we get into next year, given our cost structure is so much leaner in that business, I think we'll get into the high single-digit margins next year."

So I'm not sure if that answers your question, but all the things are lining up for improvement.
Now I don't think we'd get back to the pricing we saw pre-pandemic for a few quarters. It just takes a while.

And I think the faster that utility goes up, the more -- the faster the spot pricing will go. Is it going to be similar to what we've seen in past cycles? It -- actually, pricing may increase faster than in prior up-cycles, just because the snapback has been so strong. But there's no guarantees to that. There -- a lot goes into pricing, but this is a pretty good environment right now.
And across our industry, we're pretty hungry. We've been -- it's been a tough 1.5 years, and all of our competitors are -- have been hurting, including us. So -- and then the other thing is there's been limited new construction. I think the order book this year is -- essentially, any new orders has been nonexistent. We understand from our polls that there's about 36 barges to be delivered this year. All of those were ordered essentially over a year ago. So no new construction, a pretty sharp snapback in utility, a bunch of hungry barge operators here that have been really suffering. It's lining up pretty good. But for me to say, well, it's going to be up 25% in a quarter, I don't think that's the case. But it should be pretty sporty."

Steel is obviously a whole another ball game, but we're happy with steel prices going up because that means nobody will build or there will be muted building. So yes, we'll have a little inflationary pressure on the cost side, for sure, but we -- pricing should definitely be able to take care of that easily.
And your second question, I'm sorry, what -- oh, refineries, what are they saying. Yes, they've been very positive. Crack spreads have come back out. We're starting to see jet fuel come back. I don't know if you've flown in a while. But look, the leisure traveler is back. Leisure travel is way up. The business travel really hasn't come back as much yet. So the refineries are still a little hungry to see more jet fuel. That said, the airlines are hiring pilots in anticipation of a much stronger June, is what some of them have said. Some of our refiner customers have said they're targeting 92% utility -- 90%, 92%, 94% utility in kind of the second quarter and preparing for the summer driving season. So it's pretty constructive. I think they had a rough time. We all had a rough time through this pandemic, and they're happy to get back running.

We've been running deckhand classes and mariner classes since the first of the year, which we did in anticipation of it.

So there's that dynamic. That said, I think one of our major customers said that there's about 10% to 12% retired equipment -- percent equipment retired in a year. And I think anything new that's being added is really ESG-centric. They're going to replace things with either electric or dynamic gas blending just to reduce the carbon footprint. So that's playing out.
I think the good news for Kirby is that we have a great product offering in both electric frac and electrification of the well site where they're doing the completions. So we're pretty excited about that. There is some remanufacturing, for sure. We're starting to see that pick up a little bit. But it's -- I think it's going to be a gradual build. There is still a lot of capital discipline, which is good. I think it's healthy. Both the E&P companies and the pressure pumping companies are very capital disciplined. So I don't think it's going to be a big spike up like we saw like in 2011 in the frac industry where everybody is building as much as they could. It's going to be more gradual, more ratable, more ESG-focused. And I think that just continues to build momentum into '22."

So just Kirby kind of balances that 36 out. That said, I think other people are doing just what you said, they put some of their older, worse equipment on the bank. We, as an industry, are still suffering from very low prices. So I think muted maintenance spending and some of that stuff may be just scrap. With scrap steel prices up a bit, the economic decision might drive more retirements.
I don't have a great feel for that. I wish I could say it's going to be 120 to 150 barges this year. I just don't know. When things start to get sporty, it's amazing how much equipment can come back into the market. That said, it's still a lot of work to get that equipment back and very expensive because, as you say, we all tied up our older equipment, and it tends to be the worst equipment. And when it's sitting idle, it doesn't get better. It deteriorates, as you know. So that's a long answer. Sorry, Ben, I wish I could be more precise. But what we do know is 36 on the order book, and we're going to retire 25. We feel pretty confident about that. But the bigger picture is how much actually does get cut up across the industry.

So when that market starts to come back, it will snap back probably stronger and stay up longer. It's just a much longer cycle. All that said, as you heard, we're losing money in coastal, it's still a tough market. We're starting to see refined products come back, so that's getting better.
With the infrastructure plan, that could be better because there could be a lot of asphalt. We move a lot of asphalt and black oil products offshore. That said, there's also the overhang of one of our competitors that just went through bankruptcy, and we'll see what happens to that equipment. It's been tied up and under maintained.

Earlier today, we announced net earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 second quarter. The quarter's results were improved across both segments as the U.S. economy continued to rebound, the Gulf Coast petrochemical and refining complex recovered from Winter Storm Uri and oilfield activity and spending ramped up. 
Overall, our activity levels increased significantly in both marine transportation and distribution and services, which led to a 13% sequential increase in total revenues and a material improvement in earnings. Looking at our segments, in marine transportation, the inland market experienced a strong improvement in demand with overall barge utilization increasing into the low to mid-80% range. The quarter started with some softness as many petrochemical plants struggled to restart following the February winter storm, which shut down up to 50% of the Gulf Coast production for a period of time. But by early May, however, most of the petrochemical complex had resumed production, refinery utilization was firmly in the high 80s and demand for refined products was steadily increasing as the U.S. economy reopen. 
As a result, activity in the barge markets started to ramp up nicely and barge pricing moved off the bottom. The inland market tightened further in mid-May when the Colonial pipeline shut down, and many of our customers turn to barges for transportation and storage. In a matter of days, our barge utilization increased to near 90%. While this event was temporary, and overall activity levels moderated in June, the inland business experienced a favorable shift in market dynamics. As a result, inland ton miles increased 17% when compared to the first quarter. Average spot market pricing also improved sequentially for the first time in more than a year, and even -- and although still down relative to last year, term contract pricing pressure moderated. 
Overall, inland revenues sequentially increased 13% and operating margins recovered into the high single digits. In coastal, market fundamentals for the second quarter were largely unchanged with continued low barge utilization and few spot requirements. However, overall pricing remained stable during the second quarter. In distribution and services, we experienced continued positive momentum with improved activity levels, strong sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating margin levels not seen since the third quarter of 2019. The most significant increases came from our oil and gas businesses, which experienced increased demand as U.S. rig counts and frac activity moved higher and our customers increased their spending levels. 
In manufacturing, incremental orders and deliveries of new environmentally-friendly pressure pumping equipment and frac-related power generation equipment contributed favorably to the quarter's results. We also experienced a strong increase in demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our oil and gas distribution business from major oilfield customers. 
In commercial and industrial, the continued economic recovery resulted in sequential improved demand in our on-highway businesses. Product sales in Thermo King also increased during the quarter. These gains were partially offset by sequentially lower revenues and commercial power generation related to the timing of large backup power installations. Marine repair activity was also down modestly during the quarter. 
In summary, the second quarter was a turning point for Kirby with both our segments experiencing improved activity levels and better financial performance. We expect to see this momentum continue in the second half of the year. And in a few minutes, I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of 2021. But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our second quarter segment results and the balance sheet."
283986,1672577624,2354063,"Kirby Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the 2021 second quarter, Marine Transportation revenues were $332.9 million with an operating income of $18.5 million and an operating margin of 5.6%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, marine revenues de",1040,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the 2021 second quarter, Marine Transportation revenues were $332.9 million with an operating income of $18.5 million and an operating margin of 5.6%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, marine revenues declined $48 million or 13% and operating income declined $32.9 million. The reductions are primarily due to lower inland and coastal barge utilization, and significantly reduced pricing in inland, partially offset by increased fuel rebuilds due to higher diesel prices. 
Compared to the 2021 first quarter, marine revenues increased $31.9 million or 11%, and operating income increased $16.6 million. These increases are primarily a result of increased inland barge utilization and improved spot market pricing. As expected, second quarter operating margins were somewhat impacted by increased maintenance and costs as we continue to ramp up our operations. During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 76% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization improved into the low to mid-80% range compared to the mid-70% range in the 2021 first quarter. 
Inland barge volumes increased sequentially as the U.S. economy continued to improve as the COVID-19 pandemic lessened and Gulf Coast refinery and chemical plant activity recovered from the effects of Winter Storm Uri. Barge demand also benefited from the Colonial Pipeline outage in May. Overall, these factors contributed to a 70% increase in ton miles as compared to the first quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts or those contracts with the term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue, with 57% from time charters and 43% from contracts of our freight. 
The significant increase in barge activity in the second quarter contributed to average spot market rates improving approximately 10% sequentially. However, average spot rates remain down approximately 10% to 15% compared to the 2020 second quarter. Only a few term contracts with you during the second quarter and average rates were down in the mid- to high single digits. It will take time as market conditions improve for term contracts to renew higher. And we will need to see spot prices remain above term contract prices to get term contract pricing going in the right direction. As term contracts renew higher, we will see improvements in operating margins. Overall, during the second quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the high single digits. 
In coastal, our business continued to be challenged by weak demand for refined products and black oil. During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the low to mid-70% range, primarily due to weak spot market dynamics in the West Coast and Hawaii, where economies have experienced a slower recovery from the pandemic. Despite reduced barge utilization, coastal revenues improved slightly, both sequentially and year-on-year due to increased fuel rebuilds. With respect to pricing, average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were stable. During the second quarter, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. 
Coastal's operating margin in the second quarter was in the negative mid-single digits. With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the second quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2021 second quarter were $226.7 million with an operating income of $6.2 million and an operating margin of 2.7%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, distribution and services revenue increased $66.5 million or 42% and operating income improved $20.3 million. Compared to the 2021 first quarter, revenues increased $30.8 million or 16% and operating income increased $3.3 million. These improvements are primarily due to a significant increase in demand for our oil and gas products and services as well as the improved economic condition across the U.S. which is raising demand for equipment, parts and service in the commercial and industrial markets. 
In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity across the U.S. result in improved sequential and year-on-year demand for equipment parts and services in our on-highway business. Revenues in our Thermal King business were also higher. In power generation, activity increased year-on-year due to higher sales and installations following the pandemic, but was down sequentially due to the timing of backup power installations in the Northeast. Marine revenues were down sequentially and year-on-year due to reduced major overhauls. 
During the second quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 62% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the mid-single digits. In oil and gas, improving market dynamics and increased activity in the oilfield contributed to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating income. Our manufacturing businesses experienced substantial increases in deliveries of new pressure pumping and frac related power generation equipment as well as steady demand for seismic units for international markets. Our oil and gas distribution business also improved sequentially and year-on-year with increased demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. 
For the second quarter, the oil and gas related businesses represented approximately 38% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the low single digits. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $53 million of cash and total debt of $1.28 billion with a debt-to-cap of 29.1%. Since the acquisition on April 1, 2020, we have reduced debt by $427 million. During the quarter, we generated strong cash from operations of $95 million, net of capital expenditure of $24 million, free cash flow was $71 million. At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $852 million. As of this week, our net debt was $1.2 billion, and total liquidity was $881 million. 
For the full year, we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $250 million to $310 million for the full year. Lastly, from a tax perspective, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27% in the third and fourth quarters. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."

The last 15 months have been challenging with weak markets, poor operating conditions and declining financial performance.

The last 15 months have been challenging with weak markets, poor operating conditions and declining financial performance. As economies reopened in the second quarter, we experienced a welcome increase in overall demand and greatly improved market conditions. With the U.S. and international economies continuing to reopen and demand for refined products and oilfield equipment and services increasing, we see this positive momentum continuing into the second half of the year. As a result, we expect to see improvement in revenues and earnings for both of Kirby segments. 
While we are very encouraged about the recovery, we are, however, cautiously watching the rising number of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S. and around the world just now. There is a risk that these spikes, which are already resulting in new lockdowns in some locations, could adversely impact the recovery, refinery utilization and refined products demand. Although we expect this could slow the pace of the recovery, we do believe that momentum will continue to build. Additionally, as many of you know, labor constraints across the industrial supply chain are creating delays in manufacturing lead times and other supply chains. It is possible that we could see some anticipated product sales or deliveries of our manufactured equipment delayed in the second half of the year. In the inland market, our outlook remains positive. 
As of today, our barge utilization is in the mid-80% range, driven by strong activity levels in the refining and petrochemical complex. Barring a significant step change in COVID, we expect barge activity should continue to increase during the last 2 quarters of this year as a result of improving demand, including increased refinery activity, higher refined products consumption and new petrochemical plants coming online. With minimal construction of new barges and barge retirements still occurring, we believe our barge utilization will increase into the high 80% to 90% range as the year progresses. This should support further improvement in spot market pricing during the second half of the year. 
Overall, in the third quarter, we expect revenues will sequentially improve with increasing demand and spot market pricing. Although we have some modest labor inflation starting in the third quarter, we expect operating margins to increase. As a result, we expect inland operating margins will be in the low double digits, 10-ish, if you will, during the third quarter. We expect further improvement in revenue and margins for the fourth quarter but results could be tempered by the normal seasonal weather disruptions. In coastal, we expect the market will recover slower with some improvement in barge demand during the remainder of the year. In recent weeks, spot activity has modestly improved with higher economic activity and increased demand for refined products. As a result, our barge utilization has increased slightly, particularly on the West Coast, where overall demand levels have been slower to recover from the pandemic. 
Overall, we expect coastal barge utilization will be in the mid-70% range in the coming months, which should yield third and fourth quarter revenues slightly higher than the second quarter. We expect coastal operating margins will improve in the second half of the year, but still remain below breakeven in the negative low to mid-single-digit range. Looking at distribution and services, we expect that economic growth, improvements in the oilfield and summer seasonality will result in sequential revenue growth with improved operating margins. 
In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway with further recovery in bus repair activity and increased parts revenue from our new online sales platform. We also expect increased Thermo King product sales and service during the peak summer demand season. In power generation, we expect increased backup power equipment sales and installations. And in our rental fleet, we should see some seasonal increases in utilization during the hurricane season. 
In marine repair, we expect a sequential reduction in revenues, primarily due to the harvest season in the dry cargo markets. In oil and gas, we believe current oil prices will contribute to continued increases in the rig count with incremental well completions activity as 2021 progresses. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in the Distribution segment for the remainder of 2021. In manufacturing, a focus on sustainability and efforts of oilfield companies to reduce their carbon footprints continues to generate increased inquiries and new orders for Kirby's portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment, including electric and dual fuel pressure pumping units and highly efficient natural gas power generation equipment for e-frac. 
We also are experiencing increased orders to remanufacture existing pressure pumping equipment. As a result, we anticipate increased deliveries of manufactured and remanufactured products in the back half of 2021. However, as mentioned previously, supply chain delays could result in some equipment delivery shifting between quarters and potentially into 2022. Overall, for the full year, our expectations have not materially changed for D&S. We anticipate significant year-on-year revenue growth of 15% to 25% with commercial and industrial representing approximately 65% of revenues and oil and gas representing the balance of 35%. We expect D&S operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year with the third quarter being the highest. In the fourth quarter, normal seasonality will likely result in some sequential reduction in operating margins. 
Before we wrap up, I want to briefly comment on 2 other matters. First, today, we announced that Bill Harvey will be retiring as Kirby's CFO in early next year. Bill has been an integral part of the Kirby team for the last 4 years and has helped to guide us through several large inland marine acquisitions and the integration of Stewart & Stevenson. Bill's contributions to Kirby's success and our financial strength have been significant, and he will certainly be missed. Additionally, earlier this week, released -- we released our new 2021 Sustainability Report. This report represents another milestone in our ESG journey with new emissions disclosures for the full company as well as enhanced disclosures on safety, employee training and governance. You can access our new report in the Sustainability section on our website. 
Now to wrap things up, although there is some uncertainty around COVID-19 and its impact on the recovery, we remain very optimistic about Kirby's outlook. The second quarter was an important turning point for the company from a financial perspective with increased earnings in both segments. Most importantly, for the first time in over a year, we experienced a positive inland market that benefited from rising demand, favorable operating conditions and a major disruption. While the Colonial pipeline outage provided a temporary boost to the business, it highlighted that the inland market is well along on its path to recovery and how rapidly barge utilization can tighten and how quickly spot prices can move. The world economy is still in disarray. With much of Europe still essentially shut down and India, Mexico and South America not fully open. As the world economy fully recovers from the pandemic and demand for liquid normalizes around the world, we are confident our inland businesses will regain pre-pandemic utilization levels in the 90% range, bringing with it improved pricing, earnings and returns. 
In coastal, although market conditions remain challenging, continued retirements of industry capacity and a lack of any new construction will keep capacity in check and allow for a solid rebound once the U.S. economy fully recovers. And finally, in distribution and services, we have come a long way in the last year, with steady improvements in financial performance. Our distribution businesses have not yet fully recovered, and there is room for further improvement as we go forward. With more favorable oilfield fundamentals and increased demand for lower carbon solutions, our new and highly efficient, environmentally friendly pressure pumping and power generation equipment is capturing the attention of our customers and translating into new orders that will provide additional growth in the second half of the year and into 2022. 
Overall, we have made substantial progress during the last year in very difficult markets. We realigned our cost structure, expanded our product offering in D&S and improved our financial flexibility. Our marine markets have stabilized and are beginning to improve. All of this has set the stage for improved earnings and returns and will allow us to take advantage of future growth opportunities. 
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

We've -- in the first quarter, we were down in the mid-70s in terms of utility.

But then it started to taper off as Colonial came back in and better weather started to help transit time. So we did end the quarter kind of in the mid-80s. But the important thing is spot pricing and contract pricing improved a bit. Contract pricing was still down year-over-year. You go all the way back to the second quarter in 2020. So we kind of lapped that quarter. Those were higher prices back then. So contract pricing was down kind of mid- to high single digits, but spot pricing was up in the double-digit range, around 10%. 
And that, to your question, put spot pricing above contracts now. And that's what we need. We need that to stay above contracts. We need the customers to believe it's going to stay that way for a while. And then that contract portfolio start to renew higher. That may take another quarter or 2 before we kind of lap contract prices and they start renewing higher. But look, margins improved. We kind of went from low to mid-single digits in inland in the first quarter to kind of high single digits. We'll be in double digits next quarter in the third quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be hard to say because weather can impact us a bit. But all the trends are in the right direction. 
I mean when you think about customers and what's going on in the world right now, crude demand seems to be back. It's within kind of the 5-year historical trends. Crude storage is now just -- well, it's actually below the 5-year average now. TSA checkpoint data shows throughput has improved about 20% in the last quarter or so. Gulf Coast refineries are back in the 90% range. Chemical activity barometers up. Retail sales are up. Leading indicators are up, new manufacturing orders are up. So the economy feels like it's coming back. I think we're all a little nervous about COVID right now. We're seeing some cases within Kirby pop up again and hearing about some spotty lockdowns. So in the past, I think last quarter, I used 40. It's hard to be -- to use that word when you're looking at COVID reemerging here. 
But all of that economic data shows that things are continuing to move and open up. I think when we talk to our customers, what they're telling us is that the international and export volumes are still not there. They're probably 15% lower than they were pre-COVID. And when you think about that kind of makes sense. You've got Mexico, Latin America, South America essentially in various stages of shutdown. Europe still really hasn't opened up. India is kind of reacting and essentially locked down. So a lot of those export volumes are down. So domestically, things are improving, but the global economies are not quite back and that's what we're hearing from our customers. All that said, it's pretty positive."

What's your expectation around net retirements for 2021?

We're Look, we're -- we think the order book is about 70 -- between 70, 75 barges, maybe I don't think the actual count that we have at 72 barges for delivery this year. About half of them have been delivered. The first half were really all ordered pre-pandemic, and they just started delivering. But new barge pricing is at an all-time high. If you look kind of price changes from 2020 to 2021, a clean 30, the price for a clean 30 is now almost 40% higher than it was last year. Steel prices are driving a big part of that. Clean 30 now is probably $3.8 million. In 2018, just to reference that, it was about 2.5, in 2017, it was around 2 to build a Clean 30. So steel prices have driven that up labor to a lesser extent. 
But look, nobody is building a lot of barges right now and retirements are up. Scrap steel prices are up to retirements are a little more palatable. So it's pretty constructive right now. We don't see really a net add in terms of new barges. And in fact, what we saw with Colonial makes us feel pretty good about kind of the unutilized overhang. For us to -- in the space of 2 weeks to see the industry kind of go to sold out in clean third market, it shows you how little overhang there really is. And I think a lot of that's because of the retirements that have occurred and there's not a lot of new equipment coming in. And to be fair, a number of our competitors, including us, still have some equipment on the bank. So from a supply and demand standpoint, it feels pretty good right now."

I think Atlantic Coast is better utilized than, say, the West Coast. But there's no new construction that we're aware of. No new barges are being built. And the coastal market, there is -- it takes a long time. It could take up to 2 years or longer to get a new coastal tug and barge unit. Now that said, the assets are out there. You may have seen that they were sold out of the bankruptcy court. Somebody's going to have to sink a lot of money back in to get some of that equipment moving. So that's a slight overhang in the market. 
But as you heard in our prepared remarks, coastal pricing kind of held flat, but utility is less than on the inland side. Look, as you know, the coastal market is more about refined products than it is chemicals, whereas the inland market is a little more chemical heavy. So again, we need to see the refined market just continue to expand, and I think that will soak up capacity with the caveat the Bushard equipment may come back over a period of time. I think it takes several years for that equipment to come back in any meaningful manner. Just knowing how much maintenance will need to be done on that equipment."

With the cost of price of new equipment and of course, with some labor inflation on top of that, and oh, by the way, we are seeing food inflation. When we do crew transport, whether it's renting cars or flying, we're seeing those costs come up, hotel costs are coming up as we have to put crew members in hotels before they grew on. So we are seeing some inflation. And all things being equal, that that labor and cost inflation and the cost of the equipment inflation should drive higher -- the need for higher, as you stated, mid-cycle pricing. 
The other thing is we haven't talked much about this, but as you get into ESG and look at the engine packages on towboats and tugboats, you've got to start moving to Tier 4 engine packages, which are much more expensive in more expensive to operate. So when you put all that together, yes, we're going to need higher mid-cycle pricing throughout the industry to recover any kind of capital."

We're just not seeing a lot of it, to be honest. Essentially, most of the new orders or orders in the period have been ESG related. As we get tighter, that dynamic will, in my opinion, change, and we'll see more remanufacturing. 
Will this be kind of blowing and going like we saw in 2011? I don't think so, Greg. I think it feels, rightly or wrongly, a lot more capital discipline. I think many of the private companies, in particular, there's not as much capital available. So -- and if there is capital, the lenders kind of want to see an ESG flip forward. So all that said, I still think reman makes sense, and we'll see more rather than less as we go forward. It's just been pretty thin now. We're starting to see more of it, but it's still kind of early days in that area, in my opinion."

I would just tell you on refinery utilization, be a little careful in that in the last 1.5 years, about 5% of the refining capacity was either shut down or idled. So yes, we're back up above 90%, but that's on a lower base. It was about 1 million barrels, roughly plus or minus a little bit 1 million barrels of refining capacity that's been shut down and idle. Now we've seen some good signs recently the refinery came back online, and so that's coming back. But as you think of refinery utilization, you've got to factor in that about 5% of the total complex was shut down. and we need some of that to be restarted. 
Now the other interesting thing is rather than restarting that, we're seeing more biodiesel and renewable diesel, which particularly if you take soybean oil and make it into diesel, that's -- those are going to be barge moves kind of most likely coming out of the Midwest as they make renewable diesel. So we're watching all that. Does that help the coastal market, the renewable diesel. Maybe we've actually had coastal unit go and move some renewable diesel. So we're watching it. But again, we're still at lower levels. And I think we need some of the export market to come back and some of those refineries that have been idle to come back to really make a dent in the coastal utilization."

Well, I'll tell a little bit more on eFrac before I go into the commercial and industrial power generation. In eFrac, Stewart & Stevenson started making its first generation e-frac back in 2013, which was all around the gas turbine driving electric drive. And the newer kind of generation that everybody is excited about is using natural gas, power generation, engine packages from CAT or MTU to basically develop electric power with, say, 10 natural gas power generation engines on a micro grid on a well pad. And there is an element of having backup energy storage there so that you can run all the natural gas generation equipment at its peak efficiency and take them on and off-line correctly. 
When you start to look at the commercial market, it's more one-off rather than a big microgrid that generates huge numbers of megawatts. What we've seen is a lot more standby backup power. We have a power generation rental fleet that, frankly, we get a lot of business from our hurricane back up. During hurricanes, the likes of the big box stores will put us on standby in case there's an outage. I think as you've seen with the Texas storm, which took out a good part of the grid and some of the challenges in California with the electric grid. And then as you think of EVs taking more of the electric grid, I think businesses, in general, are looking more and more at backup power. And we're really trying to capture parts of that market with our OEMs that we represent, the engine manufacturers. And that's how we are. 
We're a distributor, as you know, Bill, for a number of people. And essentially, we're using that relationship to go to market for backup power. We have a pretty good presence up in the Northeast, and we've been working to get into backup power for big financial institutions, to a lesser extent in Florida for some of the kind of health care, nursing home, hospital type backup power. It will be interesting to see if the grid gets more and more utilized and electricity becomes more and more important as electrification occurs across both the passenger car market and other markets, what the demands for backup power will be. We're trying to position it. I would tell you that we're going to market in the future will be to take that backup power and couple it with our energy storage system, i.e., our battery system. So that there's a situation where you can charge the battery and you'll always have backup power and not need as much in terms of diesel to drive backup power. Maybe there's a couple -- coupling with solar on certain rooftops of commercial buildings. 
So that's all kind of new areas that we're working on. There's nothing to put in the model yet for for that market. But that's what we're looking at and what we're pursuing from an ESG standpoint, Bill."

Earlier today, we announced net earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 second quarter.

Earlier today, we announced net earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 second quarter. The quarter's results were improved across both segments as the U.S. economy continued to rebound, the Gulf Coast petrochemical and refining complex recovered from Winter Storm Uri and oilfield activity and spending ramped up.  
Overall, our activity levels increased significantly in both marine transportation and distribution and services, which led to a 13% sequential increase in total revenues and a material improvement in earnings. Looking at our segments, in marine transportation, the inland market experienced a strong improvement in demand with overall barge utilization increasing into the low to mid-80% range. The quarter started with some softness as many petrochemical plants struggled to restart following the February winter storm, which shut down up to 50% of the Gulf Coast production for a period of time. But by early May, however, most of the petrochemical complex had resumed production, refinery utilization was firmly in the high 80s and demand for refined products was steadily increasing as the U.S. economy reopen. 
As a result, activity in the barge markets started to ramp up nicely and barge pricing moved off the bottom. The inland market tightened further in mid-May when the Colonial Pipeline shut down, and many of our customers turned to barges for transportation and storage. In a matter of days, our barge utilization increased to near 90%. While this event was temporary, and overall activity levels moderated in June, the inland business experienced a favorable shift in market dynamics. As a result, inland ton miles increased 17% when compared to the first quarter. Average spot market pricing also improved sequentially for the first time in more than a year, and even -- and although is still down relative to last year, term contract pricing pressure moderated. 
Overall, inland revenues sequentially increased 13% and operating margins recovered into the high single digits. In coastal, market fundamentals for the second quarter were largely unchanged with continued low barge utilization and few spot requirements. However, overall pricing remained stable during the second quarter. In distribution and services, we experienced continued positive momentum with improved activity levels, strong sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating margin levels not seen since the third quarter of 2019. The most significant increases came from our oil and gas businesses, which experienced increased demand as U.S. rig counts and frac activity moved higher and our customers increased their spending levels. 
In manufacturing, incremental orders and deliveries of new environmentally-friendly pressure pumping equipment and frac-related power generation equipment contributed favorably to the quarter's results. We also experienced a strong increase in demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our oil and gas distribution business from major oilfield customers.
In commercial and industrial, the continued economic recovery resulted in sequential improved demand in our on-highway businesses. Product sales in Thermo King also increased during the quarter. These gains were partially offset by sequentially lower revenues and commercial power generation related to the timing of large backup power installations. Marine repair activity was also down modestly during the quarter. 
In summary, the second quarter was a turning point for Kirby with both our segments experienced improved activity levels and better financial performance. We expect to see this momentum continue in the second half of the year. And in a few minutes, I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of 2021. But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our second quarter segment results and the balance sheet."

In the 2021 second quarter, marine transportation revenues were $332.9 million with an operating income of $18.5 million and an operating margin of 5.6%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, marine revenues de",1041,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the 2021 second quarter, marine transportation revenues were $332.9 million with an operating income of $18.5 million and an operating margin of 5.6%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, marine revenues declined $48 million or 13% and operating income declined $32.9 million. The reductions are primarily due to lower inland and coastal barge utilization, and significantly reduced pricing in inland, partially offset by increased fuel rebuilds due to higher diesel prices. 
Compared to the 2021 first quarter, marine revenues increased $31.9 million or 11%, and operating income increased $16.6 million. These increases are primarily a result of increased inland barge utilization and improved spot market pricing. As expected, second quarter operating margins were somewhat impacted by increased maintenance and ops costs as we continue to ramp up our operations. During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 76% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization improved into the low to mid-80% range compared to the mid-70% range in the 2021 first quarter. 
Inland barge volumes increased sequentially as the U.S. economy continued to improve as the COVID-19 pandemic lessened and Gulf Coast refinery and chemical plant activity recovered from the effects of Winter Storm Uri. Barge demand also benefited from the Colonial Pipeline outage in May. Overall, these factors contributed to a 70% increase in ton miles as compared to the first quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts or those contracts with the term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue with 57% from time charters and 43% from contracts of affreightment. 
The significant increase in barge activity in the second quarter contributed to average spot market rates improving approximately 10% sequentially. However, average spot rates remained down approximately 10% to 15% when compared to the 2020 second quarter. Only a few term contracts renewed during the second quarter and average rates were down in the mid to high single digits. It will take time as market conditions improve for term contracts to renew higher. And we will need to see spot prices remain above term contract prices to get term contract pricing going in the right direction. As term contracts renew higher, we will see improvements in operating margins. Overall, during the second quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the high single digits.
In coastal, our business continued to be challenged by weak demand for refined products and black oil. During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the low to mid-70% range, primarily due to weak spot market dynamics in the West Coast and Hawaii, where economies have experienced a slower recovery from the pandemic. Despite reduced barge utilization, coastal revenues improved slightly, both sequentially and year-on-year due to increased fuel rebuilds. With respect to pricing, average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were stable. During the second quarter, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. 
Coastal's operating margin in the second quarter was in the negative mid-single digits. With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the second quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2021 second quarter were $226.7 million with an operating income of $6.2 million and an operating margin of 2.7%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, distribution and services revenue increased $66.5 million or 42% and operating income improved $20.3 million. Compared to the 2021 first quarter, revenues increased $30.8 million or 16% and operating income increased $3.3 million. These improvements are primarily due to a significant increase in demand for our oil and gas products and services as well as the improved economic condition across the U.S. which is raising demand for equipment, parts and service in the commercial and industrial markets.  
In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity across the U.S. resulted in improved sequential and year-on-year demand for equipment parts and services in our on-highway business. Revenues in our Thermal King business were also higher. In power generation, activity increased year-on-year due to higher sales and installations following the pandemic, but was down sequentially due to the timing of backup power installations in the Northeast. Marine revenues were down sequentially and year-on-year due to reduced major overhauls. 
During the second quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 62% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the mid-single digits. In oil and gas, improving market dynamics and increased activity in the oilfield contributed to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating income. Our manufacturing businesses experienced substantial increases in deliveries of new pressure pumping and frac related power generation equipment as well as steady demand for seismic units for international markets. Our oil and gas distribution business also improved sequentially and year-on-year with increased demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. 
For the second quarter, the oil and gas related businesses represented approximately 38% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the low single digits. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $53 million of cash and total debt of $1.28 billion with a debt-to-cap of 29.1%. Since the Savage acquisition on April 1, 2020, we have reduced debt by $427 million. During the quarter, we generated strong cash from operations of $95 million, net of capital expenditure of $24 million, free cash flow was $71 million. At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $852 million. As of this week, our net debt was $1.2 billion, and total liquidity was $881 million. 
For the full year, we continued to expect capital spending to be approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $250 million to $310 million for the full year. Lastly, from a tax perspective, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27% in the third and fourth quarters. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."

The last 15 months have been challenging with weak markets, poor operating conditions and declining financial performance. As economies reopen in the second quarter, we experienced a welcome increase in overall demand and greatly improved market conditions. With the U.S. and international economies continuing to reopen and demand for refined products and oilfield equipment and services increasing, we see this positive momentum continuing into the second half of the year. As a result, we expect to see improvement in revenues and earnings for both of Kirby segments. 
While we are very encouraged about the recovery, we are, however, cautiously watching the rising number of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S. and around the world just now. There is a risk that these spikes, which are already resulting in new lockdowns in some locations, could adversely impact the recovery, refinery utilization and refined products demand. Although we expect this could slow the pace of the recovery, we do believe that momentum will continue to build. Additionally, as many of you know, labor constraints across the industrial supply chain are creating delays in manufacturing lead times and other supply chains. It is possible that we could see some anticipated product sales or deliveries of our manufactured equipment delayed in the second half of the year. In the inland market, our outlook remains positive. 
As of today, our barge utilization is in the mid-80% range, driven by strong activity levels in the refining and petrochemical complex. Barring a significant step change in COVID, we expect barge activity should continue to increase during the last 2 quarters of this year as a result of improving demand, including increased refinery activity, higher refined products consumption and new petrochemical plants coming online. With minimal construction of new barges and barge retirements still occurring, we believe our barge utilization will increase into the high 80% to 90% range as the year progresses. This should support further improvement in spot market pricing during the second half of the year.  
Overall, in the third quarter, we expect revenues will sequentially improve with increasing demand and spot market pricing. Although we have some modest labor inflation starting in the third quarter, we expect operating margins to increase. As a result, we expect inland operating margins will be in the low double digits, 10-ish, if you will, during the third quarter. We expect further improvement in revenue and margins for the fourth quarter but results could be tempered by the normal seasonal weather disruptions. In coastal, we expect the market will recover slower with some improvement in barge demand during the remainder of the year. In recent weeks, spot activity has modestly improved with higher economic activity and increased demand for refined products. As a result, our barge utilization has increased slightly, particularly on the West Coast where overall demand levels have been slower to recover from the pandemic. 
Overall, we expect coastal barge utilization will be in the mid-70% range in the coming months, which should yield third and fourth quarter revenues slightly higher than the second quarter. We expect coastal operating margins will improve in the second half of the year, but still remain below breakeven in the negative low to mid-single-digit range. Looking at distribution and services, we expect that economic growth, improvements in the oilfield and summer seasonality will result in sequential revenue growth with improved operating margins. 
In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway with further recovery in bus repair activity and increased parts revenue from our new online sales platform. We also expect increased Thermo King product sales and service during the peak summer demand season. In power generation, we expect increased backup power equipment sales and installations. And in our rental fleet, we should see some seasonal increases in utilization during the hurricane season. 
In marine repair, we expect a sequential reduction in revenues, primarily due to the harvest season in the dry cargo markets. In oil and gas, we believe current oil prices will contribute to continued increases in the rig count with incremental well completions activity as 2021 progresses. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in the Distribution segment for the remainder of 2021. In manufacturing, a focus on sustainability and efforts of oilfield companies to reduce their carbon footprints continues to generate increased inquiries and new orders for Kirby's portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment, including electric and dual fuel pressure pumping units and highly efficient natural gas power generation equipment for eFrac. 
We also are experiencing increased orders to remanufacture existing pressure pumping equipment. As a result, we anticipate increased deliveries of manufactured and remanufactured products in the back half of 2021. However, as mentioned previously, supply chain delays could result in some equipment delivery shifting between quarters and potentially into 2022. Overall, for the full year, our expectations have not materially changed for D&S. We anticipate significant year-on-year revenue growth of 15% to 25% with commercial and industrial representing approximately 65% of revenues and oil and gas representing the balance of 35%. We expect D&S operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year with the third quarter being the highest. In the fourth quarter, normal seasonality will likely result in some sequential reduction in operating margins. 
Before we wrap up, I want to briefly comment on 2 other matters. First, today, we announced that Bill Harvey will be retiring as Kirby's CFO early next year. Bill has been an integral part of the Kirby team for the last 4 years and has helped to guide us through several large inland marine acquisitions and the integration of Stewart & Stevenson. Bill's contributions to Kirby's success and our financial strength have been significant, and he will certainly be missed. Additionally, earlier this week, released -- we released our new 2021 Sustainability Report. This report represents another milestone in our ESG journey with new envisions disclosures for the full company as well as enhanced disclosures on safety, employee training and governance. You can access our new report in the Sustainability section on our website. 
Now to wrap things up, although there is some uncertainty around COVID-19 and its impact on the recovery, we remain very optimistic about Kirby's outlook. The second quarter was an important turning point for the company from a financial perspective with increased earnings in both segments. Most importantly, for the first time in over a year, we experienced a positive inland market that benefited from rising demand, favorable operating conditions and a major disruption. While the Colonial pipeline outage provided a temporary boost to the business, it highlighted that the inland market is well along on its path to recovery and how rapidly barge utilization can tighten and how quickly spot prices can move. The world economy is still in disarray. With much of Europe still essentially shut down and India, Mexico and South America not fully open. As the world economy fully recovers from the pandemic and demand for liquid normalizes around the world, we are confident our inland businesses will regain pre-pandemic utilization levels in the 90% range, bringing with it improved pricing, earnings and returns.  
In coastal, although market conditions remain challenging, continued retirements of industry capacity and a lack of any new construction will keep capacity in check and allow for a solid rebound once the U.S. economy fully recovers. And finally, in distribution and services, we have come a long way in the last year, with steady improvements in financial performance. Our distribution businesses have not yet fully recovered, and there is room for further improvement as we go forward. With more favorable oilfield fundamentals and increased demand for lower carbon solutions, our new and highly efficient, environmentally friendly pressure pumping and power generation equipment is capturing the attention of our customers and translating into new orders that will provide additional growth in the second half of the year and into 2022. 
Overall, we have made substantial progress during the last year in very difficult markets. We realigned our cost structure, expanded our product offering in D&S and improved our financial flexibility. Our marine markets have stabilized and are beginning to improve. All of this has set the stage for improved earnings and returns and will allow us to take advantage of future growth opportunities. 
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

Yes, Jack, look, the inland trends continue to improve. We've -- in the first quarter, we were down in the mid-70s in terms of utility. We got to low 80s at the beginning of the second quarter kind of ramped up into the mid-80s and then the Colonial",562,"Sure. Yes, Jack, look, the inland trends continue to improve. We've -- in the first quarter, we were down in the mid-70s in terms of utility. We got to low 80s at the beginning of the second quarter kind of ramped up into the mid-80s and then the Colonial Pipeline outage had a little spike, got us up to high 80s to essentially 90%, and little less than 90%. But then it started to taper off as Colonial came back in and better weather started to help transit time. So we did end the quarter kind of in the mid-80s. But the important thing is spot pricing and contract pricing improved a bit. Contract pricing was still down year-over-year. You go all the way back to the second quarter in 2020. So we kind of lapped that quarter. Those were higher prices back then. So contract pricing was down kind of mid- to high single digits, but spot pricing was up in the double-digit range, around 10%. 
And that, to your question, put spot pricing above contracts now. And that's what we need. We need that to stay above contracts. We need the customers to believe it's going to stay that way for a while. And then that contract portfolio start to renew higher. That may take another quarter or 2 before we kind of lap contract prices and they start renewing higher. But look, margins improved. We kind of went from low to mid-single digits in inland in the first quarter to kind of high single digits. We'll be in double digits next quarter in the third quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be hard to say because weather can impact us a bit. But all the trends are in the right direction. 
I mean, when you think about customers and what's going on in the world right now, crude demand seems to be back. It's within kind of the 5-year historical trends. Crude storage is now just -- well, it's actually below the 5-year average now. TSA checkpoint data shows throughput has improved about 20% in the last quarter or so. Gulf Coast refineries are back in the 90% range. Chemical activity barometers are up. Retail sales are up. Leading indicators are up. New manufacturing orders are up. So the economy feels like it's coming back. I think we're all a little nervous about COVID right now. We're seeing some cases within Kirby pop up again and hearing about some spotty lockdowns. So in the past, I think last quarter, I used 40. It's hard to be -- to use that word when you're looking at COVID reemerging here. 
But all of that economic data shows that things are continuing to move and open up. I think when we talked to our customers, what they're telling us is that the international and export volumes are still not there. They're probably 15% lower than they were pre-COVID. And when you think about that kind of makes sense. You've got Mexico, Latin America, South America essentially in various stages of shutdown. Europe still really hasn't opened up. India is kind of reacting and essentially locked down. So a lot of those export volumes are down. So domestically, things are improving, but the global economies are not quite back and that's what we're hearing from our customers. All that said, it's pretty positive."

So I guess for my follow-up question, David, as we think out over the next couple of years, I would be curious to get your thoughts on how you would expect industry capacity to trend? What's your expectation around net retirements for 2021? And given the rise in commodity prices and steel prices, where do you think rates would need to go to or maybe if you want to think about magnitude of an increase from where we are right now, just to support building for replacement much less thinking about building for expansion on the inland side?"

We're -- look, we're -- we think the order book is about 70 -- between 70, 75 barges, maybe I don't think the actual count that we have is 72 barges for delivery this year. About half of them have been delivered.",302,"Sure. Yes, thanks for that question, Jack. We're -- look, we're -- we think the order book is about 70 -- between 70, 75 barges, maybe I don't think the actual count that we have is 72 barges for delivery this year. About half of them have been delivered. The first half were really all ordered pre-pandemic, and they just started delivering. But new barge pricing is at an all-time high. If you look kind of price changes from 2020 to 2021, a Clean 30, the price for a Clean 30 is now almost 40% higher than it was last year. Steel prices are driving a big part of that. Clean 30 now is probably $3.8 million. In 2018, just to reference that, it was about 2.5; in 2017, it was around 2 to build a Clean 30. So steel prices have driven that up labor to a lesser extent. 
But look, nobody is building a lot of barges right now and retirements are up. Scrap steel prices are up, so retirements are a little more palatable. So it's pretty constructive right now. We don't see really a net add in terms of new barges. And in fact, what we saw with Colonial makes us feel pretty good about kind of the unutilized overhang. For us to -- in the space of 2 weeks to see the industry kind of go to sold out in Clean 30 market, it shows you how little overhang there really is. And I think a lot of that's because of the retirements that have occurred and there's not a lot of new equipment coming in. And to be fair, a number of our competitors, including us, still have some equipment on the bank. So from a supply and demand standpoint, it feels pretty good right now."

Again,I think Atlantic Coast is better utilized than, say, the West Coast. But there's no new construction that we're aware of. No new barges are being built. In the coastal market, there is -- it takes a long time. It could take up to 2 years or longer to get a new coastal tug and barge unit. Now that said, the Bushard assets are out there. You may have seen that they were sold out of the bankruptcy court. Somebody's going to have to sink a lot of money back in to get some of that equipment moving. So that's a slight overhang in the market. 
But as you heard in our prepared remarks, coastal pricing kind of held flat, but its utility is less than on the inland side. Look, as you know, the coastal market is more about refined products than it is chemicals, whereas the inland market is a little more chemical heavy. So again, we need to see the refined market just continue to expand, and I think that will soak up capacity with the caveat the Bushard equipment may come back over a period of time. I think it takes several years for that equipment to come back in any meaningful manner. Just knowing how much maintenance will need to be done on that equipment."

As you know, in our D&S business, we've got commercial and industrial and then oil and gas business. The commercial industrial was profitable kind of in the low to mid-single digits -- kind of mid-single digits, if you will, in terms of margins. Oil and gas was still a little negative. The good news there is we've had good inbound. Our backlog is up pretty meaningfully. One of the things we're seeing is we've got a lot of new products. Really, if you think about electric microgrids and supporting the electric frac equipment and electric frac build-outs, we've got some new generation products. And in that new generation products, there's kind of the first set of them, the margins are really thin and there's a lot of engineering and testing that goes on. 
So that's a long way of saying, yes, we believe the margins will improve in that business next quarter and certainly into 2022 as we deliver more and more of the eFrac and power generation support equipment for eFrac. Backlog continues to build. We continue to take new orders. It's pretty exciting. I would say that all of our pressure pumping customers are very focused on ESG right now, which generally means more eFrac. There is some dynamic gas blending, dual fuel work, but the bulk of the orders we've been receiving have been in eFrac and the new generation eFrac has basically some start-up lower margins. I think we'll be solidly profitable in the coming quarters around these new eFrac products."

Well, let me take your -- the last part of that question first.

Well, let me take your -- the last part of that question first. With barge pricing for a brand-new clean 30,000-barrel barge being $3.6 million to $3.8 million, in order to get a return on capital on that, that's got to be materially higher. We're talking for 2 barge to kind of north of $8,500 a day to get double-digit IRR. So the short answer is, yes. With the cost of price of new equipment and of course, with some labor inflation on top of that, and by the way, we are seeing food inflation. When we do crew transport, whether it's renting cars or flying, we're seeing those costs come up, hotel costs are coming up as we have to put crew members in hotels before they crew on. So we are seeing some inflation. And all things being equal, that labor and cost inflation and the cost of the equipment inflation should drive higher -- the need for higher, as you stated, mid-cycle pricing. 
The other thing is, we haven't talked much about this, but as you get into ESG and look at the engine packages on towboats and tugboats, you've got to start moving to Tier 4 engine packages, which are much more expensive and frankly more expensive to operate. So when you put all that together, yes, we're going to need higher mid-cycle pricing throughout the industry to recover any kind of capital."

I would say, look, there's a lot of installed equipment out there that is still functional, it still can be remanufactured and have quite a bit of life left in it. We're seeing a little bit of that come back now. But I would say any new capital, the definite trend on new capital is for eFrac. That said, maintenance and maintenance capital -- look, the economics are still good. If you've got these fleets, traditional diesel-driven fleets, it still makes sense to remanufacture them. We're just not seeing a lot of it, to be honest. Essentially, most of the new orders in period have been ESG related. As we get tighter, that dynamic will, in my opinion, change, and we'll see more remanufacturing. 
Will this be kind of blowing and going like we saw in 2011? I don't think so, Greg. I think it feels, rightly or wrongly, a lot more capital discipline. I think many of the private companies, in particular, there's not as much capital available. So -- and if there is capital, the lenders kind of want to see an ESG flip forward. So all that said, I still think reman makes sense, and we'll see more reman than less as we go forward. It's just been pretty thin now. We're starting to see more of it, but it's still kind of early days in that area, in my opinion."

I would just tell you on refinery utilization, be a little careful in that, in the last 1.5 years, about 5% of the refining capacity was either shut down or idled. So yes, we're back up above 90%, but that's on a lower base. It was about 1 million barrels roughly, plus or minus a little bit 1 million barrels of refining capacity that's been shut down and idle. Now we've seen some good signs recently, the [health issue] refinery came back online, and so that's coming back. But as you think of refinery utilization, you've got to factor in that about 5% of the total complex was shut down and we need some of that to be restarted. 
Now the other interesting thing is rather than restarting that, we're seeing more biodiesel and renewable diesel, which particularly if you take soybean oil and make it into diesel, that's -- those are going to be barge moves kind of most likely coming out of the Midwest as they make renewable diesel. So we're watching all that. Does that help the coastal market, the renewable diesel? Maybe, we've actually had coastal unit go and move some renewable diesel. So we're watching it. But again, we're still at lower levels. And I think we need some of the export market to come back and some of those refineries that have been idle to come back to really make a dent in the coastal utilization."

Well, I'll tell a little bit more on eFrac before I go into the commercial and industrial power generation. In eFrac, Stewart & Stevenson started making its first generation eFrac back in 2013, which was all around the gas turbine driving electric drive. And the newer kind of generation that everybody is excited about is using natural gas, power generation, engine packages from CAT or MTU to basically develop electric power with, say, 10 natural gas power generation engines on a micro grid on a well pad. And there is an element of having backup energy storage there so that you can run all the natural gas generation equipment at its peak efficiency and take them on and offline correctly. 
When you start to look at the commercial market, it's more one-off rather than big microgrid that generates huge numbers of megawatts. What we've seen is a lot more standby backup power. We have a power generation rental fleet that, frankly, we get a lot of business from our hurricane backup. During hurricanes, the lights of the big-box stores will put us on standby in case there's an outage. I think as you've seen with the Texas storm, which took out a good part of the grid and some of the challenges in California with the electric grid, and then as you think of EVs taking more of the electric grid, I think businesses, in general, are looking more and more at backup power. And we're really trying to capture parts of that market with our OEMs that we represent, the engine manufacturers. And that's how we are. 
We're a distributor, as you know, Bill, for a number of people. And essentially, we're using that relationship to go to market for backup power. We have a pretty good presence up in the Northeast, and we've been working to get into backup power for big financial institutions, to a lesser extent in Florida for some of the kind of healthcare, nursing home, hospital type backup power. It will be interesting to see if the grid gets more and more utilized and electricity becomes more and more important as electrification occurs across both the passenger car market and other markets, what the demands for backup power will be. We're trying to position it. I would tell you that we're -- going to market in the future will be to take that backup power and couple it with our energy storage system, i.e., our battery system. So that there's a situation where you can charge the battery and you'll always have backup power and not need as much in terms of diesel to drive backup power. Maybe there's a couple -- coupling with solar on certain rooftops of commercial buildings. 
So that's all kind of new areas that we're working on. There's nothing to put in the model yet for  that market. But that's what we're looking at and what we're pursuing from an ESG standpoint, Bill."

Looking at our segments. In marine transportation, the inland market experienced a strong improvement in demand with overall barge utilization increasing into the low to mid-80% range. The quarter started with some softness as many petrochemical plants struggled to restart following the February winter storm, which shut down up to 50% of the Gulf Coast production for a period of time. But by early May, however, most of the petrochemical complex had resumed production, refinery utilization was firmly in the high 80s and demand for refined products was steadily increasing as the U.S. economy reopen. 
As a result, activity in the barge markets started to ramp up nicely and barge pricing moved off the bottom. The inland market tightened further in mid-May when the Colonial Pipeline shut down, and many of our customers turned to barges for transportation and storage. In a matter of days, our barge utilization increased to near 90%. While this event was temporary and overall activity levels moderated in June, the inland business experienced a favorable shift in market dynamics. As a result, inland ton miles increased 17% when compared to the first quarter. Average spot market pricing also improved sequentially for the first time in more than a year, and even -- and although still down relative to last year, term contract pricing pressure moderated. 
Overall, inland revenues sequentially increased 13% and operating margins recovered into the high single digits. In coastal, market fundamentals for the second quarter were largely unchanged with continued low barge utilization and few spot requirements. However, overall pricing remained stable during the second quarter. In distribution and services, we experienced continued positive momentum with improved activity levels, strong sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating margin levels not seen since the third quarter of 2019. The most significant increases came from our oil and gas businesses, which experienced increased demand as U.S. rig counts and frac activity moved higher and our customers increased their spending levels. 
In manufacturing, incremental orders and deliveries of new environmentally-friendly pressure pumping equipment and frac-related power generation equipment contributed favorably to the quarter's results. We also experienced a strong increase in demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our oil and gas distribution business from major oilfield customers.
In commercial and industrial, the continued economic recovery resulted in sequential improved demand in our on-highway businesses. Product sales in Thermo King also increased during the quarter. These gains were partially offset by sequentially lower revenues in commercial power generation related to the timing of large backup power installations. Marine repair activity was also down modestly during the quarter.
 
In summary, the second quarter was a turning point for Kirby with both our segments experiencing improved activity levels and better financial performance. We expect to see this momentum continue in the second half of the year. And in a few minutes, I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of 2021. 
But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our second quarter segment results and the balance sheet."

In the 2021 second quarter, marine transportation revenues were $332.9 million with an operating income of $18.5 million and an operating margin of 5.6%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, marine revenues de",1043,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the 2021 second quarter, marine transportation revenues were $332.9 million with an operating income of $18.5 million and an operating margin of 5.6%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, marine revenues declined $48 million or 13% and operating income declined $32.9 million. The reductions are primarily due to lower inland and coastal barge utilization and significantly reduced pricing in inland partially offset by increased fuel rebuilds due to higher diesel prices. Compared to the 2021 first quarter, marine revenues increased $31.9 million or 11%, and operating income increased $16.6 million. These increases are primarily a result of increased inland barge utilization and improved spot market pricing. As expected, second quarter operating margins were somewhat impacted by increased maintenance and [ ops ] costs as we continue to ramp up our operations. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 76% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization improved into the low to mid-80% range compared to the mid-70% range in the 2021 first quarter. Inland barge volumes increased sequentially as the U.S. economy continued to improve as the COVID-19 pandemic lessened and Gulf Coast refinery and chemical plant activity recovered from the effects of Winter Storm Uri. Barge demand also benefited from the Colonial Pipeline outage in May. 
Overall, these factors contributed to a 70% increase in ton miles as compared to the first quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts or those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue with 57% from time charters and 43% from contracts of affreightment. The significant increase in barge activity in the second quarter contributed to average spot market rates improving approximately 10% sequentially. 
However, average spot rates remained down approximately 10% to 15% when compared to the 2020 second quarter. Only a few term contracts renewed during the second quarter and average rates were down in the mid to high single digits. It will take time as market conditions improve for term contracts to renew higher. And we will need to see spot prices remain above term contract prices to get term contract pricing going in the right direction. As term contracts renew higher, we will see improvements in operating margins. Overall, during the second quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the high single digits.
In coastal, our business continued to be challenged by weak demand for refined products and black oil. During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the low to mid-70% range primarily due to weak spot market dynamics in the West Coast and Hawaii, where economies have experienced a slower recovery from the pandemic. Despite reduced barge utilization, coastal revenues improved slightly, both sequentially and year-on-year due to increased fuel rebuilds. With respect to pricing, average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were stable. 
During the second quarter, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. Coastal's operating margin in the second quarter was in the negative mid-single digits. With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the second quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2021 second quarter were $226.7 million with an operating income of $6.2 million and an operating margin of 2.7%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, distribution and services revenue increased $66.5 million or 42% and operating income improved $20.3 million. Compared to the 2021 first quarter, revenues increased $30.8 million or 16% and operating income increased $3.3 million. These improvements are primarily due to a significant increase in demand for our oil and gas products and services as well as the improved economic condition across the U.S. which is raising demand for equipment, parts and service in the commercial and industrial markets. 
In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity across the U.S. resulted in improved sequential and year-on-year demand for equipment parts and services in our on-highway business. Revenues in our Thermo King business were also higher. In power generation, activity increased year-on-year due to higher sales and installations following the pandemic, but was down sequentially due to the timing of backup power installations in the northeast. Marine revenues were down sequentially and year-on-year due to reduced major overhauls. 
During the second quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 62% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the mid-single digits. In oil and gas, improving market dynamics and increased activity in the oilfield contributed to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating income. Our manufacturing businesses experienced substantial increases in deliveries of new pressure pumping and frac related power generation equipment as well as steady demand for seismic units for international markets. 
Our oil and gas distribution business also improved sequentially and year-on-year with increased demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. For the second quarter, the oil and gas related businesses represented approximately 38% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the low single digits.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $53 million of cash and total debt of $1.28 billion with a debt-to-cap of 29.1%. Since the Savage acquisition on April 1, 2020, we have reduced debt by $427 million. During the quarter, we generated strong cash from operations of $95 million, net of capital expenditure of $24 million, free cash flow was $71 million. At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $852 million. As of this week, our net debt was $1.2 billion, and total liquidity was $881 million.
 
For the full year, we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $250 million to $310 million for the full year. Lastly, from a tax perspective, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27% in the third and fourth quarters. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."
283986,1672577624,2374351,"Kirby Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. The last 15 months have been challenging with weak markets, poor operating conditions and declining financial performance. As economies reopen in the second quarter, we experienced a welcome increase in overall demand and greatly improved",1409,"Thank you, Bill. The last 15 months have been challenging with weak markets, poor operating conditions and declining financial performance. As economies reopen in the second quarter, we experienced a welcome increase in overall demand and greatly improved market conditions. With the U.S. and international economies continuing to reopen and demand for refined products and oilfield equipment and services increasing, we see this positive momentum continuing into the second half of the year. As a result, we expect to see improvement in revenues and earnings for both of Kirby segments. 
While we are very encouraged about the recovery, we are, however, cautiously watching the rising number of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S. and around the world just now. There is a risk that these spikes, which are already resulting in new lockdowns in some locations, could adversely impact the recovery, refinery utilization and refined products demand. Although we expect this could slow the pace of the recovery, we do believe that momentum will continue to build. 
Additionally, as many of you know, labor constraints across the industrial supply chain are creating delays in manufacturing lead times and other supply chains. It is possible that we could see some anticipated product sales or deliveries of our manufactured equipment delayed in the second half of the year. In the inland market, our outlook remains positive. As of today, our barge utilization is in the mid-80% range driven by strong activity levels in the refining and petrochemical complex. 
Barring a significant step change in COVID, we expect barge activity should continue to increase during the last 2 quarters of this year as a result of improving demand, including increased refinery activity, higher refined products consumption and new petrochemical plants coming online. With minimal construction of new barges and barge retirement still occurring, we believe our barge utilization will increase into the high 80% to 90% range as the year progresses. This should support further improvement in spot market pricing during the second half of the year. 
Overall, in the third quarter, we expect revenues will sequentially improve with increasing demand and spot market pricing. Although we have some modest labor inflation starting in the third quarter, we expect operating margins to increase. As a result, we expect inland operating margins will be in the low double digits, 10-ish, if you will, during the third quarter. We expect further improvement in revenue and margins for the fourth quarter, but results could be tampered by the normal seasonal weather disruptions. 
In coastal, we expect the market will recover slower with some improvement in barge demand during the remainder of the year. In recent weeks, spot activity has modestly improved with higher economic activity and increased demand for refined products. As a result, our barge utilization has increased slightly, particularly on the West Coast where overall demand levels have been slower to recover from the pandemic.
 
Overall, we expect coastal barge utilization will be in the mid-70% range in the coming months, which should yield third and fourth quarter revenues slightly higher than the second quarter. We expect coastal operating margins will improve in the second half of the year, but still remain below breakeven in the negative low to mid-single-digit range.
Looking at distribution and services. We expect that economic growth, improvements in the oilfield and summer seasonality will result in sequential revenue growth with improved operating margins. In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway with further recovery in bus repair activity and increased parts revenue from our new online sales platform. We also expect increased Thermo King product sales and service during the peak summer demand season. In power generation, we expect increased backup power equipment sales and installations. And in our rental fleet, we should see some seasonal increases in utilization during the hurricane season. 
In marine repair, we expect a sequential reduction in revenues primarily due to the harvest season in the dry cargo markets. In oil and gas, we believe current oil prices will contribute to continued increases in the rig count with incremental well completions activity as 2021 progresses. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in the distribution segment for the remainder of 2021. 
In manufacturing, a focus on sustainability and efforts of oilfield companies to reduce their carbon footprints continues to generate increased inquiries and new orders for Kirby's portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment, including electric and dual fuel pressure pumping units and highly efficient natural gas power generation equipment for eFrac. 
We also are experiencing increased orders to remanufacture existing pressure pumping equipment. As a result, we anticipate increased deliveries of manufactured and remanufactured products in the back half of 2021. However, as mentioned previously, supply chain delays could result in some equipment delivery shifting between quarters and potentially into 2022. 
Overall, for the full year, our expectations have not materially changed for D&S. We anticipate significant year-on-year revenue growth of 15% to 25% with commercial and industrial representing approximately 65% of revenues and oil and gas representing the balance of 35%. We expect D&S operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year with the third quarter being the highest. In the fourth quarter, normal seasonality will likely result in some sequential reduction in operating margins. 
Before we wrap up, I want to briefly comment on 2 other matters. First, today, we announced that Bill Harvey will be retiring as Kirby's CFO early next year. Bill has been an integral part of the Kirby team for the last 4 years and has helped to guide us through several large inland marine acquisitions and the integration of Stewart & Stevenson. Bill's contributions to Kirby's success and our financial strength have been significant, and he will certainly be missed. Additionally, earlier this week, released -- we released our new 2021 Sustainability Report. This report represents another milestone in our ESG journey with new envisions disclosures for the full company as well as enhanced disclosures on safety, employee training and governance. You can access our new report in the Sustainability section on our website. 
Now to wrap things up, although there is some uncertainty around COVID-19 and its impact on the recovery, we remain very optimistic about Kirby's outlook. The second quarter was an important turning point for the company from a financial perspective with increased earnings in both segments. Most importantly, for the first time in over a year, we experienced a positive inland market that benefited from rising demand, favorable operating conditions and a major disruption. While the Colonial pipeline outage provided a temporary boost to the business, it highlighted that the inland market is well along on its path to recovery and how rapidly barge utilization can tighten and how quickly spot prices can move. 
The world economy is still in disarray. With much of Europe still essentially shut down and India, Mexico and South America not fully open -- as the world economy fully recovers from the pandemic and demand for liquid normalizes around the world, we are confident our inland businesses will regain prepandemic utilization levels in the 90% range, bringing with it improved pricing, earnings and returns. In coastal, although market conditions remain challenging, continued retirements of industry capacity and a lack of any new construction will keep capacity in check and allow for a solid rebound once the U.S. economy fully recovers. 
And finally, in distribution and services, we have come a long way in the last year, with steady improvements in financial performance. Our distribution businesses have not yet fully recovered, and there is room for further improvement as we go forward. With more favorable oilfield fundamentals and increased demand for lower carbon solutions, our new and highly efficient, environmentally friendly pressure pumping and power generation equipment is capturing the attention of our customers and translating into new orders that will provide additional growth in the second half of the year and into 2022. 
Overall, we have made substantial progress during the last year in very difficult markets. We realigned our cost structure, expanded our product offering in D&S and improved our financial flexibility. Our marine markets have stabilized and are beginning to improve. All of this has set the stage for improved earnings and returns and will allow us to take advantage of future growth opportunities. 
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

You mentioned you're currently running at about 85% utilization rate. Just be curious to know, are your customers giving you any indication for how they're expecting their activity levels to trend over the balance of the year? 
And how do you think that's going to impact utilization as we move through the third quarter? And I would just be kind of curious as well, David, could you talk about where we are with spot rates relative to contract rates? Are spot rates back at or above contract rates? And if you could just sort of update us there, I think that’d be helpful."

Yes, Jack, look, the inland trends continue to improve. We -- in the first quarter, we were down in the mid-70s in terms of utility. We got to low 80s at the beginning of the second quarter kind of ramped up into the mid-80s and then the Colonial Pi",563,"Sure. Yes, Jack, look, the inland trends continue to improve. We -- in the first quarter, we were down in the mid-70s in terms of utility. We got to low 80s at the beginning of the second quarter kind of ramped up into the mid-80s and then the Colonial Pipeline outage had a little spike, got us up to high 80s to essentially 90% and -- little less than 90%. But then it started to taper off as Colonial came back in and better weather started to help transit time. 
So we did end the quarter kind of in the mid-80s. But the important thing is spot pricing and contract pricing improved a bit. Contract pricing was still down year-over-year. You go all the way back to the second quarter in 2020. So we kind of lapped that quarter. Those were higher prices back then. So contract pricing was down kind of mid to high single digits, but spot pricing was up in the double-digit range, around 10%. 
And that, to your question, put spot pricing above contracts now. And that's what we need. We need that to stay above contracts. We need the customers to believe it's going to stay that way for a while. And then that contract portfolio start to renew higher. That may take another quarter or 2 before we kind of lap contract prices and they start renewing higher. But look, margins improved. We kind of went from low to mid-single digits in inland in the first quarter to kind of high single digits. We'll be in double digits next quarter in the third quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be hard to say because weather can impact us a bit. But all the trends are in the right direction. 
I mean when you think about customers and what's going on in the world right now, crude demand seems to be back. It's within kind of the 5-year historical trends. Crude storage is now just -- well, it's actually below the 5-year average now. TSA checkpoint data shows throughput has improved about 20% in the last quarter or so. Gulf Coast refineries are back in the 90% range. Chemical activity barometers are up. Retail sales are up. Leading indicators are up. New manufacturing orders are up. So the economy feels like it's coming back. I think we're all a little nervous about COVID right now. We're seeing some cases within Kirby pop up again and hearing about some spotty lockdowns. So in the past, I think last quarter, I used 40. It's hard to be -- to use that word when you're looking at COVID reemerging here. 
But all of that economic data shows that things are continuing to move and open up. I think when we talked to our customers, what they're telling us is that the international and export volumes are still not there. They're probably 15% lower than they were pre-COVID. And when you think about that kind of make sense. You've got Mexico, Latin America, South America essentially in various stages of shutdown. Europe still really hasn't opened up. India is kind of reacting and essentially locked down. So a lot of those export volumes are down. So domestically, things are improving, but the global economies are not quite back and that's what we're hearing from our customers. All that said, it's pretty positive."

What's your expectation around net retirements for 2021? And given the rise in commodity prices and steel prices, where do you think rates would need to go to or maybe if you want to think about magnitude of an increase from where we are right now, just to support building for replacement much less thinking about building for expansion on the inland side?"

We're -- look, we're -- we think the order book is about 70 -- between 70, 75 barges, maybe I don't think the actual count that we have is 72 barges for delivery this year. About half of them have been delivered.",303,"Sure. Yes, thanks for that question, Jack. We're -- look, we're -- we think the order book is about 70 -- between 70, 75 barges, maybe I don't think the actual count that we have is 72 barges for delivery this year. About half of them have been delivered. The first half were really all ordered prepandemic, and they just started delivering. But new barge pricing is at an all-time high. If you look kind of price changes from 2020 to 2021, a Clean 30, the price for a Clean 30 is now almost 40% higher than it was last year. Steel prices are driving a big part of that. Clean 30 now is probably $3.8 million. In 2018, just to reference that, it was about $2.5 million; 2017, it was around $2 million to build a Clean 30. So steel prices have driven that up labor to a lesser extent. 
But look, nobody is building a lot of barges right now and retirements are up. Scrap steel prices are up, so retirements are a little more palatable. So it's pretty constructive right now. We don't see really a net add in terms of new barges. And in fact, what we saw with Colonial makes us feel pretty good about kind of the unutilized overhang for us to -- in the space of 2 weeks to see the industry kind of go to sold out in Clean 30 market, it shows you how little overhang there really is. And I think a lot of that's because of the retirements that have occurred and there's not a lot of new equipment coming in. And to be fair, a number of our competitors, including us, still have some equipment on the bank. So from a supply and demand standpoint, it feels pretty good right now."

And so I think as the economy improves and this utilization hits the mid-80s and it's in the mid-80s now that customer view that it's going to stay that way for a while or perhaps even get tighter really helps the pricing dynamic. So we're right there at that dynamic. And we're very encouraged. Spot pricing is now above contract, and we had a nice move. It was helped by the Colonial.

Again, I think Atlantic Coast is better utilized than, say, the West Coast. But there's no new construction that we're aware of. No new barges are being built. In the coastal market, there is -- it takes a long time. It could take up to 2 years or longer to get a new coastal tug and barge unit. Now that said, the Bushard assets are out there. You may have seen that they were sold out of the bankruptcy court. Somebody's going to have to sink a lot of money back in to get some of that equipment moving. So that's a slight overhang in the market. 
But as you heard in our prepared remarks, coastal pricing kind of held flat, but its utility is less than on the inland side. Look, as you know, the coastal market is more about refined products than it is chemicals, whereas the inland market is a little more chemical heavy. So again, we need to see the refined market just continue to expand, and I think that will soak up capacity with the caveat the Bushard equipment may come back over a period of time. I think it takes several years for that equipment to come back in any meaningful manner. Just knowing how much maintenance will need to be done on that equipment."

The commercial, industrial was profitable kind of in the low to mid-single digits -- kind of mid-single digits, if you will, in terms of margins. Oil and gas was still a little negative. The good news there is we've had good inbound. Our backlog is up pretty meaningfully. One of the things we're seeing is we've got a lot of new products. Really, if you think about electric microgrids in supporting electric frac equipment and electric frac buildouts, we've got some new generation products. And in that new generation products, there's kind of the first set of them, the margins are really thin and there's a lot of engineering and testing that goes on. 
So that's a long way of saying, yes, we believe the margins will improve in that business next quarter and certainly into 2022 as we deliver more and more of these eFrac and power generation support equipment for eFrac. Backlog continues to build. We continue to take new orders. It's pretty exciting. I would say that all of our pressure pumping customers are very focused on ESG right now, which generally means more eFrac. There is some dynamic gas blending, dual fuel work, but the bulk of the orders we've been receiving have been in eFrac and the new generation eFrac has basically some start-up lower margins.

Well, let me take your -- the last part of that question first.

With barge pricing for a brand-new clean 30,000-barrel barge being $3.6 million to $3.8 million, in order to get a return on capital on that, that's got to be materially higher. We're talking for 2 barge to kind of north of 8,500 a day to get double-digit IRR. So the short answer is, yes. With the cost of price of new equipment and of course, with some labor inflation on top of that, and by the way, we are seeing food inflation. When we do crew transport, whether it's renting cars or flying, we're seeing those costs come up, hotel costs are coming up as we have to put crew members in hotels before they crew on. So we are seeing some inflation. And all things being equal, that labor and cost inflation and the cost of the equipment inflation should drive higher -- the need for higher, as you stated, mid-cycle pricing. 
The other thing is, we haven't talked much about this, but as you get into ESG and look at the engine packages on towboats and tugboats, you've got to start moving to Tier 4 engine packages, which are much more expensive and frankly more expensive to operate. So when you put all that together, yes, we're going to need higher mid-cycle pricing throughout the industry to recover any kind of capital."

That said, maintenance and maintenance capital -- look, the economics are still good. If you've got these fleets, traditional diesel-driven fleets, it still makes sense to remanufacture them. We're just not seeing a lot of it, to be honest. Essentially, most of the new orders or orders in period have been ESG related. As we get tighter, that dynamic will, in my opinion, change, and we'll see more remanufacturing. 
Will this be kind of blowing and going like we saw in 2011? I don't think so, Greg. I think it feels, rightly or wrongly, a lot more capital discipline. I think many of the private companies, in particular, there's not as much capital available. So -- and if there is capital, the lenders kind of want to see an ESG flip forward. So all that said, I still think reman makes sense, and we'll see more reman than less as we go forward. It's just been pretty thin now.

So yes, we're back up above 90%, but that's on a lower base. It was about 1 million barrels roughly, plus or minus a little bit 1 million barrels of refining capacity that's been shut down and idle. Now we've seen some good signs recently, the [ health issue ] refinery came back online, and so that's coming back. But as you think of refinery utilization, you've got to factor in that about 5% of the total complex was shut down and we need some of that to be restarted. 
Now the other interesting thing is rather than restarting that, we're seeing more biodiesel and renewable diesel, which particularly if you take soybean oil and make it into diesel, that's -- those are going to be barge moves kind of most likely coming out of the Midwest as they make renewable diesel. So we're watching all that. Does that help the coastal market, the renewable diesel? Maybe, we've actually had a coastal unit go and move some renewable diesel. So we're watching it. But again, we're still at lower levels.

Well, I'll tell a little bit more on eFrac before I go into the commercial and industrial power generation. In eFrac, Stewart & Stevenson started making its first generation eFrac back in 2013, which was all around the gas turbine driving electric drive. And the newer kind of generation that everybody is excited about is using natural gas, power generation, engine packages from CAT or MTU to basically develop electric power with, say, 10 natural gas power generation engines on a micro grid on a well pad. And there is an element of having backup energy storage there so that you can run all the natural gas generation equipment at its peak efficiency and take them on and offline correctly. 
When you start to look at the commercial market, it's more one-off rather than big microgrid that generates huge numbers of megawatts. What we've seen is a lot more standby backup power. We have a power generation rental fleet that, frankly, we get a lot of business from our hurricane backup. During hurricanes, the likes of the big box stores will put us on standby in case there's an outage. I think as you've seen with the Texas storm, which took out a good part of the grid and some of the challenges in California with the electric grid, and then as you think of EVs taking more of the electric grid, I think, businesses, in general, are looking more and more at backup power. And we're really trying to capture parts of that market with our OEMs that we represent, the engine manufacturers. And that's how we are. 
We're a distributor, as you know, Bill, for a number of people. And essentially, we're using that relationship to go to market for backup power. We have a pretty good presence up in the Northeast, and we've been working to get into backup power for big financial institutions to a lesser extent in Florida for some of the kind of health care, nursing home, hospital type backup power. It will be interesting to see if the grid gets more and more utilized and electricity becomes more and more important as electrification occurs across both the passenger car market and other market, what the demands for backup power will be. We're trying to position it. I would tell you that we're -- going to market in the future will be to take that backup power and couple it with our energy storage system, i.e., our battery system. So that there's situation where you can charge the battery and you'll always have backup power and not need as much in terms of diesel to drive backup power. Maybe there's a couple -- coupling with solar on certain rooftops of commercial buildings. 
So that's all kind of new areas that we're working on. There's nothing to put in the model yet for that market. But that's what we're looking at and what we're pursuing from an ESG standpoint, Bill."

Earlier today, we announced net earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 second quarter. The quarter's results were improved across both segments as the U.S. economy continued to rebound -- the Gulf Coast petrochemical and refining complex recovered from Winter Storm Uri and oilfield activity and spending ramped up. Overall, our activity levels increased significantly in both marine transportation and distribution and services, which led to a 13% sequential increase in total revenues and a material improvement in earnings. 
Looking at our segments. In marine transportation, the inland market experienced a strong improvement in demand with overall barge utilization increasing into the low to mid-80% range. The quarter started with some softness as many petrochemical plants struggled to restart following the February winter storm, which shut down up to 50% of the Gulf Coast production for a period of time. But by early May, however, most of the petrochemical complex had resumed production, refinery utilization was firmly in the high 80s and demand for refined products was steadily increasing as the U.S. economy reopen. 
As a result, activity in the barge markets started to ramp up nicely and barge pricing moved off the bottom. The inland market tightened further in mid-May when the Colonial Pipeline shut down, and many of our customers turned to barges for transportation and storage. In a matter of days, our barge utilization increased to near 90%. While this event was temporary and overall activity levels moderated in June, the inland business experienced a favorable shift in market dynamics. As a result, inland ton miles increased 17% when compared to the first quarter. Average spot market pricing also improved sequentially for the first time in more than a year, and even -- and although still down relative to last year, term contract pricing pressure moderated. 
Overall, inland revenues sequentially increased 13% and operating margins recovered into the high single digits. In coastal, market fundamentals for the second quarter were largely unchanged with continued low barge utilization and few spot requirements. However, overall pricing remained stable during the second quarter. In distribution and services, we experienced continued positive momentum with improved activity levels, strong sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating margin levels not seen since the third quarter of 2019. The most significant increases came from our oil and gas businesses, which experienced increased demand as U.S. rig counts and frac activity moved higher and our customers increased their spending levels. 
In manufacturing, incremental orders and deliveries of new environmentally-friendly pressure pumping equipment and frac-related power generation equipment contributed favorably to the quarter's results. We also experienced a strong increase in demand for new transmissions, parts and service in our oil and gas distribution business from major oilfield customers.
In commercial and industrial, the continued economic recovery resulted in sequential improved demand in our on-highway businesses. Product sales in Thermo King also increased during the quarter. These gains were partially offset by sequentially lower revenues in commercial power generation related to the timing of large backup power installations. Marine repair activity was also down modestly during the quarter.
 
In summary, the second quarter was a turning point for Kirby with both our segments experiencing improved activity levels and better financial performance. We expect to see this momentum continue in the second half of the year. And in a few minutes, I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of 2021. 
But before I do, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our second quarter segment results and the balance sheet."
283986,1672577624,2374353,"Kirby Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the 2021 second quarter, marine transportation revenues were $332.9 million with an operating income of $18.5 million and an operating margin of 5.6%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, marine revenues de",1043,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. In the 2021 second quarter, marine transportation revenues were $332.9 million with an operating income of $18.5 million and an operating margin of 5.6%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, marine revenues declined $48 million or 13% and operating income declined $32.9 million. The reductions are primarily due to lower inland and coastal barge utilization and significantly reduced pricing in inland partially offset by increased fuel rebuilds due to higher diesel prices. Compared to the 2021 first quarter, marine revenues increased $31.9 million or 11%, and operating income increased $16.6 million. These increases are primarily a result of increased inland barge utilization and improved spot market pricing. As expected, second quarter operating margins were somewhat impacted by increased maintenance and [ ops ] costs as we continue to ramp up our operations. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 76% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization improved into the low to mid-80% range compared to the mid-70% range in the 2021 first quarter. Inland barge volumes increased sequentially as the U.S. economy continued to improve as the COVID-19 pandemic lessened and Gulf Coast refinery and chemical plant activity recovered from the effects of Winter Storm Uri. Barge demand also benefited from the Colonial Pipeline outage in May. 
Overall, these factors contributed to a 70% increase in ton miles as compared to the first quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts or those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue with 57% from time charters and 43% from contracts of affreightment. The significant increase in barge activity in the second quarter contributed to average spot market rates improving approximately 10% sequentially. 
However, average spot rates remained down approximately 10% to 15% when compared to the 2020 second quarter. Only a few term contracts renewed during the second quarter and average rates were down in the mid to high single digits. It will take time as market conditions improve for term contracts to renew higher. And we will need to see spot prices remain above term contract prices to get term contract pricing going in the right direction. As term contracts renew higher, we will see improvements in operating margins. Overall, during the second quarter, the operating margin in the inland business was in the high single digits.
In coastal, our business continued to be challenged by weak demand for refined products and black oil. During the quarter, coastal barge utilization was in the low to mid-70% range primarily due to weak spot market dynamics in the West Coast and Hawaii, where economies have experienced a slower recovery from the pandemic. Despite reduced barge utilization, coastal revenues improved slightly, both sequentially and year-on-year due to increased fuel rebuilds. With respect to pricing, average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were stable. 
During the second quarter, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. Coastal's operating margin in the second quarter was in the negative mid-single digits. With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of the changes in the second quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2021 second quarter were $226.7 million with an operating income of $6.2 million and an operating margin of 2.7%. Compared to the 2020 second quarter, distribution and services revenue increased $66.5 million or 42% and operating income improved $20.3 million. Compared to the 2021 first quarter, revenues increased $30.8 million or 16% and operating income increased $3.3 million. These improvements are primarily due to a significant increase in demand for our oil and gas products and services as well as the improved economic condition across the U.S. which is raising demand for equipment, parts and service in the commercial and industrial markets. 
In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity across the U.S. resulted in improved sequential and year-on-year demand for equipment parts and services in our on-highway business. Revenues in our Thermo King business were also higher. In power generation, activity increased year-on-year due to higher sales and installations following the pandemic, but was down sequentially due to the timing of backup power installations in the northeast. Marine revenues were down sequentially and year-on-year due to reduced major overhauls. 
During the second quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 62% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the mid-single digits. In oil and gas, improving market dynamics and increased activity in the oilfield contributed to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating income. Our manufacturing businesses experienced substantial increases in deliveries of new pressure pumping and frac related power generation equipment as well as steady demand for seismic units for international markets. 
Our oil and gas distribution business also improved sequentially and year-on-year with increased demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. For the second quarter, the oil and gas related businesses represented approximately 38% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the low single digits.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $53 million of cash and total debt of $1.28 billion with a debt-to-cap of 29.1%. Since the Savage acquisition on April 1, 2020, we have reduced debt by $427 million. During the quarter, we generated strong cash from operations of $95 million, net of capital expenditure of $24 million, free cash flow was $71 million. At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $852 million. As of this week, our net debt was $1.2 billion, and total liquidity was $881 million.
 
For the full year, we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $250 million to $310 million for the full year. Lastly, from a tax perspective, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27% in the third and fourth quarters. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."

The last 15 months have been challenging with weak markets, poor operating conditions and declining financial performance.

The last 15 months have been challenging with weak markets, poor operating conditions and declining financial performance. As economies reopen in the second quarter, we experienced a welcome increase in overall demand and greatly improved market conditions. With the U.S. and international economies continuing to reopen and demand for refined products and oilfield equipment and services increasing, we see this positive momentum continuing into the second half of the year. As a result, we expect to see improvement in revenues and earnings for both of Kirby segments. 
While we are very encouraged about the recovery, we are, however, cautiously watching the rising number of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S. and around the world just now. There is a risk that these spikes, which are already resulting in new lockdowns in some locations, could adversely impact the recovery, refinery utilization and refined products demand. Although we expect this could slow the pace of the recovery, we do believe that momentum will continue to build. 
Additionally, as many of you know, labor constraints across the industrial supply chain are creating delays in manufacturing lead times and other supply chains. It is possible that we could see some anticipated product sales or deliveries of our manufactured equipment delayed in the second half of the year. In the inland market, our outlook remains positive. As of today, our barge utilization is in the mid-80% range driven by strong activity levels in the refining and petrochemical complex. 
Barring a significant step change in COVID, we expect barge activity should continue to increase during the last 2 quarters of this year as a result of improving demand, including increased refinery activity, higher refined products consumption and new petrochemical plants coming online. With minimal construction of new barges and barge retirement still occurring, we believe our barge utilization will increase into the high 80% to 90% range as the year progresses. This should support further improvement in spot market pricing during the second half of the year. 
Overall, in the third quarter, we expect revenues will sequentially improve with increasing demand and spot market pricing. Although we have some modest labor inflation starting in the third quarter, we expect operating margins to increase. As a result, we expect inland operating margins will be in the low double digits, 10-ish, if you will, during the third quarter. We expect further improvement in revenue and margins for the fourth quarter, but results could be tampered by the normal seasonal weather disruptions. 
In coastal, we expect the market will recover slower with some improvement in barge demand during the remainder of the year. In recent weeks, spot activity has modestly improved with higher economic activity and increased demand for refined products. As a result, our barge utilization has increased slightly, particularly on the West Coast where overall demand levels have been slower to recover from the pandemic.
 
Overall, we expect coastal barge utilization will be in the mid-70% range in the coming months, which should yield third and fourth quarter revenues slightly higher than the second quarter. We expect coastal operating margins will improve in the second half of the year, but still remain below breakeven in the negative low to mid-single-digit range.
Looking at distribution and services. We expect that economic growth, improvements in the oilfield and summer seasonality will result in sequential revenue growth with improved operating margins. In commercial and industrial, we anticipate continued improvement in on-highway with further recovery in bus repair activity and increased parts revenue from our new online sales platform. We also expect increased Thermo King product sales and service during the peak summer demand season. In power generation, we expect increased backup power equipment sales and installations. And in our rental fleet, we should see some seasonal increases in utilization during the hurricane season. 
In marine repair, we expect a sequential reduction in revenues primarily due to the harvest season in the dry cargo markets. In oil and gas, we believe current oil prices will contribute to continued increases in the rig count with incremental well completions activity as 2021 progresses. As a result, we expect to see higher demand for new engines and transmissions, parts and services in the distribution segment for the remainder of 2021. 
In manufacturing, a focus on sustainability and efforts of oilfield companies to reduce their carbon footprints continues to generate increased inquiries and new orders for Kirby's portfolio of environmentally friendly equipment, including electric and dual fuel pressure pumping units and highly efficient natural gas power generation equipment for eFrac. 
We also are experiencing increased orders to remanufacture existing pressure pumping equipment. As a result, we anticipate increased deliveries of manufactured and remanufactured products in the back half of 2021. However, as mentioned previously, supply chain delays could result in some equipment delivery shifting between quarters and potentially into 2022. 
Overall, for the full year, our expectations have not materially changed for D&S. We anticipate significant year-on-year revenue growth of 15% to 25% with commercial and industrial representing approximately 65% of revenues and oil and gas representing the balance of 35%. We expect D&S operating margins will be in the low to mid-single digits for the full year with the third quarter being the highest. In the fourth quarter, normal seasonality will likely result in some sequential reduction in operating margins. 
Before we wrap up, I want to briefly comment on 2 other matters. First, today, we announced that Bill Harvey will be retiring as Kirby's CFO early next year. Bill has been an integral part of the Kirby team for the last 4 years and has helped to guide us through several large inland marine acquisitions and the integration of Stewart & Stevenson. Bill's contributions to Kirby's success and our financial strength have been significant, and he will certainly be missed. Additionally, earlier this week, released -- we released our new 2021 Sustainability Report. This report represents another milestone in our ESG journey with new envisions disclosures for the full company as well as enhanced disclosures on safety, employee training and governance. You can access our new report in the Sustainability section on our website. 
Now to wrap things up, although there is some uncertainty around COVID-19 and its impact on the recovery, we remain very optimistic about Kirby's outlook. The second quarter was an important turning point for the company from a financial perspective with increased earnings in both segments. Most importantly, for the first time in over a year, we experienced a positive inland market that benefited from rising demand, favorable operating conditions and a major disruption. While the Colonial pipeline outage provided a temporary boost to the business, it highlighted that the inland market is well along on its path to recovery and how rapidly barge utilization can tighten and how quickly spot prices can move. 
The world economy is still in disarray. With much of Europe still essentially shut down and India, Mexico and South America not fully open -- as the world economy fully recovers from the pandemic and demand for liquid normalizes around the world, we are confident our inland businesses will regain prepandemic utilization levels in the 90% range, bringing with it improved pricing, earnings and returns. In coastal, although market conditions remain challenging, continued retirements of industry capacity and a lack of any new construction will keep capacity in check and allow for a solid rebound once the U.S. economy fully recovers. 
And finally, in distribution and services, we have come a long way in the last year, with steady improvements in financial performance. Our distribution businesses have not yet fully recovered, and there is room for further improvement as we go forward. With more favorable oilfield fundamentals and increased demand for lower carbon solutions, our new and highly efficient, environmentally friendly pressure pumping and power generation equipment is capturing the attention of our customers and translating into new orders that will provide additional growth in the second half of the year and into 2022. 
Overall, we have made substantial progress during the last year in very difficult markets. We realigned our cost structure, expanded our product offering in D&S and improved our financial flexibility. Our marine markets have stabilized and are beginning to improve. All of this has set the stage for improved earnings and returns and will allow us to take advantage of future growth opportunities. 
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

Yes, Jack, look, the inland trends continue to improve. We -- in the first quarter, we were down in the mid-70s in terms of utility. We got to low 80s at the beginning of the second quarter kind of ramped up into the mid-80s and then the Colonial Pi",563,"Sure. Yes, Jack, look, the inland trends continue to improve. We -- in the first quarter, we were down in the mid-70s in terms of utility. We got to low 80s at the beginning of the second quarter kind of ramped up into the mid-80s and then the Colonial Pipeline outage had a little spike, got us up to high 80s to essentially 90% and -- little less than 90%. But then it started to taper off as Colonial came back in and better weather started to help transit time. 
So we did end the quarter kind of in the mid-80s. But the important thing is spot pricing and contract pricing improved a bit. Contract pricing was still down year-over-year. You go all the way back to the second quarter in 2020. So we kind of lapped that quarter. Those were higher prices back then. So contract pricing was down kind of mid to high single digits, but spot pricing was up in the double-digit range, around 10%. 
And that, to your question, put spot pricing above contracts now. And that's what we need. We need that to stay above contracts. We need the customers to believe it's going to stay that way for a while. And then that contract portfolio start to renew higher. That may take another quarter or 2 before we kind of lap contract prices and they start renewing higher. But look, margins improved. We kind of went from low to mid-single digits in inland in the first quarter to kind of high single digits. We'll be in double digits next quarter in the third quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be hard to say because weather can impact us a bit. But all the trends are in the right direction. 
I mean when you think about customers and what's going on in the world right now, crude demand seems to be back. It's within kind of the 5-year historical trends. Crude storage is now just -- well, it's actually below the 5-year average now. TSA checkpoint data shows throughput has improved about 20% in the last quarter or so. Gulf Coast refineries are back in the 90% range. Chemical activity barometers are up. Retail sales are up. Leading indicators are up. New manufacturing orders are up. So the economy feels like it's coming back. I think we're all a little nervous about COVID right now. We're seeing some cases within Kirby pop up again and hearing about some spotty lockdowns. So in the past, I think last quarter, I used 40. It's hard to be -- to use that word when you're looking at COVID reemerging here. 
But all of that economic data shows that things are continuing to move and open up. I think when we talked to our customers, what they're telling us is that the international and export volumes are still not there. They're probably 15% lower than they were pre-COVID. And when you think about that kind of make sense. You've got Mexico, Latin America, South America essentially in various stages of shutdown. Europe still really hasn't opened up. India is kind of reacting and essentially locked down. So a lot of those export volumes are down. So domestically, things are improving, but the global economies are not quite back and that's what we're hearing from our customers. All that said, it's pretty positive."

So I guess for my follow-up question, David, as we think out over the next couple of years, I would be curious to get your thoughts on how you would expect industry capacity to trend? What's your expectation around net retirements for 2021? And given the rise in commodity prices and steel prices, where do you think rates would need to go to or maybe if you want to think about magnitude of an increase from where we are right now, just to support building for replacement much less thinking about building for expansion on the inland side?"

About half of them have been delivered.",303,"Sure. Yes, thanks for that question, Jack. We're -- look, we're -- we think the order book is about 70 -- between 70, 75 barges, maybe I don't think the actual count that we have is 72 barges for delivery this year. About half of them have been delivered. The first half were really all ordered prepandemic, and they just started delivering. But new barge pricing is at an all-time high. If you look kind of price changes from 2020 to 2021, a Clean 30, the price for a Clean 30 is now almost 40% higher than it was last year. Steel prices are driving a big part of that. Clean 30 now is probably $3.8 million. In 2018, just to reference that, it was about $2.5 million; 2017, it was around $2 million to build a Clean 30. So steel prices have driven that up labor to a lesser extent. 
But look, nobody is building a lot of barges right now and retirements are up. Scrap steel prices are up, so retirements are a little more palatable. So it's pretty constructive right now. We don't see really a net add in terms of new barges. And in fact, what we saw with Colonial makes us feel pretty good about kind of the unutilized overhang for us to -- in the space of 2 weeks to see the industry kind of go to sold out in Clean 30 market, it shows you how little overhang there really is. And I think a lot of that's because of the retirements that have occurred and there's not a lot of new equipment coming in. And to be fair, a number of our competitors, including us, still have some equipment on the bank. So from a supply and demand standpoint, it feels pretty good right now."

Again, I think Atlantic Coast is better utilized than, say, the West Coast. But there's no new construction that we're aware of. No new barges are being built. In the coastal market, there is -- it takes a long time. It could take up to 2 years or longer to get a new coastal tug and barge unit. Now that said, the Bushard assets are out there. You may have seen that they were sold out of the bankruptcy court. Somebody's going to have to sink a lot of money back in to get some of that equipment moving. So that's a slight overhang in the market. 
But as you heard in our prepared remarks, coastal pricing kind of held flat, but its utility is less than on the inland side. Look, as you know, the coastal market is more about refined products than it is chemicals, whereas the inland market is a little more chemical heavy. So again, we need to see the refined market just continue to expand, and I think that will soak up capacity with the caveat the Bushard equipment may come back over a period of time. I think it takes several years for that equipment to come back in any meaningful manner. Just knowing how much maintenance will need to be done on that equipment."

I would say that all of our pressure pumping customers are very focused on ESG right now, which generally means more eFrac.

We're talking for 2 barge to kind of north of 8,500 a day to get double-digit IRR. So the short answer is, yes. With the cost of price of new equipment and of course, with some labor inflation on top of that, and by the way, we are seeing food inflation. When we do crew transport, whether it's renting cars or flying, we're seeing those costs come up, hotel costs are coming up as we have to put crew members in hotels before they crew on. So we are seeing some inflation. And all things being equal, that labor and cost inflation and the cost of the equipment inflation should drive higher -- the need for higher, as you stated, mid-cycle pricing. 
The other thing is, we haven't talked much about this, but as you get into ESG and look at the engine packages on towboats and tugboats, you've got to start moving to Tier 4 engine packages, which are much more expensive and frankly more expensive to operate.

That said, maintenance and maintenance capital -- look, the economics are still good. If you've got these fleets, traditional diesel-driven fleets, it still makes sense to remanufacture them. We're just not seeing a lot of it, to be honest. Essentially, most of the new orders or orders in period have been ESG related. As we get tighter, that dynamic will, in my opinion, change, and we'll see more remanufacturing. 
Will this be kind of blowing and going like we saw in 2011? I don't think so, Greg. I think it feels, rightly or wrongly, a lot more capital discipline. I think many of the private companies, in particular, there's not as much capital available. So -- and if there is capital, the lenders kind of want to see an ESG flip forward. So all that said, I still think reman makes sense, and we'll see more reman than less as we go forward. It's just been pretty thin now. We're starting to see more of it, but it's still kind of early days in that area, in my opinion."

I would just tell you on refinery utilization, be a little careful in that, in the last 1.5 years, about 5% of the refining capacity was either shut down or idled. So yes, we're back up above 90%, but that's on a lower base. It was about 1 million barrels roughly, plus or minus a little bit 1 million barrels of refining capacity that's been shut down and idle. Now we've seen some good signs recently, the [ health issue ] refinery came back online, and so that's coming back. But as you think of refinery utilization, you've got to factor in that about 5% of the total complex was shut down and we need some of that to be restarted. 
Now the other interesting thing is rather than restarting that, we're seeing more biodiesel and renewable diesel, which particularly if you take soybean oil and make it into diesel, that's -- those are going to be barge moves kind of most likely coming out of the Midwest as they make renewable diesel. So we're watching all that. Does that help the coastal market, the renewable diesel? Maybe, we've actually had a coastal unit go and move some renewable diesel. So we're watching it. But again, we're still at lower levels. And I think we need some of the export market to come back and some of those refineries that have been idle to come back to really make a dent in the coastal utilization."

Well, I'll tell a little bit more on eFrac before I go into the commercial and industrial power generation. In eFrac, Stewart & Stevenson started making its first generation eFrac back in 2013, which was all around the gas turbine driving electric drive. And the newer kind of generation that everybody is excited about is using natural gas, power generation, engine packages from CAT or MTU to basically develop electric power with, say, 10 natural gas power generation engines on a micro grid on a well pad. And there is an element of having backup energy storage there so that you can run all the natural gas generation equipment at its peak efficiency and take them on and offline correctly. 
When you start to look at the commercial market, it's more one-off rather than big microgrid that generates huge numbers of megawatts. What we've seen is a lot more standby backup power. We have a power generation rental fleet that, frankly, we get a lot of business from our hurricane backup. During hurricanes, the likes of the big box stores will put us on standby in case there's an outage. I think as you've seen with the Texas storm, which took out a good part of the grid and some of the challenges in California with the electric grid, and then as you think of EVs taking more of the electric grid, I think, businesses, in general, are looking more and more at backup power. And we're really trying to capture parts of that market with our OEMs that we represent, the engine manufacturers. And that's how we are. 
We're a distributor, as you know, Bill, for a number of people. And essentially, we're using that relationship to go to market for backup power. We have a pretty good presence up in the Northeast, and we've been working to get into backup power for big financial institutions to a lesser extent in Florida for some of the kind of health care, nursing home, hospital type backup power. It will be interesting to see if the grid gets more and more utilized and electricity becomes more and more important as electrification occurs across both the passenger car market and other market, what the demands for backup power will be. We're trying to position it. I would tell you that we're -- going to market in the future will be to take that backup power and couple it with our energy storage system, i.e., our battery system. So that there's situation where you can charge the battery and you'll always have backup power and not need as much in terms of diesel to drive backup power. Maybe there's a couple -- coupling with solar on certain rooftops of commercial buildings. 
So that's all kind of new areas that we're working on. There's nothing to put in the model yet for that market. But that's what we're looking at and what we're pursuing from an ESG standpoint, Bill."

Earlier today, we announced adjusted earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 third quarter, which excludes a onetime noncash charge totaling $4.58 per share related to our coastal marine business. On a GAAP b",1051,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. 
Earlier today, we announced adjusted earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 third quarter, which excludes a onetime noncash charge totaling $4.58 per share related to our coastal marine business. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $4.41 per share. 
Overall, our quarter was messy, with the onetime charge in coastal; a devastating hurricane, which significantly impacted our inland marine business; and increased issues related to COVID-19. We'll talk more about each of these, including the onetime charge in a few moments. But first, I'll discuss our key markets. 
In Marine Transportation, our inland business started the quarter with improving customer demand. In August, however, barge volumes declined as the cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant increased, which slowed the pace of the economic recovery and reduced demand for refined products and crude. 
Vehicle miles traveled in the U.S. declined, including an overall 4.4% decline in August, with all regions of the U.S. impacted. 
In our operations, we experienced a meaningful rise in positive cases among our mariners. As a result, we incurred increased costs to charter additional horsepower during the quarter to ensure our operations were seamless. 
Our inland business was also materially impacted by Hurricane Ida, a significant category 4 storm, which made land fall near New Orleans in late August. This storm left a widespread path of destruction, which led to prolonged shutdowns of many customer plant as well as significant damage to marine equipment and waterway infrastructure. 
As this storm approached, all refineries and chemical plants in the New Orleans Baton Rouge corridor were forced into shutdowns. The storm damage was so significant that many remain closed or operating at reduced production levels through September and, in some cases, well into October. 
At the height of the storm, more than 2 million barrels of refinery capacity per day was offline, reducing PADD 3 refinery utilization from 93% in August to 79% in September. 
In the petrochemical sector, with nearly the entire complex shut down operating rates at nameplate ethylene plants in the Southeast -- excuse me, in Southeast Louisiana declined from 89% in August to 24% in September, and production fell as much as 75% compared to August. 
From a marine transportation perspective, the storm surge was so significant, the Mississippi River flow backwards, causing many industry barges to break free and resulting in damage to numerous vessels, customer docks and waterway infrastructure. 
It's been estimated that as many as 2,000 dry cargo and tank barges were damaged during the storm, which included 30 Kirby tank barges. 
All of this resulted in a full closure of the Mississippi River for about a week and a lengthy closure of parts of the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway, which remains in effect today. This closure has resulted in lengthy alternative routes and significant lock delays throughout September and October. 
Overall, we estimate the damage caused by the hurricane on our equipment directly contributed to lost revenue and additional costs totaling approximately $0.08 per share during the third quarter. 
Moving to coastal. The market remained challenging during the third quarter, but we did experience some increases in spot market demand, which contributed to modest increases in barge utilization and reduced operating losses. More importantly, we took significant actions to improve our coastal business, including the sale of our marine transportation assets in Hawaii and the retirement of 12 laid-up wire tank barges and 4 tug boats in the coastal fleet. 
These actions resulted in a onetime noncash impairment charge in the third quarter. However, there are significant positives, and it positions the coastal business for success going forward. 
First, our risk profile is greatly reduced by exiting Hawaii, which is a remote market that has generated poor returns for many years. The retirement of our outdated and laid-up coastal wire barges and tugboats improves our cost structure and materially reduces future capital outlays. 
Frankly, many of our customers view the old wire tow technology as less safe and less reliable when compared to newer ATBs. Overall, going forward, we expect our smaller fleet will allow us to focus on attractive markets and more efficient, safe and cost competitive equipment will ultimately generate improved earnings and favorable returns. 
In distribution and services, momentum continued to build with improved activity levels contributing to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating margins. 
In commercial and industrial, the timing of major backup power installations and seasonal utilization improvements in the rental fleet led to strong sequential activity in power generation. 
Increased demand for Thermo King product sales and service also contributed favorably to the quarter's results. These gains were partially offset by modest activity reductions in marine repair primarily due to major -- excuse me, due to reduced major overhauls and temporary facility closures following Hurricane Ida. 
In oil and gas, increasing U.S. rig counts and completions activity drove strong incremental demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. This growth contributed 25% sequential growth in oil and gas revenues and positive operating margins for the first time in more than 2 years. 
In manufacturing, although supply chain constraints delayed the deliveries of several orders and led to a sequential reduction in revenues, our backlog grew meaningfully with significant new demand for our environmentally friendly pressure pumping and electric power generation equipment. 
In October, Kirby acquired a small energy storage systems manufacturer based in Texas, which has been a key partner in the development of our new power generation solutions for electric fracturing equipment. This acquisition will be important to the development of future energy storage solutions for the oilfield as well as industrial and marine transportation applications. 
In summary, our third quarter results reflected a challenging environment as well as key operating decisions in coastal marine. The good news is that we have seen a significant improvement in inland market fundamentals in recent weeks, with increasing customer demand and higher barge utilization in the high 80% range. 
Distribution and services also continues to improve with the economy. In a few moments, I'll talk more about these developments as well as the rest of our outlook. But first, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss more about the onetime charge as well as our segment results and balance sheet."

Before I review our segment results, I want to provide a little more detail on the onetime charge in coastal marine. During the third quarter, we sold our coastal marine transportation assets in Hawaii, including 4 tank barges and 7 tugboats for cash proceeds of $17.2 million. 
We also retired 12 wire tank barges and 4 tugboats, which had limited customer acceptance and low utilization. These events resulted in a noncash impairment charge of $121.7 million. As a result, the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred and performed interim quantitative impairment test on coastal goodwill, which resulted in a noncash impairment charge totaling $219 million. 
In total, the company recorded a noncash impairment related to coastal marine equipment and associated goodwill totaling $340.7 million before tax, $275 million after tax or $4.58 per share. 
Looking at our operating segments. In the third quarter, marine transportation revenues were $338.5 million with an operating income of $16.9 million and an operating margin of 5%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues increased $17.9 million or 6%, primarily due to higher fuel rebuilds in inland and coastal as the average cost of diesel fuel had increased 76%. 
Improved barge utilization in inland is offset by lower pricing on term contracts that had renewed during the last year. 
Operating income declined $15.5 million primarily due to Hurricane Ida, lower term contract pricing and increased maintenance. 
Compared to the 2021 second quarter, marine revenues increased $5.6 billion or 2% due to modest improvements in coastal barge utilization and increased fuel rebuilds. Operating income declined $1.6 million as a result of sales mix, increased horsepower costs and the impact of Hurricane Ida. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 76% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization was in the low 80% range, which was slightly down compared to the second quarter, but improved compared to the low 70% range in the 2020 third quarter. 
Barge utilization during the quarter was heavily impacted by reduced volumes as a result of COVID-19 Delta variant and customer shutdowns following Hurricane Ida. 
Long-term inland marine transportation contracts or those contracts with a term of one year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue, with 56% from time charters and 44% from contracts of affreightment. 
With respect to pricing, average spot market rates were stable compared to the second quarter and the 2020 third quarter. Of the few term contracts that renewed during the third quarter, average rates were down in the low to mid-single digits. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, inland revenues were up 3% due to significant increases in fuel rebuilds and improved barge utilization, offset by lower average pricing on term contracts. 
Compared to the second quarter, inland revenues were stable. Overall, the inland market represented 76% of segment revenues and had an operating margin in the mid- to high single digits. 
In coastal, spot market conditions improved modestly, resulting in barge utilization in the mid-70% range during the quarter. Average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were stable. 
During the third quarter, the percentage of coastal revenues under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. 
Revenues in coastal increased 4% sequentially and 13% compared to the 2020 third quarter, primarily due to higher fuel rebuilds and modest increases in spot market activity. 
Overall, coastal represented 24% of Marine Transportation segment revenues and at a negative operating margin in the low single digits. 
With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of changes in the third quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to distribution and services. Revenues for the 2021 third quarter were $260.4 million, with an operating income of $11 million and an operating margin of 4.2%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, distribution and services revenue increased $84.4 million or 48%, and operating income improved $9.9 million. 
Compared to the 2021 second quarter, revenues increased $33.7 million or 15%, and operating income increased $4.9 million. These improvements are primarily due to a significant increase in demand for our oil and gas products and services as well as the improved economic conditions across the U.S., which has raised demand for equipment, parts and service in the commercial and industrial markets. 
In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity contributed to the increased sequential and year-on-year demand for equipment, parts and service in on-highway, Thermo King and power generation. The power generation rental fleet also benefit from increased utilization during the summer storm season, including Hurricane Ida. 
Marine repair revenues were down sequentially and year-on-year due to reduced major overhauls as well as activity reductions at our Louisiana facilities following Hurricane Ida. 
During the third quarter, commercial and industrial revenues increased 9% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Overall, the business represented approximately 59% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the mid-single digits. 
In oil and gas, favorable commodity prices and increased activity in the oil field contributed to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating income. The most significant increase was in our distribution business, with better demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. 
Our manufacturing businesses also experienced substantial increases in new orders for pressure pumping and frac-related power generation equipment. While manufacturing revenues increased sharply year-on-year, the business was negatively impacted by the timing of deliveries and OEM supply chain issues. 
During the third quarter, oil and gas revenues increased 25% sequentially and 120% year-on-year. Overall, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 41% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the low to mid-single digits. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, we had $54 million of cash and total debt of $1.21 billion, with a debt-to-cap ratio of 29.8%. Since the Savvis acquisition of April 1, 2020, we have repaid nearly $500 million in debt. 
During the quarter, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $83 million, net of capital expenditures of $34 million. Free cash flow was $49 million. We also sold assets with net proceeds of $22 million during the quarter, primarily composed of coastal marine assets in Hawaii. 
At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $908 million. As of this week, our net debt has been further reduced to $1.2 billion. 
For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, which represents more than a 15% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. 
We also expect to generate free cash flow of $250 million to $290 million for the full year. 
Lastly, from a tax perspective, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."

Although the third quarter certainly had its challenges, we are very encouraged by the improving market fundamentals across our businesses, which are setting the stage for materially improved earnings in the coming year. In the near t",933,"Thank you, Bill. 
Although the third quarter certainly had its challenges, we are very encouraged by the improving market fundamentals across our businesses, which are setting the stage for materially improved earnings in the coming year. 
In the near term, for the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential improvement in overall revenues and earnings driven by increased volumes and more favorable market conditions in marine transportation, offset in part by nominal and normal and continued supply chain issues in distribution and services. 
In the inland market, although some issues associated with Hurricane Ida have carried over, including extended customer shutdowns, barge repairs and waterway closures, our outlook remains very positive. 
During October, our barge utilization has been in the mid-80% to high 80% range, with recent utilization at the high end of that and in the high 80s. Some of this increase can be attributed to waterway closures in Louisiana, which have extended transit times. However, turnarounds and pent-up demand are also driving up barge volumes. 
While the waterways are expected to fully reopen soon, we expect barge utilization levels will be minimally impacted due to the ramping up of Hurricane Ida affected plants, economic improvements, new chemical plants coming online and the onset of winter weather. 
With increased inland activity levels, minimum new barge construction and continued retirements, we expect further improvements in the spot market going forward. 
During the fourth quarter and into next year, term contracts that renewed lower during the pandemic are expected to reset and gradually reset to reflect the improved market conditions. 
Overall, inland revenues are expected to sequentially increase in the fourth quarter, with operating margins improving to around 10%. 
In coastal, we expect the market will continue to recover, with modest demand improvement for refined products and black oil transportation. The recent retirement of the wire barge marine equipment will result in coastal barge utilization being around 90% for the fourth quarter. 
Although the Hawaii equipment has been sold, we will continue to operate the assets under a charter agreement through the end of the year when our existing customer contracts expire. 
In the fourth quarter, we do anticipate some elevated shipyard activity on several of our larger capacity barges, and that will result in a coastal revenue reduction in the mid-single digits compared to the third quarter. 
Coastal operating margins are expected to be at or slightly below breakeven for the fourth -- in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at distribution and services, favorable commodity prices and increasing rig counts as well as well completions are expected to yield continued strong demand in our oil and gas distribution business. 
In manufacturing, activity levels are also expected to remain strong driven by new orders and our growing backlog of environmentally friendly pressure pumping equipment and frac-related power generation equipment as well as some modest remanufacturing of conventional equipment. 
However, the OEM supply chain issues are expected to persist throughout the fourth quarter, and they will delay sales -- some sales and project deliveries into 2022. As a result, we expect our oil and gas businesses will experience a modest sequential reduction in revenues and operating income in the quarter. 
In Commercial and Industrial, despite improving economic activity, there will be normal seasonality in marine repair, Thermo King and power generation, resulting in sequential reductions in revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter. Overall, compared to the 2021 third quarter distribution and services revenues are expected to decline modestly, with operating margins in the low to mid-single digits. 
Now to wrap things up, although the third quarter's results were disappointing, we see improved results in the fourth quarter, despite planned shipyards and coastal and seasonality and supply chain issues in distribution and services. 
More importantly, we see strong momentum building across our businesses, which we will believe -- which we believe will drive increased revenues and meaningful earnings growth in the coming years. 
In inland, our barge utilization has recently touched 90%, with October averaging in the mid- to high 80% range. 
With the world economy beginning to emerge from the pandemic, low inventories of refined products and oil demand expected to meet or exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2022, we believe inland has turned the corner. 
With minimal new barge supply, we expect our inland business will steadily move higher with improved pricing, earnings and returns going forward. 
In coastal, although market conditions remain challenging, recent improvements in the spot market should lead to barge utilization around 90%, are difficult but necessary decisions to exit the Hawaii market and retire unutilized assets are long-term positives that will allow this business to focus on its best assets and markets to generate positive earnings as the market improved. 
In distribution and services, economic growth will benefit our commercial and industrial businesses in the coming quarters. In oil and gas, with strong commodity prices and expectations for increased U.S. gas-directed drilling, we are increasingly optimistic about enhanced demand for our products and services. 
Further, a heightened customer focus on low carbon solutions, including friendly -- environmentally friendly pressure pumping equipment and our power generation solutions for e-frac, has translated into significant growth in our backlog. 
These increasing levels of activity will lead to improved profitability in 2022. 
And finally, our strict capital discipline and intense focus on cash flow generation throughout the pandemic has enabled us to significantly reduce our debt and increase our liquidity. As a result, we are very well positioned to act on future strategic opportunities to increase our earnings potential going forward.

I'm curious sort of what the crossover is if those areas are starting to see significant inflation. Is there any ability for some of the excess chemical or petroleum products to sort of be priced out of the market or for you guys to capture share if those other 2 modes of transportation get more expensive?"

I would just tell you, in general, inflation is happening. We're seeing a little wage pressure. We gave some raises in July, but we've not had a problem filling positions. 
As you know, Ben, we started our school, which is kind of a Kirby advantage. We started training mariners in January and have continued throughout the year. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our labor supply, and we're pretty excited about that. 
We are seeing some inflation with supplies and food and whatnot. But so far, it's okay. 
The big news for us really is that demand is growing. We're starting to see it. I mean, you can see it in the consumer, right? The consumer is doing better. Gasoline demands back up above the 5-year average. Manufacturing orders are up. Our chemical customers are doing really well. 
You can look at their earnings announcements. Our refining and integrated customers are seeing inventories low one, but crack spread is really high. One of our independent refining customers that had shut down the refinery during COVID has restarted it. 
So from our perspective, demand is increasing. It's not really crossover demand. It's just real demand that we saw in our base business. And as you know, that demand with supply and check means that we're headed for a much better pricing environment. 
We're starting to see that now. We're getting price increases in the spot market. Spot prices are above contract prices in -- and things are moving along really well there."

But when you look at what's happening in the inland market and particularly tightness around horsepower, tightness around supply is growing, we're very optimistic. And we think we'll renew contracts. Higher spot pricing is well above contract pricing, and we're about to reprice some of these -- the COVID low contracts. 
So I can't be too specific because it's a negotiation with numerous customers. As you know, fourth quarter is usually one of the heavier quarters. I would say it's kind of twice any other quarter. The first, second and third are kind of all around the same, maybe a little more in the first than the second and the third. But the fourth is always the heaviest. 
So we're pretty optimistic. We're heading in. Demand is tight. Pricing is going up. Labor and mariners are in short supply. Horsepower is in short supply. It is set up to go up. It needs to, it has to and it will."

There's -- some of the big chemical customers, you know them, they're saying they're running full out. And some of the refiners are saying the exact same thing. The independent refiners are saying they're going to run out -- run hard. 
Also we're seeing a little heavier feedstock mix, which is pretty positive for barging. The heavier feedstock mix, the more byproducts. And those byproducts generally lead to a little more barge movements. I mean, some of them are heavier products and not as readily moved in pipeline. 
So it's shaping up nicely. It's always good when your customers start making more money, right? Whether it's the chemical guys or the refiners or the integrated, they're all doing better, and that's good. 
And they're doing better because demand is picking up. And I think we're all tired of talking about COVID, but its demand impact has been real. And hopefully, we're turning the corner. We had the Delta variant. Hopefully, there's not another variant coming. 
But everything looks pretty good from our perspective just looking at refinery utilization and chemical plant utilization, ethylene production, aromatics production, C4 co-product production, they're all kind of increasing.

And we're seeing that. I think there's Dan Lippe and others that publish on that. But the heavier feedstocks are going into the chemical plants. And again, that's good for us. The more naphtha they crack, the more heavies that you'll see. You could see C4s and butadiene coming out. Butadiene is a nice one because it's a pressure cargo, and Kirby's got a pretty good position in pressure products.

The good news is, as we talked about, demand is increasing, right? If you think about the coastal business, it's pretty heavy in terms of refined products. And as you heard in some of my previous comments, the refinery utilization is up, product inventories are low, crack spreads are stronger, volumes are picking up. 
They just need to pick up a little more. There's still too much supply in the offshore business, but we're getting closer to the turn there. I think that turn is further out than the inland turn just because of how overbuilt that market got after. 
As you recall, Jack, a few years back, there were probably 1/3 of the fleet was moving crude by barge. And I would say, it's a lot less than that. There's only a handful of the coastal barges moving crude oil now. 
So all that excess capacity has to be soaked up by refined products demand, and that's happening. It's just happening a little slower. So -- but it's heading in the right direction. 
We're doing our part. We're taking out these older wire equipment pieces, and I also think that ballast water treatment may drive some others out to retire. We're pretty far along on our fleet with ballast water treatment. I think a few other of our competitors are behind the curve on ballast water treatment. 
So as they start to spend that capital, perhaps we'll see some retirement. It's a long-winded answer to say that supply and demand is still a little out of balance, but it's heading the right direction. And we took the actions we felt that were necessary. And I think we'll be breakeven-ish next year based on what we see now."

I think the encouraging thing though, Ken, is our backlog has jumped meaningfully. I mean, our book-to-bill is a huge percentage, and we're not talking tens of millions. It's more like hundreds. 
And backlog is really growing. A lot of it is ESG centric. I'll tell you, in oil and gas, in particular, kind of any new equipment is -- has got an element of carbon reduction for our customers and our customers' customers. And so that -- we're very excited about it. 
And you may have heard also that we bought a small company during the quarter that builds ESS, is energy storage systems or batteries, if you will. ESS sounds a little more sophisticated. But one of the things we do is we add that battery system to a frac spread, and it helps even the electric load on the generation equipment as they're ramping up and down on the pressure pump and actual pumping. 
That's -- so that's vertical integration, but the great thing about the ESS capabilities, we're able to extend those into other parts of our KDS business, the distribution business. You can imagine, in commercial and industrial, the need for electric power keeps growing, and having a strong ESS offering will help us and is helping us. 
And then you can even take it to marine. We're building basically an electric hybrid towboat right now. It can -- it will be able to run completely on electric power.

So it's not meaningful at all in terms of materiality, in terms of cash. 
As we look at our business, the serious cash deployment would be to continue to consolidate the inland marine business if we're doing anything. You may see us spend some meaningful CapEx on wind support-type vessels, depending on contracts and how that might go. 
But the big capital deployment will be in the marine side of the business. I think the offshore assets, that was more of a restructuring. As we look at it, our customers, they really have gravitated away from wire offshore barges to the favor of ATBs. And we just kind of took that and we need to restructure around that. 
But the meaningful capital deployment or acquisitions will likely be in the marine side. I would tell you on D&S, we're running with the electrification side, and that has been meaningful in the oil and gas side. As we've seen e-frac come up and power generation used in well servicing. 
I would tell you, the rest of that commercial and industrial is coming along, too. Almost every  business nowadays is looking at the grid reliability and what they need to do to protect themselves. 
So we're pretty excited about that. But as you know, that doesn't take a lot of capital, right? That doesn't require us to go buy companies or a lot of CapEx. It's really pretty low CapEx. This small acquisition really was a small piece of vertical integration because we're already selling the ESS with our e-fracs."

I'd say the only real lingering thing is the Intercoastal Waterway is still closed near New Orleans, but I think that's going to open up in the next week or so.

I think this market has been one of the worst ever in the history. 
We were coming out of the bottom pre-pandemic, and then the pandemic just kind of set a new low. Many of our competitors have been operating at cash breakeven or lower. We had some contracts way down there as well. 
You can look at our inland margins, right? They were kind of record lows. Now that's coming back. We were low mid-single digits. Now we're kind of -- I think we did about 7.5% in the inland side in the third quarter. We're thinking we'll do 10% margins in the fourth quarter. I would see, hopefully, we get into the mid-teens in '22 in inland. 
But when you start at really low margins and breakeven for many of our competitors, there could well be some opportunities. I would caveat this, and that is we've been very prudent through this pandemic. We've paid down a lot of debt. As you heard from Bill, I think since the Savage acquisition, we've paid down over $500 million in debt. 
We're still generating really strong cash flow. We'll continue to delever and be prudent as we look for acquisitions. But there could well be some. I would just tell you, we're going to be prudent. 
It's been a rough couple of years, and there's a lot of pain out there. But by the same token, we want to delever a little more. We've gotten our debt-to-total cap down below 30%. It's now -- I think it's 29%. I'm looking at Bill, 29%-ish. So we're going to delever a little more, but there could be some  prospects in the coming year or 2."

COVID, we didn't really talk much about it because I think we're all tired of talking about COVID, but that probably cost us $0.05 or $0.06. 
As COVID hit our marine crews, we had to divert toes. We had to take them off higher because we had to recrew. We had higher medical costs, et cetera. So -- and then we had a higher tax rate if you throw that into the third quarter, too. 
So it was a messy quarter. As I look forward, I would tell you that some of that -- those kind of headwinds are definitely going away. Ida has gone away.

The liquid tank barge market was impacted. And I think I used Kirby as an example. We probably had 30 barges. We only got a handful left to come out of repair. 
So we're almost through it. And I would -- I wouldn't think the rest of the industry is much different than we were in that. It was a meaningful impact, though.

I'm just curious, the increase in newbuild prices, is that kind of directly attributable to higher steel prices? Or are there other factors at play there? 
And I'm thinking specifically, is there any sort of hesitation from owners or underlying technology obsolescence risk embedded in there, kind of looking ahead, 5, 10, 20 years in the future? And maybe saying it another way, if steel prices were normalized, would we still be looking at a constructive supply picture here?"

I would tell you, so, look, new barge, whether it's clean or dirty or hot oil barge, the price is -- if you go back to 2017, 2018, prices are almost, gosh, I would say, almost double.

I would tell you, so, look, new barge, whether it's clean or dirty or hot oil barge, the price is -- if you go back to 2017, 2018, prices are almost, gosh, I would say, almost double. 
A big portion of that is steel. But look, everything that goes into, it has gone up in price, too, right? I mean, you can think about paint, you can think about welding and labor, yes, it just costs more now to build them. 
And that's why as we think about inflation, it's not necessarily a bad thing for Kirby. We've got this huge installed base of barges that are relatively young and well maintained. And yes, so the higher the cost of new barges, kind of the better for us is the way we look at it. 
But steel is no doubt the majority of that cost. And it's -- yes, steel is up. Where the price of barges went up 100%, steel's up 300% since pre-pandemic. So you could imagine it feels that. 
I would tell you that most owner-operators right now are not building new equipment. There has been some on order. It's been on order for a while. Deliveries are nominal. And I would say, retirements should outstrip the deliveries there. 
In terms of your technology obsolescence, there's not -- a barge is a barge. It's a big steel box, but they are more and more sophisticated. But there's not a lot of technology obsolescence. I would tell you that there is -- because of ESG, it's becoming more and more important is the pressure rating of a barge. 
A typical industry barge had a 3-pound pressure rating. Kirby has only built 6 pounds. So if you think about it, future emissions from a 6-pound barge are a lot less than they are in a 3-pound barge, and the market is starting to recognize that. By the market, I mean, our customers, they're worried about their fence line emissions, and the there's a premium coming and starting for 6-pound barges. 
Now is that an obsolescence thing? I'm not sure it's an obsolescence thing. It's just a fact, right, that everybody wants their emissions down. Those emissions are getting measured more and more and reported more and more. So we're seeing a premium kind of leak into the market -- driven into market by more desire for 6-pound barges versus 3 pounds. But that's not -- it's not technical obsolescence per se."

Earlier today, we announced adjusted earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 third quarter, which excludes a onetime noncash charge totaling $4.58 per share related to our coastal marine business. On a GAAP bas",1050,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced adjusted earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 third quarter, which excludes a onetime noncash charge totaling $4.58 per share related to our coastal marine business. 
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $4.41 per share. Overall, our quarter was messy, with the onetime charge in coastal, a devastating hurricane, which significantly impacted our inland marine business and increased issues related to COVID-19. We'll talk more about each of these, including the onetime charge in a few moments. But first, I'll discuss our key markets. 
In Marine Transportation, our inland business started the quarter with improving customer demand. In August, however, barge volumes declined as the cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant increased, which slowed the pace of the economic recovery and reduced demand for refined products and crude. Vehicle miles traveled in the U.S. declined, including an overall 4.4% decline in August, with all regions of the U.S. impacted. 
In our operations, we experienced a meaningful rise in positive cases among our mariners. As a result, we incurred increased costs to charter additional horsepower during the quarter to ensure our operations were seamless. Our inland business was also materially impacted by Hurricane Ida, a significant category 4 storm, which made land fall near New Orleans in late August. This storm left a widespread path of destruction, which led to prolonged shutdowns of many customer plant as well as significant damage to marine equipment and waterway infrastructure. 
As this storm approached, all refineries and chemical plants in the New Orleans, Baton Rouge corridor were forced into shutdowns. The storm damage was so significant that many remain closed or operating at reduced production levels through September and, in some cases, well into October. 
At the height of the storm, more than 2 million barrels of refinery capacity per day was offline, reducing PADD 3 refinery utilization from 93% in August to 79% in September. 
In the petrochemical sector, with nearly the entire complex shut down operating rates at nameplate ethylene plants in the Southeast -- excuse me, in Southeast Louisiana declined from 89% in August to 24% in September, and production fell as much as 75% compared to August. 
From a Marine Transportation perspective, the storm surge was so significant, the Mississippi River flow backwards, causing many industry barges to break free and resulting in damage to numerous vessels, customer docks and waterway infrastructure. 
It's been estimated that as many as 2,000 dry cargo and tank barges were damaged during the storm, which included 30 Kirby tank barges. All of this resulted in a full closure of the Mississippi River for about a week and a lengthy closure of parts of the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway, which remains in effect today. This closure has resulted in lengthy alternative routes and significant lock delays throughout September and October. 
Overall, we estimate the damage caused by the hurricane on our equipment directly contributed to lost revenue and additional costs totaling approximately $0.08 per share during the third quarter. 
Moving to coastal. The market remained challenging during the third quarter, but we did experience some increases in spot market demand, which contributed to modest increases in barge utilization and reduced operating losses. More importantly, we took significant actions to improve our coastal business, including the sale of our Marine Transportation assets in Hawaii and the retirement of 12 laid-up wire tank barges and 4 tugboats in the coastal fleet. 
These actions resulted in a onetime noncash impairment charge in the third quarter. However, there are significant positives, and it positions the coastal business for success going forward. 
First, our risk profile is greatly reduced by exiting Hawaii, which is a remote market that has generated poor returns for many years. The retirement of our outdated and laid-up coastal wire barges and tugboats improves our cost structure and materially reduces future capital outlays. 
Frankly, many of our customers view the old wire tow technology as less safe and less reliable when compared to newer ATBs. Overall, going forward, we expect our smaller fleet will allow us to focus on attractive markets and more efficient, safe and cost competitive equipment will ultimately generate improved earnings and favorable returns. 
In Distribution and Services, momentum continued to build with improved activity levels contributing to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating margins. 
In commercial and industrial, the timing of major backup power installations and seasonal utilization improvements in the rental fleet led to strong sequential activity in power generation. 
Increased demand for Thermo-King product sales and service also contributed favorably to the quarter's results. These gains were partially offset by modest activity reductions in marine repair primarily due to major -- excuse me, due to reduced major overhauls and temporary facility closures following Hurricane Ida. 
In oil and gas, increasing U.S. rig counts and completions activity drove strong incremental demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. This growth contributed to 25% sequential growth in oil and gas revenues and positive operating margins for the first time in more than 2 years. 
In manufacturing, although supply chain constraints delayed the deliveries of several orders and led to a sequential reduction in revenues, our backlog grew meaningfully with significant new demand for our environmentally friendly pressure pumping and electric power generation equipment. 
In October, Kirby acquired a small energy storage systems manufacturer based in Texas, which has been a key partner in the development of our new power generation solutions for electric fracturing equipment. This acquisition will be important to the development of future energy storage solutions for the oilfield as well as industrial and Marine Transportation applications. 
In summary, our third quarter results reflected a challenging environment as well as key operating decisions in coastal marine. The good news is that we have seen a significant improvement in inland market fundamentals in recent weeks, with increasing customer demand and higher barge utilization in the high 80% range. 
Distribution and Services also continues to improve with the economy. In a few moments, I'll talk more about these developments as well as the rest of our outlook. But first, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss more about the onetime charge as well as our segment results and balance sheet."

Before I review our segment results, I want to provide a little more detail on the onetime charge in coastal marine. During the third quarter, we sold our coastal Marine Transportation assets in Hawaii, including 4 tank barges and 7 tugboats for cash proceeds of $17.2 million. 
We also retired 12 wire tank barges and 4 tugboats, which had limited customer acceptance and low utilization. These events resulted in a noncash impairment charge of $121.7 million. As a result, the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred and performed interim quantitative impairment test on coastal goodwill, which resulted in a noncash impairment charge totaling $219 million. 
In total, the company recorded a noncash impairment related to coastal marine equipment and associated goodwill totaling $340.7 million before tax, $275 million after tax or $4.58 per share. Looking at our operating segments. In the third quarter, Marine Transportation revenues were $338.5 million with an operating income of $16.9 million and an operating margin of 5%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues increased $17.9 million or 6%, primarily due to higher fuel rebuilds in inland and coastal as the average cost of diesel fuel had increased 76%. 
Improved barge utilization in inland is offset by lower pricing on term contracts that had renewed during the last year. Operating income declined $15.5 million primarily due to Hurricane Ida, lower term contract pricing and increased maintenance. 
Compared to the 2021 second quarter, marine revenues increased $5.6 billion or 2% due to modest improvements in coastal barge utilization and increased fuel rebuilds. Operating income declined $1.6 million as a result of sales mix, increased horsepower costs and the impact of Hurricane Ida. 
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 76% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization was in the low 80% range, which was slightly down compared to the second quarter, but improved compared to the low 70% range in the 2020 third quarter. Barge utilization during the quarter was heavily impacted by reduced volumes as a result of COVID-19 Delta variant and customer shutdowns following Hurricane Ida. 
Long-term inland Marine Transportation contracts or those contracts with a term of one year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue, with 56% from time charters and 44% from contracts of affreightment. 
With respect to pricing, average spot market rates were stable compared to the second quarter and the 2020 third quarter. Of the few term contracts that renewed during the third quarter, average rates were down in the low to mid-single digits. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, inland revenues were up 3% due to significant increases in fuel rebuilds and improved barge utilization, offset by lower average pricing on term contracts. 
Compared to the second quarter, inland revenues were stable. Overall, the inland market represented 76% of segment revenues and had an operating margin in the mid- to high single digits. 
In coastal, spot market conditions improved modestly, resulting in barge utilization in the mid-70% range during the quarter. Average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were stable. During the third quarter, the percentage of coastal revenues under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters. 
Revenues in coastal increased 4% sequentially and 13% compared to the 2020 third quarter, primarily due to higher fuel rebuilds and modest increases in spot market activity. Overall, coastal represented 24% of Marine Transportation segment revenues and at a negative operating margin in the low single digits. 
With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of changes in the third quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website. 
Moving to Distribution and Services. Revenues for the 2021 third quarter were $260.4 million, with an operating income of $11 million and an operating margin of 4.2%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, Distribution and Services revenue increased $84.4 million or 48%, and operating income improved $9.9 million. 
Compared to the 2021 second quarter, revenues increased $33.7 million or 15%, and operating income increased $4.9 million. These improvements are primarily due to a significant increase in demand for our oil and gas products and services as well as the improved economic conditions across the U.S., which has raised demand for equipment, parts and service in the commercial and industrial markets. 
In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity contributed to the increased sequential and year-on-year demand for equipment, parts and service in on-highway, Thermo King and power generation. The power generation rental fleet also benefit from increased utilization during the summer storm season, including Hurricane Ida. 
Marine repair revenues were down sequentially and year-on-year due to reduced major overhauls as well as activity reductions at our Louisiana facilities following Hurricane Ida. 
During the third quarter, commercial and industrial revenues increased 9% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Overall, the business represented approximately 59% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the mid-single digits. 
In oil and gas, favorable commodity prices and increased activity in the oil field contributed to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating income. The most significant increase was in our distribution business, with better demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. 
Our manufacturing businesses also experienced substantial increases in new orders for pressure pumping and frac-related power generation equipment. While manufacturing revenues increased sharply year-on-year, the business was negatively impacted by the timing of deliveries and OEM supply chain issues. 
During the third quarter, oil and gas revenues increased 25% sequentially and 120% year-on-year. Overall, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 41% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the low to mid-single digits. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, we had $54 million of cash and total debt of $1.21 billion, with a debt-to-cap ratio of 29.8%. Since the Savage acquisition of April 1, 2020, we have repaid nearly $500 million in debt. 
During the quarter, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $83 million, net of capital expenditures of $34 million. Free cash flow was $49 million. We also sold assets with net proceeds of $22 million during the quarter, primarily composed of coastal marine assets in Hawaii. 
At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $908 million. As of this week, our net debt has been further reduced to $1.2 billion. 
For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, which represents more than a 15% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $250 million to $290 million for the full year. 
Lastly, from a tax perspective, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."
283986,1683524344,2416018,"Kirby Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bill. Although the third quarter certainly had its challenges, we are very encouraged by the improving market fundamentals across our businesses, which are setting the stage for materially improved earnings in the coming year. In the near ter",935,"Thank you, Bill. Although the third quarter certainly had its challenges, we are very encouraged by the improving market fundamentals across our businesses, which are setting the stage for materially improved earnings in the coming year. 
In the near term, for the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential improvement in overall revenues and earnings driven by increased volumes and more favorable market conditions in Marine Transportation, offset in part by nominal and normal [Audio Gap] and continued supply chain issues in Distribution and Services. 
In the inland market, although some issues associated with Hurricane Ida have carried over, including extended customer shutdowns, barge repairs and waterway closures, our outlook remains very positive. During October, our barge utilization has been in the mid-80% to high 80% range, with recent utilization at the high end of that and in the high 80s. Some of this increase can be attributed to waterway closures in Louisiana, which have extended transit times. However, turnarounds and pent-up demand are also driving up barge volumes. 
While the waterways are expected to fully reopen soon, we expect barge utilization levels will be minimally impacted due to the ramping up of Hurricane Ida affected plants, economic improvements, new chemical plants coming online and the onset of winter weather. 
With increased inland activity levels, minimum new barge construction and continued retirements, we expect further improvements in the spot market going forward. 
During the fourth quarter and into next year, term contracts that renewed lower during the pandemic are expected to reset and gradually reset to reflect the improved market conditions. Overall, inland revenues are expected to sequentially increase in the fourth quarter, with operating margins improving to around 10%. 
In coastal, we expect the market will continue to recover, with modest demand improvement for refined products and black oil transportation. The recent retirement of the wire barge marine equipment will result in coastal barge utilization being around 90% for the fourth quarter. 
Although the Hawaii equipment has been sold, we will continue to operate the assets under a charter agreement through the end of the year when our existing customer contracts expire. 
In the fourth quarter, we do anticipate some elevated shipyard activity on several of our larger capacity barges, and that will result in a coastal revenue reduction in the mid-single digits compared to the third quarter. Coastal operating margins are expected to be at or slightly below breakeven for the fourth -- in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at Distribution and Services, favorable commodity prices and increasing rig counts as well as well completions are expected to yield continued strong demand in our oil and gas distribution business. 
In manufacturing, activity levels are also expected to remain strong driven by new orders and our growing backlog of environmentally friendly pressure pumping equipment and frac-related power generation equipment as well as some modest remanufacturing of conventional equipment. 
However, the OEM supply chain issues are expected to persist throughout the fourth quarter, and they will delay sales -- some sales and project deliveries into 2022. As a result, we expect our oil and gas businesses will experience a modest sequential reduction in revenues and operating income in the quarter. 
In commercial and industrial, despite improving economic activity, there will be normal seasonality in marine repair, Thermo King and power generation, resulting in sequential reductions in revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter. Overall, compared to the 2021 third quarter Distribution and Services revenues are expected to decline modestly, with operating margins in the low to mid-single digits. 
Now to wrap things up, although the third quarter's results were disappointing, we see improved results in the fourth quarter, despite planned shipyards and coastal and seasonality and supply chain issues in Distribution and Services. 
More importantly, we see strong momentum building across our businesses, which we will believe -- which we believe will drive increased revenues and meaningful earnings growth in the coming years. 
In inland, our barge utilization has recently touched 90%, with October averaging in the mid- to high 80% range. With the world economy beginning to emerge from the pandemic, low inventories of refined products and oil demand expected to meet or exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2022, we believe inland has turned the corner. 
With minimal new barge supply, we expect our inland business will steadily move higher with improved pricing, earnings and returns going forward. 
In coastal, although market conditions remain challenging, recent improvements in the spot market should lead to barge utilization around 90%. Our difficult but necessary decisions to exit the Hawaii market and retire unutilized assets are long-term positives that will allow this business to focus on its best assets and markets to generate positive earnings as the market improved. 
In Distribution and Services, economic growth will benefit our commercial and industrial businesses in the coming quarters. In oil and gas, with strong commodity prices and expectations for increased U.S. gas-directed drilling, we are increasingly optimistic about enhanced demand for our products and services. 
Further, a heightened customer focus on low carbon solutions, including friendly -- environmentally friendly pressure pumping equipment and our power generation solutions for e-frac, has translated into significant growth in our backlog. 
These increasing levels of activity will lead to improved profitability in 2022. 
And finally, our strict capital discipline and intense focus on cash flow generation throughout the pandemic has enabled us to significantly reduce our debt and increase our liquidity. As a result, we are very well positioned to act on future strategic opportunities to increase our earnings potential going forward. 
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

And certainly, one of the things that we're seeing is all the supply chain issues, but it's impacting things like driver shortages and even on the railroads and being somewhat capacity constrained and definitely inflation in some of those -- specifically those other 2 categories. 
I'm curious, sort of what the crossover is if those areas are starting to see significant inflation. Is there any ability for some of the excess chemical or petroleum products to sort of be priced out of the market or for you guys to capture share if those other 2 modes of transportation get more expensive?"

I would just tell you, in general, inflation is happening. We're seeing a little wage pressure. We gave some raises in July, but we've not had a problem filling positions. 
As you know, Ben, we started our school, which is kind of a Kirby advantage. We started training mariners in January and have continued throughout the year. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our labor supply, and we're pretty excited about that. We are seeing some inflation with supplies and food and whatnot. But so far, it's okay. 
The big news for us really is that demand is growing. We're starting to see it. I mean, you can see it in the consumer, right? The consumer is doing better, gasoline demand is back up above the 5-year average, manufacturing orders are up. Our chemical customers are doing really well. You can look at their earnings announcements. Our refining and integrated customers are seeing inventories low one, but crack spread is really high. One of our independent refining customers that had shut down the refinery during COVID has restarted it. 
So from our perspective, demand is increasing. It's not really crossover demand. It's just real demand that we saw in our base business. And as you know, that demand with supply and check means that we're headed for a much better pricing environment. 
We're starting to see that now. We're getting price increases in the spot market. Spot prices are above contract prices in -- and things are moving along really well there."

But when you look at what's happening in the inland market and particularly tightness around horsepower, tightness around supply is growing, we're very optimistic. And we think we'll renew contracts. Higher spot pricing is well above contract pricing, and we're about to reprice some of these -- the COVID-low contracts. 
So I can't be too specific because it's a negotiation with numerous customers. As you know, fourth quarter is usually one of the heavier quarters. I would say it's kind of twice any other quarter. The first, second and third are kind of all around the same, maybe a little more in the first than the second and the third. But the fourth is always the heaviest. 
So we're pretty optimistic. We're heading in. Demand is tight. Pricing is going up. Labor and mariners are in short supply. Horsepower is in short supply. It is set up to go up. It needs to, it has to and it will."

There's -- some of the big chemical customers, you know them, they're saying they're running full out. And some of the refiners are saying the exact same thing. The independent refiners are saying they're going to run out -- run hard. 
Also we're seeing a little heavier feedstock mix, which is pretty positive for barging. The heavier feedstock mix, the more byproducts. And those byproducts generally lead to a little more barge movements. I mean, some of them are heavier products and not as readily moved in pipeline. 
So it's shaping up nicely. It's always good when your customers start making more money, right? Whether it's the chemical guys or the refiners or the integrated, they're all doing better, and that's good. 
And they're doing better because demand is picking up. And I think we're all tired of talking about COVID, but its demand impact has been real. And hopefully, we're turning the corner. We had the Delta variant. Hopefully, there's not another variant coming. 
But everything looks pretty good from our perspective just looking at refinery utilization and chemical plant utilization, ethylene production, aromatics production, C4 co-product production, they're all kind of increasing.

And then with the fundamentals accelerating in the inland market, is there maybe any thought to going to some shorter-term contracts just to be able to participate in maybe a stronger pricing environment as you look 6 or maybe even 12 months out?

And we're seeing that. I think there's [ Dan Lippe ] and others that publish on that. But the heavier feedstocks are going into the chemical plants. And again, that's good for us. The more naphtha they crack, the more heavies that you'll see. You could see C4s and butadiene coming out. Butadiene is a nice one because it's a pressure cargo, and Kirby's got a pretty good position in pressure products.

There's still a little overhang in excess equipment in the coastal market. I think everybody is aware of the Bouchard equipment out there, and there's still a fair amount of idle equipment amongst our competitors. 
The good news is, as we talked about, demand is increasing, right? If you think about the coastal business, it's pretty heavy in terms of refined products. And as you heard in some of my previous comments, the refinery utilization is up, product inventories are low, crack spreads are stronger, volumes are picking up. 
They just need to pick up a little more. There's still too much supply in the offshore business, but we're getting closer to the turn there. I think that turn is further out than the inland turn just because of how overbuilt that market got after -- as you recall, Jack, a few years back, there were probably 1/3 of the fleet was moving crude by barge. And I would say, it's a lot less than that. There's only a handful of the coastal barges moving crude oil now. 
So all that excess capacity has to be soaked up by refined products demand, and that's happening. It's just happening a little slower. So -- but it's heading in the right direction. 
We're doing our part. We're taking out these older wire equipment pieces, and I also think that ballast water treatment may drive some others out to retire. We're pretty far along on our fleet with ballast water treatment. I think a few other of our competitors are behind the curve on ballast water treatment. 
So as they start to spend that capital, perhaps we'll see some retirement. It's a long-winded answer to say that supply and demand is still a little out of balance, but it's heading in the right direction. And we took the actions we felt that were necessary. And I think we'll be breakeven-ish next year based on what we see now."

I think it resolves itself in early '22, but it's real. I know you guys are tired of hearing about COVID and supply chain. We're tired about it, too. But it's been real. You can look at some of the big engine OEMs. They're starting to catch up. So I'm optimistic, but they were real. 
I think the encouraging thing though, Ken, is our backlog has jumped meaningfully. I mean, our book-to-bill is a huge percentage, and we're not talking tens of millions. It's more like hundreds. 
And backlog is really growing. A lot of it is ESG centric. I'll tell you, in oil and gas, in particular, kind of any new equipment is got an element of carbon reduction for our customers and our customers' customers. And so that -- we're very excited about it. 
And you may have heard also that we bought a small company during the quarter that builds ESS, Energy Storage Systems or batteries, if you will. ESS sounds a little more sophisticated. But one of the things we do is we add that battery system to a frac spread, and it helps even the electric load on the generation equipment as they're ramping up and down on their pressure pump and the actual pumping. 
That's -- so that's vertical integration, but the great thing about the ESS capabilities, we're able to extend those into other parts of our KDS business, the distribution business. You can imagine, in commercial and industrial, the need for electric power keeps growing, and having a strong ESS offering will help us and is helping us. 
And then you can even take it to marine. We're building basically an electric, hybrid towboat right now. Ken, it will be able to run completely on electric power. And we're really excited about that. We see that as a future and also a place to add product from this very small acquisition. But it's got high technology. That's a long rambling answer. I hope I got the answer you wanted there."

So it's not meaningful at all in terms of materiality, in terms of cash. 
As we look at our business, the serious cash deployment would be to continue to consolidate the inland marine business if we're doing anything. You may see us spend some meaningful CapEx on wind support-type vessels, depending on contracts and how that might go. 
But the big capital deployment will be in the marine side of the business. I think the offshore assets, that was more of a restructuring. As we look at it, our customers, they really have gravitated away from wire offshore barges to the favor of ATBs. And we just kind of took that and we need to restructure around that. 
But the meaningful capital deployment or acquisitions will likely be in the marine side. I would tell you on D&S, we're running with the electrification side, and that has been meaningful in the oil and gas side. As we've seen e-frac come up and power generation used in well servicing. 
I would tell you, the rest of that commercial and industrial is coming along, too. Almost every business nowadays is looking at the grid reliability and what they need to do to protect themselves. 
So we're pretty excited about that. But as you know, that doesn't take a lot of capital, right? That doesn't require us to go buy companies or a lot of CapEx. It's really pretty low CapEx.

I think this market has been one of the worst ever in the history. We were coming out of the bottom pre-pandemic, and then the pandemic just kind of set a new low. Many of our competitors have been operating at cash breakeven or lower. We had some contracts way down there as well. 
You can look at our inland margins, right? They were kind of record lows. Now that's coming back. We were low mid-single digits. Now we're kind of -- I think we did about 7.5% in the inland side in the third quarter. We're thinking we'll do 10% margins in the fourth quarter. I would see, hopefully, we get into the mid-teens in '22 in inland. 
But when you start at really low margins and breakeven for many of our competitors, there could well be some opportunities. I would caveat this, and that is we've been very prudent through this pandemic. We've paid down a lot of debt. As you heard from Bill, I think since the Savage acquisition, we've paid down over $500 million in debt. 
We're still generating really strong cash flow. We'll continue to delever and be prudent as we look for acquisitions. But there could well be some. I would just tell you, we're going to be prudent. 
It's been a rough couple of years, and there's a lot of pain out there. But by the same token, we want to delever a little more. We've gotten our debt-to-total cap down below 30%.

COVID, we didn't really talk much about it because I think we're all tired of talking about COVID, but that probably cost us $0.05 or $0.06.

So it was a messy quarter. As I look forward, I would tell you that some of that -- those kind of headwinds are definitely going away. Ida has gone away.

A big portion of that is steel. But look, everything that goes into, it has gone up in price, too, right? I mean, you can think about paint, you can think about welding and labor, yes, it just costs more now to build them. 
And that's why as we think about inflation, it's not necessarily a bad thing for Kirby. We've got this huge installed base of barges that are relatively young and well maintained. And yes, so the higher the cost of new barges, kind of the better for us is the way we look at it. 
But steel is no doubt the majority of that cost. And it's -- yes, steel is up. Where the price of barges went up 100%, steel's up 300% since pre-pandemic. So you could imagine it feels that. 
I would tell you that most owner-operators right now are not building new equipment. There has been some on order. It's been on order for a while. Deliveries are nominal. And I would say, retirements should outstrip the deliveries there.

I would tell you that there is -- because of ESG, it's becoming more and more important is the pressure rating of a barge. 
A typical industry barge had a 3-pound pressure rating. Kirby has only built 6 pounds. So if you think about it, future emissions from a 6-pound barge are a lot less than they are in a 3-pound barge, and the market is starting to recognize that. By the market, I mean, our customers, they're worried about their fence line emissions, and the there's a premium coming and starting for 6-pound barges. 
Now is that an obsolescence thing? I'm not sure it's an obsolescence thing. It's just a fact, right, that everybody wants their emissions down. Those emissions are getting measured more and more and reported more and more. So we're seeing a premium kind of leak into the market -- driven into market by more desire for 6-pound barges versus 3 pounds. But that's not -- it's not technical obsolescence per se."

Earlier today, we announced adjusted earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 third quarter, which excludes a onetime noncash charge totaling $4.58 per share related to our coastal marine business. On a GAAP bas",1048,"Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. 
Earlier today, we announced adjusted earnings of $0.17 per share for the 2021 third quarter, which excludes a onetime noncash charge totaling $4.58 per share related to our coastal marine business. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $4.41 per share. 
Overall, our quarter was messy, with the onetime charge in coastal, a devastating hurricane which significantly impacted our inland marine business and increased issues related to COVID-19. We'll talk more about each of these including the onetime charge in a few moments. But first, I'll discuss our key markets.  
In Marine Transportation, our inland business started the quarter with improving customer demand. In August, however, barge volumes declined as the cases of the COVID-19 Delta variant increased, which slowed the pace of the economic recovery and reduced demand for refined products and crude. Vehicle miles traveled in the U.S. declined, including an overall 4.4% decline in August, with all regions of the U.S. impacted.  In our operations, we experienced a meaningful rise in positive cases among our mariners. As a result, we incurred increased costs to charter additional horsepower during the quarter to ensure our operations were seamless. 
Our inland business was also materially impacted by Hurricane Ida, a significant Category 4 storm which made landfall near New Orleans in late August. This storm left a widespread path of destruction, which led to prolonged shutdowns of many customer plants as well as significant damage to marine equipment and waterway infrastructure.  
As this storm approached, all refineries and chemical plants in the New Orleans/Baton Rouge corridor were forced into shutdowns. The storm damage was so significant that many remain closed or operating at reduced production levels through September and, in some cases, well into October.  
At the height of the storm, more than 2 million barrels of refinery capacity per day was off-line, reducing PADD III refinery utilization from 93% in August to 79% in September.  
In the petrochemical sector, with nearly the entire complex shut down, operating rates at nameplate ethylene plants in the Southeast -- excuse me, in Southeast Louisiana declined from 89% in August to 24% in September. And production fell as much as 75% compared to August.  
From a Marine Transportation perspective, the storm surge was so significant, the Mississippi River flowed backwards, causing many industry barges to break free and resulting in damage to numerous vessels, customer docks and waterway infrastructure.  
It's been estimated that as many as 2,000 dry cargo and tank barges were damaged during the storm, which included 30 Kirby tank barges. All of this resulted in a full closure of the Mississippi River for about a week and a lengthy closure of parts of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, which remains in effect today. This closure has resulted in lengthy alternative routes and significant lock delays throughout September and October.  
Overall, we estimate the damage caused by the hurricane on our equipment directly contributed to lost revenue and additional costs totaling approximately $0.08 per share during the third quarter.  
Moving to coastal. The market remained challenging during the third quarter, but we did experience some increases in spot market demand, which contributed to modest increases in barge utilization and reduced operating losses. More importantly, we took significant actions to improve our coastal business including the sale of our Marine Transportation assets in Hawaii and the retirement of 12 laid-up wire tank barges and 4 tugboats in the coastal fleet.  
These actions resulted in a onetime noncash impairment charge in the third quarter. However, there are significant positives, and it positions the coastal business for success going forward.  
First, our risk profile is greatly reduced by exiting Hawaii, which is a remote market that has generated poor returns for many years. The retirement of our outdated and laid-up coastal wire barges and tugboats improves our cost structure and materially reduces future capital outlays. Frankly, many of our customers view the old wire tow technology as less safe and less reliable when compared to newer ATBs. Overall, going forward, we expect our smaller fleet will allow us to focus on attractive markets. And more efficient, safe and cost-competitive equipment will ultimately generate improved earnings and favorable returns.  
In Distribution and Services, momentum continued to build with improved activity levels contributing to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating margins. In commercial and industrial, the timing of major backup power installations and seasonal utilization improvements in the rental fleet led to strong sequential activity in power generation. Increased demand for Thermo King product sales and service also contributed favorably to the quarter's results. These gains were partially offset by modest activity reductions in marine repair primarily due to major -- excuse me, due to reduced major overhauls and temporary facility closures following Hurricane Ida.  
In oil and gas, increasing U.S. rig counts and completions activity drove strong incremental demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. This growth contributed to 25% sequential growth in oil and gas revenues and positive operating margins for the first time in more than 2 years. In manufacturing, although supply chain constraints delayed the deliveries of several orders and led to a sequential reduction in revenues, our backlog grew meaningfully with significant new demand for our environmentally friendly pressure pumping and electric power generation equipment.  
In October, Kirby acquired a small energy storage systems manufacturer based in Texas, which has been a key partner in the development of our new power generation solutions for electric fracturing equipment. This acquisition will be important to the development of future energy storage solutions for the oilfield as well as industrial and marine transportation applications.  
In summary, our third quarter results reflected a challenging environment as well as key operating decisions in coastal marine. The good news is that we have seen a significant improvement in inland market fundamentals in recent weeks with increasing customer demand and higher barge utilization in the high 80% range.  
Distribution and Services also continues to improve with the economy. In a few moments, I'll talk more about these developments as well as the rest of our outlook. But first, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss more about the onetime charge as well as our segment results and balance sheet."

Before I review our segment results, I want to provide a little more detail on the onetime charge in coastal marine. During the third quarter, we sold our coastal Marine Transportation assets in Hawaii, including 4 tank barges and 7 tugboats for cash proceeds of $17.2 million. We also retired 12 wire tank barges and 4 tugboats, which had limited customer acceptance and low utilization. These events resulted in a noncash impairment charge of $121.7 million. As a result, the company concluded that a triggering event had occurred and performed interim quantitative impairment test on coastal goodwill, which resulted in a noncash impairment charge totaling $219 million. In total, the company recorded a noncash impairment related to coastal marine equipment and associated goodwill totaling $340.7 million before tax, $275 million after tax or $4.58 per share. 
Looking at our operating segments. In the third quarter, Marine Transportation revenues were $338.5 million with an operating income of $16.9 million and an operating margin of 5%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, marine revenues increased $17.9 million or 6% primarily due to higher fuel rebuilds in inland and coastal as the average cost of diesel fuel had increased 76%. Improved barge utilization in inland is offset by lower pricing on term contracts that had renewed during the last year. Operating income declined $15.5 million primarily due to Hurricane Ida, lower term contract pricing and increased maintenance.  
Compared to the 2021 second quarter, marine revenues increased $5.6 billion or 2% due to modest improvements in coastal barge utilization and increased fuel rebuilds. Operating income declined $1.6 million as a result of sales mix, increased horsepower costs and the impact of Hurricane Ida.  
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 76% of segment revenue. Average barge utilization was in the low 80% range, which was slightly down compared to the second quarter but improved compared to the low-70% range in the 2020 third quarter. Barge utilization during the quarter was heavily impacted by reduced volumes as a result of COVID-19 Delta variant and customer shutdowns following Hurricane Ida. Long-term inland Marine Transportation contracts or those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue with 56% from time charters and 44% from contracts of affreightment.  
With respect to pricing, average spot market rates were stable compared to the second quarter and the 2020 third quarter. Of the few term contracts that renewed during the third quarter, average rates were down in the low to mid-single digits. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, inland revenues were up 3% due to significant increases in fuel rebuilds and improved barge utilization offset by lower average pricing on term contracts. Compared to the second quarter, inland revenues were stable. Overall, the inland market represented 76% of segment revenues and had an operating margin in the mid- to high single digits.  
In coastal, spot market conditions improved modestly resulting in barge utilization in the mid-70% range during the quarter. Average spot market rates and renewals of term contracts were stable. During the third quarter, the percentage of coastal revenues under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were term -- time charters.  
Revenues in coastal increased 4% sequentially and 13% compared to the 2020 third quarter primarily due to higher fuel rebuilds and modest increases in spot market activity. Overall, coastal represented 24% of Marine Transportation segment revenues and at a negative operating margin in the low single digits. With respect to our tank barge fleet, a reconciliation of changes in the third quarter as well as projections for the remainder of 2021 are included in our earnings call presentation posted on our website.  
Moving to Distribution and Services. Revenues for the 2021 third quarter were $260.4 million with an operating income of $11 million and an operating margin of 4.2%. Compared to the 2020 third quarter, Distribution and Services revenue increased $84.4 million or 48%, and operating income improved $9.9 million. Compared to the 2021 second quarter, revenues increased $33.7 million or 15%, and operating income increased $4.9 million. These improvements are primarily due to a significant increase in demand for our oil and gas products and services as well as the improved economic conditions across the U.S., which has raised demand for equipment, parts and service in the commercial and industrial markets.  
In commercial and industrial, increased economic activity contributed to the increased sequential and year-on-year demand for equipment, parts and service in on-highway, Thermo King and power generation. The power generation rental fleet also benefit from increased utilization during the summer storm season including Hurricane Ida. Marine repair revenues were down sequentially and year-on-year due to reduced major overhauls as well as activity reductions at our Louisiana facilities following Hurricane Ida. During the third quarter, commercial and industrial revenues increased 9% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Overall, the business represented approximately 59% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the mid-single digits.  
In oil and gas, favorable commodity prices and increased activity in the oilfield contributed to significant sequential and year-on-year increases in revenues and operating income. The most significant increase was in our distribution business with better demand for new transmissions, parts and service from major oilfield customers. Our manufacturing businesses also experienced substantial increases in new orders for pressure pumping and frac-related power generation equipment. While manufacturing revenues increased sharply year-on-year, the business was negatively impacted by the timing of deliveries and OEM supply chain issues.  
During the third quarter, oil and gas revenues increased 25% sequentially and 120% year-on-year. Overall, the oil and gas-related businesses represented approximately 41% of segment revenue and had an operating margin in the low to mid-single digits.  
Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, we had $54 million of cash and total debt of $1.21 billion with a debt-to-cap ratio of 29.8%. Since the Savage acquisition of April 1, 2020, we have repaid nearly $500 million in debt.  
During the quarter, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $83 million. Net of capital expenditures of $34 million, free cash flow was $49 million. We also sold assets with net proceeds of $22 million during the quarter primarily composed of coastal marine assets in Hawaii. At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $908 million. As of this week, our net debt has been further reduced to $1.2 billion. 
For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $130 million, which represents more than a 15% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet. We also expect to generate free cash flow of $250 million to $290 million for the full year. Lastly, from a tax perspective, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 29% in the fourth quarter.  
I'll now turn the call back over to David."

Although the third quarter certainly had its challenges, we are very encouraged by the improving market fundamentals across our businesses, which are setting the stage for materially improved earnings in the coming year. In the near term, for the fourth quarter, we expect a sequential improvement in overall revenues and earnings driven by increased volumes and more favorable market conditions in Marine Transportation offset in part by nominal and normal [ seasonality ] and continued supply chain issues in Distribution and Services.  
In the inland market, although some issues associated with Hurricane Ida have carried over, including extended customer shutdowns, barge repairs and waterway closures, our outlook remains very positive. 
During October, our barge utilization has been in the mid-80% to high-80% range with recent utilization at the high end of that and in the high-80s. Some of this increase can be attributed to waterway closures in Louisiana, which have extended transit times. However, turnarounds and pent-up demand are also driving up barge volumes. While the waterways are expected to fully reopen soon, we expect barge utilization levels will be minimally impacted due to the ramping up of Hurricane Ida-affected plants, economic improvements, new chemical plants coming online and the onset of winter weather. 
With increased inland activity levels, minimum new barge construction and continued retirements, we expect further improvements in the spot market going forward. During the fourth quarter and into next year, term contracts that renewed lower during the pandemic are expected to reset and gradually reset to reflect the improved market conditions. Overall, inland revenues are expected to sequentially increase in the fourth quarter with operating margins improving to around 10%. 
In coastal, we expect the market will continue to recover with modest demand improvement for refined products and black oil transportation. The recent retirement of the wire barge marine equipment will result in coastal barge utilization being around 90% for the fourth quarter. Although the Hawaii equipment has been sold, we will continue to operate the assets under a charter agreement through the end of the year when our existing customer contracts expire. 
In the fourth quarter, we do anticipate some elevated shipyard activity on several of our larger capacity barges, and that will result in a coastal revenue reduction in the mid-single digits compared to the third quarter. Coastal operating margins are expected to be at or slightly below breakeven for the fourth -- in the fourth quarter. 
Looking at Distribution and Services, favorable commodity prices and increasing rig count as well as well completions are expected to yield continued strong demand in our oil and gas distribution business. In manufacturing, activity levels are also expected to remain strong driven by new orders and our growing backlog of environmentally friendly pressure pumping equipment and frac-related power generation equipment as well as some modest remanufacturing of conventional equipment. However, the OEM supply chain issues are expected to persist throughout the fourth quarter, and they will delay sales -- some sales and project deliveries into 2022. As a result, we expect our oil and gas businesses will experience a modest sequential reduction in revenues and operating income in the quarter. 
In commercial and industrial, despite improving economic activity, there will be normal seasonality in marine repair, Thermo King and power generation, resulting in sequential reductions in revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter. Overall, compared to the 2021 third quarter, Distribution and Services revenues are expected to decline modestly with operating margins in the low to mid-single digits. 
Now to wrap things up. Although the third quarter's results were disappointing, we see improved results in the fourth quarter despite planned shipyards and coastal and seasonality and supply chain issues in Distribution and Services. More importantly, we see strong momentum building across our businesses, which we will believe -- which we believe will drive increased revenues and meaningful earnings growth in the coming years. 
In inland, our barge utilization has recently touched 90% with October averaging in the mid- to high-80% range. With the world economy beginning to emerge from the pandemic, low inventories of refined products and oil demand expected to meet or exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2022, we believe inland has turned the corner. With minimal new barge supply, we expect our inland business will steadily move higher with improved pricing, earnings and returns going forward. 
In coastal, although market conditions remain challenging, recent improvements in the spot market should lead to barge utilization around 90%. Our difficult but necessary decisions to exit the Hawaii market and retire unutilized assets are long-term positives that will allow this business to focus on its best assets and markets to generate positive earnings as the market improved. 
In Distribution and Services, economic growth will benefit our commercial and industrial businesses in the coming quarters. In oil and gas, with strong commodity prices and expectations for increased U.S. gas-directed drilling, we are increasingly optimistic about enhanced demand for our products and services. 
Further, a heightened customer focus on low-carbon solutions, including friendly -- environmentally friendly pressure pumping equipment and our power generation solutions for e-frac, has translated into significant growth in our backlog. These increasing levels of activity will lead to improved profitability in 2022. 
And finally, our strict capital discipline and intense focus on cash flow generation throughout the pandemic has enabled us to significantly reduce our debt and increase our liquidity. As a result, we are very well positioned to act on future strategic opportunities to increase our earnings potential going forward. 
Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

And certainly, one of the things that we're seeing is all the supply chain issues, but it's impacting things like driver shortages and even on the railroads and being somewhat capacity constrained and definitely inflation in some of those -- specifically those other 2 categories. I'm curious, sort of what the crossover is if those areas are starting to see significant inflation. Is there any ability for some of the excess chemical or petroleum products to sort of be priced out of the market or for you guys to capture share if those other 2 modes of transportation get more expensive?"

I would just tell you, in general, inflation is happening. We're seeing a little wage pressure. We gave some raises in July, but we've not had a problem filling positions. As you know, Ben, we started our school, which is kind of a Kirby advantage. We started training mariners in January and have continued throughout the year. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our labor supply, and we're pretty excited about that. We are seeing some inflation with supplies and food and whatnot, but so far, it's okay. 
The big news for us really is that demand is growing. We're starting to see it. I mean you can see it in the consumer, right? The consumer is doing better. Gasoline demand is back up above the 5-year average. Manufacturing orders are up. Our chemical customers are doing really well. You can look at their earnings announcements. Our refining and integrated customers are seeing inventories low, one, but crack spread is really high. One of our independent refining customers that had shut down the refinery during COVID has restarted it. 
So from our perspective, demand is increasing. It's not really crossover demand, it's just real demand that we saw in our base business. And as you know, that demand with supply and check means that we're headed for a much better pricing environment. We're starting to see that now. We're getting price increases in the spot market. Spot prices are above contract prices in -- and things are moving along really well there."

But when you look at what's happening in the inland market and particularly tightness around horsepower, tightness around supply is growing, we're very optimistic. And we think we'll renew contracts. Our spot pricing is well above contract pricing, and we're about to reprice some of these -- the COVID-low contracts. 
So I can't be too specific because it's a negotiation with numerous customers. As you know, fourth quarter is usually one of the heavier quarters. I would say it's kind of twice any other quarter. The first, second and third are kind of all around the same, maybe a little more in the first than the second and the third. But the fourth is always the heaviest. 
So we're pretty optimistic. We're heading in. Demand is tight. Pricing is going up. Labor and mariners are in short supply. Horsepower is in short supply. It is set up to go up. It needs to, it has to, and it will."

There's -- some of the big chemical customers, you know them, they're saying they're running full out, and some of the refiners are saying the exact same thing. The independent refiners are saying they're going to run out -- run hard. 
Also we're seeing a little heavier feedstock mix, which is pretty positive for barging. The heavier feedstock mix, the more byproducts. And those byproducts generally lead to a little more barge movements. I mean some of them are heavier products and not as readily moved in pipeline. 
So it's shaping up nicely. It's always good when your customers start making more money, right? Whether it's the chemical guys or the refiners or the integrated, they're all doing better, and that's good. And they're doing better because demand is picking up. And I think we're all tired of talking about COVID, but its demand impact has been real. And hopefully, we're turning the corner. We had the Delta variant. Hopefully, there's not another variant coming. 
But everything looks pretty good from our perspective. Just looking at refinery utilization and chemical plant utilization, ethylene production, aromatics production, C4 co-product production, they're all kind of increasing. They've recovered from Ida and actually are starting to get above pre -- or pandemic levels and back to pre-pandemic levels."

And we're seeing that. I think there's Dan Lippe and others that publish on that. 
But the heavier feedstocks are going into the chemical plants. And again, that's good for us. The more naphtha they crack, the more heavies that you'll see. You could see C4s and butadiene coming out. Butadiene is a nice one because it's a pressure cargo, and Kirby's got a pretty good position in pressure products. So yes, the flexi crackers are taking advantage of kind of the pricing dynamics and cracking a little more heavy.

There's still a little overhang in excess equipment in the coastal market. I think everybody is aware of the Bouchard equipment out there, and there's still a fair amount of idle equipment amongst our competitors. 
The good news is, as we talked about, demand is increasing, right? If you think about the coastal business, it's pretty heavy in terms of refined products. And as you heard in some of my previous comments, the refinery utilization is up, product inventories are low, crack spreads are stronger, volumes are picking up. They just need to pick up a little more. 
There's still too much supply in the offshore business, but we're getting closer to the turn there. I think that turn is further out than the inland turn just because of how overbuilt that market got after -- as you recall, Jack, a few years back, there were probably 1/3 of the fleet was moving crude by barge. And I would say it's a lot less than that. There's only a handful of the coastal barges moving crude oil now. 
So all that excess capacity has to be soaked up by refined products demand, and that's happening. It's just happening a little slower. So -- but it's heading in the right direction. 
We're doing our part. We're taking out these older wire equipment pieces. And I also think that ballast water treatment may drive some others out to retire. We're pretty far along on our fleet with ballast water treatment. I think a few other of our competitors are behind the curve on ballast water treatment. So as they start to spend that capital, perhaps we'll see some retirement. 
It's a long-winded answer to say that supply and demand is still a little out of balance, but it's heading in the right direction. And we took the actions we felt that were necessary. And I think we'll be breakeven-ish next year based on what we see now."

I think it resolves itself in early '22, but it's real. I know you guys are tired of hearing about COVID and supply chain. We're tired about it, too. But it's been real. You can look at some of the big engine OEMs. They're starting to catch up, so I'm optimistic, but they were real. 
I think the encouraging thing though, Ken, is our backlog has jumped meaningfully. I mean our book-to-bill is a huge percentage, and we're not talking tens of millions. It's more like hundreds. 
And backlog is really growing. A lot of it is ESG centric. I'll tell you, in oil and gas in particular, kind of any new equipment has got an element of carbon reduction for our customers and our customers' customers. And so that -- we're very excited about it. 
And you may have heard also that we bought a small company during the quarter that builds ESS, energy storage systems or batteries, if you will. ESS sounds a little more sophisticated. But one of the things we do is we add that battery system to a frac spread, and it helps even the electric load on the generation equipment as they're ramping up and down on their pressure pump and the actual pumping. That's -- so that's vertical integration. 
But the great thing about the ESS capabilities, we're able to extend those into other parts of our KDS business, the distribution business. You can imagine, in commercial and industrial, the need for electric power keeps growing, and having a strong ESS offering will help us and is helping us. 
And then you can even take it to marine. We're building basically an electric, hybrid towboat right now. Ken, it will be able to run completely on electric power. And we're really excited about that. We see that as a future and also a place to add product from this very small acquisition. But it's got high technology. That's a long rambling answer. I hope I got the answer you wanted there."

As we look at our business, the serious cash deployment would be to continue to consolidate the inland marine business if we're doing anything. You may see us spend some meaningful CapEx on wind support-type vessels depending on contracts and how that might go. But the big capital deployment will be in the marine side of the business. 
I think the offshore assets, that was more of a restructuring. As we look at it, our customers, they really have gravitated away from wire offshore barges to the favor of ATBs. And we just kind of took that, and we need to restructure around that. 
But the meaningful capital deployment or acquisitions will likely be in the marine side. I would tell you on D&S, we're running with the electrification side, and that has been meaningful in the oil and gas side as we've seen e-frac come up and power generation used in well servicing. 
I would tell you, the rest of that commercial and industrial is coming along, too. Almost every business nowadays is looking at the grid reliability and what they need to do to protect themselves. 
So we're pretty excited about that. But as you know, that doesn't take a lot of capital, right? That doesn't require us to go buy companies or a lot of CapEx. It's really pretty low CapEx. This small acquisition really was a small piece of vertical integration because we're already selling the ESS with our e-fracs."

You can look at our inland margins, right? They were kind of record lows. Now that's coming back. We were low, mid-single digits. Now we're kind of -- I think we did about 7.5% in the inland side in the third quarter. We're thinking we'll do 10% margins in the fourth quarter. I would see, hopefully, we get into the mid-teens in '22 in inland. 
But when you start at really low margins and breakeven for many of our competitors, there could well be some opportunities. I would caveat this, and that is we've been very prudent through this pandemic. We've paid down a lot of debt. As you heard from Bill, I think since the Savage acquisition, we've paid down over $500 million in debt. 
We're still generating really strong cash flow. We'll continue to delever and be prudent as we look for acquisitions. But there could well be some. I would just tell you we're going to be prudent. 
It's been a rough couple of years, and there's a lot of pain out there. But by the same token, we want to delever a little more. We've gotten our debt-to-total cap down below 30%. It's now -- I think it's 29% -- I'm looking at Bill, 29%-ish. So we're going to delever a little more, but there could be some prospects in the coming year or 2."

As we think about it historically, traditionally, Q3 was a good quarter. Utilization pricing, it seems like then you kind of stepped down a little in Q4. And then in Q1, you really step down in terms of utilization and spot pricing. 
Just given what we saw in Q3, does that kind of change how we should be thinking about the normal seasonal path, maybe not in Q4 but in Q1 and what that means in terms of setting up Q3?"

We had the restructuring of coastal. Hurricane Ida was about $0.08. COVID, we didn't really talk much about it because I think we're all tired of talking about COVID, but that probably cost us $0.05 or $0.06. As COVID hit our marine crews, we had to divert tows. We had to take them off, higher -- because we had to recrew. We had higher medical costs, et cetera. So -- and then we had a higher tax rate if you throw that into the third quarter, too. So it was a messy quarter. 
As I look forward, I would tell you that some of that -- those kind of headwinds are definitely going away. Ida has gone away. Third quarter is almost always our best, but -- and that's because of our contracts of affreightment. As you know, when the weather is good, that's where we make good margins. 
So I know it sounds cliche, but I think quarter 3 was an anomaly. As you do know, quarter 4 has the weather, and quarter 1 has some weather as well. That will be normal. But it won't be near as bad as, say, what Ida and COVID did to us in this quarter."

But it's -- there's a lot of barges in the shipyards now recovering from Ida, but I think it's very temporary. It was more dry cargo and other vessels that were impact. 
The liquid tank barge market was impacted. And I think I used Kirby as an example. We probably had 30 barges. We only got a handful left to come out of repair. So we're almost through it. And I would -- I wouldn't think the rest of the industry is much different than we were in that. 
It was a meaningful impact, though. It's -- to have the Mississippi River go flow northward and just rip a lot of fleets up, it was a significant impact. But I do think it's largely temporary and not a systemic change to the inland market."

Supply side looks pretty construction -- pretty -- sorry, constructive for probably the next few years to come. I'm just curious, the increase in new build prices, is that kind of directly attributable to higher steel prices? Or are there other factors at play there? 
And I'm thinking specifically, is there any sort of hesitation from owners or underlying technology obsolescence risk embedded in there kind of looking ahead 5, 10, 20 years in the future? And maybe saying it another way, if steel prices were normalized, would we still be looking at a constructive supply picture here?"

I would tell you so, look, new barge, whether it's clean or dirty or hot oil barge, the prices -- if you go back to 2017, 2018, prices are almost, gosh, I would say, almost double. A big portion of that is steel. But look, everything that goes into it has gone up in price, too, right? I mean you can think about paint. You can think about welding and labor. Yes, it just costs more now to build them. 
And that's why as we think about inflation, it's not necessarily a bad thing for Kirby. We've got this huge installed base of barges that are relatively young and well maintained. And yes, so the higher the cost of new barges, kind of the better for us is the way we look at it. 
But steel is no doubt the majority of that cost. And it's -- yes, steel is up. Where the price of barges went up 100%, steel's up 300% since pre-pandemic. So you could imagine steel's that. 
I would tell you that most owner-operators right now are not building new equipment. There has been some on order. It's been on order for a while. Deliveries are nominal. And I would say, retirements should outstrip the deliveries there. 
In terms of your technology obsolescence, there's not -- a barge is a barge. It's a big steel box, but they are more and more sophisticated. But there's not a lot of technology obsolescence. I would tell you that there is -- because of ESG, it's becoming more and more important is the pressure rating of a barge. 
A typical industry barge had a 3-pound pressure rating. Kirby has only built 6 pounds. So if you think about it, future emissions from a 6-pound barge are a lot less than they are in a 3-pound barge. And the market is starting to recognize that. By the market, I mean our customers. They're worried about their fence-line emissions, and there's a premium coming and starting for 6-pound barges. 
Now is that an obsolescence thing? I'm not sure it's an obsolescence thing. It's just a fact, right, that everybody wants their emissions down. Those emissions are getting measured more and more and reported more and more. So we're seeing a premium kind of leak into the market -- well, driven into market by more desire for 6-pound barges versus 3 pounds. But that's not -- it's not technical obsolescence per se."
