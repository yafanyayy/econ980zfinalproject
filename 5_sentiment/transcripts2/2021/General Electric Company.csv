It's hard to think of a tougher year than 2020. However, our team performed in the fourth quarter marked a strong free cash flow finish to the year. Starting with our results snapshot on Slide 2. Industrial free",1189,"Steve, thanks, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to think of a tougher year than 2020. However, our team performed in the fourth quarter marked a strong free cash flow finish to the year. Starting with our results snapshot on Slide 2. Industrial free cash flow came in at $4.4 billion in the quarter, $500 million higher than last year. This was largely driven by better working capital and improved renewables and power orders. 
For the year, we generated positive free cash flow of $600 million or $300 million, excluding biopharma in the first quarter. Despite the weakness in aviation, health care drove our performance, delivering $2.9 billion of free cash, and power and renewables continued to improve. 
Orders were down 3% organically in the quarter. While down, this was a considerable improvement from the second and third quarters. In 3 of our 4 segments, orders were in fact up, notably equipment orders at Renewables and Power were up double digits. For the year, orders were down 17%, with 95% of this pressure Aviation related. 
Despite this, our backlog remains a strength at $387 billion with approximately 80% geared towards services where we have higher margins. 
Industrial revenue was down 14% organically and 13% for the year. Services were down 22% this quarter driven by the aviation aftermarket despite some moderation, outages and upgrades in power and power upgrades and renewables. While services may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, especially as we've seen during the pandemic, they create a multiyear backlog of profitable business and importantly, keep us close to our customers, and we expect to grow in '21. 
Industrial margin was 6.4% this quarter, and 3.4% for the year. While this was an organic contraction on both measures, we saw sequential improvement through the year due to our more than $2 billion of cost actions. Adjusted EPS was $0.08 for the quarter and $0.01 for the year, which includes an impact for the restructuring recast of $0.02 for the quarter and $0.05 for the year. Carolina will expand on this momentarily. 
In all, momentum is growing across our businesses. As 2020 progressed, we significantly improved GE's profitability and cash performance despite a still difficult macro environment. We're encouraged by the significant free cash flow growth this quarter. 
We came into 2020 with a clear game plan at GE. We were expecting strong performance from Aviation and Healthcare while executing our turnarounds at Power and Renewables. We all know how the story goes. The COVID-19 pandemic hit and it hit us hard, but our battle-tested team embraced the new realities and moved on. This is best evidenced by the meaningful progress on our priorities. 
Looking at Slide 3. One, we strengthen our businesses. This started first with what matters most, protecting the safety of our employees and taking care of our customers and our communities. At the same time, we remain focused on what we can control. We continue to build our world-class team at all levels with new leaders joining our resisting strong bench of GE talent, and these leaders are playing a critical role in GE's operational and cultural transformation. 
In support of our transformation and better results, we executed more than $3 billion of cash actions. This enabled strong free cash flow generation in the quarter, bringing us again into positive territory for the full year. 
Specifically at Gas Power, we delivered positive cash flow 1 year ahead of our commitments due to our cost measures and operational improvements. And we saw traction across our other businesses. For example, all 3 power portfolio businesses generated profit growth this quarter, the first time in 2 years. 
Two, we continue to solidify our financial position. Despite the ongoing market uncertainty, our liquidity remains strong, bolstered by our free cash flow performance. We exited the quarter with $37 billion of cash. You'll recall that in early 2020, we completed the sale of our biopharma business for $20 billion. This cash enabled us to accelerate our balance sheet deleveraging efforts. And since the beginning of 2019, we've reduced external debt by $30 billion. 
And three, we're building our foundation for long-term profitable growth. This starts with GE's purpose. Rising to the challenge of building a world that works. We're leading in some of the world's most important markets, the energy transition, precision health and the future of flight. And we're passionate about delivering for our customers while tackling the world's biggest problems. We're seeing this as we help customers decarbonize through leading technology across wind, gas power generation, and modernizing the power grid with digital and automation solutions. And this really came to life at health care this year, where we were on the front lines responding to the exponential increases in demand in certain products due to COVID-19. And we're keeping our sights on the long term. Health care launched more than 40 new products, including the mural virtual care solution, which provides a complete view of patient status across a care area, [indiscernible] system. 
And we announced that we acquired Prismatic Sensors, which has photon counting technology, a huge leap forward in the quality of images that can be captured on a CT. 
So as we play more offense in 2021, our team is energized about making our purpose a reality every day. Now LEAN is how we will do this across GE and the real unfinished business. In the last 2 years, we've laid the groundwork, establishing our Kaizen promotion office and introducing LEAN fundamentals across the company. Now we're picking up the pace, scaling lean company-wide with an eye towards operational and financial impact through safety, quality, delivery, cost and cash improvements. 
In digital grid, for example, our team used problem-solving and daily management to reduce quality defects by 25%. This helped drive savings that enabled the business to grow operating profit by 60% in 2020. As this team shows, you can apply LEAN in any part of the business, not just in manufacturing. 
One of our key leadership behaviors is delivering with focus, which means ruthlessly prioritizing where we can add the greatest value. Two key opportunities for GE are aftermarket services and digital, often working in tandem to transform what we can do for our customers on a daily basis. For example, our renewables and digital teams are working together to develop AI enhanced wind turbine inspections to reduce blade failures. 
In turn, earlier detection will help improve safety as well as reduce repair time and cost. These advances are possible due to our ongoing commitment to investing in innovation. We also had some major product launches this year with the Haliade-X wind turbine and the GE 9x engine receiving certifications. Both machines are leaders in their own rights offering incredible power output and efficiency. 
So 2020 is certainly a year none of us will ever forget for its challenges, but even more so for how the world rose to meet them. At GE, I'm proud of the way we persevered in the face of great uncertainty, and we're set up well for the year ahead. 
With that, Carolina will provide further details on our quarterly results."
177031,701622821,2181393,"General Electric Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Larry.

Broadly speaking, I'm also pleased with how we're progressing on our priorities. We're becoming more operational. We're deepening our focus on cash flow and we're using LEAN and automation to improve speed, quality and scale. And you've started to see evidence of this in our margin and cash flow numbers. I'll share some examples with you today. 
Turning to Slide 4. Larry covered our consolidated results, so let me provide some additional color on our earnings performance. First, we made some notable reporting enhancements. This better aligned with how we operate our businesses and will help us drive improvements. They also further enhance transparency and disclosure quality. Of particular note, we now include restructuring expense expected for significant and higher cost programs in adjusted EPS and in our segment results. This will drive accountability in managing costs and benefit at the businesses. The restructuring recost was an impact of $0.02 in the quarter and $0.05 for the year. 
Second, we're still managing through significant market volatility. Aviation continues to heavily impact our overall performance, pressuring our top line and our industrial profit, but we saw progress in our other businesses. This quarter, while overall industrial margin was down 350 basis points, excluding aviation, margin expanded 340 basis points, reflecting swift actions and strong executions on our cost programs. As planned in 2020, we reduced structural headcount by more than 20,000 or 11%, and that's ex dispositions. 
Third, looking at continuing to adjusted EPS much of this difference came from the steps we've taken to improve our financial position and operations. There were a couple of main drivers. This includes our Baker Hughes mark and $124 million of restructuring expense tied to the significant high cost programs. 
I'd also point out debt tender costs, additional biopharma-related tax benefit and the remaining $100 million to close out the SEC matter. In all, as our actions took hold we saw improving results to close this difficult year. 
Moving to cash. We generated $4.4 billion of industrial free cash flow this quarter, well above our expectations coming into the quarter. This is up $500 million year-over-year, but is also ex-biopharma, up $900 million. All businesses delivered positive cash flow, largely driven by better working capital management. 
Cash flow benefited from positive earnings, healthy earnings were strong again this quarter. And together with Power and Renewables were enough to offset Aviation decline. You'll see that there are puts and takes between earnings and other CFOA. As seen in prior quarters, noncash items such as the Baker Hughes mark-to-market impacted earnings but not cash, and they were offset in other CFOA. 
Consistent with how we run the business, with strengthens our working capital definition, broadening it to include current contract assets and other current items, while our free cash flow definitions remain unchanged. 
This quarter, working capital was the biggest driver of our free cash flow, a source of cash at $3.4 billion. This was significantly better sequentially and year-over-year due to seasonal volume and continued operational and financial process improvement. While we're seeing improvements across the board, inventory and payables were the net contributors to cash flow this quarter. 
Looking at the dynamics. Receivable naturally pressured from the higher seasonal volume in fourth quarter. We also reduced short-term factoring by $1.2 billion this quarter, bringing the total factoring balance down to $6.8 billion. Partially offsetting this was strong collections, resulting in a further decline in past dues and DSOs. 
Renewables was a standout this year, implementing a standard operating rhythm using LEAN to reduce its DSOs and its past due by more than 25%. 
On inventory, we released $1.6 billion across all businesses through higher deliveries driven by seasonality and more rigorous material management. For example, Healthcare's [indiscernible] is implementing a real pull system in production. So far, this has improved on-time delivery by roughly 15 points and increased inventory turns by 0.5 turn. 
Payables were also benefit as volume increased this quarter. Progress collections were a net $1 billion inflow. This was driven by cash collected from large orders closed in renewables and strong milestone deliveries, partially offset by Aviation and Power. 
Contract assets, and net $800 million of inflow, and this was due to Aviation CSA collections, including quarterly flight hours, annual minium contract requirements and other items. 
We're still carefully optimizing our investments to drive returns aligned with our long-term objectives. We held CapEx flat sequentially. In fourth quarter, this represents a reduction of more than 50% year-over-year and for the year, this is down 31%. But importantly, we continue to invest in high-return and strategically important projects. 
For the year, industrial free cash flow was $600 million. All businesses except Aviation, improved cash flows and ended the year stronger than they began. Total power generated positive free cash flow including gas power as we made faster progress on our fixed cost reductions and working capital improvements despite the negative cash flows as power portfolio. 
Health care delivered an impressive free cash flow of $2.9 billion, while overcoming a $1 billion headwind from the foregone cash flows of biopharma. This was driven by higher earnings primarily from the pandemic-related demand, cost actions and better working capital. Free cash flow at renewables was negative $600 million, but a $300 million improvement year-over-year despite the impact of the PTC cycle. The focus on inventory management is paying off, and we had strong progress from orders and milestone execution. Aviation free cash flow turned positive this quarter and was nearly breakeven for the year, enabled by our significant cash actions. 
Stepping back, our trajectory to sustainable cash flow growth was largely on self help. I'm confident we're focused on the right areas. Operational cash drivers that improve working capital, increasing our frequency of our operating rhythms and more linear cash flow generation throughout the quarters and the year. 
For example, all leaders have action plans to run their businesses leaner with lower inventory levels. In aggregate, our focus and actions to improve working capital are starting to pay off. 
Moving to the segment results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First, on Aviation. GE and CFM departures were down approximately 48% this quarter versus our January '20 baseline due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and further travel restrictions. The commercial aftermarket, which is critical to our recovery, showed some sequential improvement. Orders were down 40% year-on-year, but up more than 50% sequentially. Commercial services was down more than 50% year-over-year, with commercial engines down 21%. 
It's important to recall that the fourth quarter of '19 included a $1.9 billion order from the aero derivative joint venture formation. This was just under half of the total orders decline in dollar terms. 
Aviation backlog stands at $260 billion, down 5% year-over-year, yet flat sequentially. The largest driver was commercial engines as unit shipments and cancellations outpaced orders. Cancellations were about 400 units, primarily led 1b this quarter, significant. But for context, our ending LEAP backlog still stands at more than 9,600 engines. 
Revenue decline continued to moderate, down 34% this quarter, while revenue was up nearly 20% sequentially. Commercial engine revenue was down 47%. As we shipped 309 fewer engines year-over-year. Commercial services revenue was down nearly 50%. This was driven by lower spare parts sales and shop visits. Charges for long-term service agreements were approximately $150 million this quarter, roughly 1/3 is COVID related. 
While customer demand remained strong in military, revenue was flat, falling short of our expectations. This was due to continued supply chain challenges, slowing shipments. 
Segment margin, 9.6%. Margin expanded sequentially driven by the cost actions and improved volume in commercial markets. Despite more than $100 million of continued higher costs due to lower production rates. The decremental margins this quarter were 48%, up sequentially. This was due to continued volume pressure and a tough margin comp of 23% from the fourth quarter in '19. 
So for the year, aviation margin of 5.6% were supported by significant countermeasures. We realized savings of more than $1 billion of costs and $2 billion of cash actions. This work continues in '21. 
Moving to health care. The team delivered another strong quarter. The health care systems market remained dynamic with elevated demand in COVID-19-related equipment, offset by softer demand for non pandemic products. 
Regionally, public health care markets, such as Europe and China have been stronger than private markets, particularly U.S., India and Latin America. For the second consecutive quarter, global procedure volumes were relatively stable, with some regional variability as care providers postpone elective procedures due to COVID-19 spikes. 
With that backdrop, healthcare orders continued to improve at 1%. In health care systems, orders grew 1%, Europe was up low double digits and China up low single digits. Services saw consistent growth, up low double digits as we continue to provide critical support to our customers. 
In PDX demand continues to recover to pre-pandemic level, and orders were down 1%, but up slightly sequentially. Healthcare revenue was up 6%. Healthcare Systems was up 7%, LCF had solid execution, delivering a record number of ventilators. Non-pandemic-related volumes were also positive as we converted imaging backlog and ultrasound orders this quarter. 
From a regional perspective, we saw strong growth in Europe and China. This year, China revenue was more than $2 billion and up 11% in the quarter alone. U.S. revenue was more than $6.5 billion, up 2% for the year, including the U.S. government ventilator order. PDX revenue slightly down 1%. 
The segment margin was up 310 basis points this quarter, and 190 basis points for the year. While we continue to invest in new products, the team reduced structural costs, headcount was down roughly 1,200 this quarter, and the business maintained tighter control over discretionary costs. 
For the year, revenue was up 4%, with healthcare systems up 5%, and the margin was 17%. Our team delivered operational improvement and has headroom for more with an eye towards continued margin expansion. 
Turning to power. Our team continued to make operational progress, particularly in cash generation. Starting with the market. Despite global electricity demand and gas-based power generation declining this quarter, GE gas turbine utilization, and therefore, our CSA billings were resilient, increasing mid-single digits. Driven by our technology and commercial positioning in higher growth gas favored regions. 
As anticipated, we saw significant orders improvement. Gas power equipment order more than tripled with HA Wins in Asia and securing 45 to 50 heavy-duty gas turbine shipments in 2021. Service orders grew 7%, with double-digit growth in transactional and low single-digit growth in CSA, while upgrade declined moderated from earlier in 2020, down single digits. 
For the year, service orders were down 3%. 
Power portfolio orders were down 27%, largely driven by steam equipment. As we exit new build coal, this trend of limited steam equipment activity has continued. And as we execute backlog and rightsize the business, we expect this to flow through the financials. We ended with slightly higher backlog as growth in gas power more than offset declines in Power portfolio. 
Gas power backlog of $66 billion grew roughly $700 million sequentially, driven by strong equipment and transactional services book-to-bill. Revenue was down slightly this quarter. In Gas Power revenue was down 3%, largely driven by services down 10%. We saw lower discretionary spend on upgrades and narrower scope of outages. For the year, we executed about 90% of our pre-COVID outage plan. Offsetting this was equipment revenue up double digits. We shipped 28 gas turbines this quarter, up 7 units year-over-year, for a total of 51 heavy-duty shipments in 2020, and we commissioned 4 gigawatts of power to the grid, including CHA units. 
In Power portfolio, revenue was up 5% primarily driven by steam equipment project execution. Our Power portfolio performed about 95% of their pre-COVID outage plans. 
Segment margin of 6% was up 40 basis points, a double-digit reduction in gas power fixed costs was partially offset by negative revenue mix between equipment and services and some onetime noncash charges, including for specific customer credit event. In Power portfolio, as Larry mentioned, all 3 businesses generated profit. Power conversion was a particular standout. Better execution led to margin expansion of 10 points year-over-year. 
For the year, power revenues were down 5%, but [indiscernible] health margins at 1.5%. We offset pressure from lower services volume and onetime noncash charges such as an underperforming joint venture for global aero derivative packaging by reducing headcount by roughly 3,300 and decreasing power fixed costs. 
Turning to renewables. Our progress continues. This year, onshore wind delivered record volumes despite the pandemic. Offshore wind received full certification for both its 12-and 13-megawatt Haliade-X. In grid and hydro, our turnaround, showed improved results. 
Starting with the market. Onshore wind growth was sustained by international demand. Offshore wind continued to be supported by solid secular growth trends. And we've built a robust Haliade-X pipeline with total commitments of 5.7 gigawatts. Orders were up 32% year-over-year, representing the first quarter of growth since the third quarter in '19. This was driven by onshore wind with large equipment orders in North America and offshore wind with its first Haliade-X order of 95 units from the Dogger bank wind farm in the U.K. This double-digit order growth brings our backlog to a record high of $30 billion and importantly, at better margins. We remain focused on underwriting discipline and better project selectivity. 
Revenue was down 7% driven by onshore wind specifically, new units and repower upgrades were down 27% as our deliveries were more heavily weighted in the prior quarter due to the PTC dynamics. This was partially offset by growth in offshore wind and hybrids. 
Segment margin was slightly negative this quarter, though up 290 basis points year-over-year was driven by cost productivity better pricing in onshore in North America and improved project execution. At grid, profit, while negative, improved significantly driven by our restructuring actions and better project execution. 
For Renewables, revenue was up for the year, and while the segment margin improved, it was still negative. 
Moving to GE Capital on Slide 7. We ended the year with $103 billion of assets, excluding liquidity. Continuing operations generated an adjusted net loss of $24 million this quarter. This was down year-over-year, primarily driven by lower gains at GECAS and EFS and higher taxes, partially offsetting lower EFS impairments and positive marks on the insurance investment portfolio. 
At GECAS, our team continued to work customer-by-customer through restructuring and, in some cases, repossessions. At year-end, the outstanding deferred balance was approximately $400 million. This was down slightly sequentially, both as a function of limited new deferrals as well as collections. 
Importantly, we've collected around 84% of what we've invoiced to date and out of fleet of more than 900 aircraft, we ended the year with 27 aircraft on ground. This quarter, GECAS generated a profit of $120 million. That's down $94 million year-over-year. Driven primarily by the disposition of the PKR in 2019 and market conditions. 
For the year, GECAS generated earnings of $50 million, excluding the second quarter goodwill impairment. Equipment lease impairments in the year totaled $542 million and $45 million in the quarter. 
Going forward, we continue to monitor credit risk as further credit deterioration could result in additional airline failures over and above those that we have considered in our reviews. 
Turning to insurance. The business generated net income of $112 million this quarter. This was largely driven by increases in the unrealized gains in invested securities portfolio and in mark-to-market adjustments and realized gains. 
As it relates to the pandemic and investing for what we believe is timing related. In our LTC block, we continue to see reductions in new claims and higher policy terminations. In our runoff life business, we saw -- we still saw higher claims due to higher mortality. In our structured settlement block, we also saw higher mortality routing in lower claims. Insurance will complete its annual statutory cash flow test in the first quarter of '21. 
As expected, GE provided a capital contribution to GE Capital of $2 billion, in line with the required annual insurance statutory funding for 2020. As we said in the third quarter, we expect an additional contribution from GE to GE Capital in '21 to meet its existing insurance statutory funding requirements of approximately $2 billion. 
In light of the uncertain environment, further 2021 contributions depend on GE Capital's performance, including GECAS' operations and the insurance CFT results. 
Shifting to corporate. Our focus on decentralization continues. We're driving more accountability to the segments and continue to resize the core in favor of the business units. This quarter, adjusted corporate costs were $443 million, down 23% year-over-year. Functional costs and operations improved as we saw further reduced headcount, which was down 13% for the year. GE Digital saw significant traction on profit and cash flow as the business improved operations and optimized its cost structure. 
Moving to Slide 8. We continue to improve our financial position despite the uncertain external environment. We ended the year with about $37 billion of total cash, more than $23 billion at GE and $13 billion at GE Capital. We also maintained $20 billion of credit lines. And through a series of actions this year, we reduced near-term liquidity needs through 2024 by $10.5 billion. 
We also continued to enhance our cash management operations, targeting more linear cash flow, lower factoring and less restricted cash. As a result, we reduced intra-quarter borrowings by $3.6 billion in 2020 or approximately 75% less year-over-year. 
Expanding on cash flow linearity. One focus area for our businesses has been improving the end-to-end cycle of order fulfillment, billing and collections. In our Healthcare system equipment business, for example, standard work is helping us level load the number of deliveries from the third month in the quarter to earlier in the quarter, smoothing out deliveries and collections. This is also reducing inventory and improving factory productivity. 
These types of operational improvements have reduced our industrial cash needs to below $13 billion on a go-forward basis. And this creates greater capacity to delever the company. However, we'll continue to hold elevated cash levels through this period of uncertainty. 
Turning to debt reduction. We made strong progress in 2020, reducing external debt by $16 billion, and our industrial net debt ended at $32 billion, down $16 billion in '20 and down $23 billion from '19. 
We also continue to derisk and actively manage our pension. In 2020, we decreased our pension deficit by $2.3 billion. The combination of strong asset returns at 17.6% and recent actions, such as the $2.5 billion pension prefunding, more than offset the impact of low interest rates. 
Based on our current assumptions, we won't need to make contributions through 2023 to the GE pension plan. In terms of leverage levels, industrial ended with a 5.9x debt-to-EBITDA ratio due to lower EBITDA, reflecting pandemic-related pressure. We remain committed to achieving our industrial leverage target of 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA over time. 
At GE Capital, we ended 2020 with a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.4%. And we expect to remain below our 4x debt-to-equity target. 
In closing, our team has made meaningful progress this year. I'm encouraged by the results we're seeing from the many, many changes underway. We'll continue to build on this momentum in 2021. 
Now Larry, back to you."

Turning to page to 2021. We're planning to provide a full outlook for the company, including detailed segment information during our March investor call. But today, we'll share an overview for the total company in 2021. Moving to Sl",677,"Carolina, thank you. Turning to page to 2021. We're planning to provide a full outlook for the company, including detailed segment information during our March investor call. But today, we'll share an overview for the total company in 2021. 
Moving to Slide 9. We're expecting organic growth in the low single-digit range for industrial revenue, organic expansion of 250-plus basis points for industrial operating margin, $0.15 to $0.25 for adjusted EPS and a range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion for industrial free cash flow. 
Of course, there are a number of key assumptions underpinning our plan for the year. First is the lost cash and earnings from dispositions, largely biopharma, which, again, generated nearly $300 million in cash and $400 million in profit in the first quarter of '20 and the continued reduction of Baker Hughes dividends, which represented more than $250 million of cash flow in 2020. 
Second, on aviation, where the impact of COVID has been most acutely felt and our level of uncertainty is still the greatest. Starting with the market, our plan assumes departures remain close to fourth quarter levels in the first quarter, and we begin to see the commercial aviation market recover in the second half. That said, we fully acknowledge the pace of the recovery remains dependent on containing the spread of the virus, effective inoculation programs and government's collaboration to encourage travel. 
At GE Aviation, we continue to expect the engine aftermarket recovery to lag departure trends across regions and fleets, particularly around quarantine requirements. And given that we generate a significant portion of our cash in commercial services, the recovery of the aftermarket remains critical. So our full year plan assumes aviation revenue is flat to up year-over-year. And as a reminder, since the full effect of the virus was not felt until late in the first quarter of last year, we will be lapping a tough comp. 
Looking across our other segments, In power, we anticipate continued progress at Gas Power, with some offset in Power portfolio as we exit new build coal. Overall, we expect equipment revenue will be down, driven by our narrower scope with less turnkey volume. We're also planning for growth in our higher-margin services revenue. 
In Renewables, we're focused on improving operational execution and driving structural cost out. This will help us expand margins and improve cash. At Healthcare, we expect continued strength in health care systems as our new products and commercial average drive growth and PDX to recover. While we expect cash conversion to remain solid, it will be lower than 2020. 
And in capital, we expect earnings to be better. At each business, we're further accelerating cash performance and cost management with restructuring remaining elevated. 
So in aggregate, we have a positive trajectory, going into 2021, despite areas of volatility and the continued challenges in aviation. We're focused on delivering on our commitments, and I'm confident that our continued efforts will build a stronger and more focused GE. 
Turning to Slide 10. As we all know, 2020 was a year like none other. I'm truly proud of the GE team and their remarkable resilience. I hope you can see that in the face of great uncertainty, we continue to strengthen our businesses and deliver for our customers. And as we move through the second half, our businesses had a strong free cash flow finish to what was a challenging year. Momentum is growing across our businesses. We've continued to evolve our culture by embracing LEAN while preserving the strengths that have defined GE throughout its history. And I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, how we will continue to lead the energy transition, help our customers deliver precision health and define the future of flight. 
As our multiyear transformation accelerates, we'll unlock upside potential with better cash generation, profit and growth. And ultimately, we expect that our industrial businesses over time, should generate high single-digit free cash flow margins, while rising to the challenge of building a world that works. 
With that, Steve, let's go to questions."

The segment will be flat, but it really masks 2 underlying dynamics, right? You're spot on with respect to the improvement at Gas Power, I don't think we could be more pleased with the progress the team is making there. Clearly a competitive market, no question. But in terms of controlling what we can control, both again, the better underwriting upfront with respect to equipment, the continued market acceptance of DHA, all of that, I think, is in our favor. Services has been a challenge. We've talked about that, I think, through the course of 2020. And a little bit of light there relative to the order book in the fourth quarter. But I think we really know the onus is on us to continue to drive better performance in all aspects of the service portfolio there, be it CSA's transaction and upgrades. Upgrades was particularly pressured for us in '20. We know CSAs is a function of utilization a little bit better. So I think when you put all of that commercial and operational activity on top of the restructuring, where we've taken $1 billion of cost out at Gas Power, you get the early arrival of that positive free cash performance in '20 as opposed to '21. And we really move from here with a team that I think has proven that we can control or controllable and deliver better results with this book of business. I think when you talk about power portfolio, you put your finger on steam, we're going to be restructuring as we exit coal, new build coal. That is a significant undertaking. It is early in that effort, and that will be a cash pull on us in '21 and probably to a lesser degree, in '22 as we execute on that. 
So when you put it all together, as you saw on the slide in the appendix, it will be roughly flat in '21. We'll be looking to drive gas as best we can, but we need to see the new coal exit through, and we'll do that as thoroughly and as thoughtfully as we can."

We actually saw fewer aircraft retire last year than we did the year before. But I think we're going to see that uptick in '21 in all likelihood here in the back half as volumes return and the deliveries at both of the major airframers pickup. 
So we're assuming that we will see that retirement transition and at the same time, while there's been a little bit of a bid-ask spread with respect to departing out some of those planes, we're anticipating that we'll see a little bit more of that USM effect as we get into the second half at a time when we should see a return to volume activity. I think people need to appreciate that, that USM cuts both ways for us. We're -- we've been a major user of USM given the nature of our CSA obligations over time. So it will take a little while, I think, for that market to begin to really kick in. There is a lag, of course, from the time a plane is retired to the time that we would see it in the U.S. end market. But I think as we look out over the next several years, again, not trying today to pen a particular time in which we see a return to normal volume activities. From our perspective, we anticipate deliveries to outpace retirements, and that will be a net effect positive for us at aviation. The other dynamic worth noting there, of course, is when we look at the dynamics for our fleet today, when we highlight the fact we've got a very young fleet, we're really -- what we really mean by that is we've got a little over half of the CF56, 5B and 7B fleet, they haven't seen their first shop visit, right? So they're still early in their life cycle, 3 quarters of that same fleet have yet to see their second shop visit. So we'll typically see during the course of a normal useful life. Our major economics happen in and around the first and second. So as these planes come back online, that green time is used. Demand puts additional pressures on the fleets that -- those are the catalysts that we're really watching for relative to the beginning of the recovery and the return to, let's just say, '19 levels in our commercial aftermarket business there in aviation."

Well, there are a couple of things in place, Scott, and I'd rather talk about that internally before we talk about it externally. But in effect, what you've seen in the last couple of years, really is not only the reduction of the core through absolute reductions, but also the movement of a number of the traditional corporate functions that had been at the center in some form out into the businesses.

That's really not part in a major way of that corporate net number that you see there, right? The businesses are paying their way. By and large in that regard.

We try to resize it in a way that embrace this harsh, unfortunate near-term reality, but gave us a little bit of room just because -- back to Andrew's question, a number of dynamics that are hard to know in the short-term with absolute certainty, be it the retirement dynamic, how fleets are going to manage green time just even in the short term, how folks are going to flex around the COVID effects as we saw in July and August and then in the other direction here in the first quarter. 
So as an operational matter, I think what John, Russell and the team are prepared for is a number of scenarios where when we see that recovery, we'll leverage some of the, if you will, the excess cost that is still there. Because again, we didn't take it to the bone, but also, we have -- we've laid in place plans that will give us an opportunity to ramp back effectively from a safety, from a quality, from an on-time delivery perspective, but also to have the right cost structure along the way. But we will be dealing with limits, right, in terms of our shop visit capacity in a particular window. And then that's part of the conversation we're already having with customers as they begin to think about the second half of '21. They want to make sure that they have their fleet in tiptop ready to go condition. So a lot that we're working through there. Clearly, our supply chain has been through a roller coaster right there along with us. I mean it was a year ago, I mean, literally, right now, when we're talking about not only continued volume ramps, but a new introduction, clearly at Boeing, with the MAX. And then literally weeks later, we're talking about slamming on the brakes. 
Part of what you saw in the fourth quarter is a little bit better inventory performance because the lead times and the cycle times and aviation tend to be longer than they are in some of the other businesses. But we are working as closely as we can with the supply base to help them do what we're doing, and that is worked through the near-term here, where we have these volume pressures, but also be ready for, again, a number of scenarios by which we see a return toward more normal volumes."

But Mary, you mentioned and expecting a lag in terms of the recovery in your shop visits, versus what the market traffic is, it doesn't look like it's happening today, but I get that's the phenomenon that develops over time. Just given so much of the free cash flow performance at the corporate level is working capital and not earnings. I mean how much of the range is really dependent on aviation as a market because it doesn't seem like there's a ton of volatility or expectation in the forecast that in aviation core performance is really driving that. And maybe that's a lag or something else, but am I interpreting that right?"

There's a bit of renewables in the range there as well. But I think what we've seen through the course of 2020 is that fortunately, when all was said and done, our power businesses were able to work their way through the pressure and the uncertainty. We had a number of orders of renewables that came in at the end of the year, and we didn't know they were going to be there until they were there. And fortunately, they were. But clearly, this will be a year of climate broadly, and that will be a good thing for our renewables business. And I think health care, while we won't convert at the exceptionally high levels the team did and credit to them in the back half of last year, health care, I think we've got good line of sight on. So when you look at that range, I think the bulk of it, again, is really a function of aviation. I like the way we're executing, we can always do better. But that said, it will really be a function of what happens in the end of the market. And I think what we try to do here is provide a framework that isn't assuming some sort of out of consensus early spike recovery in aviation, that would be in a word foolish."

It's hard to think of a tougher year than 2020. However, our team performed, and the fourth quarter marked a strong free cash flow finish to the year. Starting with our results snapshot on Slide 2. Industrial f",1185,"Steve, thanks, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to think of a tougher year than 2020. However, our team performed, and the fourth quarter marked a strong free cash flow finish to the year. 
Starting with our results snapshot on Slide 2. Industrial free cash flow came in at $4.4 billion in the quarter, $0.5 billion higher than last year. This was largely driven by better working capital and improved Renewables and Power orders.  
For the year, we generated positive free cash flow of $600 million or $300 million excluding BioPharma in the first quarter. Despite the weakness in Aviation, Healthcare drove our performance, delivering $2.9 billion of free cash, and Power and Renewables continued to improve.  
Orders were down 3% organically in the quarter. While down, this was a considerable improvement from the second and third quarters. In 3 of our 4 segments, orders were in fact up. Notably, equipment orders at Renewables and Power were up double digits. For the year, orders were down 17% with 95% of this pressure Aviation related.  
Despite this, our backlog remains a strength at $387 billion with approximately 80% geared towards services where we have higher margins.  
Industrial revenue was down 14% organically and 13% for the year. Services were down 22% this quarter driven by the aviation aftermarket despite some moderation, outages and upgrades in Power and power upgrades in Renewables. While Services may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, especially as we've seen during the pandemic, they create a multiyear backlog of profitable business, and importantly, keep us close to our customers, and we expect to grow in '21.  
Industrial margin was 6.4% this quarter and 3.4% for the year. While this was an organic contraction on both measures, we saw sequential improvement through the year due to our more than $2 billion of cost actions. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.08 for the quarter and $0.01 for the year, which includes an impact for the restructuring recast of $0.02 for the quarter and $0.05 for the year. Carolina will expand on this momentarily.  
In all, momentum is growing across our businesses. 
As 2020 progressed, we significantly improved GE's profitability and cash performance despite a still difficult macro environment. We're encouraged by the significant free cash flow growth this quarter.  
We came into 2020 with a clear game plan at GE. We were expecting strong performance from Aviation and Healthcare while executing our turnarounds at Power and Renewables. We all know how the story goes. The COVID-19 pandemic hit and it hit us hard, but our battle-tested team embraced the new realities and moved on. This is best evidenced by the meaningful progress on our priorities.  
Looking at Slide 3. One, we strengthened our businesses. This started first with what matters most: protecting the safety of our employees and taking care of our customers and our communities. At the same time, we remained focused on what we can control. We continued to build our world-class team at all levels with new leaders joining our existing strong bench of GE talent, and these leaders are playing a critical role in GE's operational and cultural transformation.  
In support of our transformation and better results, we executed more than $3 billion of cash actions. This enabled strong free cash flow generation in the quarter, bringing us again into positive territory for the full year. Specifically, at Gas Power, we delivered positive cash flow 1 year ahead of our commitments due to our cost measures and operational improvements. And we saw traction across our other businesses. For example, all 3 Power Portfolio businesses generated profit growth this quarter, the first time in 2 years.  
Two, we continued to solidify our financial position. Despite the ongoing market uncertainty, our liquidity remained strong, bolstered by our free cash flow performance. We exited the quarter with $37 billion of cash. You'll recall that in early 2020, we completed the sale of our BioPharma business for $20 billion. This cash enabled us to accelerate our balance sheet deleveraging efforts, and since the beginning of 2019, we've reduced external debt by $30 billion.  
And three, we're building our foundation for long-term profitable growth. This starts with GE's purpose: rising to the challenge of building a world that works. We're leading in some of the world's most important markets: the energy transition, precision health and the future of flight. And we're passionate about delivering for our customers while tackling the world's biggest problems. We're seeing this as we help customers decarbonize through leading technology across wind, gas power generation and modernizing the power grid with digital and automation solutions. And this really came to life at health care this year where we were on the front lines responding to the exponential increases in demand in certain products due to COVID-19. 
And we're keeping our sights on the long term. Healthcare launched more than 40 new products, including the Mural Virtual Care Solution, which provides a complete view of patient status across a care area, hospital or system.  
And we announced that we acquired Prismatic Sensors, which has photon-counting technology, a huge leap forward in the quality of images that can be captured on a CT. So as we play more offense in 2021, our team is energized about making our purpose a reality every day. 
Now lean is how we will do this across GE and the real unfinished business. In the last 2 years, we've laid the groundwork, establishing our Kaizen Promotion Office and introducing lean fundamentals across the company. Now we're picking up the pace, scaling lean company-wide with an eye towards operational and financial impact through safety, quality, delivery, cost and cash improvements.  
In digital grid, for example, our team used problem-solving and daily management to reduce quality defects by 25%. This helped drive savings that enabled the business to grow operating profit by 60% in 2020. As this team shows, you can apply lean in any part of the business, not just in manufacturing.  
One of our key leadership behaviors is delivering with focus, which means ruthlessly prioritizing where we can add the greatest value. Two key opportunities for GE are aftermarket services and digital, often working in tandem to transform what we can do for our customers on a daily basis. For example, our Renewables and digital teams are working together to develop AI-enhanced wind turbine inspections to reduce blade failures. In turn, earlier detection will help improve safety as well as reduce repair time and cost. These advances are possible due to our ongoing commitment to investing in innovation. 
We also had some major product launches this year with the Haliade-X wind turbine and the GE9X engine receiving certifications. Both machines are leaders in their own rights offering incredible power output and efficiency.  
So 2020 is certainly a year none of us will ever forget for its challenges, but even more so for how the world rose to meet them. At GE, I'm proud of the way we persevered in the face of great uncertainty, and we're set up well for the year ahead.  
With that, Carolina will provide further details on our quarterly results."
177031,701622821,2181497,"General Electric Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Larry.

Broadly speaking, I'm also pleased with how we're progressing on our priorities. We're becoming more operational; we're deepening our focus on cash flow; and we're using LEAN and automation to improve speed, quality and scale. And we've started to see evidence of this in our margin and cash flow numbers. I'll share some examples with you today.  
Turning to Slide 4. Larry covered our consolidated results, so let me provide some additional color on our earnings performance. First, we made some notable reporting enhancements. This better aligned with how we operate our businesses and will help us drive improvements. They also further enhanced transparency and disclosure quality. Of particular note, we now include restructuring expense for significant and higher cost programs in adjusted EPS and in our segment results. This will drive accountability in managing costs and benefit at the businesses. The restructuring recast was an impact of $0.02 in the quarter and $0.05 for the year.  
Second, we're still managing through significant market volatility. Aviation continues to heavily impact our overall performance, pressuring our top line and our Industrial profit, but we saw progress in our other businesses. This quarter, while overall Industrial margin was down 350 basis points, excluding Aviation, margin expanded 340 basis points reflecting swift actions and strong executions on our cost programs. As planned in 2020, we reduced structural head count by more than 20,000 or 11% and that's ex dispositions.  
Third, looking at continuing to adjusted EPS. Much of this difference came from the steps we've taken to improve our financial position and operations. There were a couple of main drivers. This includes our Baker Hughes mark and $124 million of restructuring expense tied to the significant high cost programs. I'd also point out debt tender costs, additional BioPharma-related tax benefit and the remaining $100 million to close out the SEC matter. 
In all, as our actions took hold we saw improving results to close this difficult year.  
Moving to cash. We generated $4.4 billion of Industrial free cash flow this quarter, well above our expectations coming into the quarter. This is up $500 million year-over-year, but is also, ex-BioPharma, up $900 million. All businesses delivered positive cash flow, largely driven by better working capital management.  
Cash flow benefited from positive earnings. Healthcare earnings were strong again this quarter, and together with Power and Renewables, were enough to offset Aviation decline. You'll see that there are puts and takes between earnings and other CFOA. As seen in prior quarters, noncash items such as the Baker Hughes mark-to-market impacted earnings but not cash, and they were offset in other CFOA.  
Consistent with how we run the business, we strengthened our working capital definition, broadening it to include current contract assets and other current items while our free cash flow definitions remain unchanged.  
This quarter, working capital was the biggest driver of our free cash flow. A source of cash at $3.4 billion, this was significantly better sequentially and year-over-year due to seasonal volume and continued operational and financial process improvement. While we're seeing improvements across the board, inventory and payables were the net contributors to cash flow this quarter.  
Looking at the dynamics. Receivable, naturally pressured from the higher seasonal volume in fourth quarter. We also reduced short-term factoring by $1.2 billion this quarter, bringing the total factoring balance down to $6.8 billion. Partially offsetting this were strong collections, resulting in a further decline in past dues and DSOs. Renewables was a standout this year, implementing a standard operating rhythm using lean to reduce its DSOs and its past due by more than 25%.  
On inventory, we released $1.6 billion across all businesses through higher deliveries driven by seasonality and more rigorous material management. For example, Healthcare's MR team is implementing a real pull system in production. So far, this has improved on-time delivery by roughly 15 points and increased inventory turns by 0.5x.  
Payables were also benefit as volume increased this quarter. Progress collections were a net $1 billion inflow. This was driven by cash collected from large orders closed in Renewables and strong milestone deliveries, partially offset by Aviation and Power.  
Contract assets, a net $800 million of inflow, this was due to Aviation CSA collections, including quarterly flight hours, annual minimum contract requirements and other items.  
We're still carefully optimizing our investments to drive returns aligned with our long-term objectives. We held CapEx flat sequentially. In fourth quarter, this represents a reduction of more than 50% year-over-year; and for the year, this is down 31%. But importantly, we continued to invest in high-return and strategically important projects.  
For the year, Industrial free cash flow was $600 million. All businesses except Aviation improved cash flows and ended the year stronger than they began. 
Total Power generated positive free cash flow, including Gas Power, as we made faster progress on our fixed cost reductions and working capital improvements despite the negative cash flows at Power portfolio.  
Healthcare delivered an impressive free cash flow of $2.9 billion, while overcoming a $1 billion headwind from the foregone cash flows of BioPharma. This was driven by higher earnings primarily from the pandemic-related demand, cost actions and better working capital. 
Free cash flow at Renewables was negative $600 million, but a $300 million improvement year-over-year despite the impact of the PTC cycle. The focus on inventory management is paying off and we had strong progress from orders and milestone execution. 
Aviation free cash flow turned positive this quarter and was nearly breakeven for the year, enabled by our significant cash actions.  
Stepping back, our trajectory to sustainable cash flow growth was largely on self-help. I'm confident we're focused on the right areas: operational cash drivers that improve working capital, increasing our frequency of our operating rhythms and more linear cash flow generation throughout the quarters and the year. For example, all leaders have action plans to run their businesses leaner with lower inventory levels. In aggregate, our focus and actions to improve working capital are starting to pay off.  
Moving to the segment results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First, on Aviation. GE and CFM departures were down approximately 48% this quarter versus our January '20 baseline due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and further travel restrictions. The commercial aftermarket, which is critical to our recovery, showed some sequential improvement. 
Orders were down 40% year-on-year, but up more than 50% sequentially. Commercial Services was down more than 50% year-over-year with Commercial Engines down 21%.  
It's important to recall that the fourth quarter of '19 included a $1.9 billion order from the aeroderivative joint venture formation. This was just under half of the total orders decline in dollar terms.  
Aviation backlog stands at $260 billion, down 5% year-over-year yet flat sequentially. The largest driver was Commercial Engines as unit shipments and cancellations outpaced orders. 
Cancellations were about 400 units, primarily by 1B this quarter, significant. But for context, our ending LEAP backlog still stands at more than 9,600 engines.  
Revenue decline continued to moderate, down 34% this quarter, while revenue was up nearly 20% sequentially. Commercial Engine revenue was down 47%. As we shipped 309 fewer engines year-over-year. Commercial Services revenue was down nearly 50%. This was driven by lower spare parts sales and shop visits. Charges for long-term service agreements were approximately $150 million this quarter, roughly 1/3 is COVID related. While customer demand remained strong in military, revenue was flat, falling short of our expectations. This was due to continued supply chain challenges, slowing shipments.  
Segment margin, 9.6%. Margin expanded sequentially driven by the cost actions and improved volume in commercial markets despite more than $100 million of continued higher costs due to lower production rates. Decremental margins this quarter were 48%, up sequentially. This was due to continued volume pressure and a tough margin comp of 23% from the fourth quarter in '19.  
So for the year, Aviation margin of 5.6% were supported by significant countermeasures. We realized savings of more than $1 billion of costs and $2 billion of cash actions. This work continues in '21.  
Moving to Healthcare. The team delivered another strong quarter. The health care systems market remained dynamic with elevated demand in COVID-19-related equipment, offset by softer demand for nonpandemic products.  
Regionally, public health care markets such as Europe and China have been stronger than private markets, particularly U.S., India and Latin America. For the second consecutive quarter, global procedure volumes were relatively stable with some regional variability as care providers postponed elective procedures due to COVID-19 spikes.  
With that backdrop, Healthcare orders continued to improve at 1%. In Healthcare Systems, orders grew 1%, Europe was up low double digits and China up low single digits. Services saw consistent growth, up low double digits as we continued to provide critical support to our customers. In PDx, demand continues to recover to prepandemic level and orders were down 1%, but up slightly sequentially. 
Healthcare revenue was up 6%. Healthcare Systems was up 7%. LCS had solid execution delivering a record number of ventilators. Nonpandemic-related volumes were also positive as we converted Imaging backlog and Ultrasound orders this quarter.  
From a regional perspective, we saw strong growth in Europe and China. This year, China revenue was more than $2 billion and up 11% in the quarter alone. U.S. revenue was more than $6.5 billion, up 2% for the year, including the U.S. government ventilator order. PDx revenue, slightly down 1%.  
The segment margin was up 310 basis points this quarter and 190 basis points for the year. While we continued to invest in new products, the team reduced structural costs. Head count was down roughly 1,200 this quarter, and the business maintained tighter control over discretionary costs.  
For the year, revenue was up 4%, with Healthcare Systems up 5% and the margin was 17%. Our team delivered operational improvement and has headroom for more with an eye towards continued margin expansion.  
Turning to Power. Our team continued to make operational progress, particularly in cash generation. 
Starting with the market. Despite global electricity demand and gas-based power generation declining this quarter, GE gas turbine utilization, and therefore, our CSA billings were resilient, increasing mid-single digits driven by our technology and commercial positioning in higher-growth gas-favored regions.  
As anticipated, we saw significant orders improvement. Gas Power equipment order more than tripled with HA wins in Asia and securing 45 to 50 heavy-duty gas turbine shipments in 2021. Service orders grew 7% with double-digit growth in transactional and low single-digit growth in CSA while upgrade decline moderated from earlier in 2020, down single digits. For the year, service orders were down 3%.  
Power Portfolio orders were down 27%, largely driven by steam equipment. As we exit new build coal, this trend of limited steam equipment activity has continued. And as we execute backlog and rightsize the business, we expect this to flow through the financials. We ended with slightly higher backlog as growth in Gas Power more than offset declines in Power Portfolio.  
Gas Power backlog of $66 billion grew roughly $700 million sequentially, driven by strong equipment and transactional services book-to-bill. Revenue was down slightly this quarter. In Gas Power, revenue was down 3% largely driven by Services down 10%. We saw lower discretionary spend on upgrades and narrower scope of outages. For the year, we executed about 90% of our pre-COVID outage plan. Offsetting this was equipment revenue up double digits. 
We shipped 28 gas turbines this quarter, up 7 units year-over-year, for a total of 51 heavy-duty shipments in 2020. And we commissioned 4 gigawatts of power to the grid, including 6 HA units.  
In Power Portfolio, revenue was up 5% primarily driven by steam equipment project execution. Our Power Portfolio performed about 95% of their pre-COVID outage plans.  
Segment margin of 6% was up 40 basis points. A double-digit reduction in Gas Power fixed costs was partially offset by negative revenue mix between equipment and services and some onetime noncash charges, including for specific customer credit event. In Power Portfolio, as Larry mentioned, all 3 businesses generated profit. Power conversion was a particular standout. Better execution led to margin expansion of 10 points year-over-year.  
For the year, Power revenues were down 5%, but the team held margins at 1.5%. We offset pressure from lower Services volume and onetime noncash charges such as an underperforming joint venture for global aeroderivative packaging by reducing head count by roughly 3,300 and decreasing Power fixed costs.  
Turning to Renewables. Our progress continues. This year, Onshore Wind delivered record volumes despite the pandemic. Offshore Wind received full certification for both its 12-and 13-megawatt Haliade-X. In Grid and Hydro, our turnaround showed improved results.  
Starting with the market. Onshore Wind growth was sustained by international demand. Offshore Wind continued to be supported by solid secular growth trends. And we've built a robust Haliade-X pipeline with total commitments of 5.7 gigawatts. 
Orders were up 32% year-over-year, representing the first quarter of growth since the third quarter in '19. This was driven by Onshore Wind with large equipment orders in North America and Offshore Wind with its first Haliade-X order of 95 units from the Dogger Bank wind farm in the U.K. This double-digit order growth brings our backlog to a record high of $30 billion, and importantly, at better margins. We remain focused on underwriting discipline and better project selectivity.  
Revenue was down 7% driven by Onshore Wind. Specifically, new units and repower upgrades were down 27% as our deliveries were more heavily weighted in the prior quarter due to the PTC dynamics. This was partially offset by growth in Offshore Wind and hybrids.  
Segment margin was slightly negative this quarter, though up 290 basis points year-over-year. It was driven by cost productivity, better pricing in Onshore Wind North America and improved project execution. At Grid, profit, while negative, improved significantly driven by our restructuring actions and better project execution.  
For Renewables, revenue was up for the year, and while the segment margin improved, it was still negative.  
Moving to GE Capital on Slide 7. We ended the year with $103 billion of assets, excluding liquidity. Continuing operations generated an adjusted net loss of $24 million this quarter. This was down year-over-year, primarily driven by lower gains at GECAS and EFS and higher taxes, partially offsetting lower EFS impairments and positive marks on the Insurance investment portfolio.  
At GECAS, our team continued to work customer-by-customer through restructuring, and in some cases, repossessions. At year-end, the outstanding deferred balance was approximately $400 million. This was down slightly sequentially, both as a function of limited new deferrals as well as collections.  
Importantly, we've collected around 84% of what we've invoiced to date. And out of a fleet of more than 900 aircraft, we ended the year with 27 aircraft on ground. This quarter, GECAS generated a profit of $120 million. That's down $94 million year-over-year, driven primarily by the disposition of the PK Air in 2019 and market conditions.  
For the year, GECAS generated earnings of $50 million, excluding the second quarter goodwill impairment. 
Equipment lease impairments in the year totaled $542 million and $45 million in the quarter.  
Going forward, we continue to monitor credit risk as further credit deterioration could result in additional airline failures over and above those that we have considered in our reviews.  
Turning to Insurance. The business generated net income of $112 million this quarter. This was largely driven by increases in the unrealized gains in the investment securities portfolio and in mark-to-market adjustments and realized gains.  
As it relates to the pandemic and adjusting for what we believe is timing related. In our LTC block, we continued to see reductions in new claims and higher policy terminations. In our runoff life business, we saw -- we still saw higher claims due to higher mortality. In our structured settlement block, we also saw higher mortality routing in lower claims. Insurance will complete its annual statutory cash flow test in the first quarter of '21.  
As expected, GE provided a capital contribution to GE Capital of $2 billion, in line with the required annual insurance statutory funding for 2020. As we said in the third quarter, we expect an additional contribution from GE to GE Capital in '21 to meet its existing insurance statutory funding requirements of approximately $2 billion. In light of the uncertain environment, further 2021 contributions depend on GE Capital's performance, including GECAS operations and the insurance CFT results.  
Shifting to corporate. Our focus on decentralization continues. We're driving more accountability to the segments and continue to resize the core in favor of the business units. This quarter, adjusted corporate costs were $443 million, down 23% year-over-year. Functional costs and operations improved as we saw further reduced head count, which was down 13% for the year. 
GE Digital saw significant traction on profit and cash flow as the business improved operations and optimized its cost structure.  
Moving to Slide 8. We continued to improve our financial position despite the uncertain external environment. We ended the year with about $37 billion of total cash, more than $23 billion at GE and $13 billion at GE Capital. We also maintained $20 billion of credit lines. And through a series of actions this year, we reduced near-term liquidity needs through 2024 by $10.5 billion.  
We also continued to enhance our cash management operations, targeting more linear cash flow, lower factoring and less restricted cash. As a result, we reduced intra-quarter borrowings by $3.6 billion in 2020 or approximately 75% less year-over-year.  
Expanding on cash flow linearity. One focus area for our businesses has been improving the end-to-end cycle of order fulfillment, billing and collections. In our Healthcare System equipment business, for example, standard work is helping us level load the number of deliveries from the third month in the quarter to earlier in the quarter, smoothing out deliveries and collections. This is also reducing inventory and improving factory productivity. These types of operational improvements have reduced our industrial cash needs to below $13 billion on a go-forward basis. And this creates greater capacity to delever the company. However, we'll continue to hold elevated cash levels through this period of uncertainty.  
Turning to debt reduction. We made strong progress in 2020, reducing external debt by $16 billion, and our Industrial net debt ended at $32 billion, down $16 billion in '20 and down $23 billion from '19.  
We also continued to derisk and actively manage our pension. In 2020, we decreased our pension deficit by $2.3 billion. The combination of strong asset returns at 17.6% and recent actions, such as the $2.5 billion pension prefunding, more than offset the impact of low interest rates. Based on our current assumptions, we won't need to make contributions through 2023 to the GE Pension plan. 
In terms of leverage levels. Industrial ended with a 5.9x debt-to-EBITDA ratio due to lower EBITDA, reflecting pandemic-related pressure. We remain committed to achieving our Industrial leverage target of 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA over time. 
At GE Capital, we ended 2020 with a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.4% and we expect to remain below our 4x debt-to-equity target. 
In closing, our team has made meaningful progress this year. I'm encouraged by the results we're seeing from the many, many changes underway. We'll continue to build on this momentum in 2021.  
Now Larry, back to you."

But today, we'll share an overview for the total company in 2021. Moving to Sl",676,"Carolina, thank you. Turning to page to 2021. We're planning to provide a full outlook for the company, including detailed segment information during our March investor call. But today, we'll share an overview for the total company in 2021. 
Moving to Slide 9. We're expecting organic growth in the low single-digit range for Industrial revenue, organic expansion of 250-plus basis points for Industrial operating margin, $0.15 to $0.25 for adjusted EPS and a range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion for Industrial free cash flow. 
Of course, there are a number of key assumptions underpinning our plan for the year. First is the lost cash and earnings from dispositions, largely BioPharma, which, again, generated nearly $300 million in cash and $400 million in profit in the first quarter of '20 and the continued reduction of Baker Hughes dividends, which represented more than $250 million of cash flow in 2020. 
Second, on Aviation, where the impact of COVID has been most acutely felt and our level of uncertainty is still the greatest. Starting with the market, our plan assumes departures remain close to fourth quarter levels in the first quarter, and we begin to see the commercial aviation market recover in the second half. That said, we fully acknowledge the pace of the recovery remains dependent on containing the spread of the virus, effective inoculation programs and government's collaboration to encourage travel. 
At GE Aviation, we continue to expect the engine aftermarket recovery to lag departure trends across regions and fleets, particularly around quarantine requirements. And given that we generate a significant portion of our cash in Commercial Services, the recovery of the aftermarket remains critical. 
So our full year plan assumes Aviation revenue is flat to up year-over-year. And as a reminder, since the full effect of the virus was not felt until late in the first quarter of last year, we will be lapping a tough comp. 
Looking across our other segments. In Power, we anticipate continued progress at Gas Power with some offset in Power Portfolio as we exit new build coal. Overall, we expect equipment revenue will be down, driven by our narrower scope with less turnkey volume. We're also planning for growth in our higher-margin Services revenue. 
In Renewables, we're focused on improving operational execution and driving structural cost out. This will help us expand margins and improve cash. 
At Healthcare, we expect continued strength in Healthcare Systems as our new products and commercial efforts drive growth and PDx to recover. While we expect cash conversion to remain solid, it will be lower than 2020. 
And at Capital, we expect earnings to be better. 
At each business, we're further accelerating cash performance and cost management with restructuring remaining elevated. 
So in aggregate, we have a positive trajectory going into 2021 despite areas of volatility and the continued challenges in Aviation. We're focused on delivering on our commitments, and I'm confident that our continued efforts will build a stronger and more focused GE. 
Turning to Slide 10. As we all know, 2020 was a year like none other. I'm truly proud of the GE team and their remarkable resilience. I hope you can see that in the face of great uncertainty, we continue to strengthen our businesses and deliver for our customers. And as we move through the second half, our businesses had a strong free cash flow finish to what was a challenging year.  Momentum is growing across our businesses. We've continued to evolve our culture by embracing lean while preserving the strengths that have defined GE throughout its history. 
And I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, how we will continue to lead the energy transition, help our customers deliver precision health and define the future of flight. 
As our multiyear transformation accelerates, we'll unlock upside potential with better cash generation, profit and growth. And ultimately, we expect that our Industrial businesses over time should generate high single-digit free cash flow margins while rising to the challenge of building a world that works. 
With that, Steve, let's go to questions."

And the most significant is really the restructuring recast in moving responsibility for not only the sort of execution, but also the cost as well as the benefit to the businesses. So I would say that's the biggest and most important one. 
And also, when we're talking about the working capital definition and the broadening working capital definition, that is really to more align with how we really run the business internally and operationally to drive improvements in working capital to show that also in the external reporting, and the classified balance sheet really goes with that.

And then I would say you have cash earnings, it's about 1/3, that gets you to the midpoint of our range with all the businesses planning for structural cost out, and here, we have both the normal course of strengthening the business, that's the business around, but also the carryover from the COVID 2020 actions.

The segment will be flat, but it really masks 2 underlying dynamics, right? You're spot on with respect to the improvement at Gas Power, I don't think we could be more pleased with the progress the team is making there. Clearly, a competitive market, no question. 
But in terms of controlling what we can control, both, again, the better underwriting up-front with respect to equipment, the continued market acceptance of the HA, all of that, I think, is in our favor. 
Services has been a challenge. We've talked about that, I think, through the course of 2020. A little bit of light there relative to the order book in the fourth quarter. But I think we really know the onus is on us to continue to drive better performance in all aspects of the Service portfolio there, be it CSA's transaction and upgrades. Upgrades was particularly pressured for us in '20. We know CSA is a function of utilization a little bit better. 
So I think when you put all of that commercial and operational activity on top of the restructuring where we've taken $1 billion of cost out at Gas Power, you get the early arrival of that positive free cash performance in '20 as opposed to '21. And we really move from here with a team that I think has proven that we can control our controllable and deliver better results with this book of business. 
I think when you talk about Power portfolio, you put your finger on Steam, we're going to be restructuring as we exit coal -- new build coal. That is the significant undertaking. It is early in that effort, and that will be a cash pull on us in '21 and probably to a lesser degree in '22 as we execute on that. 
So when you put it all together, as you saw on the slide in the appendix, it will be roughly flat in '21. We'll be looking to drive Gas as best we can, but we need to see the new coal exit through and we'll do that as thoroughly and as thoughtfully as we can."

So there is still significant room to improve our earnings and then also the structural process improvements that we are driving through the business on the working capital. So we see a healthy cash conversion. But will take a little bit longer than next year."

I mean the way we look at retirements in '20 just interestingly compared to '19, we actually saw fewer aircraft retire last year than we did the year before. But I think we're going to see that uptick in '21 in all likelihood",417,"Andrew, you're exactly right. I mean the way we look at retirements in '20 just interestingly compared to '19, we actually saw fewer aircraft retire last year than we did the year before. But I think we're going to see that uptick in '21 in all likelihood here in the back half as volumes return and the deliveries at both of the major airframers pick up. 
So we're assuming that we will see that retirement transition, and at the same time, while there's been a little bit of a bid-ask spread with respect to departing out some of those planes, we're anticipating that we'll see a little bit more of that USM effect as we get into the second half at a time when we should see a return to volume activity. I think people need to appreciate that USM cuts both ways for us. We're -- we've been a major user of USM given the nature of our CSA obligations over time. 
So it will take a little while, I think, for that market to begin to really kick in. There is a lag, of course, from the time a plane is retired to the time that we would see it in the USM market. But I think as we look out over the next several years, again, not trying today to pin a particular time in which we see a return to normal volume activities, from our perspective, we anticipate deliveries to outpace retirements and that will be a net effect positive for us at Aviation. 
The other dynamic worth noting there, of course, is when we look at the dynamics for our fleet today, when we highlight the fact we've got a very young fleet, we're really -- what we really mean by that is we've got a little over half of the CFM56-5B and -7B fleet, they haven't seen their first shop visit, right? So they're still early in their life cycle, 3/4 of that same fleet have yet to see their second shop visit. So they'll typically see 3 during the course of a normal useful life. Our major economics happen in and around the first and second. 
So as these planes come back online, that green time is used. Demand puts additional pressures on the fleet that -- those are the catalysts that we're really watching for relative to the beginning of the recovery and the return to, let's just say, '19 levels in our commercial aftermarket business there in Aviation."

Well, there are a couple of things in place, Scott, and I'd rather talk about that internally before we talk about it externally. But in effect, what you've seen in the last couple of years really is not only the reduction of the core through absolute reductions, but also the movement of a number of the traditional corporate functions that had been at the center in some form out into the businesses. 
There is still a fair bit of activity. You're referencing there specifically the Global Research Center where we have a shared facility. That's really not part in a major way of that corporate net number that you see there, right? The businesses are paying their way by and large in that regard. 
Also, keep in mind, we've got a number of P&Ls in what we call corporate, principally the Digital business, our $1 billion software business. Some of those businesses are more independent than -- of the portfolio. Others are operationally linked. 
So we'll continue to work to improve those businesses. And if there are situations where they can work more closely or better with the businesses under a different roof, we'll do that. But I think we'll continue to look for opportunities, but they will be, on balance, more modest in scale and scope than what you've seen in the last couple of years."

Well, Deane, it's probably most helpful to just frame kind of what we did and where we are, right? We didn't bring that activity level down to 0. We tried to resize it in a way that embraced this harsh, unfortunate near-term reality, but gave us a little bit of room just because -- back to Andrew's question, a number of dynamics that are hard to know in the short term with absolute certainty, be it the retirement dynamic, how fleets are going to manage green time just even in the short term, how folks are going to flex around the COVID effects as we saw in July and August and then in the other direction here in the first quarter. 
So as an operational matter, I think what John, Russell and the team are prepared for is a number of scenarios where when we see that recovery, we'll leverage some of the, if you will, the excess cost that is still there because again, we didn't take it to the bone. But also, we have -- we've laid in place plans that will give us an opportunity to ramp back effectively from a safety, from a quality, from an on-time delivery perspective, but also to have the right cost structure along the way. But we will be dealing with limits, right, in terms of our shop visit capacity in a particular window. 
And then that's part of the conversation we're already having with customers as they begin to think about the second half of '21. They want to make sure that they have their fleet in tiptop ready-to-go condition. So a lot that we're working through there. 
Clearly, our supply chain has been through a roller coaster right there along with us. I mean it was a year ago -- I mean, literally, right now, when we're talking about not only continued volume ramps, but a new introduction clearly at Boeing with the MAX and then literally weeks later we're talking about slamming on the brakes. 
Part of what you saw in the fourth quarter is a little bit better inventory performance because the lead times and the cycle times in Aviation tend to be longer than they are in some of the other businesses. But we are working as closely as we can with the supply base to help them do what we're doing and that is work through the near term here where we have these volume pressures, but also be ready for, again, a number of scenarios by which we see a return toward more normal volumes."

There's a bit of Renewables in the range there as well. 
But I think what we've seen through the course of 2020 is that, fortunately, when all was said and done, our Power businesses were able to work their way through the pressure and the uncertainty. We had a number of orders at Renewables that came in at the end of the year, and we didn't know they were going to be there until they were there, and fortunately, they were. But clearly, this will be a year of climate broadly and that will be a good thing for our Renewables business. 
And I think Healthcare, while we won't convert at the exceptionally high levels the team did and credit to them in the back half of last year, Healthcare, I think we've got good line of sight on. 
So when you look at that range, I think the bulk of it, again, is really a function of Aviation. I like the way we're executing, we can always do better.

Despite continued challenges in Aviation and a still difficult comparison to last year, the first quarter marked a solid start to 2021. I'm confident this sets us up well to deliver on our '21 commitments, and profitable growth for the long term. 
Looking at the first quarter numbers on Slide 2. Orders were down 8% organically, primarily driven by Aviation Services and Power Equipment. It was partially offset by continued strength in Healthcare and Renewables as well as growth in Power Services. 
We're seeing better performance in our shorter-cycle service businesses. Ex Aviation, service orders were up 6% organically in the quarter. Our backlog stands at $833 billion and remains a strength, with approximately 80% geared towards services, where we have higher margins. 
Industrial revenue was down 10% organically. Services continued to be a main focus as they were down 14%. While services may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, especially as we've seen during the pandemic, we still expect growth in services this year. 
Ex Aviation, Industrial revenue was up 1% organically. Adjusted Industrial margin was 5.1%, up 110 basis points organically. Notably, we saw organic expansion year-over-year, with 3 of our 4 businesses improving as our cost actions 2020 continue to take hold. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.03, with the majority of businesses improving, offsetting Aviation. Carolina will provide more color shortly. 
Industrial free cash flow was a negative $845 million. Encouragingly, this was up $1.7 billion ex BioPharma, driven by better earnings and working capital. 
In all, we're seeing continued progress, especially on margins and cash flow, and we believe these improvements are sustainable. 
As we look to the second quarter, we expect industrial free cash flow growth of similar magnitude to what we saw this quarter. 
And despite ongoing volatility, as the world fights through the pandemic, the guidance we provided a month ago remains unchanged. 
Turning to Slide 3. There's a lot we're doing day in and day out to build momentum across GE. During the last month, we agreed to combine GECAS with AerCap, marking a significant catalyst in our journey to focus GE on its core 4 Industrial businesses: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, Healthcare. And each business is critical to the global markets they serve. This transaction enables us to further strengthen the company for the long term, in closing, bringing our total debt reduction to more than $70 billion over the last 3 years, while drastically simplifying GE in a number of ways, including our financial reporting. 
All the while, we've been fortifying GE's foundation, this starts first with our resilient and passionate team. They have been instrumental in driving our LEAN transformation forward, and I'm grateful for their service. As we scale LEAN across the company, we're working to deliver safety, quality, delivery and cost improvements as well as high-quality growth. 
One recent example comes from Digital Services and Renewables. We heard from our customers that our cycle times and responsiveness needed improvement. A LEAN Kaizen event revealed multiple systems and inconsistent processes in the way. Through value stream mapping, we developed standard work to decrease cycle time by 70%, enabling us to bid for and win more business. This has already led to more than $70 million of backlog growth. Opportunities like these for high-impact deployment of LEAN abound throughout our company. 
We're coupling LEAN with a significant decentralization effort. This means managing not just the 4 segments we report, but the nearly 30 businesses underneath them, where the work [indiscernible] is done. This combination of LEAN and decentralization is maximizing value for our customers while increasing accountability at the business level. And even though it's still early in our journey, we're seeing tangible operational and financial results. 
For example, at a recent operating review with Power Conversion, I was thrilled to see how the team's strategy has come together, optimizing their operations through LEAN and redefining their market focus. This has led to double-digit order growth in the quarter and 3 consecutive quarters of organic margin expansion. 
This stronger foundation sets us up to spend more time playing offense. Our first priority is investment to drive organic growth efforts. We're improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have today. And at the same time, we're strengthening our offerings with new product introductions. 
As you may have seen recently, we've had some major wins across the portfolio. In Renewables, we were selected to supply more than 530 turbines to North Central Wind Energy Facilities in Oklahoma, marking the largest Onshore Wind project in GE's history. 
At Aviation, CFM secured LEAP engine and service agreements from Southwest Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines to power 100 MAX and 35 A320neo aircraft. 
Meanwhile, in Healthcare, we've launched new ultrasound solutions, the Vscan and Venue, the industry's first AI offering for cardiac imaging. These innovations are supporting clinicians who need fast, reliable insights at the point of care now more than ever. 
And while we're continuing to invest in technology and innovation to serve our customers and to lead our markets into the future, fortifying our competitive position globally is of paramount importance. Over time, we will look to augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments that accelerate the implementation of our strategy and create real value for customers and investors alike. 
So as we think about what we're playing for, it is the long term, building a world that works. At GE, our technology and expertise across critical markets enable us to lead along with our customers in creating a more sustainable future. 
Our Renewables and Power businesses sit at the heart of the energy transition. Our opportunities were on full display last week during Earth Week. 
In Renewables, we've held the #1 position in North America onshore wind 2 years running, and this is the fastest-growing source of new power generation capacity. 
At Gas Power, we're playing a vital complementary role in decarbonizing at scale as customers shift from coal to gas. And as we modernize the Power Grid with digital and automation solutions, we have an opportunity to have an even bigger impact. 
In Healthcare, we're at the forefront of the Precision Health Revolution. We have a leading position in many imaging modalities, and we're growing our digital and AI capabilities, which will enhance the personalization of diagnostics and therapeutics. Take an area like cancer screening, our solutions are improving patient outcomes, helping clinicians rule out false positives and streamlining workflows for providers and payers alike. 
And as we look to the future of flight, no business is better positioned than our Aviation business. In the near term, our focus is getting people back into the air safely. And as the market recovers from COVID, we're well placed with the largest and youngest engine platform, with more than 37,000 Commercial Engines and more than 60% of our fleet that has not yet had a second shop visit. Underscoring the value of our platform will generate for decades to come. 
As we tackle the world's most complex challenges, we're also passionate about delivering for our customers across our vast global installed base. It's our services that keep us close to our customers day in, day out and create a significant source of recurring revenue. By staying true to our purpose and our customers, we'll unlock further upside potential in growth, profit and cash generation, leading to high single-digit free cash flow margins over the next few years. 
Stepping back, we're on a positive trajectory in 2021 and beyond. We're focused on delivering on our commitments, and I'm confident that our continued efforts will build a stronger and more focused GE. 
With that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter."

As you mentioned, our decentralization effort continues. And our finance team is playing a critical role. We're developing and supporting a more granular operating view of our nearly 30 P&Ls and we're building LEAN skills to ensure the processes we're setting up are truly lean and automated. 
We're also deepening our focus on cash and strengthening our operational muscles. We're especially seeing this with billings and collections. 
And we're really driving services growth, a key component to unlocking improved profitability. For example, as we execute contracts, we're more focused on cost productivity and standard work. I'm confident this improved discipline will translate into improved results. 
Turning to Slide 4. Before we dive into the results, 2 items. 
First, with the announcement of AerCap and GECAS combination, GECAS has moved to discontinued operations. As a result, we booked a day 1 loss on sale on our financials have been recast to reflect this transfer, with depreciations ceasing on the portfolio. Going forward, any changes to earnings associated with GECAS in discops will primarily be driven by the AerCap stock price. 
Second, we're planning to transition our quarterly backlog disclosures to our remaining performance obligation basis, or RPO, starting in the second quarter. This change will simplify and streamline our reporting, further aligning our key metrics to those commonly used across our sectors and reducing unnecessary extra work. 
Now let me provide some color on the quarter on an organic basis. 
Looking at the top line. Recall that our businesses only partially felt the impact of the pandemic in the first quarter of '20. 
Aviation continues to be challenged, managing through market volatility, which has weighed on our overall performance. 
Industrial revenue was down 10% this quarter, largely driven by services. However, ex Aviation revenue was up 1%. We're focusing on improved services growth across the portfolio. 
Healthcare equipment and services continue to be a strength. We saw increased demand as global procedure volumes recovered to pre-pandemic levels. 
While Power declined and Renewables was roughly flat, these were largely driven by our increased focus on profitable growth. Examples include reducing turnkey scope in Gas Power, exiting new coal in Power Portfolio and increasing project selectivity in Renewables. 
Next, Industrial margins expanded 110 basis points, with Power, Renewables and Healthcare all contributing. 
Ex Aviation, margins expanded 450 basis points. 
A couple of standouts. One, Gas Power services with double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion, and this was supported by better performance in our transactional and CSA portfolios. And two, Healthcare margin expansion. This was driven by better volume and cost productivity due to our LEAN efforts and expense management. 
We also continue to see sustainable benefits from our cost actions, including reduced headcount of roughly 23,000 year-over-year. We are on track to realize the incremental $1 billion of benefits in 2021. 
Finally, adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter. This reflects $0.04 of improvement year-over-year, ex BioPharma, driven in roughly equal parts by Industrial and Capital performance. 
As we walk from continuing to adjusted EPS, we need to exclude the positive [ Baker ] mark as well as the negative impact of significant higher cost restructuring programs and nonoperating expenses, primarily pension. Overall, we're encouraged by our Industrial margin improvement. 
Moving to cash. Industrial free cash flow was negative $845 million, a use of cash and a decline from the fourth quarter, which we expect seasonally, consistent with what we shared earlier in the quarter. However, we saw significant progress across a number of our businesses with cash flow up $1.4 billion year-over-year and, ex BioPharma, up $1.7 billion, driven by earnings and working capital improvement. 
Looking at earnings, they were down year-over-year on a reported basis. However, as I mentioned earlier, earnings were up, excluding the impact of BioPharma and Baker, with adjusted Industrial organic profit up 18%. 
Moving to working capital. This was a use of $900 million this quarter. We're seeing progress across the board, with payables and inventories contributing the most of the improvement. 
Looking at the flows within the quarter. Receivables were sourced from higher seasonal collections and daily management, while we also reduced short-term factoring, which negatively impacted our free cash flow by $800 million. Our focus on stronger billings and collections continued, with 2 days of DSO improvement. For example, in Aviation Services, within our CSA portfolio, we're using value stream mapping and daily management and have improved billing timeliness by 15%. 
Inventory was a use of cash of $700 million. This was largely driven by Renewables, as expected, to support second half volume. Inventory remains a key focus area for all leaders. 
Take our Healthcare business, where we're improving by 0.5 turn year-over-year. When I recently visited our team in Life care Solutions, they showed me how their Hoshin Kanri project reduced inventory by more than 5% already this quarter while delivering cost savings. We're continuously sharing these learnings across GE to inspire and accelerate further improvement. 
Payables was a use of $400 million. We saw seasonally lower volume in Power and Aviation. There was a significant improvement year-over-year. Progress was also a use of $400 million as deliveries outpaced collections. Contract assets was flat as deliveries offset collections. 
So working capital, without the $800 million impact of the factoring reduction, would have been close to flat this quarter. And year-over-year, working capital flow was $1.6 billion better. Overall, a significant improvement. 
We're carefully optimizing our capital investments to drive long-term growth. CapEx spend was up 18% sequentially, yet down 37% year-over-year. We've increased rigor in our investments by focusing on high-return and strategically differentiated technologies, including the Haliade-X in Renewables and PDx capacity expansion in Healthcare. 
In all, our efforts to improve working capital are taking hold and with additional opportunities near term. Over time, sustainable free cash flow generation will mainly come from profitable organic growth, combined with higher margins and longer-term efficient capital deployment. 
Turning to liquidity and leverage on Slide 6. We've continued to solidify our financial position. This quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $4 billion. Our liquidity is strong, and we have ample additional liquidity sources for future deleveraging actions. This includes proceeds from the GECAS transaction, positive cash flow and monetizing our remaining stakes in Baker and AerCap. Post transaction close, we expect to reduce debt significantly, bringing our total reduction to more than $70 billion since the end of 2018. 
Additionally, we do not anticipate any further funding requirement for the GE pension plan in the foreseeable future. And by that, I mean the end of the decade. This is due to our $2.5 billion pre-funding in 2020, our investment portfolio performance as well as the recently enacted American Rescue Plan Act. 
Since the beginning of 2019, we reduced our factoring balance by $8 billion, bringing it down to about $6 billion at quarter end. 
Effective April 1, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs. As I talked about our outlook, we'll exclude the related cash flow impact going forward, which we expect to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. The majority of this will be felt in the second quarter. 
Combining this with $3.5 billion to $4 billion with the $800 million reported cash impact in the first quarter from the normal course activity gets you to the $4 billion to $5 billion range of cash that we described last month. 
If you apply the same logic and cancel out the factoring effect from our discontinued programs in 2020, after re baselining for BioPharma and COVID-related volume in Healthcare, you get to rebase line free cash flow of about positive $2.4 billion in 2020. 
Our 2021 reported free cash flow range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion includes the impact of the negative $800 million factoring in the first quarter. Excluding the full year impact from factoring, the majority of our cash flow improvement in 2021 comes from earnings. 
As we reduce our reliance on factoring, we will continue to focus with further improvement on our core billings and collections capabilities, leading to better cash performance over time. And there is no change to our view from outlook, where the improvement is driven by our underlying operating performance. 
Due to us reducing factoring as well as better managing working capital and cash, our [indiscernible] quarterly cash needs have decreased more than $4 billion in a year, a significant improvement. 
[indiscernible] we expect to achieve net debt-to-EBITDA of less than 2.5x over the next few years and maintain a strong investment-grade rating. 
Moving to our business results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. 
First, on Power. Our Gas Power and Power Portfolio teams continue to make progress. We're especially encouraged by the growth in Gas Power services. Overall, Power remains on track to deliver their financial commitments for the year. 
Looking at the market, global electricity demand grew 3% this quarter, driving GE gas turbine utilization and CSA billings up high single digits. 
Orders declined 12% in the quarter. At Gas power, equipment orders were down 50%, driven by the non-repeat of a large turnkey order. However, we booked 18 turbines, up 9. And notably, service orders were up 11% with contractual and transactional growth. This was driven by higher outages and stronger commercial performance compared to the pandemic-related disruptions last year. 
At Power Portfolio, orders were down 16% as we expected, driven by our planned exit of the newbuild coal business at [indiscernible]. This was partially offset by double-digit growth at Power Conversion. Backlog of $78 billion decreased year-over-year, largely driven by timing of equipment orders and contractual service commitments. Gas Power accounts for roughly 80% of this backlog. 
Revenue was down. Gas Power was down 2%. This was driven by equipment, down 25%. We had significantly lower turnkey scope project, as anticipated, while at the same time, we shipped more heavy-duty gas turbines this quarter, up 6. And we commissioned 3.6 gigawatts of power to the Grid, including 3 HA units. 
As you heard [indiscernible] outlook, we've been more selective on turnkey projects and we're transitioning to more equipment projects, which is better risk return equation over time. We saw meaningful improvement in services revenue, up 13%, due to strong transactional backlog execution and higher outages. 
Our Portfolio revenue was down 9%, driven by [indiscernible]. Offsetting this, Power Conversion and Nuclear were both up. 
Segment margin was negative, but improving by 110 basis points. Gas Power margin was positive and expanded significantly. This was largely driven by positive mix from higher-margin services volume and reducing fixed costs. Our Portfolio margin contracted, but largely driven by Steam project execution and unfavorable legacy project arbitration resolutions. 
We're progressing through our planned exit of new build coal and concluded our European Works Council consultations this quarter. 
Both Power Conversion and Nuclear expanded margins, operational improvements continued. 
Turning to Renewables. We're playing a leadership role in the energy transition while building a profitable growth business for GE. We continue to improve operational execution and scale Offshore Wind and we remain on track for our full year commitment. 
Starting with the market. In Onshore Wind, we're expecting the U.S. market to slightly decrease this year, while robust growth continues abroad. 
In Offshore Wind, the strong market trends are expected to continue through the decade. And broadly speaking, Grid is positioned to gain momentum as the energy transition accelerates and government stimulus increases. 
Now on the quarter. Orders grew double digits in Onshore, Offshore and Grid solutions, all up. Grid was the biggest driver following a large HVDC system order. Onshore Wind Services, including more than 120 repower units, increased significantly. Offshore Wind is building momentum, with more Haliade-X orders expected in the second half. 
Revenue was flat, with equipment revenues growth up high single digits, offset by a significant decline in services. In Onshore Wind, equipment was higher with more than 760 units delivered, while services were down as we did not deliver any repower upgrades. However, digital services were up significantly, excluding repower. Offshore wind growth was driven by continued execution on EDF 6-megawatt PBG project in France. Grid declined due to deal selectivity and commercial execution. 
Segment margin, while negative, improved by 310 basis points. In Onshore Wind, margin improved significantly, driven by cost productivity and execution, partly offset by product mix. In Grid, cost-out more than offset incremental restructuring expenses. 
Next, on Aviation. Our team continues to position the business for the rebound, despite current market challenges. As the Aviation end market recovers, which we believe will begin in the second half, we expect to deliver on our '21 outlook: revenue growth, margin expansion and better cash generation. 
GE CFM were down 40% year-over-year, in line with our guide from outlook. We're encouraged that March departure levels improved significantly versus January and February. But regional pressures continue, especially in Europe and Asia, ex China. 
Orders were down more than 25%, with Commercial Services down more than 40%, but some improvement sequentially. And Commercial Engines, down less than 10%, supported by multiple large orders, including 1 for 22 GE9X engines. 
The Aviation backlog stands at about $260 billion, down slightly sequentially. The largest drivers were Commercial Engines and Services, with approximately 400 LEAP-1B cancellations. For context, our LEAP unit backlog stands at more than 9,200 engines. 
The revenue decline was driven by Commercial Engines, down double digits, and Commercial Services down 40%. Commercial services saw lower spare parts sales and lower shop visits. Although dynamics varied by engine and region, shop visits were broadly in line with our guided outlook. In military, revenue was flat due to favorable equipment mix despite 50 lower unit shipments. Overall, engine deliveries remain pressured, primarily in rotorcraft, and our team continues to address these supply chain challenges. 
Segment margin contracted to approximately 13%, primarily driven by Commercial Services. However, decrementals improved to 19%, and margin expanded sequentially as our cost actions continue to take hold. We're on track to realize the incremental $0.5 billion benefits in 2021. 
Moving to Healthcare. We're excited about the progress we're seeing. The team's strong performance shows how implementing LEAN and decentralization is driving real results. Overall, market fundamentals are also improving. For the third consecutive quarter, global procedures volumes were up double digits. Demand for non-pandemic products was solid as government stimulus drove strong order growth in China, India and Japan. 
Meanwhile, demand for pandemic-related products began to normalize. We're seeing elective procedures return to pre-pandemic levels, but there is still much for us to do to support our customers. Many are running at reduced capacity and have patients waiting longer than usual for screenings, treatments and procedures. 
With that backdrop, Healthcare orders continue to improve. Healthcare Systems orders were up 5% with equipment and services growth. Imaging and Ultrasound improved double digits, both year-over-year and compared to the first quarter '19. And CT grew across all regions, while Life Care Solution orders were down as pandemic-related demand softened. 
PDx demand continued to recover, with orders up 7%, driven by CT screening for cardiac disease and routine oncology and neurology screenings returning to pre-pandemic levels. 
Healthcare revenue was also up. Healthcare Systems, up 7% across businesses. Two highlights: Ultrasound demand was high, with growth across most regions and all product lines. And Life Care Solutions grew again this quarter. PDx revenue was up 7% with elective procedures returning to pre-pandemic level. 
Segment margins expanded an impressive 270 basis points driven by profitable growth and continued cost reduction, while we still invest for growth, especially in Imaging, Ultrasound and LCS. 
Moving to Slide 8. At Capital, adjusted continuing operations generated a net loss which was half of last year's loss. This was primarily driven by insurance and tax, partially offset by lower EFS gains. 
At insurance, we continue to see a positive claims trend and strong investment results versus last year when we had pandemic-related marks and impairments as well. 
GE Capital assets, excluding cash, were down almost $6 billion sequentially, driven by the GECAS transaction and lower factoring. 
Within discontinued op, two to call out. GECAS had a net loss of $2.6 billion, which includes the loss on sale of $2.8 billion from the aircraft transaction, offset by about $200 million of earnings. We see collections progress on previously granted deferrals, and we ended the quarter with 20 aircraft on ground. We may see levels fluctuate throughout 2021 due to the continued market volatility. 
We've previously noted ongoing litigation related to our run-off Polish mortgage portfolio. This quarter, we recorded charges of approximately $300 million. This is based on the rising number of borrower losses filed and expected to be filed in the future as well as higher discount rates. We expect upcoming decisions of the European Court of Justice and the Polish Supreme Court to have an impact on the litigation landscape for Polish banks, including our run-off Polish mortgage business. 
Moving to Corporate. We remain focused on leaner processes and decentralization. If I compare the adjusted corporate costs with when I started a year ago, we are down almost 50%, most notably here are our functional costs and operations, which improved over 40% and digital, focusing on driving growth and improved profitability with a strong performance from Grid software this quarter. 
Taking a step back, Larry and I recognize the positive sustainable impact that LEAN will create at GE. We are picking up the pace. And while it's still early, we're building momentum with measurable impact this quarter, as you've seen. This is becoming more visible at Corporate as well. We've significantly transformed how we operate, moving more work to the businesses and further streamlining the remaining corporate functions. And we have an increased focus on strategy, capital allocation, research, talent and governance. 
Now Larry, back to you."

Thanks to our team, we're making measurable and sustainable progress, and we're set up well to deliver on our 2021 commitments that we shared with you in March. 
Since joining GE, one of my top priorities has been instilling greater focus throughout the organization. The GECAS transaction announced last month marks an important step forward in making GE a more focused, simpler and stronger industrial company [indiscernible] even better positioned to serve the needs of our customers and the world with leading technologies and strong service capabilities across our installed base. 
As we are building a world that works, we're also creating a more sustainable future, leading in the energy transition, driving more integrated and personalized healthcare and enabling smarter and more efficient flight. 
I hope the business examples we've shared today helped convey the real operational and cultural changes underway at GE. There are many steps, big and small, happening across our company right now that make me excited about the future.

So you talked more and more about playing offense and playing for the long term here. If I bring this back to free cash flow, I know that you -- you kind of guide to 2023 at high single-digit free cash flow margins, but you removed a lot of headwinds. Carolina mentioned that the pension headwind is gone potentially now to the end of the decade. The factoring headwind, I think, even if you look at the near-term here, the 4 to 5 guide that you all reflected, I think, the near-term impact is probably $800 million less. So de facto, I think you kind of implicitly increase your -- your cash flow guide today, unless I'm misinterpreting that. But if I take it more to the long term, right, and I look at sort of these removed headwinds, and  peers in a lot of your business being significantly above that high single-digit free cash flow margin, how do you think about the portfolio and that target in the long term?"

Let me just level set. I think what we're trying to do today is reiterate that what we said, what, a month ago or so, at the GECAS announcement, with respect to our outlook for this year in terms of free cash potential,",477,"Markus, a couple of comments there. Let me just level set. I think what we're trying to do today is reiterate that what we said, what, a month ago or so, at the GECAS announcement, with respect to our outlook for this year in terms of free cash potential, the 2.5 to 4.5, that's intact, right? So no intention to change that. 
As Carolina highlighted, we did have $800 million of factoring discontinuation pressure in the first quarter that we're not adjusting for, but we do want to flag it for you because it's akin to what we will adjust for more formally the rest of the year now that we have formally discontinued the factoring program. 
But I think that as you ask about the longer term, there's no question that we feel confident today about our potential to deliver on that high single-digit free cash flow margin in '23 or hopefully shortly thereafter, right? And we're really talking about, you take the midpoint of that, call it 8% on, let's say, the '19 revenue base, somewhere in the $85 billion to $90 billion range, that gets us to a $7 billion free cash number. 
I think given the way we are running the businesses better today, at least compared to what I saw when I walked in 2.5 years ago, the opportunities I think we have clearly framed in front of us around the energy transition, around precision health around the future of flight. 
And as you highlight, as Carolina noted, a number of headwinds will dissipate over time, be it some of the restructuring and power, be it pension. I mean what terrific news that is for us. In addition to the interest step down and the like. 
So there's a lot of things that we're working on, that we're encouraged by. There are a number of things that are going to dissipate over time. And you put all that together, well, we've got plenty of work to do. So there's no declaration of victory here. I think we're just trying to underscore our continued confidence that we can deliver on those numbers over time. 
Clearly, we need Aviation to come back. I think we're encouraged by a number of the signs there. The U.S., clearly coming back. China, above where they were a year ago, let alone '19, at this point. So that's encouraging. But certainly, other parts of the world, as you well know, are still fighting this horrible pandemic. That creates a little bit of the volatility that we referred to. But all in, we continue to believe the Aviation recovery is more a matter of when, not if. And again, with that 37,000 strong narrow-body fleet out there, the youngest in the industry, we think we're well positioned to serve and to deliver results for our investors as that occurs."

I'm not sure I would buy into your premise that we've got the visibility that you're suggesting that we do. I think the range that we have today in line, obviously, with the range that we've shared since early in the year, captures what we know and what we don't know. Clearly, we're waiting for Aviation to begin to snap back. That is an important swing factor for us, and I think we've been consistent talking about that. I don't think there's much of a historic whole precedent in that business given the way the pandemic is ravaging various parts of the world and, in turn, both leisure and business travel. 
Clearly, we have a new administration that's doing a lot of good things, medium to long term here to help, I think, fuel our Renewables business and the growth there. But the order book, as it often is, is backloaded in Onshore and Offshore. And we -- as our customers do need to have, I think, better visibility with respect to number of funding programs, tax policy changes and regulatory approvals, that will have real impact on orders and, in turn, down payments in that business. 
So I don't want to lay out a long list, but there are a number of moving pieces here. And given the nature of our business, as you well know, a number of orders are often large and they carry with them significant cash impacts when they happen and negative effects when they don't. 
So I think what we're going to do going forward is what we've done here in the last several years, tell you what we know, tell you what we don't. I think we're mindful that the factoring dynamic creates some noise here. But again, as we've said a couple of times, no change to the effect, 4 to 5, as we discontinue the factoring programs. And operationally, we feel good about the 2.5 to 4.5. If we can get to the high end of that range, great. If we can do better, we will. But it's a long-term game here, and that's the way we're going to play it out."

Let me try to take them in order. 
From a price cost perspective, a number of moving pieces. We're clearly seeing some price pressure not unlike what you've heard about elsewhere, [indiscernible], resins, certain metals. But I think we've also been able to mitigate that in the first quarter to effectively [ a wash ] number of things that we do normal course from a cost management perspective, let alone going after price where we can. 
I think where we're seeing supply issues particularly are in and around where we're seeing a little bit better growth, interestingly enough, not surprisingly, Healthcare probably being #1, Renewables being the other, again, chips, resins and the like. I think right now, it's more isolated. All the nuisance would be maybe an understatement, but I think we're working through that and presumably have that captured in the guide that we're reiterating today. 
With respect to military, that's a little bit of a different challenge, right? That's not a price cost play. That's not a supply chain disruption issue given the snapback. There are a number of things that we need to do a better job of inside of our own facilities. We need help from our supply base there so that we've got a smoother, more consistent flow into and out of -- into through and out of the -- the manufacturing processes. So we're working on that. That's not going to be something that we declare victory on here in the second quarter. But rest assured, we're spending a lot of time working those issues with our customers in mind, first and foremost. 
So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a color for what's happening operationally. These are the challenges when you get economic recovery, and we're glad to see these challenges because it suggests that  better times are on the way."

But I do think that given that the curves have more or less played out as we remodeled them a few years back, clearly, you've got the COVID effects, GE is in a very different place today, I'm optimistic that we'll continue to explore strategic options in and around insurance, and we'll see what happens. I don't want anyone to bank on that as a dead cert. But by the same token, I think what you've heard us say for some time is we're very keen to focus on our core 4 Industrial businesses.

That said, there are different types of shop visits, right, some of which we perform, some of which we don't. I think we've got better visibility, clearly, when we're doing all the work. I think that is playing out as we would have anticipated. You well know a number of cross currents and pressures there in the short term, is airlines, battle of Covid. We've got less visibility on the channel side of things. And I think we clearly see signs that over the last several quarters, a number of our partners have brought inventory levels down. That doesn't necessarily mean a scope reduction on the part of the shop visit being performed, but it does have a knock-on effect relative to the value for us in the very near term. But like any distribution or third-party-related business I've ever seen, you see those behaviors in the downturn and then you get a lift off that base. And that is part of what I think we will see. That's part of what we are assuming we will see as we see the snapback in shop visits going forward. 
But that all needs to play out. Again, a number of encouraging signs in certain markets, the U.S. and China, first amongst them. But clearly, some signs in places like India, like the rest of Asia Pac, parts of Europe, that are of concern and need to stabilize before they improve."

And I just think that is a function of a lot of the LEAN work we've talked about. That's probably our operating segment where we have pushed decentralization the furthest to date. And I do think we're seeing some early results there. 
There's no question that they've gotten off to a good start, right? Orders, up 5%. Let's remember though, it's a bit of a Dickens' dynamic, right, 2 cities, pandemic-related products, well off where we were a year ago. But the core Imaging and Ultrasound franchises, from an orders perspective, are up over 20% year-on-year in the first quarter. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of the play there, and that's really where precision health happens. With due respect, it's not ventilators and patient monitors. They have a role to play, but it really is in and around CT, Ultrasound and the core Imaging products. 
I think as we go forward, while we're encouraged by the 270 bps, if we are getting a market snapback more than we would have anticipated and if we see that being sustainable, in addition to the operating improvements we're going to make, I think what you'll see us do, Andy, is, frankly, try to temper the margin expansion this year and look to put more money back into the business. In no way does that suggest we have not been funding those opportunities that we have wanted to, but you have to follow really the history of the last couple of years, right? We were prepping for an IPO. We pulled that off. Sold BioPharma, that's a distraction. Getting back to basics. Head long into a pandemic. We're really, I think, getting into calmer water in Healthcare, which gives us an opportunity, now that I think we're proving we can deliver on margins and cash, to drive growth, put more money into it, but make sure those are good investments, be it in sales force additions, be it in digital, be it in new products, right? 
So we're not going to call that today, but don't be surprised if we continue to see good top and bottom line performance, that we call off some of the outsized margin improvements so that we're putting that back into the business and have a good '21 but also a good '22, a good '23 in a business that I think more people are going to appreciate as a real value driver for GE going forward."

So a good bit of what you see happening in Onshore Wind, and I think increasingly in Grid, is a little less of an aggressive pursuit of the top line with more of a balanced approach to go after the business where we're well positioned, where we can serve and make a little bit of money, hopefully, a little bit more money over time, but also have a less -- have a better risk profile, right, to make sure that we're in the geographies, we're in the applications where we have higher confidence. So it's not priced the way it is in Healthcare, obviously. But if you go through our our deal review process, I think you would see that selectivity in those 2 areas in Renewables, and it's very much the same process we are driving across the organization. Now there are plenty of things that we'll do in the short-term. Price where we can, surcharges. A number of our long-term contracts across the company have inflation-based escalators in them, which helps us in environments like the one we may see play out here in the next couple of years.

I am joined today for our first quarter 2021 earnings call by our Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck Happe.  
Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available on our website. Note that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.  
With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry."

Despite continued challenges in Aviation and a still difficult comparison to last year, the first quarter marked a solid start to 2021. I'm confident this sets us up well to deliver on our '21 commitments, and profita",1282,"Steve, thanks, and good morning, all. Despite continued challenges in Aviation and a still difficult comparison to last year, the first quarter marked a solid start to 2021. I'm confident this sets us up well to deliver on our '21 commitments, and profitable growth for the long term.  
Looking at the first quarter numbers on Slide 2. Orders were down 8% organically, primarily driven by Aviation services and Power equipment. It was partially offset by continued strength in Healthcare and Renewables as well as growth in Power Services. We're seeing better performance in our shorter-cycle service businesses. Ex-Aviation, service orders were up 6% organically in the quarter. Our backlog stands at $833 billion and remains a strength, with approximately 80% geared towards services, where we have higher margins.  
Industrial revenue was down 10% organically. Services continued to be a main focus as they were down 14%. While services may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, especially as we've seen during the pandemic, we still expect growth in services this year.  
Ex-Aviation, Industrial revenue was up 1% organically. Adjusted Industrial margin was 5.1%, up 110 basis points organically. Notably, we saw organic expansion year-over-year, with 3 of our 4 businesses improving as our cost actions 2020 continue to take hold.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.03, with the majority of businesses improving, offsetting Aviation. Carolina will provide more color shortly.  
Industrial free cash flow was a negative $845 million. Encouragingly, this was up $1.7 billion ex-BioPharma, driven by better earnings and working capital.  
In all, we're seeing continued progress, especially on margins and cash flow, and we believe these improvements are sustainable.  
As we look to the second quarter, we expect industrial free cash flow growth of similar magnitude to what we saw this quarter.  
And despite ongoing volatility, as the world fights through the pandemic, the guidance we provided a month ago remains unchanged.  
Turning to Slide 3. There's a lot we're doing day in and day out to build momentum across GE. During the last month, we agreed to combine GECAS with AerCap, marking a significant catalyst in our journey to focus GE on its core 4 Industrial businesses: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, Healthcare. And each business is critical to the global markets they serve. This transaction enables us to further strengthen the company for the long term, in closing, bringing our total debt reduction to more than $70 billion over the last 3 years, while drastically simplifying GE in a number of ways, including our financial reporting.  
All the while, we've been fortifying GE's foundation, this starts first with our resilient and passionate team. They have been instrumental in driving our lean transformation forward, and I'm grateful for their service.  As we scale lean across the company, we're working to deliver safety, quality, delivery and cost improvements as well as high-quality growth.  
One recent example comes from Digital Services and Renewables. We heard from our customers that our ""cycle times"" and responsiveness needed improvement. A lean kaizen event revealed multiple systems and inconsistent processes in the way. Through value stream mapping, we developed standard work to decrease cycle time by 70%, enabling us to bid for and win more business. This has already led to more than $70 million of backlog growth. Opportunities like these for high-impact deployment of lean abound throughout our company.
We're coupling lean with a significant decentralization effort. This means managing, not just the 4 segments we report, but the nearly 30 businesses underneath them, where the work [indiscernible] GE has done. This combination of lean and decentralization is maximizing value for our customers while increasing accountability at the business level. And even though it's still early in our journey, we're seeing tangible operational and financial results.  
For example, at a recent operating review with Power Conversion, I was thrilled to see how the team's strategy has come together, optimizing their operations through lean and redefining their market focus. This has led to double-digit order growth in the quarter and 3 consecutive quarters of organic margin expansion. 
This stronger foundation sets us up to spend more time playing offense. Our first priority is investment to drive organic growth efforts. We're improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have today. And at the same time, we're strengthening our offerings with new product introductions.  
As you may have seen recently, we've had some major wins across the portfolio. In Renewables, we were selected to supply more than 530 turbines to North Central Wind Energy Facilities in Oklahoma, marking the largest Onshore Wind project in GE's history.  
At Aviation, CFM secured LEAP engine and service agreements from Southwest Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines to power 100 MAX and 35 A320neo aircraft.  
Meanwhile, at Healthcare, we've launched new ultrasound solutions, the Vscan and Venue, the industry's first AI offering for cardiac imaging. These innovations are supporting clinicians who need fast, reliable insights at the point of care now more than ever.  
And while we're continuing to invest in technology and innovation to serve our customers and to lead our markets into the future, fortifying our competitive position globally is of paramount importance. Over time, we will look to augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments that accelerate the implementation of our strategy and create real value for customers and investors alike.  
So as we think about what we're playing for, it is the long term, building a world that works. At GE, our technology and expertise across critical markets enable us to lead along with our customers in creating a more sustainable future.  
Our Renewables and Power businesses sit at the heart of the energy transition. Our opportunities were on full display last week during Earth Week.  
In Renewables, we've held the #1 position in North America onshore wind 2 years running, and this is the fastest-growing source of new power generation capacity.  
At Gas Power, we're playing a vital complementary role in decarbonizing at scale as customers shift from coal to gas.  
And as we modernize the Power Grid with digital and automation solutions, we have an opportunity to have an even bigger impact.  
In Healthcare, we're at the forefront of the precision health revolution. We have a leading position in many imaging modalities, and we're growing our digital and AI capabilities, which will enhance the personalization of diagnostics and therapeutics.  
Take an area like cancer screening, our solutions are improving patient outcomes, helping clinicians rule out false positives and streamlining workflows for providers and payers alike.  
And as we look to the future of flight, no business is better positioned than our aviation business. In the near term, our focus is getting people back into the air safely. And as the market recovers from COVID, we're well placed with the largest and youngest engine platform, with more than 37,000 commercial engines and more than 60% of our fleet that has not yet had a second shop visit. Underscoring the value of our platform will generate for decades to come.  
As we tackle the world's most complex challenges, we're also passionate about delivering for our customers across our vast global installed base. It's our services that keep us close to our customers day in and day out and create a significant source of recurring revenue. By staying true to our purpose and our customers, we'll unlock further upside potential in growth, profit and cash generation, leading to high single-digit free cash flow margins over the next few years.  
Stepping back, we're on a positive trajectory in 2021 and beyond. We're focused on delivering on our commitments, and I'm confident that our continued efforts will build a stronger and more focused GE.  
With that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter."
177031,711868956,2259087,"General Electric Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Larry. As you mentioned, our decentralization effort continues. And our financing is playing a critical role. We're developing and supporting a more granular operating view of our nearly 30 P&Ls and we're building lean skills to ensure the process",2959,"Thanks, Larry. As you mentioned, our decentralization effort continues. And our financing is playing a critical role. We're developing and supporting a more granular operating view of our nearly 30 P&Ls and we're building lean skills to ensure the processes we're setting up are truly lean and automated.  
We're also deepening our focus on cash and strengthening our operational muscles. We're especially seeing this with billings and collections.  
And we're really driving services growth, a key component to unlocking improved profitability. For example, as we execute contracts, we're more focused on cost productivity and standard work. I'm confident this improved discipline will translate into improved results.
Turning to Slide 4. Before we dive into the results, 2 items.  
First, with the announcement of AerCap and GECAS combination, GECAS has moved to discontinued operations. As a result, we booked a day 1 loss on sale on our financials have been recast to reflect this transfer, with depreciations sitting on the portfolio.  
Going forward, any changes to earnings associated with GECAS in disc ops will primarily be driven by the AerCap stock price.  
Second, we're planning to transition our quarterly backlog disclosures to our remaining performance obligation basis, or RPO, starting in the second quarter. This change will simplify and streamline our reporting, further aligning our key metrics to those commonly used across our sectors and reducing unnecessary extra work.  
Now let me provide some color on the quarter on an organic basis. Looking at the top line. Recall that our businesses only partially felt the impact of the pandemic in the first quarter of '20. Aviation continues to be challenged, managing through market volatility, which has weighed on our overall performance.  
Industrial revenue was down 10% this quarter, largely driven by services. However, ex-Aviation revenue was up 1%. We're focusing on improved services growth across the portfolio.  
Healthcare equipment and services continue to be a strength. We saw increased demand as global procedure volumes recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  
While Power declined and Renewables was roughly flat, these were largely driven by our increased focus on profitable growth. Examples include reducing turnkey scope in Gas Power, exiting new coal in Power Portfolio and increasing project selectivity in Renewables.  
Next, Industrial margins expanded 110 basis points, with Power, Renewables and Healthcare all contributing. Ex-Aviation, margins expanded 450 basis points.  
A couple of standouts: one, Gas Power services with double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion, and this was supported by better performance in our transactional and CSA portfolios; and two, Healthcare margin expansion. This was driven by better volume and cost productivity due to our lean efforts and expense management.  
We also continue to see sustainable benefits from our cost actions, including reduced headcount of roughly 23,000 year-over-year. We are on track to realize the incremental $1 billion of benefits in 2021.
Finally, adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter. This reflects $0.04 of improvement year-over-year, ex BioPharma, driven in roughly equal parts by Industrial and Capital performance.  
As we work from continuing to adjusted EPS, we need to exclude the positive Baker mark as well as the negative impact of significant higher cost restructuring programs and nonoperating expenses, primarily pension. Overall, we're encouraged by our Industrial margin improvement.
Moving to cash. Industrial free cash flow was negative $845 million, the use of cash and a decline from the fourth quarter, which we expect seasonally, consistent with what we shared earlier in the quarter. However, we saw significant progress across a number of our businesses with cash flow up $1.4 billion year-over-year and, ex-BioPharma, up $1.7 billion, driven by earnings and working capital improvement.  
Looking at earnings, they were down year-over-year on a reported basis. However, as I mentioned earlier, earnings were up, excluding the impact of BioPharma and Baker, with adjusted Industrial organic profit up 18%.  
Moving to working capital. This was a use of $900 million this quarter. We're seeing progress across the board, with payables and inventories contributing the most of the improvement.  
Looking at the flows within the quarter. Receivables were sourced from higher seasonal collections and daily management, while we also reduced short-term factoring, which negatively impacted our free cash flow by $800 million. Our focus on stronger billings and collections continued, with 2 days of DSO improvement.  
For example, in Aviation Services, within our CSA portfolio, we're using value stream mapping and daily management and have improved billing timeliness by 15%.  
Inventory was a use of cash of $700 million. This was largely driven by Renewables, as expected, to support second half volume. Inventory remains a key focus area for all leaders.  
Take our Healthcare business, where we're improving by 0.5 turn year-over-year. When I recently visited our team in Life Care Solutions, they showed me how their Hoshin Kanri project reduced inventory by more than 5% already this quarter while delivering cost savings. We're continuously sharing these learnings across GE to inspire and accelerate further improvement.  
Payables was a use of $400 million. We saw seasonally lower volume in Power and Aviation. There was a significant improvement year-over-year. Progress was also a use of $400 million as deliveries outpaced collections. Contract assets was flat as deliveries offset collections.  
So working capital, without the $800 million impact of the factoring reduction, would have been close to flat this quarter. And year-over-year, working capital flow was $1.6 billion better. Overall, a significant improvement. 
We're carefully optimizing our capital investments to drive long-term growth. CapEx spend was up 18% sequentially, yet down 37% year-over-year. We've increased rigor in our investments by focusing on high-return and strategically differentiated technologies, including the Haliade-X in Renewables and PDx capacity expansion in Healthcare.  
In all, our efforts to improve working capital are taking hold and with additional opportunities near term. Over time, sustainable free cash flow generation will mainly come from profitable organic growth, combined with higher margins and longer-term efficient capital deployment.  
Turning to liquidity and leverage on Slide 6. We've continued to solidify our financial position. This quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $4 billion. Our liquidity is strong, and we have ample additional liquidity sources for future deleveraging actions. This includes proceeds from the GECAS transaction, positive cash flow and monetizing our remaining stakes in Baker and AerCap. Post transaction close, we expect to reduce debt significantly, bringing our total reduction to more than $70 billion since the end of 2018.  
Additionally, we do not anticipate any further funding requirement for the GE pension plan in the foreseeable future. And by that, I mean the end of the decade. This is due to our $2.5 billion pre-funding in 2020, our investment portfolio performance as well as the recently enacted American Rescue Plan Act.  
Since the beginning of 2019, we reduced our factoring balance by $8 billion, bringing it down to about $6 billion at quarter end.  
Effective April 1, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs. As I talked about our outlook, we'll exclude the related cash flow impact going forward, which we expect to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. The majority of this will be felt in the second quarter.  
Combining this with $3.5 billion to $4 billion with the $800 million reported cash impact in the first quarter from the normal course activity gets you to the $4 billion to $5 billion range of cash that we described last month.  
If you apply the same logic and cancel out the factoring effect from our discontinued programs in 2020, after rebaselining for BioPharma and COVID-related volume in Healthcare, you get to rebaseline free cash flow of about positive $2.4 billion in 2020.  
Our 2021 reported free cash flow range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion includes the impact of the negative $800 million factoring in the first quarter. Excluding the full year impact from factoring, the majority of our cash flow improvement in 2021 comes from earnings.  
As we reduce our reliance on factoring, we will continue to focus with further improvement on our core billings and collections capabilities, leading to better cash performance over time. And there is no change to our view from outlook, where the improvement is driven by our underlying operating performance.
Due to us reducing factoring as well as better managing working capital and cash, our quarterly cash needs have decreased more than $4 billion in a year, a significant improvement.  
In all, we expect to achieve net debt-to-EBITDA of less than 2.5x over the next few years and maintain a strong investment-grade rating.  
Moving to our business results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First, on Power. Our Gas Power and Power Portfolio teams continue to make progress. We're especially encouraged by the growth in Gas Power services. Overall, Power remains on track to deliver their financial commitments for the year.  
Looking at the market, global electricity demand grew 3% this quarter, driving GE gas turbine utilization and CSA billings up high single digits. Orders declined 12% in the quarter. At Gas Power, equipment orders were down 50%, driven by the non-repeat of a large turnkey order. However, we booked 18 turbines, up 9. And notably, service orders were up 11% with contractual and transactional growth. This was driven by higher outages and stronger commercial performance compared to the pandemic-related disruptions last year.  
At Power Portfolio, orders were down 16% as we expected, driven by our planned exit of the new build coal business at Steam. This was partially offset by double-digit growth at Power Conversion. Backlog of $78 billion decreased year-over-year, largely driven by timing of equipment orders and contractual service commitments. Gas Power accounts for roughly 80% of this backlog. 
Revenue was down. Gas Power was down 2%. This was driven by equipment, down 25%. We had significantly lower turnkey scope project, as anticipated, while at the same time, we shipped more heavy-duty gas turbines this quarter, up 6. And we commissioned 3.6 gigawatts of power to the Grid, including 3 HA units.  
As you heard from Scott's outlook, we've been more selective on turnkey projects and we're transitioning to more equipment projects, which is better risk-return equation over time. We saw meaningful improvement in services revenue, up 13%, due to strong transactional backlog execution and higher outages. Our Portfolio revenue was down 9%, driven by Steam. Offsetting this, Power Conversion and Nuclear were both up.  
Segment margin was negative, but improving by 110 basis points. Gas Power margin was positive and expanded significantly. This was largely driven by positive mix from higher-margin services volume and reducing fixed costs. Our Portfolio margin contracted, but largely driven by Steam project execution and unfavorable legacy project arbitration resolutions. We're progressing through our planned exit of new build coal and concluded our European Works Council consultations this quarter. Both Power Conversion and Nuclear expanded margins, operational improvements continued.  
Turning to Renewables. We're playing a leadership role in the energy transition while building a profitable growth business for GE. We continue to improve operational execution and scale Offshore Wind, and we remain on track for our full year commitment.  
Starting with the market. In Onshore Wind, we're expecting the U.S. market to slightly decrease this year, while robust growth continues abroad.  
In Offshore Wind, the strong market trends are expected to continue through the decade. And broadly speaking, Grid is positioned to gain momentum as the energy transition accelerates and government stimulus increases.  
Now on the quarter. Orders grew double digits in Onshore, Offshore and Grid solutions, all up. Grid was the biggest driver following a large HVDC system order.  
Onshore Wind Services, including more than 120 repower units, increased significantly. Offshore Wind is building momentum, with more Haliade-X orders expected in the second half.  
Revenue was flat, with equipment revenues growth up high single digits, offset by a significant decline in services. In Onshore Wind, equipment was higher with more than 760 units delivered, while services were down as we did not deliver any repower upgrades. However, Digital services were up significantly, excluding repower. Offshore Wind growth was driven by continued execution on EDF 6-megawatt PBG project in France. Grid declined due to deal selectivity and commercial execution.  
Segment margin, while negative, improved by 310 basis points. In Onshore Wind, margin improved significantly, driven by cost productivity and execution, partly offset by product mix. In Grid, cost-out more than offset incremental restructuring expenses.  
Next, on Aviation. Our team continues to position the business for the rebound, despite current market challenges. As the Aviation end market recovers, which we believe will begin in the second half, we expect to deliver on our '21 outlook: revenue growth, margin expansion and better cash generation.  
GE CFM departures were down 40% year-over-year, in line with our guide from outlook. We're encouraged that March departure levels improved significantly versus January and February, but regional pressures continue, especially in Europe and Asia, ex-China.  
Orders were down more than 25%, with Commercial Services down more than 40%, but some improvement sequentially. And Commercial Engines, down less than 10%, supported by multiple large orders, including 1 for 22 GE9X engines.  
The Aviation backlog stands at about $260 billion, down slightly sequentially. The largest drivers were Commercial Engines and Services, with approximately 400 LEAP-1B cancellations. For context, our LEAP unit backlog stands at more than 9,200 engines.  
The revenue decline was driven by Commercial Engines, double -- down double digits, and Commercial Services down 40%. Commercial services saw lower spare parts sales and lower shop visits. Although dynamics varied by engine and region, shop visits were broadly in line with our guided outlook. In military, revenue was flat due to favorable equipment mix despite 50 lower unit shipments. Overall, engine deliveries remain pressured, primarily in rotorcraft, and our team continues to address these supply chain challenges.  
Segment margin contracted to approximately 13%, primarily driven by Commercial Services. However, decrementals improved to 19%, and margin expanded sequentially as our cost actions continue to take hold. We're on track to realize the incremental $0.5 billion of benefit in 2021.  
Moving to Healthcare. We're excited about the progress we're seeing. The team's strong performance shows how implementing lean and decentralization is driving real results. Overall, market fundamentals are also improving. For the third consecutive quarter, global procedures volumes were up double digits. Demand for nonpandemic products was solid as government stimulus drove strong order growth in China, India and Japan.  
Meanwhile, demand for pandemic-related products began to normalize. We're seeing elective procedures return to pre-pandemic levels, but there is still much for us to do to support our customers. Many are running at reduced capacity and have patients waiting longer than usual for screenings, treatments and procedures.  
With that backdrop, Healthcare orders continue to improve. Healthcare Systems orders were up 5% with equipment and services growth. Imaging and Ultrasound improved double digits, both year-over-year and compared to the first quarter '19. And CT grew across all regions, while Life Care Solution orders were down as pandemic-related demand softened.  
PDx demand continued to recover, with orders up 7%, driven by CT screening for cardiac disease and routine oncology and neurology screenings returning to pre-pandemic levels.  
Healthcare revenue was also up. Healthcare Systems, up 7% across businesses. Two highlights: Ultrasound demand was high, with growth across most regions and all product lines. And Life Care Solutions grew again this quarter. PDx revenue was up 7% with elective procedures returning to pre-pandemic levels.  
Segment margins expanded an impressive 270 basis points driven by profitable growth and continued cost reduction, while we still invest for growth, especially in Imaging, Ultrasound and LCS.  
Moving to Slide 8. At Capital, adjusted continuing operations generated a net loss which was half of last year's loss. This was primarily driven by insurance and tax, partially offset by lower EFS gains.  
At insurance, we continue to see a positive claims trend and strong investment results versus last year when we had pandemic-related marks and impairments as well.  
GE Capital assets, excluding cash, were down almost $6 billion sequentially, driven by the GECAS transaction and lower factoring.  
Within discontinued op, two to call out. GECAS had a net loss of $2.6 billion, which includes the loss on sale of $2.8 billion from the AerCap transaction, offset by about $200 million of earnings, with the collections progress on previously granted deferrals, and we ended the quarter with 20 aircraft on ground. We may see levels fluctuate throughout 2021 due to the continued market volatility.  
We've previously noted ongoing litigation related to our run-off Polish mortgage portfolio. This quarter, we recorded charges of approximately $300 million. This is based on the rising number of borrower losses filed and expected to be filed in the future as well as higher discount rates. We expect upcoming decisions of the European Court of Justice and the Polish Supreme Court to have an impact on the litigation landscape for Polish banks, including our run-off Polish mortgage business.  
Moving to Corporate. We remain focused on leaner processes and decentralization. If I compare the adjusted corporate costs with when I started a year ago, we are down almost 50%, most notably here are our functional costs and operations, which improved over 40% and in Digital, focusing on driving growth and improved profitability with a strong performance from Grid software this quarter.  
Taking a step back, Larry and I recognize the positive sustainable impact that lean will create at GE. We are picking up the pace. And while it's still early, we're building momentum with measurable impact this quarter, as you've seen. This is becoming more visible at Corporate as well. We've significantly transformed how we operate, moving more work to the businesses and further streamlining the remaining corporate functions. And we have an increased focus on strategy, capital allocation, research, talent and governance.  
Now Larry, back to you."

Thanks to our team, we're making measurable and sustainable progress, and we're set up well to deliver on our 2021 commitments that we shared with you in March.  
Since joining GE, one of my top priorities has been instilling greater focus throughout the organization. The GECAS transaction announced last month marks an important step forward in making GE a more focused, simpler and stronger industrial company, one that's even better positioned to serve the needs of our customers and the world with leading technologies and strong service capabilities across our installed base.  
As we are building a world that works, we're also creating a more sustainable future, leading in the energy transition, driving more integrated and personalized healthcare and enabling smarter and more efficient flight.  
I hope the business examples we've shared today helped convey the real operational and cultural changes underway at GE. There are many steps, big and small, happening across our company right now that make me excited about the future.

So you talked more and more about playing offense and playing for the long term here. If I bring this back to free cash flow, I know that you kind of guide to 2023 at high single-digit free cash flow margins, but you removed a lot of headwinds. Carolina mentioned that the pension headwind is gone potentially now to the end of the decade. 
The factoring headwind, I think, even if you look at just the near-term here, the $4 billion to $5 billion guide that you all reflected, I think, the near-term impact is probably $800 million less. So de facto, I think you kind of implicitly increased your cash flow guide today, unless I'm misinterpreting that. 
But if I take it more to the long term, right, and I look at sort of these removed headwinds, and  peers in a lot of your business being significantly above that high single-digit free cash flow margin, how do you think about the portfolio and that target in the long term?"
177031,711868956,2259087,"General Electric Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Markus, a couple of comments there. Let me just level set.

Let me just level set. I think what we're trying to do today is reiterate that what we said about a month ago or so at the GECAS announcement, with respect to our outlook for this year in terms of free cash potential, the $2.5 billion to $4.5billion, that's intact, right? So no intention to change that.  
As Carolina highlighted, we did have $800 million of factoring discontinuation pressure in the first quarter that we're not adjusting for, but we do want to flag it for you because it's akin to what we will adjust for more formally the rest of the year now that we have formally discontinued the factoring program.  
But I think that as you ask about the longer term, there's no question that we feel confident today about our potential to deliver on that high single-digit free cash flow margin in '23 or hopefully shortly thereafter, right? If -- and we're really talking about, you take the midpoint of that, call it 8% on, let's say, the '19 revenue base, somewhere in the $85 billion to $90 billion range, that gets us to a $7 billion free cash number.  
I think given the way we are running the businesses better today, at least compared to what I saw when I walked in 2.5 years ago, the opportunities I think we have clearly framed in front of us around the energy transition, around precision health around the future of flight and as you highlight, as Carolina noted, a number of headwinds will dissipate over time, be it some of the restructuring and power, be it pension. I mean what terrific news that is for us. In addition to the interest step down and the like.
So there's a lot of things that we're working on, that we're encouraged by. There are a number of things that are going to dissipate over time. And you put all that together, well, we've got plenty of work to do. So there's no declaration of victory here. I think we're just trying to underscore our continued confidence that we could deliver on those numbers over time.
Clearly, we need Aviation to come back. I think we're encouraged by a number of the signs there. The U.S., clearly coming back. China, above where they were a year ago, let alone '19, at this point. So that's encouraging. But certainly, other parts of the world, as you well know, are still fighting this horrible pandemic. That creates a little bit of the volatility that we referred to. But all in, we continue to believe the Aviation recovery is more a matter of when, not if. And again, with that 37,000-strong narrow-body fleet out there, the youngest in the industry, we think we're well positioned to serve and to deliver results for our investors as that occurs."

I think we mentioned this in our prepared remarks, on the military side of the house, just in terms of deliveries. So we have some past due backlog there that we needed to clear, which will be helpful as well.  
So as we go through the year, I think you'll see the cost efforts from last year play out. Clearly, the comps get easier. And as we get a better mix of business, with services coming back, we clear those issues in military -- in the military side of the business, I think you should continue to see us improve the margins from here.

I think the range that we have today in line, obviously, with the range that we've shared since early in the year, captures what we know and what we don't know. 
Clearly, we're waiting for Aviation to begin to snap back, that is an important swing factor for us, and I think we've been consistent talking about that. I don't think there's much of a historic whole precedent in that business given the way the pandemic is ravaging various parts of the world and, in turn, both leisure and business travel.
Clearly, we have a new administration that's doing a lot of good things, medium to long term here to help, I think, fuel our Renewables business and the growth there. But the order book, as it often is, is backloaded in Onshore and Offshore. And we -- as our customers do need to have, I think, better visibility with respect to the number of funding programs, tax policy changes and regulatory approvals, that will have real impact on orders and, in turn, down payments in that business.  
So I don't want to lay out a long list, but there are a number of moving pieces here. And given the nature of our business, as you well know, a number of orders are often large and they carry with them significant cash impacts when they happen and negative effects when they don't.  
So I think what we're going to do going forward is what we've done here in the last several years, tell you what we know, tell you what we don't. I think we're mindful that the factoring dynamic creates some noise here. But again, as we've said a couple of times, no change to the effect, $4 billion to $5 billion, as we discontinue the factoring programs. And operationally, we feel good about the $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. If we can get to the high end of that range, great. If we can do better, we will. But it's a long-term game here, and that's the way we're going to play it out."

Let me try to take them in order. From a price cost perspective, a number of moving pieces. We're clearly seeing some price pressure not unlike what you've heard about elsewhere, [indiscernible], resins, certain metals. But I think we've also been able to mitigate that in the first quarter to effectively awash a number of things that we do normal course from a cost management perspective, let alone going after price where we can.  
I think where we're seeing supply issues particularly are in and around where we're seeing a little bit better growth, interestingly enough, not surprisingly. Healthcare probably being #1, Renewables being the other, again, chips, resins and the like. I think right now, it's more isolated. All the nuisance would be maybe an understatement, but I think we're working through that and presumably have that captured in the guide that we're reiterating today.  
With respect to military, that's a little bit of a different challenge, right? That's not a price cost play. That's not a supply chain disruption issue given the snapback. There are a number of things that we need to do a better job of inside of our own facilities. We need help from our supply base there so that we've got a smoother, more consistent flow into and out of -- into, through and out of the -- the manufacturing processes. So we're working on that. That's not going to be something that we declare victory on here in the second quarter. But rest assured, we're spending a lot of time working those issues with our customers in mind, first and foremost.  
So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a color for what's happening operationally. These are the challenges when you get economic recovery, and we're glad to see these challenges because it suggests that better times are on the way."

I think that is playing out as we would have anticipated. You well know a number of cross currents and pressures there in the short term, is airlines' battle with COVID. 
We've got less visibility on the channel side of things. And I think we clearly see signs that over the last several quarters, a number of our partners have brought inventory levels down. That doesn't necessarily mean a scope reduction on the part of the shop visit being performed, but it does have a knock-on effect relative to the value for us in the very near term.

There's no question that they've gotten off to a good start, right? Orders, up 5%. Let's remember though, it's a bit of a Dickens' dynamic, right, 2 cities, pandemic-related products, well off where we were a year ago. But the core Imaging and Ultrasound franchises, from an orders perspective, are up over 20% year-on-year in the first quarter. So it gives you a little bit of a sense of the play there, and that's really where precision health happens. With due respect, it's not ventilators and patient monitors. They have a role to play, but it really is in and around CT, Ultrasound and the core Imaging products. 
I think as we go forward, while we're encouraged by the 270 bps, if we are getting a market snapback more than we would have anticipated and if we see that being sustainable, in addition to the operating improvements we're going to make, I think what you'll see us do, Andy, is, frankly, try to temper the margin expansion this year and look to put more money back into the business.

We're really, I think, getting into calmer water in Healthcare, which gives us an opportunity, now that I think we're proving we can deliver on margins and cash, to drive growth, put more money into it, but make sure those are good investments, be it in sales force additions, be it in digital, be it in new products, right? 
So we're not going to call that today, but don't be surprised if we continue to see good top and bottom line performance, that we call off some of the outsized margin improvements so that we're putting that back into the business and have a good '21 but also a good '22, a good '23 in a business that I think more people are going to appreciate as a real value driver for GE going forward."

So a good bit of what you see happening in Onshore Wind, and I think increasingly in Grid, is a little less of a -- an aggressive pursuit of the top line with more of a balanced approach to go after the business where we're well positioned, where we can serve and make a little bit of money, hopefully, a little bit more money over time, but also have a less -- have a better risk profile, right, to make sure that we're in the geographies, we're in the applications where we have higher confidence. So it's not priced the way it is in Healthcare, obviously. 
But if you go through our deal review process, I think you would see that selectivity in those 2 areas in Renewables, and it's very much the same process we are driving across the organization. Now there are plenty of things that we'll do in the short-term. Price where we can, surcharges. A number of our long-term contracts across the company have inflation-based escalators in them, which helps us in environments like the one we may see play out here in the next couple of years. But we're really just, again, trying to pursue the quality business across the portfolio where we can serve the customer well and do that in a way that drives margins and cash for our investors."

Despite continued challenges in Aviation and a still difficult comparison to last year, the first quarter marked a solid start to 2021. I'm confident this sets us up well to deliver on our '21 commitments, and profitable growth for the long term.  
Looking at the first quarter numbers on Slide 2. Orders were down 8% organically, primarily driven by Aviation services and Power equipment. It was partially offset by continued strength in Healthcare and Renewables as well as growth in Power Services. We're seeing better performance in our shorter-cycle service businesses. Ex-Aviation, service orders were up 6% organically in the quarter. Our backlog stands at $833 billion and remains a strength, with approximately 80% geared towards services, where we have higher margins.  
Industrial revenue was down 10% organically. Services continued to be a main focus as they were down 14%. While services may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, especially as we've seen during the pandemic, we still expect growth in services this year.  
Ex-Aviation, Industrial revenue was up 1% organically. Adjusted Industrial margin was 5.1%, up 110 basis points organically. Notably, we saw organic expansion year-over-year, with 3 of our 4 businesses improving as our cost actions 2020 continue to take hold.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.03, with the majority of businesses improving, offsetting Aviation. Carolina will provide more color shortly.  
Industrial free cash flow was a negative $845 million. Encouragingly, this was up $1.7 billion ex-BioPharma, driven by better earnings and working capital.  
In all, we're seeing continued progress, especially on margins and cash flow, and we believe these improvements are sustainable.  
As we look to the second quarter, we expect industrial free cash flow growth of similar magnitude to what we saw this quarter.  
And despite ongoing volatility, as the world fights through the pandemic, the guidance we provided a month ago remains unchanged.  
Turning to Slide 3. There's a lot we're doing day in and day out to build momentum across GE. During the last month, we agreed to combine GECAS with AerCap, marking a significant catalyst in our journey to focus GE on its core 4 Industrial businesses: Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, Healthcare. And each business is critical to the global markets they serve. This transaction enables us to further strengthen the company for the long term, in closing, bringing our total debt reduction to more than $70 billion over the last 3 years, while drastically simplifying GE in a number of ways, including our financial reporting.  
All the while, we've been fortifying GE's foundation, this starts first with our resilient and passionate team. They have been instrumental in driving our lean transformation forward, and I'm grateful for their service.  As we scale lean across the company, we're working to deliver safety, quality, delivery and cost improvements as well as high-quality growth.  
One recent example comes from Digital Services and Renewables. We heard from our customers that our ""cycle times"" and responsiveness needed improvement. A lean kaizen event revealed multiple systems and inconsistent processes in the way. Through value stream mapping, we developed standard work to decrease cycle time by 70%, enabling us to bid for and win more business. This has already led to more than $70 million of backlog growth. Opportunities like these for high-impact deployment of lean abound throughout our company.
We're coupling lean with a significant decentralization effort. This means managing, not just the 4 segments we report, but the nearly 30 businesses underneath them, where the work -- GE has done. This combination of lean and decentralization is maximizing value for our customers while increasing accountability at the business level. And even though it's still early in our journey, we're seeing tangible operational and financial results.  
For example, at a recent operating review with Power Conversion, I was thrilled to see how the team's strategy has come together, optimizing their operations through lean and redefining their market focus. This has led to double-digit order growth in the quarter and 3 consecutive quarters of organic margin expansion. 
This stronger foundation sets us up to spend more time playing offense. Our first priority is investment to drive organic growth efforts. We're improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have today. And at the same time, we're strengthening our offerings with new product introductions.  
As you may have seen recently, we've had some major wins across the portfolio. In Renewables, we were selected to supply more than 530 turbines to North Central Wind Energy Facilities in Oklahoma, marking the largest Onshore Wind project in GE's history.  
At Aviation, CFM secured LEAP engine and service agreements from Southwest Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines to power 100 MAX and 35 A320neo aircraft.  
Meanwhile, at Healthcare, we've launched new ultrasound solutions, the Vscan and Venue, the industry's first AI offering for cardiac imaging. These innovations are supporting clinicians who need fast, reliable insights at the point of care now more than ever.  
And while we're continuing to invest in technology and innovation to serve our customers and to lead our markets into the future, fortifying our competitive position globally is of paramount importance. Over time, we will look to augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments that accelerate the implementation of our strategy and create real value for customers and investors alike.  
So as we think about what we're playing for, it is the long term, building a world that works. At GE, our technology and expertise across critical markets enable us to lead along with our customers in creating a more sustainable future.  
Our Renewables and Power businesses sit at the heart of the energy transition. Our opportunities were on full display last week during Earth Week.  
In Renewables, we've held the #1 position in North America onshore wind 2 years running, and this is the fastest-growing source of new power generation capacity.  
At Gas Power, we're playing a vital complementary role in decarbonizing at scale as customers shift from coal to gas.  
And as we modernize the Power Grid with digital and automation solutions, we have an opportunity to have an even bigger impact.  
In Healthcare, we're at the forefront of the precision health revolution. We have a leading position in many imaging modalities, and we're growing our digital and AI capabilities, which will enhance the personalization of diagnostics and therapeutics.  
Take an area like cancer screening, our solutions are improving patient outcomes, helping clinicians rule out false positives and streamlining workflows for providers and payers alike.  
And as we look to the future of flight, no business is better positioned than our aviation business. In the near term, our focus is getting people back into the air safely. And as the market recovers from COVID, we're well placed with the largest and youngest engine platform, with more than 37,000 commercial engines and more than 60% of our fleet that has not yet had a second shop visit. Underscoring the value of our platform will generate for decades to come.  
As we tackle the world's most complex challenges, we're also passionate about delivering for our customers across our vast global installed base. It's our services that keep us close to our customers day in and day out and create a significant source of recurring revenue. By staying true to our purpose and our customers, we'll unlock further upside potential in growth, profit and cash generation, leading to high single-digit free cash flow margins over the next few years.  
Stepping back, we're on a positive trajectory in 2021 and beyond. We're focused on delivering on our commitments, and I'm confident that our continued efforts will build a stronger and more focused GE.  
With that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter."
177031,711868956,2261099,"General Electric Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Larry. As you mentioned, our decentralization effort continues. And our financing is playing a critical role. We're developing and supporting a more granular operating view of our nearly 30 P&Ls and we're building lean skills to ensure the process",2959,"Thanks, Larry. As you mentioned, our decentralization effort continues. And our financing is playing a critical role. We're developing and supporting a more granular operating view of our nearly 30 P&Ls and we're building lean skills to ensure the processes we're setting up are truly lean and automated.  
We're also deepening our focus on cash and strengthening our operational muscles. We're especially seeing this with billings and collections.  
And we're really driving services growth, a key component to unlocking improved profitability. For example, as we execute contracts, we're more focused on cost productivity and standard work. I'm confident this improved discipline will translate into improved results.
Turning to Slide 4. Before we dive into the results, 2 items.  
First, with the announcement of AerCap and GECAS combination, GECAS has moved to discontinued operations. As a result, we booked a day 1 loss on sale on our financials have been recast to reflect this transfer, with depreciations sitting on the portfolio.  
Going forward, any changes to earnings associated with GECAS in disc ops will primarily be driven by the AerCap stock price.  
Second, we're planning to transition our quarterly backlog disclosures to our remaining performance obligation basis, or RPO, starting in the second quarter. This change will simplify and streamline our reporting, further aligning our key metrics to those commonly used across our sectors and reducing unnecessary extra work.  
Now let me provide some color on the quarter on an organic basis. Looking at the top line. Recall that our businesses only partially felt the impact of the pandemic in the first quarter of '20. Aviation continues to be challenged, managing through market volatility, which has weighed on our overall performance.  
Industrial revenue was down 10% this quarter, largely driven by services. However, ex-Aviation revenue was up 1%. We're focusing on improved services growth across the portfolio.  
Healthcare equipment and services continue to be a strength. We saw increased demand as global procedure volumes recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  
While Power declined and Renewables was roughly flat, these were largely driven by our increased focus on profitable growth. Examples include reducing turnkey scope in Gas Power, exiting new coal in Power Portfolio and increasing project selectivity in Renewables.  
Next, Industrial margins expanded 110 basis points, with Power, Renewables and Healthcare all contributing. Ex-Aviation, margins expanded 450 basis points.  
A couple of standouts: one, Gas Power services with double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion, and this was supported by better performance in our transactional and CSA portfolios; and two, Healthcare margin expansion. This was driven by better volume and cost productivity due to our lean efforts and expense management.  
We also continue to see sustainable benefits from our cost actions, including reduced headcount of roughly 23,000 year-over-year. We are on track to realize the incremental $1 billion of benefits in 2021.
Finally, adjusted EPS was $0.03 in the quarter. This reflects $0.04 of improvement year-over-year, ex BioPharma, driven in roughly equal parts by Industrial and Capital performance.  
As we work from continuing to adjusted EPS, we need to exclude the positive Baker mark as well as the negative impact of significant higher cost restructuring programs and nonoperating expenses, primarily pension. Overall, we're encouraged by our Industrial margin improvement.
Moving to cash. Industrial free cash flow was negative $845 million, the use of cash and a decline from the fourth quarter, which we expect seasonally, consistent with what we shared earlier in the quarter. However, we saw significant progress across a number of our businesses with cash flow up $1.4 billion year-over-year and, ex-BioPharma, up $1.7 billion, driven by earnings and working capital improvement.  
Looking at earnings, they were down year-over-year on a reported basis. However, as I mentioned earlier, earnings were up, excluding the impact of BioPharma and Baker, with adjusted Industrial organic profit up 18%.  
Moving to working capital. This was a use of $900 million this quarter. We're seeing progress across the board, with payables and inventories contributing the most of the improvement.  
Looking at the flows within the quarter. Receivables were sourced from higher seasonal collections and daily management, while we also reduced short-term factoring, which negatively impacted our free cash flow by $800 million. Our focus on stronger billings and collections continued, with 2 days of DSO improvement.  
For example, in Aviation Services, within our CSA portfolio, we're using value stream mapping and daily management and have improved billing timeliness by 15%.  
Inventory was a use of cash of $700 million. This was largely driven by Renewables, as expected, to support second half volume. Inventory remains a key focus area for all leaders.  
Take our Healthcare business, where we're improving by 0.5 turn year-over-year. When I recently visited our team in Life Care Solutions, they showed me how their Hoshin Kanri project reduced inventory by more than 5% already this quarter while delivering cost savings. We're continuously sharing these learnings across GE to inspire and accelerate further improvement.  
Payables was a use of $400 million. We saw seasonally lower volume in Power and Aviation. There was a significant improvement year-over-year. Progress was also a use of $400 million as deliveries outpaced collections. Contract assets was flat as deliveries offset collections.  
So working capital, without the $800 million impact of the factoring reduction, would have been close to flat this quarter. And year-over-year, working capital flow was $1.6 billion better. Overall, a significant improvement. 
We're carefully optimizing our capital investments to drive long-term growth. CapEx spend was up 18% sequentially, yet down 37% year-over-year. We've increased rigor in our investments by focusing on high-return and strategically differentiated technologies, including the Haliade-X in Renewables and PDx capacity expansion in Healthcare.  
In all, our efforts to improve working capital are taking hold and with additional opportunities near term. Over time, sustainable free cash flow generation will mainly come from profitable organic growth, combined with higher margins and longer-term efficient capital deployment.  
Turning to liquidity and leverage on Slide 6. We've continued to solidify our financial position. This quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $4 billion. Our liquidity is strong, and we have ample additional liquidity sources for future deleveraging actions. This includes proceeds from the GECAS transaction, positive cash flow and monetizing our remaining stakes in Baker and AerCap. Post transaction close, we expect to reduce debt significantly, bringing our total reduction to more than $70 billion since the end of 2018.  
Additionally, we do not anticipate any further funding requirement for the GE pension plan in the foreseeable future. And by that, I mean the end of the decade. This is due to our $2.5 billion pre-funding in 2020, our investment portfolio performance as well as the recently enacted American Rescue Plan Act.  
Since the beginning of 2019, we reduced our factoring balance by $8 billion, bringing it down to about $6 billion at quarter end.  
Effective April 1, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs. As I talked about our outlook, we'll exclude the related cash flow impact going forward, which we expect to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. The majority of this will be felt in the second quarter.  
Combining this with $3.5 billion to $4 billion with the $800 million reported cash impact in the first quarter from the normal course activity gets you to the $4 billion to $5 billion range of cash that we described last month.  
If you apply the same logic and cancel out the factoring effect from our discontinued programs in 2020, after rebaselining for BioPharma and COVID-related volume in Healthcare, you get to rebaseline free cash flow of about positive $2.4 billion in 2020.  
Our 2021 reported free cash flow range of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion includes the impact of the negative $800 million factoring in the first quarter. Excluding the full year impact from factoring, the majority of our cash flow improvement in 2021 comes from earnings.  
As we reduce our reliance on factoring, we will continue to focus with further improvement on our core billings and collections capabilities, leading to better cash performance over time. And there is no change to our view from outlook, where the improvement is driven by our underlying operating performance.
Due to us reducing factoring as well as better managing working capital and cash, our quarterly cash needs have decreased more than $4 billion in a year, a significant improvement.  
In all, we expect to achieve net debt-to-EBITDA of less than 2.5x over the next few years and maintain a strong investment-grade rating.  
Moving to our business results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First, on Power. Our Gas Power and Power Portfolio teams continue to make progress. We're especially encouraged by the growth in Gas Power services. Overall, Power remains on track to deliver their financial commitments for the year.  
Looking at the market, global electricity demand grew 3% this quarter, driving GE gas turbine utilization and CSA billings up high single digits. Orders declined 12% in the quarter. At Gas Power, equipment orders were down 50%, driven by the non-repeat of a large turnkey order. However, we booked 18 turbines, up 9. And notably, service orders were up 11% with contractual and transactional growth. This was driven by higher outages and stronger commercial performance compared to the pandemic-related disruptions last year.  
At Power Portfolio, orders were down 16% as we expected, driven by our planned exit of the new build coal business at Steam. This was partially offset by double-digit growth at Power Conversion. Backlog of $78 billion decreased year-over-year, largely driven by timing of equipment orders and contractual service commitments. Gas Power accounts for roughly 80% of this backlog. 
Revenue was down. Gas Power was down 2%. This was driven by equipment, down 25%. We had significantly lower turnkey scope project, as anticipated, while at the same time, we shipped more heavy-duty gas turbines this quarter, up 6. And we commissioned 3.6 gigawatts of power to the Grid, including 3 HA units.  
As you heard from Scott's outlook, we've been more selective on turnkey projects and we're transitioning to more equipment projects, which is better risk-return equation over time. We saw meaningful improvement in services revenue, up 13%, due to strong transactional backlog execution and higher outages. Our Portfolio revenue was down 9%, driven by Steam. Offsetting this, Power Conversion and Nuclear were both up.  
Segment margin was negative, but improving by 110 basis points. Gas Power margin was positive and expanded significantly. This was largely driven by positive mix from higher-margin services volume and reducing fixed costs. Our Portfolio margin contracted, but largely driven by Steam project execution and unfavorable legacy project arbitration resolutions. We're progressing through our planned exit of new build coal and concluded our European Works Council consultations this quarter. Both Power Conversion and Nuclear expanded margins, operational improvements continued.  
Turning to Renewables. We're playing a leadership role in the energy transition while building a profitable growth business for GE. We continue to improve operational execution and scale Offshore Wind, and we remain on track for our full year commitment.  
Starting with the market. In Onshore Wind, we're expecting the U.S. market to slightly decrease this year, while robust growth continues abroad.  
In Offshore Wind, the strong market trends are expected to continue through the decade. And broadly speaking, Grid is positioned to gain momentum as the energy transition accelerates and government stimulus increases.  
Now on the quarter. Orders grew double digits in Onshore, Offshore and Grid solutions, all up. Grid was the biggest driver following a large HVDC system order.  
Onshore Wind Services, including more than 120 repower units, increased significantly. Offshore Wind is building momentum, with more Haliade-X orders expected in the second half.  
Revenue was flat, with equipment revenues growth up high single digits, offset by a significant decline in services. In Onshore Wind, equipment was higher with more than 760 units delivered, while services were down as we did not deliver any repower upgrades. However, Digital services were up significantly, excluding repower. Offshore Wind growth was driven by continued execution on EDF 6-megawatt PBG project in France. Grid declined due to deal selectivity and commercial execution.  
Segment margin, while negative, improved by 310 basis points. In Onshore Wind, margin improved significantly, driven by cost productivity and execution, partly offset by product mix. In Grid, cost-out more than offset incremental restructuring expenses.  
Next, on Aviation. Our team continues to position the business for the rebound, despite current market challenges. As the Aviation end market recovers, which we believe will begin in the second half, we expect to deliver on our '21 outlook: revenue growth, margin expansion and better cash generation.  
GE CFM departures were down 40% year-over-year, in line with our guide from outlook. We're encouraged that March departure levels improved significantly versus January and February, but regional pressures continue, especially in Europe and Asia, ex-China.  
Orders were down more than 25%, with Commercial Services down more than 40%, but some improvement sequentially. And Commercial Engines, down less than 10%, supported by multiple large orders, including 1 for 22 GE9X engines.  
The Aviation backlog stands at about $260 billion, down slightly sequentially. The largest drivers were Commercial Engines and Services, with approximately 400 LEAP-1B cancellations. For context, our LEAP unit backlog stands at more than 9,200 engines.  
The revenue decline was driven by Commercial Engines, double -- down double digits, and Commercial Services down 40%. Commercial services saw lower spare parts sales and lower shop visits. Although dynamics varied by engine and region, shop visits were broadly in line with our guided outlook. In military, revenue was flat due to favorable equipment mix despite 50 lower unit shipments. Overall, engine deliveries remain pressured, primarily in rotorcraft, and our team continues to address these supply chain challenges.  
Segment margin contracted to approximately 13%, primarily driven by Commercial Services. However, decrementals improved to 19%, and margin expanded sequentially as our cost actions continue to take hold. We're on track to realize the incremental $0.5 billion of benefit in 2021.  
Moving to Healthcare. We're excited about the progress we're seeing. The team's strong performance shows how implementing lean and decentralization is driving real results. Overall, market fundamentals are also improving. For the third consecutive quarter, global procedures volumes were up double digits. Demand for nonpandemic products was solid as government stimulus drove strong order growth in China, India and Japan.  
Meanwhile, demand for pandemic-related products began to normalize. We're seeing elective procedures return to pre-pandemic levels, but there is still much for us to do to support our customers. Many are running at reduced capacity and have patients waiting longer than usual for screenings, treatments and procedures.  
With that backdrop, Healthcare orders continue to improve. Healthcare Systems orders were up 5% with equipment and services growth. Imaging and Ultrasound improved double digits, both year-over-year and compared to the first quarter '19. And CT grew across all regions, while Life Care Solution orders were down as pandemic-related demand softened.  
PDx demand continued to recover, with orders up 7%, driven by CT screening for cardiac disease and routine oncology and neurology screenings returning to pre-pandemic levels.  
Healthcare revenue was also up. Healthcare Systems, up 7% across businesses. Two highlights: Ultrasound demand was high, with growth across most regions and all product lines. And Life Care Solutions grew again this quarter. PDx revenue was up 7% with elective procedures returning to pre-pandemic levels.  
Segment margins expanded an impressive 270 basis points driven by profitable growth and continued cost reduction, while we still invest for growth, especially in Imaging, Ultrasound and LCS.  
Moving to Slide 8. At Capital, adjusted continuing operations generated a net loss which was half of last year's loss. This was primarily driven by insurance and tax, partially offset by lower EFS gains.  
At insurance, we continue to see a positive claims trend and strong investment results versus last year when we had pandemic-related marks and impairments as well.  
GE Capital assets, excluding cash, were down almost $6 billion sequentially, driven by the GECAS transaction and lower factoring.  
Within discontinued op, two to call out. GECAS had a net loss of $2.6 billion, which includes the loss on sale of $2.8 billion from the AerCap transaction, offset by about $200 million of earnings, with the collections progress on previously granted deferrals, and we ended the quarter with 20 aircraft on ground. We may see levels fluctuate throughout 2021 due to the continued market volatility.  
We've previously noted ongoing litigation related to our run-off Polish mortgage portfolio. This quarter, we recorded charges of approximately $300 million. This is based on the rising number of borrower losses filed and expected to be filed in the future as well as higher discount rates. We expect upcoming decisions of the European Court of Justice and the Polish Supreme Court to have an impact on the litigation landscape for Polish banks, including our run-off Polish mortgage business.  
Moving to Corporate. We remain focused on leaner processes and decentralization. If I compare the adjusted corporate costs with when I started a year ago, we are down almost 50%, most notably here are our functional costs and operations, which improved over 40% and in Digital, focusing on driving growth and improved profitability with a strong performance from Grid software this quarter.  
Taking a step back, Larry and I recognize the positive sustainable impact that lean will create at GE. We are picking up the pace. And while it's still early, we're building momentum with measurable impact this quarter, as you've seen. This is becoming more visible at Corporate as well. We've significantly transformed how we operate, moving more work to the businesses and further streamlining the remaining corporate functions. And we have an increased focus on strategy, capital allocation, research, talent and governance.  
Now Larry, back to you."

Let's go to Slide 9. In summary, this quarter was a solid start to 2021. Thanks to our team, we're making measurable and sustainable progress, and we're set up well to deliver on our 2021 commitments that we shared with you in March.  
Since joining GE, one of my top priorities has been instilling greater focus throughout the organization. The GECAS transaction announced last month marks an important step forward in making GE a more focused, simpler and stronger industrial company, one that's even better positioned to serve the needs of our customers and the world with leading technologies and strong service capabilities across our installed base.  
As we are building a world that works, we're also creating a more sustainable future, leading in the energy transition, driving more integrated and personalized healthcare and enabling smarter and more efficient flight.  
I hope the business examples we've shared today helped convey the real operational and cultural changes underway at GE. There are many steps, big and small, happening across our company right now that make me excited about the future. We remain focused on growth, profit and cash generation, and I'm confident in our ability to drive value for the long term.
Steve, with that, let's go to questions."

So you talked more and more about playing offense and playing for the long term here. If I bring this back to free cash flow, I know that you kind of guide to 2023 at high single-digit free cash flow margins, but you removed a lot of headwinds. Carolina mentioned that the pension headwind is gone potentially now to the end of the decade. 
The factoring headwind, I think, even if you look at just the near-term here, the $4 billion to $5 billion guide that you all reflected, I think, the near-term impact is probably $800 million less. So de facto, I think you kind of implicitly increased your cash flow guide today, unless I'm misinterpreting that. 
But if I take it more to the long term, right, and I look at sort of these removed headwinds, and  peers in a lot of your business being significantly above that high single-digit free cash flow margin, how do you think about the portfolio and that target in the long term?"

Let me just level set. I think what we're trying to do today is reiterate that what we said about a month ago or so at the GECAS announcement, with respect to our outlook for this year in terms of free cash potential, the $2.5 billion to $4.5billion, that's intact, right? So no intention to change that.  
As Carolina highlighted, we did have $800 million of factoring discontinuation pressure in the first quarter that we're not adjusting for, but we do want to flag it for you because it's akin to what we will adjust for more formally the rest of the year now that we have formally discontinued the factoring program.  
But I think that as you ask about the longer term, there's no question that we feel confident today about our potential to deliver on that high single-digit free cash flow margin in '23 or hopefully shortly thereafter, right? If -- and we're really talking about, you take the midpoint of that, call it 8% on, let's say, the '19 revenue base, somewhere in the $85 billion to $90 billion range, that gets us to a $7 billion free cash number.  
I think given the way we are running the businesses better today, at least compared to what I saw when I walked in 2.5 years ago, the opportunities I think we have clearly framed in front of us around the energy transition, around precision health around the future of flight and as you highlight, as Carolina noted, a number of headwinds will dissipate over time, be it some of the restructuring and power, be it pension. I mean what terrific news that is for us. In addition to the interest step down and the like.
So there's a lot of things that we're working on, that we're encouraged by. There are a number of things that are going to dissipate over time. And you put all that together, well, we've got plenty of work to do. So there's no declaration of victory here. I think we're just trying to underscore our continued confidence that we could deliver on those numbers over time.
Clearly, we need Aviation to come back. I think we're encouraged by a number of the signs there. The U.S., clearly coming back. China, above where they were a year ago, let alone '19, at this point. So that's encouraging. But certainly, other parts of the world, as you well know, are still fighting this horrible pandemic. That creates a little bit of the volatility that we referred to. But all in, we continue to believe the Aviation recovery is more a matter of when, not if. And again, with that 37,000-strong narrow-body fleet out there, the youngest in the industry, we think we're well positioned to serve and to deliver results for our investors as that occurs."

The 12.8% op margin print in the quarter is good, all things considered, but organically down 200 basis points from where we were a year ago.

I think we mentioned this in our prepared remarks, on the military side of the house, just in terms of deliveries. So we have some past due backlog there that we needed to clear, which will be helpful as well.  
So as we go through the year, I think you'll see the cost efforts from last year play out. Clearly, the comps get easier. And as we get a better mix of business, with services coming back, we clear those issues in military -- in the military side of the business, I think you should continue to see us improve the margins from here.

I think the range that we have today in line, obviously, with the range that we've shared since early in the year, captures what we know and what we don't know. 
Clearly, we're waiting for Aviation to begin to snap back, that is an important swing factor for us, and I think we've been consistent talking about that. I don't think there's much of a historic whole precedent in that business given the way the pandemic is ravaging various parts of the world and, in turn, both leisure and business travel.
Clearly, we have a new administration that's doing a lot of good things, medium to long term here to help, I think, fuel our Renewables business and the growth there. But the order book, as it often is, is backloaded in Onshore and Offshore. And we -- as our customers do need to have, I think, better visibility with respect to the number of funding programs, tax policy changes and regulatory approvals, that will have real impact on orders and, in turn, down payments in that business.  
So I don't want to lay out a long list, but there are a number of moving pieces here. And given the nature of our business, as you well know, a number of orders are often large and they carry with them significant cash impacts when they happen and negative effects when they don't.  
So I think what we're going to do going forward is what we've done here in the last several years, tell you what we know, tell you what we don't. I think we're mindful that the factoring dynamic creates some noise here. But again, as we've said a couple of times, no change to the effect, $4 billion to $5 billion, as we discontinue the factoring programs. And operationally, we feel good about the $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. If we can get to the high end of that range, great. If we can do better, we will.

Let me try to take them in order. From a price cost perspective, a number of moving pieces. We're clearly seeing some price pressure not unlike what you've heard about elsewhere, [ ceramics ], resins, certain metals. But I think we've also been able to mitigate that in the first quarter to effectively awash a number of things that we do normal course from a cost management perspective, let alone going after price where we can.  
I think where we're seeing supply issues particularly are in and around where we're seeing a little bit better growth, interestingly enough, not surprisingly. Healthcare probably being #1, Renewables being the other, again, chips, resins and the like. I think right now, it's more isolated. All the nuisance would be maybe an understatement, but I think we're working through that and presumably have that captured in the guide that we're reiterating today.  
With respect to military, that's a little bit of a different challenge, right? That's not a price cost play. That's not a supply chain disruption issue given the snapback. There are a number of things that we need to do a better job of inside of our own facilities. We need help from our supply base there so that we've got a smoother, more consistent flow into and out of -- into, through and out of the -- the manufacturing processes. So we're working on that. That's not going to be something that we declare victory on here in the second quarter. But rest assured, we're spending a lot of time working those issues with our customers in mind, first and foremost.  
So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a color for what's happening operationally. These are the challenges when you get economic recovery, and we're glad to see these challenges because it suggests that better times are on the way."

I don't want anyone to bank on that as a dead cert. But by the same token, I think what you've heard us say for some time is we're very keen to focus on our core 4 Industrial businesses. Insurance is not inside that perimeter. So if and when we have an opportunity to do something smart, creative and strategic around insurance, rest assured, we'll give that our full attention."

That said, there are different types of shop visits, right, some of which we perform, some of which we don't. I think we've got better visibility, clearly, when we're doing all the work. I think that is playing out as we would have anticipated. You well know a number of cross currents and pressures there in the short term, is airlines' battle with COVID. 
We've got less visibility on the channel side of things. And I think we clearly see signs that over the last several quarters, a number of our partners have brought inventory levels down. That doesn't necessarily mean a scope reduction on the part of the shop visit being performed, but it does have a knock-on effect relative to the value for us in the very near term. But like any distribution or third-party-related business I've ever seen, you see those behaviors in the downturn and then you get a lift off that base. And that is part of what I think we will see. That's part of what we are assuming we will see as we see the snapback in shop visits going forward.  
But that all needs to play out. Again, a number of encouraging signs in certain markets, the U.S. and China, first amongst them. But clearly, some signs in places like India, like the rest of Asia Pac, parts of Europe, that are of concern and need to stabilize before they improve."

And I just think that is a function of a lot of the lean work we've talked about. That's probably our operating segment where we have pushed decentralization the furthest to date. And I do think we're seeing some early results there. 
There's no question that they've gotten off to a good start, right? Orders, up 5%. Let's remember though, it's a bit of a Dickens' dynamic, right, 2 cities, pandemic-related products, well off where we were a year ago. But the core Imaging and Ultrasound franchises, from an orders perspective, are up over 20% year-on-year in the first quarter. So it gives you a little bit of a sense of the play there, and that's really where precision health happens. With due respect, it's not ventilators and patient monitors. They have a role to play, but it really is in and around CT, Ultrasound and the core Imaging products. 
I think as we go forward, while we're encouraged by the 270 bps, if we are getting a market snapback more than we would have anticipated and if we see that being sustainable, in addition to the operating improvements we're going to make, I think what you'll see us do, Andy, is, frankly, try to temper the margin expansion this year and look to put more money back into the business. In no way does that suggest we have not been funding those opportunities that we have wanted to, but you have to follow really the history of the last couple of years, right? We were prepping for an IPO. 
We've pulled that off. Sold BioPharma. That's a distraction. Getting back to basics. Head long into a pandemic. We're really, I think, getting into calmer water in Healthcare, which gives us an opportunity, now that I think we're proving we can deliver on margins and cash, to drive growth, put more money into it, but make sure those are good investments, be it in sales force additions, be it in digital, be it in new products, right? 
So we're not going to call that today, but don't be surprised if we continue to see good top and bottom line performance, that we call off some of the outsized margin improvements so that we're putting that back into the business and have a good '21 but also a good '22, a good '23 in a business that I think more people are going to appreciate as a real value driver for GE going forward."

So a good bit of what you see happening in Onshore Wind, and I think increasingly in Grid, is a little less of a -- an aggressive pursuit of the top line with more of a balanced approach to go after the business where we're well positioned, where we can serve and make a little bit of money, hopefully, a little bit more money over time, but also have a less -- have a better risk profile, right, to make sure that we're in the geographies, we're in the applications where we have higher confidence. So it's not priced the way it is in Healthcare, obviously. 
But if you go through our deal review process, I think you would see that selectivity in those 2 areas in Renewables, and it's very much the same process we are driving across the organization. Now there are plenty of things that we'll do in the short-term. Price where we can, surcharges. A number of our long-term contracts across the company have inflation-based escalators in them, which helps us in environments like the one we may see play out here in the next couple of years. But we're really just, again, trying to pursue the quality business across the portfolio where we can serve the customer well and do that in a way that drives margins and cash for our investors."

Orders were up 30% organically with growth across all segments. In Services, we're up 50%. Industrial revenue grew in 3 of our 4 segments. We saw strength in Healthcare and in Services overall. In Healthcare and Renewables in total as well as in Power Services, revenue was back to levels similar or better to 2019. Notably, Aviation and Commercial Services were up substantially as we're beginning to benefit from the market recovery. Our adjusted Industrial margin expanded 1,000 basis points organically, with year-over-year expansion across all segments and sequential expansion in all segments except Aviation where we took a noncash charge largely related to one customer contract. We expect Aviation margins to expand for the rest of '21. Carolina will cover this in more detail later. 
Adjusted EPS was up significantly with all segments contributing. Industrial free cash flow was up $2 billion, ex discontinued factoring programs, primarily driven by improved earnings and working capital. We're encouraged by our second quarter cash performance. And we're raising our full year Industrial free cash flow outlook to $3.5 billion to $5 billion while our outlook for organic revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted EPS remains unchanged. 
I'll take a moment here to speak to the dynamics at Aviation. Market fundamentals are improving. There was a sizable uptick in departures this quarter with even greater momentum in June and July. Unsurprisingly, departure trends continue to vary by region. North America continues to improve, with Canada now picking up the pace. Europe has accelerated with departures now 40% below '19 levels. China dipped down to 6% below '19 levels due to increased COVID cases and government restrictions, while Asia Pacific ex China has been more tepid due to border closures and the spreading COVID variant. Importantly though, about 2/3 of our CFM departures are concentrated in regions with improved trends. We're seeing a stronger recovery in narrowbody fleets versus widebodies, and freight continues to outperform passenger traffic. While green time utilization continues to impact us, we expect this to lessen in the second half. 
Shop visit volume and scope improved slightly sequentially. We anticipate continuing sequential volume growth and scope expansion through the year. Looking ahead, we're still expecting 21 departures to be up about 20% year-over-year and down 30% versus 2019 with customer behavior driving departure and shop visit trends. 
I'm confident in our path to recovery in Aviation. We're using lean to improve our operations and our cost structure. And no business is better positioned than GE Aviation to support our customers through the upcycle. With the largest and youngest engine platform, with more than 37,000 commercial engines and more than 60% of our fleet not yet having a second shop visit, our platform will generate value for decades to come. 
Overall, we're building momentum across GE, evidenced by the significant margin expansion and positive free cash flow this quarter. And importantly, we continue to believe the improvements underway are built on stronger fundamentals and, thus, are sustainable. 
Turning to Slide 3. We're making tremendous progress in our journey to become a more focused, simpler, stronger high-tech industrial. This quarter, the GECAS and AerCap combination some achieved key milestones. AerCap shareholders approved the transaction. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded its review. And yesterday, the European Commission cleared the transaction. We expect to close by year-end. Broadly speaking, the combination serves as a significant catalyst, enabling us to focus more time, talent and capital on our 4 core Industrial franchises, Aviation, Healthcare, Renewables and Power. It also allows us to accelerate our deleveraging plan. With our actions post-closing, our gross debt reduction will be more than $70 billion since the end of 2018. 
At the same time, we've been strengthening our operational foundation. This starts, of course, with the team. We've implemented new learning and development programs, such as leadership and action in our business and frontline leadership courses to equip GE leaders at all levels to drive our lean transformation. This quarter, we also made some leadership changes that complement our existing bench of GE talent. First is the retirement of Kieran Murphy, who will be stepping down as President and CEO of GE Healthcare at the end of the year. Over his high-impact 30-plus year career, Kieran has embodied candor and transparency and consistently delivered for our customers. I'm excited to welcome Pete Arduini who will join us from Integra Lifesciences where he served as CEO for almost a decade. Earlier in his career, Pete, in fact, worked at GE Healthcare for nearly 15 years. Pete's proven track record of driving growth across complex businesses, combined with his respected leadership style, makes him well suited to lead the important work at GE Healthcare. 
Second is the retirement of Offshore Wind CEO, John Lavelle, after a 40-year career with GE. John has positioned the business for success, leading the GE team that will help install the first large-scale U.S. offshore wind farm. We're excited to appoint Jan TerisGard as the new CEO. With Jan's prior industry experience, he's well prepared to lead our Offshore business to $3 billion in revenue by 2024. 
We also promoted Scott Strazik from Gas Power CEO to CEO of all of GE Power. Scott and his team, which now includes Valerie Margala, who was recently appointed as Steam Power CEO, will continue to run Power as 4 discrete business units, managing from the bottom up. 
Our GE team has been at the heart of driving our transformation forward, building momentum through lean and embracing a more decentralized business model. This quarter, it was good. It was really good to spend more time with our teams where I saw and heard countless Kaizen examples, and more broadly, how lean is being used to improve safety, quality, delivery and cost across GE. 
One example that stood out was from Offshore Wind where we have a global presence across 35 countries. In the first half of '21, through good lean problem-solving and daily management, we realized about $150 million of year-over-year savings in sourcing and logistics as well as through better execution on installation and commissioning cycle times. 
Now decentralization goes hand-in-hand with lean. This means managing not only the 4 Industrial segments we report with the nearly 30 business units under them. In our operating reviews, I continue to see how our teams are managing our operating P&Ls at a more granular level. We're having more meaningful operating reviews, and, in turn, driving actions across high-impact and high-priority opportunities. 
The stronger foundation is enabling us to play more offense. The first priority, of course, is organic growth. We're improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have today. There are many recent wins across GE, but let me highlight 2. At Aviation, CFM secured a new agreement with Indigo to provide 620 of our fuel-efficient LEAP-1A engines with a multiyear service contract. This is one of the largest deals in CFM's history. In Renewables, we finalized the contracts for the world's largest offshore wind farm, Dogger Bank. In the third installment, we'll supply 87 Haliade-X turbines, the most powerful offshore wind turbine built today. We're also bolstering our offerings with new product introductions and future tech innovation to serve our customers and lead our industries into the future. In Healthcare, for example, we launched Accelerus V, an AI-enabled virtual radiology solution that provides simplified workflows, better data access and more time with patients. At Power, we're supporting Australia's energy transition with plans to supply a 9F.05 gas turbine capable of operating with a blend of hydrogen and natural gas at the Tallawarra B power station. This adds to our experience on more than 75 gas turbines worldwide using hydrogen and associated fuels for power generation. 
From time to time, we'll augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments. Take Zionexa, a recent Healthcare acquisition, whose molecular imaging agent aims to provide more targeted treatment for metastatic breast cancer patients. Zionexa further demonstrates our commitment to precision health, enabling more personalized diagnosis, improved treatment in decision-making and ultimately, better clinical outcomes. 
All in all, our transformation is accelerating. We're fortifying our competitive positions globally and unlocking further upside potential and profitable growth and cash generation. With that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter."

During our recent operating reviews, we're gaining traction with increased granularity across our financials. Our finances are providing more insightful, faster analysis, which is driving better outcomes. Looking forward, we're focused on building even deeper visibility and accountability, partnering cross-functionally to unlock margin expansion and improving working capital management to generate more cash flow. 
Now looking at Slide 4, I'll cover our highlights on an organic basis. In the quarter, we returned to growth on the top line. Healthcare and Services overall were strong. In particular, Services continue to keep us close to our customers and represent more than half of our orders and revenue. Total orders were up 7% sequentially. And Aviation and Power were up more than 40% year-over-year. Services orders were up 50%, where Renewables and aviation doubled and Gas Power and Healthcare grew double digits. Revenue was up across Aviation, Healthcare and Renewables. 
Power was flat as expected. We continued to reduce turnkey scope in Gas Power and exit new unit coal and steel. We're also seeing our mix shift towards higher-margin services with total Services revenue growing 15%. Notably, Aviation Commercial Services grew 50%, reflecting a recovering market, but we're still well below '19 levels. Healthcare in total and Gas Power services remain bright spots with growth above 2019. 
Next, adjusted Industrial margins improved sequentially in all segments except Aviation where margins declined. I'll speak to this shortly. Year-over-year, margins expanded 1,000 basis points with all segments expanding. About half of this improvement was driven by nonrepeat of COVID charges, and the other half was driven by our lean efforts, cost productivity and mix shift to services. 
Regarding inflation, we're seeing pressure. However, it's a mixed story by business. Our shorter-cycle businesses feel the impact earliest, while our longer-cycle businesses are more protected given extended purchasing and production cycles. Our Services business fall in between. Across the board, we're driving cost countermeasures and utilizing price increases and escalation features in our contracts to help mitigate this pressure. 
In our longer-cycle project businesses, we manage cost performance versus our original as sold margins. We utilize lean to reduce cost and cycle time to execute delivery. In the second quarter, our countermeasures actually drove a slight net deflation impact on margins. Looking forward to the second half of '21 and into '22, although inflation pressure is likely to increase, particularly in Aviation and Renewables, we expect the net inflation impact to be limited. 
Finally, adjusted EPS was up $0.19 year-over-year. About 3/4 of this improvement came from our Industrial segment. As we walk from continuing to adjusted EPS, we need to exclude the positive baker mark, the negative impact of significant higher-cost restructuring program. nonoperating expenses, primarily pension, and debt tender costs. 
Worth noting for EPS, our reverse stock split takes effect as of marketed August 2. This will better align GE's number of shares outstanding with [indiscernible] our size. Overall, we're encouraged by our broader earnings performance, especially the underlying margin improvement, and we're well positioned to achieve our '21 outlook for margin expansion and EPS. 
Moving to cash. In the second quarter, Industrial free cash flow was positive $388 million, up $2.5 billion year-over-year on a reported basis or up $2 billion excluding discontinued factoring programs in both years. The majority of this improvement was driven by cash earnings with all segments growing earnings. Underpinning our solid quarterly performance versus our earlier expectations was higher Aviation orders and, in turn, higher progress collections and lower AD&A as well as strength at Healthcare and Power. We've made good progress exiting the majority of our factoring programs in the second quarter. This was a big step forward to becoming more operational and getting back-to-basics on billings and collections. For context, currently, about half of our billings occur in the final month of the quarter, driven in part by the timing of deliveries, far too back-end loaded and inconsistent with the lean principles of flow and level loading. 
Our turns across commercial, operations and finance are working to deliver earlier to our customers and, in turn, bill and collect cash earlier in the quarter. Over time, this will help us generate more linear cash flow. 
The discontinuation of factoring was a $2.7 billion impact, which was adjusted out of free cash flow. For the remainder of '21, the impact will be roughly $1 billion, split between the third and the fourth quarters. 
Going deeper on working capital. This was a source of cash at $260 million this quarter. Despite increased volume, we saw a significant year-over-year improvement, largely due to operational enhancements. 
Looking at [indiscernible] this effort already improved DSO by 7 days. Inventory was the use of cash, largely driven by Onshore Wind inventory build for the second half deliveries as well as fulfillment and execution challenges. Overall, inventory turns improved from 2.4 to 2.6 sequentially with higher volume, but there's much more to do. 
We continue to manage our capital investments with focus on profitable growth. When the second quarter CapEx spend was down sequentially, our investments in new product programs increased. Overall, in the first half, on a reported basis, cash flow was negative $457 million, a $3.8 billion improvement year-over-year. After rebaselining for discontinued factoring programs and the BioPharma sales, we saw a $3.2 billion improvement. So while there's more to do, our near-term working capital improvements are taking hold even as we grow. Together with higher earnings, this is beginning to drive more sustainable and linear free cash flow. And based on our 2Q performance, we're now confident that we can deliver free cash flow in the range of $3.5 billion to $5 billion for the year versus our prior outlook of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. 
Turning to liquidity and leverage on Slide 6. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of cash and recently refinanced our backup credit facility. Due to our improved financial position and cash linearity with lower prequarterly needs, we reduced the facility size from $15 billion to $10 billion and extended the maturity date to 2026 at attractive pricing. We also continue to take meaningful actions on our deleveraging plan, completing a $7 billion debt tender. This brings our gross debt, which currently includes pension, to a reduction of $53 billion since the end of 2018. 
Additionally, we continue to derisk the pension. In the U.K., as of January 2022, we implement the proposed pension freeze. As mentioned previously, we don't expect any further funding requirement for the GE pension plan at least through the end of the decade. Stepping back, we have a clear path to achieving less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA over the next few years. 
Moving to our business results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First, on Aviation. As Larry shared, we're starting to see improving fundamentals associated with the commercial market recovery across Services and OE production. The market's sequential improvement met our expectations with GE CFM departures currently down about 27% versus '19. While departure trends continue to vary by region, we still expect the global recovery to accelerate in the second half. 
Orders were up year-over-year. Both Commercial Engines and Services were up substantially year-over-year. Key commercial wins this quarter include Indigo, Southwest and United driving momentum. In fact, since the beginning of '20, new wins have now outpaced canceled orders. Military orders were down, largely due to timing of new orders and a tough comp versus last year. And you'll recall, we received a large military advance. Revenue was up 10%. Commercial Services was up 50% with operational improvement. Shop visit volume trended better than our expectations, up over 30%. And overall scope was up slightly sequentially. Broadly, we're seeing higher concentration of narrowbody visits, which typically have lower revenue. Our spare part rate was up double digits year-over-year and sequentially. This was partially offset by unfavorable CSA contract margin reviews, or CMRs, where revenue is adjusted to reflect latest margins based on cost incurred to date. 
Military continues to be impacted by internal and external supply chain issues with output expectations falling short this quarter. We're seeing some improvement as we use visual management and standard work and also other tools to solve problems in real time, and we're working to fully resolve these issues. We're now targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth for the year, but our high single-digit target remains in place through '25. 
Segment margin expanded significantly year-over-year, yet down sequentially. Margin was impacted by the noncash contract margin review charges of approximately $400 million. About 2/3 of this was related to 1 contract in a loss position. In this contract, continued COVID-driven utilization, contract-specific dynamics and operating behavior increased our estimated shop visit costs. While rare across our Service portfolio, the loss contract designation resulted in the accelerated recognition of all future forecasted losses into 2Q. Excluding this, Aviation margins would have been low double digits. Quarterly CMRs are part of our normal process and will continue in the second half. For Q2 -- for Q3, we expect margins to expand sequentially. 
Our team continues to align fixed costs and our organizational profile to market realities. We're maintaining our low double-digit margin guide for '21, supported by a second half recovery. However, based on the CMR and military dynamics, we now expect full year revenue growth to be about flat versus '20. These are temporary issues, and we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals of our business. 
Moving to Healthcare. Market fundamentals are improving and the team delivered another impressive quarter. Starting with the market. Global procedures volume grew mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. Europe, China and Japan were solid markets due to government spending, a sign of increasing expectations for better quality of care and patient outcomes. Private markets also grew in the U.S. across key customers as recovery momentum continues. 
Demand remains robust amid that backdrop. Orders were up double digits year-over-year and versus second quarter '19 and up 20%, excluding the Ford ventilator partnership last year. Healthcare system orders were up 7% with double-digit growth in imaging and ultrasound. This offsets a decline in Life Care Solutions, lapping higher demand for COVID-19-related equipment. However, LCS was up double digits versus second quarter '19. PDx orders were up almost 50% year-over-year, following a depressed second quarter '20 and also up versus second quarter '19. Revenue was also up double digits, with HCS up 6% and PDx up almost 50%. All Asia regions delivered double-digit growth, with China up high teens. The teams worked across the supply chain to help mitigate industry-wide supply shortages related to electronics and resins, which impacted growth this quarter. 
Segment margin expanded 460 basis points year-over-year and significantly versus second quarter '19 ex BioPharma. Margin continues to be driven by profitable growth, cost productivity through lean and prior-period restructuring. At the same time, we're accelerating our growth investment, particularly in digital and AI-enabled applications with increased spend planned for the second half. And we'll continue to evaluate inorganic investments to complement this, such as Zionexa. Based on our first half, we now expect organic margins to expand more than 100 basis points for the year. This will be influenced by how quickly we can ramp certain growth investment. However, our medium-term expectations remain 25 to 75 basis points expansion. Our investment ramp will support continued innovation and help us drive higher revenue growth over time. 
Turning to Renewables. We're continuing to lead the energy transition, growing new generation, lowering the cost of electricity and modernizing the grid with a focus on new product platforms and technologies that enables profitable growth and cash generation over time. 
Looking at the market. In Onshore Wind, we still expect the U.S. market to decline in the near term before stabilizing. We're watching the potential U.S. production tax credit extension closely. A blanket long-term extension likely result in near-term uncertainty because it pushes out investment decisions for what could be years. This may impact our second half orders profile and positive free cash flow outlook for the year. 
In Offshore Wind, global momentum should continue through the decade. The recent U.S. federal approval of the Vineyard Winds project supported by our Haliade-X represents meaningful progress for the U.S. market. And as the global energy transition accelerates and government stimulus increases, the grid will need to be upgraded and more actively managed. 
Orders grew mid-single digits where onshore services more than doubled as repower orders increased, which will convert to second half deliveries. This was partially offset by lower onshore equipment orders due to PTC dynamics. While both onshore and offshore equipment orders are lumpy, we expect them to increase significantly in the second half versus first half. 
Revenue was up 9%, driven by higher equipment revenue, offset by lower Services. And reported equipment was up 12% on a 2-year view versus '19. In onshore, equipment was up year-over-year on higher international unit deliveries while Services were down on fewer repower upgrades, though up sequentially. And Services ex repower grew double digits again. Segment margin, while still negative, improved more than 500 basis points as we drive towards segment profitability over time. Onshore was profitable in the quarter and year-to-date. This was driven by continued cost out and volume leverage that more than offset mix and other headwinds, such as lower margin on new products, which typically improves our product life cycle. In grid, cost productivity was offset by elevated restructuring. Looking ahead, we're focused on our operational priority, including cost reduction to help offset increased medium-term headwinds from the market inflation and new technology and platform transitions. 
Moving to Power. The segment performed very well with operational improvements across the business, particularly at Gas Power. Looking at the market. Global gas generation grew low single digits while GE gas turbine utilization continued to be resilient with megawatt hours growing high single digits. Encouragingly, outage starts were up 50% year-over-year and up mid-single digits versus 2Q '19. For the year, we expect the gas market to remain stable with gas generation growing low single digits. The dispatch of our fleet is well positioned with upgraded missions and a growing HA backlog. Outside of gas, markets remain mixed. 
Power orders were up significantly, driven by Gas Power equipment. This quarter, we booked 12 heavy-duty gas turbines and 35 aeroderivative orders, primarily LM, that will complement variable renewable power by providing distributed fast-response power to help deliver grid stability. Orders were also up in Gas Power services, Steel, Power Conversion and Nuclear. 
Power revenue was flat, with Gas Power declined while Power Conversion grew. Gas Power was down slightly, largely driven by equipment were similar to last quarter, we had lower turnkey scope projects. We also shipped 6 fewer heavy-duty gas turbines. Gas Power services was up significantly across both sales and transactional portfolios, primarily due to higher outages. And Services growth is trending better than our initial outlook. 
Power Conversion was up with its highest quarterly sales level since third quarter '18. And while steel was down slightly, Services returned to pre-COVID level. 
Total Power margins expanded roughly 900 basis points and improved sequentially. Gas Power has through stabilized rightsizing the cost structure, improving underwriting and operating better with lean. Margins were positive, largely driven by service equipment mix and lower costs. Now Q3 is typically our toughest service quarter with lower activity compared to the spring and the fall outage season, which are in the second and the fourth quarter, respectively. But we're confident in our high single-digit margin outlook for the year. 
Steel was negatively impacted by COVID in India, which drove work stoppages and delayed project execution. But we're on track with the planned exit of newbuild coal. Just over half of the planned $600 million to $700 million cash actions from restructuring, legal and project closeout were realized in the first half. Once the exit is completed, steel will be 2/3 Services. Overall, Power is on track to deliver the outlook target and high single-digit operating margins over time. 
Moving to GE Capital on Slide 8. Continuing adjusted earnings were positive $28 million, a significant improvement year-over-year. This was primarily driven by lower marks and impairments as well as higher gains at EFS, better performance at insurance and the discontinuation of preferred dividend payment, which are now a GE Industrial obligation. [indiscernible] we saw positive investment results and lower claims continue. However, favorable trends due to COVID are slowing in certain parts of the portfolio. And EFS enables $1.1 billion of orders, supporting customers at Renewables and Gas, including third-party financing. Based on our first half, we expect to reach the better end of our earnings outlook of negative $700 million to negative $500 million. Within discontinued operations, capital reported a loss of approximately $600 million, primarily due to the recent decline of AerCap stock price, which is updated quarterly. 
Moving to Corporate. Costs were up slightly given the variable nature of EHS and other and the elimination activities. Importantly, functional cost and operations were better. In the first half, total costs were down more than 20% as we improved functions and operations and digital operations. Moving forward, our focus on decentralization and linear processes continues, which will drive cost and cash improvement. For the year, we're on track for the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of costs. In all, we delivered a strong quarter. I'm encouraged by the work underway at Aviation, the ongoing strength in Healthcare and our progress at Renewables and Power. Now Larry, back to you."

As you've seen, orders and revenue returned to growth, operating margin expanded across all segments, and we generated positive free cash flow. Importantly, Aviation is showing the early signs of a recovery. And we're clearly building momentum across our businesses. 
Combined, this gives us the conviction to raise our free cash flow outlook to $3.5 billion to $5 billion for the full year. So I hope you see what I see, a transformation that is accelerating. GE is becoming a more focused, simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial. And our efforts and impact extend beyond GE. We've always felt a heightened sense of responsibility when it comes to creating a more sustainable future. We recently released our annual sustainability report this month, which shares how we're tackling the world's biggest challenges through innovative solutions, developing the future of flight, advancing precision health and leading the energy transition. For example, the CFM RISE program that we've announced with Safran demonstrates our shared vision for the future of flight as we target reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions by more than 20% versus today's most efficient engines. 
So as we rise to the challenge of building a world that works, serving customers in vital global markets, we'll stay focused on profitable growth and cash generation, which I'm confident will lead to high single-digit free cash flow margins over the next few years. Steve, with that, let's go to questions."

When we were talking to you mid-quarter, we were expecting around negative $400 million in free cash flow for the quarter. While that was the target we thought was achievable, we clearly came in much better and we were able to do much better. And where did that come from? It's a combination. Both Power and Healthcare continue to be strong, both on profit and on cash. In Aviation, we saw cash come in much better, and that was really twofold. One part was the new orders with progress payments that came. And on the other hand, we had less D&A because our customers didn't ship as many aircraft as expected, and therefore, we paid out less D&A. 
So with that bit, you can say that basically, we're rolling that bit into our updated free cash flow guide, right? So we're raising it from 2.5 to 4.5 to 3.5 to 5 And if you do the midpoint there, you basically see that cash roll through. About half of that improvement comes from earning and half comes from working capital and other offsets. And if we then compare with what happened on earnings, so clearly, on earnings, we also saw the improvement or the strengthening from Power and Healthcare. And we had underlying Aviation as expected.

And what we had in this quarter was a loss contract, and that's very rare. We have about 200 CSA contracts in our portfolio, and only a couple of them are loss-making. And we're not expecting that impact to repeat. I mean the length of the contract is around, what, 15 to 20 years. And the processes we have are rigorous. And the controls are working. And it's really a cross-functional efforts where you can say, R&D operations and commercial are working together to update the estimates with actuals from last year and then making a calculation for what the margin should be. 
So in this quarter with this 1 contract, so that turned into a loss-making contract. What technically happens then is that you don't only update history to that new margin. You also pull forward all the expected or possible losses that you would have going forward on that contract into the second quarter, and that's why it had quite a big impact in the quarter with almost $300 million from that. 
What I would say, though, is that more importantly, is how we're working to improve how we operationally do our services. So we're working to turnaround reducing times. We're working to getting engines back to our customers faster and lowering the cost of our overhauls. So if you think about that, that brings us to a lower cost, lower cash and happier customers. So that's operationally what's really important for us. 
And then your question was what about this going forward? So when we look into the second half, as we've said, we do expect the purchase to improve. And if you look at the Aviation margin in the second quarter, excluding the CMR impact, it would have been 11% plus, so double digits or low double digits. And that's why we're holding the low double-digit margin. And I would say, when we look at the second half, what will impact the second half, we talk about shop

Andrew, we talked about green time earlier. I'd say USM is another one of those variables that sits between a direct one-for-one transfer from departures to our activity. That said, I think that we haven't seen much by way of USM to date. I think as we play forward through the second half of this year and into next year, I think we're anticipating that, that will be a growing but still a modest headwind for us. So we maybe trade out a little less green time for a little bit more USM. But keep in mind as well, USM doesn't happen to GE Aviation. We're an active consumer, user of USM as well. So it will help us in some respects, lower our costs with respect to the delivered services we provide our airline customers. So a number of dynamics there, but certainly one that we have an eye on as well as we think about the back half, but maybe more importantly, '22."

We started the year with almost $7 billion in factor receivables. We took $800 million of that out in the first quarter. You saw us take another $2.7 billion out now. And we have about $1 billion to go until year-end. And then we'll end the year with around $2 billion, which is what we've talked about, right? So that's how you get to those numbers. You're absolutely correct. 
When it comes to progress, so if you look at the quarter this year, you have to compare to -- well, progress last year because you sort of look at the delta here, progress last year was including the big military progress payment that we got, which obviously didn't repeat now in the quarter. This quarter, we had a lot of deliverables in Renewables, so basically taking down progress, and that's really why it was negative compared to the deliverables. For the rest of the year, well, that will depend a bit on the dynamics of the PTC because we've talked about that the biggest variable for our guide, the cash guidance $3.5 billion to $5 billion. One of the big parts there is the PTC dynamic and if that will change our customer behavior so that they will push out the orders that we were expecting to be placed before year-end to next year. And the other one on progress will obviously be also depending on Aviation and how that plays out over the second half of the year."

More importantly, we're late with the customer in a number of instances. I think as we look at business that we might have lost, I'm not sure we can really pinpoint particular orders that went elsewhere because our lead times have been pushed, again, because I don't think this is an isolated GE dynamic.

Now that will be more a first half result than it will be the second half. But we do see, I think, higher outages with the contractual business. I think the teams on the transactional side are doing a better job day in, day out. We had a higher backlog coming into the year. I like the execution improvements that we're seeing largely by way of lean. And in turn, I think as we put more emphasis on the top, you're also seeing that flow through to the bottom, which is part of the reason we're seeing the strong margin improvements in Gas and in Power broadly not only year-over-year, but again, with respect to the comparison versus 2019 where, for the segment, I think the margins are up now over 600 basis points versus the second quarter of 2019.

Overall, we delivered a strong second quarter and first half performance, and we're encouraged by the early signs of the recovery. Looking at the numbers on Slide 2. Recall that the second quarter of 2020 was challenging as we navigated the full negative effects of the pandemic. While we recognize that many are still facing continued challenges with new COVID spikes and variants, we're seeing our businesses return to growth this quarter. Orders were up 30% organically with growth across all segments. In services, we're up 50%. Industrial revenue grew in 3 of our 4 segments. We saw strength in Healthcare and in services overall. 
In Healthcare and Renewables in total as well as in Power Services, revenue was back to levels similar or better to 2019. Notably, Aviation and Commercial Services were up substantially as we're beginning to benefit from the market recovery. Our adjusted Industrial margin expanded 1,000 basis points organically, with year-over-year expansion across all segments and sequential expansion in all segments except Aviation where we took a noncash charge largely related to one customer contract. We expect Aviation margins to expand for the rest of '21. Carolina will cover this in more detail later.  
Adjusted EPS was up significantly with all segments contributing. Industrial free cash flow was up $2 billion, ex discontinued factoring programs, primarily driven by improved earnings and working capital. We're encouraged by our second quarter cash performance. And we're raising our full year Industrial free cash flow outlook to $3.5 billion to $5 billion while our outlook for organic revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted EPS remains unchanged.  
I'll take a moment here to speak to the dynamics at Aviation. Market fundamentals are improving. There was a sizable uptick in departures this quarter, with even greater momentum in June and July. Unsurprisingly, departure trends continue to vary by region. North America continues to improve, with Canada now picking up the pace. Europe has accelerated with departures now 40% below '19 levels. China dipped down to 6% below '19 levels due to increased COVID cases and government restrictions, while Asia Pacific ex China has been more tepid due to border closures and the spreading COVID variant. Importantly though, about 2/3 of our CFM departures are concentrated in regions with improved trends. We're seeing a stronger recovery in narrowbody fleets versus widebodies, and freight continues to outperform passenger traffic. While green time utilization continues to impact us, we expect this to lessen in the second half.  
Shop visit volume and scope improved slightly sequentially. We anticipate continuing sequential volume growth and scope expansion through the year. Looking ahead, we're still expecting '21 departures to be up about 20% year-over-year and down 30% versus 2019, with customer behavior driving departure and shop visit trends.  
I'm confident in our path to recovery in Aviation. We're using lean to improve our operations and our cost structure. And no business is better positioned than GE Aviation to support our customers through the upcycle, with the largest and youngest engine platform, with more than 37,000 commercial engines and more than 60% of our fleet not yet having a second shop visit, our platform will generate value for decades to come.  
Overall, we're building momentum across GE, evidenced by the significant margin expansion and positive free cash flow this quarter. And importantly, we continue to believe the improvements underway are built on stronger fundamentals and, thus, are sustainable.  
Turning to Slide 3. We're making tremendous progress in our journey to become a more focused, simpler, stronger high-tech industrial. This quarter, the GECAS and AerCap combination achieved some key milestones: AerCap shareholders approved the transaction; the U.S. Department of Justice concluded its review; and yesterday, the European Commission cleared the transaction. We expect to close by year-end. Broadly speaking, this combination serves as a significant catalyst, enabling us to focus more time, talent and capital on our 4 core Industrial franchises: Aviation, Healthcare, Renewables and Power. It also allows us to accelerate our deleveraging plan. With our actions post closing, our gross debt reduction will be more than $70 billion since the end of 2018.  
At the same time, we've been strengthening our operational foundation. This starts, of course, with the team. We've implemented new learning and development programs, such as leadership and action in our business and frontline leadership courses to equip GE leaders at all levels to drive our lean transformation. This quarter, we also made some leadership changes that complement our existing bench of GE talent. First is the retirement of Kieran Murphy, who will be stepping down as President and CEO of GE Healthcare at the end of the year. Over his high-impact 30-plus year career, Kieran has embodied candor and transparency and consistently delivered for our customers. I'm excited to welcome Pete Arduini, who will join us from Integra LifeSciences, where he served as CEO for almost a decade. Earlier in his career, Pete, in fact, worked at GE Healthcare for nearly 15 years. Pete's proven track record of driving growth across complex businesses, combined with his respected leadership style, makes him well suited to lead the important work at GE Healthcare.  
Second is the retirement of Offshore Wind CEO, John Lavelle, after a 40-year career with GE. John has positioned the business for success, leading the GE team that will help install the first large-scale U.S. offshore wind farm. We're excited to appoint Jan Kjaersgaard as the new CEO. With Jan's prior industry experience, he's well prepared to lead our offshore business to $3 billion in revenue by 2024.  
We also promoted Scott Strazik from Gas Power CEO to CEO of all of GE Power. Scott and his team, which now includes Valérie Marjollet, who was recently appointed as Steam Power CEO, will continue to run Power as 4 discrete business units, managing from the bottom up.  
Our GE team has been at the heart of driving our transformation forward, building momentum through lean and embracing a more decentralized business model. This quarter, it was good. It was really good to spend more time with our teams where I saw and heard countless Kaizen examples, and more broadly, how lean is being used to improve safety, quality, delivery and cost across GE.  
One example that stood out was from Offshore Wind where we have a global presence across 35 countries. In the first half of '21, through good lean problem-solving and daily management, we realized about $150 million of year-over-year savings in sourcing and logistics as well as through better execution on installation and commissioning cycle times.  
Now decentralization goes hand in hand with lean. This means managing not only the 4 Industrial segments we report with the nearly 30 business units under them. In our operating reviews, I continue to see how our teams are managing our operating P&Ls at a more granular level. We're having more meaningful operating reviews and, in turn, driving actions across high-impact and high-priority opportunities.  
The stronger foundation is enabling us to play more offense. The first priority, of course, is organic growth. We're improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have today. There are many recent wins across GE, but let me highlight two. At Aviation, CFM secured a new agreement with IndiGo to provide 620 of our fuel-efficient LEAP-1A engines with a multiyear service contract. This is one of the largest deals in CFM's history. In Renewables, we finalized the contracts for the world's largest offshore wind farm, Dogger Bank. In the third installment, we'll supply 87 Haliade-X turbines, the most powerful offshore wind turbine built today. 
We're also bolstering our offerings with new product introductions and future tech innovation to serve our customers and lead our industries into the future. In Healthcare, for example, we launched Xeleris V, an AI-enabled virtual radiology solution that provides simplified workflows, better data access and more time with patients. At Power, we're supporting Australia's energy transition with plans to supply a 9F.05 gas turbine capable of operating with a blend of hydrogen and natural gas at the Tallawarra B Power Station. This adds to our experience on more than 75 gas turbines worldwide using hydrogen and associated fuels for power generation.  
From time to time, we'll augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments. Take Zionexa, a recent Healthcare acquisition, whose molecular imaging agent aims to provide more targeted treatment for metastatic breast cancer patients. Zionexa further demonstrates our commitment to precision health, enabling more personalized diagnosis, improved treatment and decision-making and ultimately, better clinical outcomes.  
All in all, our transformation is accelerating. We're fortifying our competitive positions globally and unlocking further upside potential and profitable growth and cash generation. With that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter."

During our recent operating reviews, we're gaining traction with increased granularity across our financials. Our finance teams are providing more insightful, faster analysis, which is driving better outcomes. Looking forward, we're focused on building even deeper visibility and accountability, partnering cross-functionally to unlock margin expansion and improving working capital management to generate more cash flow.  
Now looking at Slide 4, I'll cover our highlights on an organic basis. In the quarter, we returned to growth on the top line. Healthcare and services overall were strong. In particular, services continue to keep us close to our customers and represent more than half of our orders and revenue. Total orders were up 7% sequentially. And Aviation and Power were up more than 40% year-over-year. Services orders were up 50%, where Renewables and Aviation doubled and Gas Power and Healthcare grew double digits. Revenue was up across Aviation, Healthcare and Renewables.  
Power was flat as expected. We continued to reduce turnkey scope in Gas Power and exit new unit coal at Steam. We're also seeing our mix shift towards higher-margin services, with total services revenue growing 15%. Notably, Aviation Commercial Services grew 50%, reflecting a recovering market, but we're still well below '19 levels.  Healthcare in total and Gas Power services remain bright spots with growth above 2019.  
Next, adjusted Industrial margins improved sequentially in all segments except Aviation where margins declined. I'll speak to this shortly. Year-over-year, margins expanded 1,000 basis points with all segments expanding. About half of this improvement was driven by nonrepeat of COVID charges, and the other half was driven by our lean efforts, cost productivity and mix shift to services.  
Regarding inflation, we're seeing pressure. However, it's a mixed story by business. Our shorter-cycle businesses feel the impact earliest, while our longer-cycle businesses are more protected given extended purchasing and production cycles. Our services business fall in between. Across the board, we're driving cost countermeasures and utilizing price increases and escalation features in our contracts to help mitigate this pressure.  
In our longer-cycle project businesses, we manage cost performance versus our original as-sold margins. We utilize lean to reduce cost and cycle time to execute delivery. In the second quarter, our countermeasures actually drove a slight net deflation impact on margins. Looking forward to the second half of '21 and into '22, although inflation pressure is likely to increase, particularly in Aviation and Renewables, we expect the net inflation impact to be limited.  
Finally, adjusted EPS was up $0.19 year-over-year. About 3/4 of this improvement came from our Industrial segment. As we walk from continuing to adjusted EPS, we need to exclude the positive data mark, the negative impact of significant higher-cost restructuring program, nonoperating expenses, primarily pension, and debt tender costs. Worth noting for EPS, our reverse stock split takes effect as of market open August 2. This will better align GE's number of shares outstanding with companies of our size. Overall, we're encouraged by our broader earnings performance, especially the underlying margin improvement, and we're well positioned to achieve our '21 outlook for margin expansion and EPS.  
Moving to cash. In the second quarter, Industrial free cash flow was positive $388 million, up $2.5 billion year-over-year on a reported basis or up $2 billion excluding discontinued factoring programs in both years. The majority of this improvement was driven by cash earnings with all segments growing earnings. Underpinning our solid quarterly performance versus our earlier expectations was higher Aviation orders and, in turn, higher progress collections and lower AD&A as well as strength at Healthcare and Power. 
We've made good progress exiting the majority of our factoring programs in the second quarter. This was a big step forward to becoming more operational and getting back to basics on billings and collections. For context, currently, about half of our billings occur in the final month of the quarter, driven in part by the timing of deliveries, far too back-end loaded and inconsistent with the lean principles of flow and level loading.  
Our turns across commercial, operations and finance are working to deliver earlier to our customers and, in turn, bill and collect cash earlier in the quarter. Over time, this will help us generate more linear cash flow.  
The discontinuation of factoring was a $2.7 billion impact, which was adjusted out of free cash flow. For the remainder of '21, the impact will be roughly $1 billion, split between the third and the fourth quarters.  
Going deeper on working capital. This was a source of cash at $260 million this quarter. Despite increased volume, we saw a significant year-over-year improvement, largely due to operational enhancements.  
Looking at the flows in the quarter. I'll speak to a couple. Receivables were a source of cash, driven by DSO improvement across all segments. Take our Imaging and Life Care Solutions business in the U.S. and Canada, for example. Our turns are using lean and automation to better manage contract deliverables, build customers more accurately and faster and thereby generate cash quicker.  This effort already improved DSO by 7 days. Inventory was a use of cash, largely driven by Onshore Wind inventory build for the second half deliveries as well as fulfillment and execution challenges. Overall, inventory turns improved from 2.4 to 2.6 sequentially with higher volume, but there's much more to do.  
We continue to manage our capital investments with focus on profitable growth. When the second quarter CapEx spend was down sequentially, our investments in new product programs increased. Overall, in the first half, on a reported basis, cash flow was negative $457 million, a $3.8 billion improvement year-over-year. After rebaselining for discontinued factoring programs and the BioPharma sale, we saw a $3.2 billion improvement. So while there's more to do, our near-term working capital improvements are taking hold even as we grow. Together with higher earnings, this is beginning to drive more sustainable and linear free cash flow. And based on our 2Q performance, we're now confident that we can deliver free cash flow in the range of $3.5 billion to $5 billion for the year versus our prior outlook of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion.  
Turning to liquidity and leverage on Slide 6. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of cash and recently refinanced our backup credit facility. Due to our improved financial position and cash linearity with lower peak quarterly needs, we reduced the facility size from $15 billion to $10 billion and extended the maturity date to 2026 at attractive pricing. We also continue to take meaningful actions on our deleveraging plan, completing a $7 billion debt tender. This brings our gross debt, which currently includes pension, to a reduction of $53 billion since the end of 2018.  
Additionally, we continue to derisk the pension. In the U.K., as of January 2022, we implement the proposed pension freeze. As mentioned previously, we don't expect any further funding requirements for the GE pension plan at least through the end of the decade.  Stepping back, we have a clear path to achieving less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA over the next few years.  
Moving to our business results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First, on Aviation. As Larry shared, we're starting to see improving fundamentals associated with the commercial market recovery across services and OE production. The market's sequential improvement met our expectations, with GE CFM departures currently down about 27% versus '19. While departure trends continue to vary by region, we still expect the global recovery to accelerate in the second half.  
Orders were up year-over-year. Both Commercial Engines and Services were up substantially year-over-year. Key commercial wins this quarter include IndiGo, Southwest and United driving momentum. In fact, since the beginning of '20, new wins have now outpaced canceled orders. Military orders were down, largely due to timing of new orders and a tough comp versus last year. And you'll recall, we received a large military advance. Revenue was up 10%. Commercial Services was up 50% with operational improvement. Shop visit volume trended better than our expectations, up over 30%. And overall scope was up slightly sequentially. Broadly, we're seeing higher concentration of narrowbody visits, which typically have lower revenue. Our spare part rate was up double digits year-over-year and sequentially. This was partially offset by unfavorable CSA contract margin reviews, or CMRs, where revenue is adjusted to reflect latest margins based on cost incurred to date.  
Military continues to be impacted by internal and external supply chain issues, with output expectations falling short this quarter. We're seeing some improvement as we use visual management and standard work and also other tools to solve problems in real time, and we're working to fully resolve these issues. We're now targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth for the year, but our high single-digit target remains in place through '25.  
Segment margin expanded significantly year-over-year, yet down sequentially. Margin was impacted by the noncash contract margin review charges of approximately $400 million. About 2/3 of this was related to one contract in a loss position. In this contract, continued COVID-driven utilization, contract-specific dynamics and operating behavior increased our estimated shop visit costs. While rare across our service portfolio, the loss contract designation resulted in the accelerated recognition of all future forecasted losses into 2Q. Excluding this, Aviation margins would have been low double digits. Quarterly CMRs are part of our normal process and will continue in the second half. For Q2 -- for Q3, we expect margins to expand sequentially.  
Our team continues to align fixed costs and our organizational profile to market realities. We're, maintaining our low double-digit margin guide for '21, supported by a second half recovery. However, based on the CMR and military dynamics, we now expect full year revenue growth to be about flat versus '20. These are temporary issues, and we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals of our business.  
Moving to Healthcare. Market fundamentals are improving and the team delivered another impressive quarter. Starting with the market. Global procedures volume grew mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. Europe, China and Japan were solid markets due to government spending, a sign of increasing expectations for better quality of care and patient outcomes. Private markets also grew in the U.S. across key customers as recovery momentum continues. Demand remains robust amid that backdrop. Orders were up double digits year-over-year and versus second quarter '19 and up 20%, excluding the Ford ventilator partnership last year. 
Healthcare system orders were up 7% with double-digit growth in imaging and ultrasound. This offsets a decline in Life Care Solutions, lapping higher demand for COVID-19-related equipment. However, LCS was up double digits versus second quarter '19. PDx orders were up almost 50% year-over-year, following a depressed second quarter '20 and also up versus second quarter '19. Revenue was also up double digits, with HCS up 6% and PDx up almost 50%. All Asia regions delivered double-digit growth, with China up high teens. The teams worked across the supply chain to help mitigate industry-wide supply shortages related to electronics and resins, which impacted growth this quarter.  
Segment margin expanded 460 basis points year-over-year and significantly versus second quarter '19 ex BioPharma. Margin continues to be driven by profitable growth, cost productivity through lean and prior period restructuring. At the same time, we're accelerating our growth investment, particularly in digital and AI-enabled applications with increased spend planned for the second half. And we'll continue to evaluate inorganic investments to complement this, such as Zionexa. Based on our first half, we now expect organic margins to expand more than 100 basis points for the year. This will be influenced by how quickly we can ramp certain growth investment. However, our medium-term expectations remain 25 to 75 basis points expansion. Our investment ramp will support continued innovation and help us drive higher revenue growth over time.  
Turning to Renewables. We're continuing to lead the energy transition, growing new generation, lowering the cost of electricity and modernizing the grid with a focus on new product platforms and technologies that enables profitable growth and cash generation over time.  
Looking at the market. In Onshore Wind, we still expect the U.S. market to decline in the near term before stabilizing. We're watching the potential U.S. production tax credit extension closely. A blanket long-term extension likely result in near-term uncertainty because it pushes out investment decisions for what could be years. This may impact our second half orders profile and positive free cash flow outlook for the year.  
In Offshore Wind, global momentum should continue through the decade. The recent U.S. federal approval of the Vineyard Wind project supported by our Haliade-X represents meaningful progress for the U.S. market. And as the global energy transition accelerates and government stimulus increases, the grid will need to be upgraded and more actively managed.  
Orders grew mid-single digits, where onshore services more than doubled as repower orders increased, which will convert to second half deliveries. This was partially offset by lower onshore equipment orders due to PTC dynamics. While both onshore and offshore equipment orders are lumpy, we expect them to increase significantly in the second half versus first half.  
Revenue was up 9%, driven by higher equipment revenue, offset by lower services. And reported equipment was up 12% on a 2-year view versus '19. In onshore, equipment was up year-over-year on higher international unit deliveries while services were down on fewer repower upgrades, though up sequentially. And services ex repower grew double digits again. Segment margin, while still negative, improved more than 500 basis points as we drive towards segment profitability over time. 
Onshore was profitable in the quarter and year-to-date. This was driven by continued cost out and volume leverage that more than offset mix and other headwinds, such as lower margin on new products, which typically improves our product life cycle. In grid, cost productivity was offset by elevated restructuring. Looking ahead, we're focused on our operational priorities, including cost reduction to help offset increased medium-term headwinds from the market inflation and new technology and platform transitions.  
Moving to Power. The team performed very well with operational improvements across the business, particularly at Gas Power. Looking at the market. Global gas generation grew low single digits while GE gas turbine utilization continued to be resilient, with megawatt hours growing high single digits. Encouragingly, outage starts were up 50% year-over-year and up mid-single digits versus 2Q '19. For the year, we expect the gas market to remain stable with gas generation growing low single digits. The dispatch of our fleet is well positioned with upgraded missions and a growing HA backlog. Outside of gas, markets remain mixed.  
Power orders were up significantly, driven by Gas Power equipment. This quarter, we booked 12 heavy-duty gas turbines and 35 aeroderivative orders, primarily LM, that will complement variable renewable power by providing distributed fast-response power to help deliver grid stability. Orders were also up in Gas Power services, Steel, Power Conversion and Nuclear.  
Power revenue was flat, with Gas Power declined while Power Conversion grew. Gas Power was down slightly, largely driven by equipment were similar to last quarter, we had lower turnkey scope projects. We also shipped 6 fewer heavy-duty gas turbines. Gas Power services was up significantly across both CSAs and transactional portfolios, primarily due to higher outages. And services growth is trending better than our initial outlook.  
Power Conversion was up with its highest quarterly sales level since third quarter '18. And while steel was down slightly, services returned to pre-COVID level.  
Total Power margins expanded roughly 900 basis points and improved sequentially. Gas Power has stabilized through rightsizing the cost structure, improving underwriting and operating better with lean. Margins were positive, largely driven by service equipment mix and lower costs. Now Q3 is typically our toughest service quarter with lower activity compared to the spring and the fall outages season, which are in the second and the fourth quarter, respectively. But we're confident in our high single-digit margin outlook for the year.  
Steel was negatively impacted by COVID in India, which drove work stoppages and delayed project execution. But we're on track with the planned exit of newbuild coal. Just over half of the planned $600 million to $700 million cash actions from restructuring, legal and project closeout were realized in the first half. Once the exit is completed, steel will be 2/3 services. Overall, Power is on track to deliver the outlook target and high single-digit operating margins over time.  
Moving to GE Capital on Slide 8. Continuing adjusted earnings were positive $28 million, a significant improvement year-over-year. This was primarily driven by lower marks and impairments as well as higher gains at EFS, better performance at Insurance and the discontinuation of preferred dividend payment, which are now a GE Industrial obligation. At Insurance, we saw positive investment results and lower claims continue. However, favorable claims trends due to COVID are slowing in certain parts of the portfolio. And EFS enabled $1.1 billion of orders, supporting customers at Renewables and Gas, including third-party financing. 
Based on our first half, we expect to reach the better end of our earnings outlook of negative $700 million to negative $500 million. Within discontinued operations, Capital reported a loss of approximately $600 million, primarily due to the recent decline of AerCap stock price, which is updated quarterly. 
Moving to Corporate. Costs were up slightly given the variable nature of EHS and other and the elimination activity. Importantly, functional cost and operations were better. In the first half, total costs were down more than 20% as we improved functions and operations and digital operations. Moving forward, our focus on decentralization and linear processes continues, which will drive cost and cash improvement. For the year, we're on track for the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of costs. In all, we delivered a strong quarter. I'm encouraged by the work underway at Aviation, the ongoing strength in Healthcare and our progress at Renewables and Power. Now Larry, back to you."

I'm incredibly proud of the GE team performance in the second quarter. As you've seen, orders and revenue returned to growth, operating margin expanded across all segments and we generated positive free cash flow. Importantly, Aviation is showing the early signs of a recovery. And we're clearly building momentum across our businesses. 
Combined, this gives us the conviction to raise our free cash flow outlook to $3.5 billion to $5 billion for the full year. So I hope you see what I see, a transformation that is accelerating. GE is becoming a more focused, simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial. And our efforts and impact extend beyond GE. We've always felt a heightened sense of responsibility when it comes to creating a more sustainable future. We recently released our annual sustainability report this month, which shares how we're tackling the world's biggest challenges through innovative solutions, developing the future of flight, advancing precision health and leading the energy transition. For example, the CFM RISE program that we've announced with Safran demonstrates our shared vision for the future of flight as we target reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions by more than 20% versus today's most efficient engines. 
So as we rise to the challenge of building a world that works, serving customers in vital global markets, we'll stay focused on profitable growth and cash generation, which I'm confident will lead to high single-digit free cash flow margins over the next few years. Steve, with that, let's go to questions."

So could you give us more color where cash has been trending better than your expectations? It looks like Aviation and Healthcare seem ahead.

177031,1674471605,2351657,"General Electric Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Andy, that will be my pleasure. So let me start with the second quarter and what happened in the second quarter. When we were talking to you mid-quarter, we were expecting around negative $400 million in free cash flow for the quarter. While that was the",333,"Andy, that will be my pleasure. So let me start with the second quarter and what happened in the second quarter. When we were talking to you mid-quarter, we were expecting around negative $400 million in free cash flow for the quarter. While that was the target we thought was achievable, we clearly came in much better and we were able to do much better. And where did that come from? It's a combination. Both Power and Healthcare continue to be strong, both on profit and on cash. In Aviation, we saw cash come in much better, and that was really twofold. One part was the new orders with progress payments that came. And on the other hand, we had less AD&A because our customers didn't ship as many aircraft as expected, and therefore, we paid out less AD&A. 
So with that bit, you can say that basically, we're rolling that bit into our updated free cash flow guide, right? So we're raising it from $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion to $3.5 billion to $5 billion. And if you do the midpoint there, you basically see that cash roll through. About half of that improvement comes from earnings and half comes from working capital and other offsets. And if we then compare with what happened on earnings, so clearly, on earnings, we also saw the improvement or the strengthening from Power and Healthcare. And we had underlying Aviation as expected. What we also had in the quarter was a small charge of $400 million and that's a noncash charge. 
So if you take our guide for EPS, it is $0.15 to $0.25, we are now obviously rolling in the results of the second quarter, including that noncash charge into that number. That said, we do expect to be in the better part of that range for the full year, thanks to the good momentum that we are seeing in the businesses, both on Aviation recovery and the other businesses strengthening their operational performance."

So on the contract margin reviews, I know that you guys do these quarterly. But I remember last year when you were doing your impairment testing, you really made a concerted effort to look at the 20% of your portfolio that was high risk. And so I'm curious, as you kind of think about the expectations for low double-digit Aviation margins for the rest of the year, I'm just wondering what confidence do you have that you won't take another charge on the contract margin reviews? And then any other color that you can provide us on green time utilization impact for the second half and into 2022?"

And what we had in this quarter was a loss contract, and that's very rare. We have about 200 CSA contracts in our portfolio, and only a couple of them are loss-making. And we're not expecting that impact to repeat. I mean the length of the contract is around, what, 15 to 20 years. And the processes we have are rigorous and the controls are working. And it's really a cross-functional efforts where you can say, R&D, operations and commercial are working together to update the estimates with actuals from last year and then making a calculation for what the margin should be. 
So in this quarter with this one contract, so that turned into a loss-making contract. What technically happens then is that you don't only update history to that new margin, you also pull forward all the expected or possible losses that you would have going forward on that contract into the second quarter. And that's why it had such a big impact in the quarter with almost $300 million from that. 
What I would say though is that more importantly, is how we're working to improve how we operationally do our services. So we're working to reducing turnaround times. We're working to getting engines back to our customers faster and lowering the cost of our overhauls. So if you think about that, that brings us to lower cost, lower cash and happier customers. So that's operationally what's really important for us. 
And then your question was what about this going forward? So when we look into the second half, as we've said, we do expect departures to improve. And if you look at the Aviation margin in the second quarter, excluding the CMR impact, it would have been 11% plus, so double digits or low double digits. And that's why we're holding the low double-digit margin. And I would say, when we look at the second half, what will impact the second half? We talk about shop visit, the volume, the mix, the scope, and we do expect that the shop visit trend will move favorably for us. And then we'll continue to have the quarterly CMR process as is."

So I think our view is that we will continue to see strong year-over-year shop visit numbers. I think we'll see a gradual continuation of the improvement sequentially as well. That suggests a number of these impediments like green time fade with time, but they don't disappear, I think, as we work through the second half. So sequentially, we think we're going to see a continued gradual improvement. We think we will, as Carolina just said, see some slight improvement with respect to scope. All good. We're obviously watching some other variables here like the Delta variant. But at this point, I think we're optimistic about the second half performance in Aviation Services."

But primarily, spare engines are really a function of fleet planning. And given where folks are at this point, both in terms of activity and cash conservation, I think, in part, that's why you see the spares recovery perhaps being a bit more muted than the strong bounce back we're seeing in shop visits. 
Andrew, we talked about green time earlier. I'd say USM is another one of those variables that sits between a direct one-for-one transfer from departures to our activity. That said, I think that we haven't seen much by way of USM to date. I think as we play forward through the second half of this year and into next year, I think we're anticipating that, that will be a growing but still a modest headwind for us. So we maybe trade out a little less green time for a little bit more USM. But keep in mind as well, USM doesn't happen to GE Aviation. We're an active consumer, user of USM as well. So it will help us in some respects, lower our costs with respect to the delivered services we provide our airline customers. So a number of dynamics there, but certainly one that we have an eye on as well as we think about the back half, but maybe more importantly, '22."

I would say all the working capital metrics is perhaps the one that is moving -- well, that's moved the furthest. 
Of course, you have seasonality with the volumes and the different businesses, but that's how I would look at it, to look at traction. And we're very happy to see that, that positive trend has developed over last year with all the work we put into it.

So starting with Onshore Wind, this is the second quarter where we are positive for full Onshore Wind. And that's a significant improvement compared to last year. And we expect to be positive already in 2021 for the full year. And in the second half, we will see -- where we expect to see services come back even more, including more repower, and we will continue our journey to take more costs out. 
Offshore Wind, that's more of the investment for the future. I would say you'll see more of that in our numbers beginning 2022. Grid. In Grid, well, we're continuing the turnaround, and we saw good momentum in that. We see better cost out. We saw better project execution.

But it also gives us comfort that we will be positive in 2022 just building on that momentum of operational improvement. We're cautious of inflation, and we're watching the PTC dynamics and how that will impact us. But we do see good tailwinds from growth, increased services and digital as well as our cost reduction."

And I think the 10-Q says that's down from $6.6 billion on Jan 1 to $3 billion at the end of June. So just confirm that, that's the real metric we should be focused on here. 
And then on the progress, there's been a $1.3 billion headwind in the first half of the year. Just wondering how you see that development in the second half of the year, recognizing that there is some volatility with Renewables. But what's in your plan for the second half on progress?"

We started the year with almost $7 billion in factor receivables. We took $800 million of that out in the first quarter. You saw us take another $2.7 billion out now, and we have about $1 billion to go until year-end. And then we'll end the year with around $2 billion, which is what we've talked about, right? So that's how you get to those numbers. You're absolutely correct. 
When it comes to progress, so if you look at the quarter this year, you have to compare to -- well, progress last year because you sort of look at the delta here, progress last year was including the big military progress payment that we got, which obviously didn't repeat now in the quarter. This quarter, we had a lot of deliverables in Renewables, so basically taking down progress, and that's really why it was negative compared to the deliverables. 
For the rest of the year, well, that will depend a bit on the dynamics of the PTC because we've talked about that the biggest variable for our guide, the cash guidance, that's $3.5 billion to $5 billion. One of the big parts there is the PTC dynamic and if that will change our customer behavior so that they will push out the orders that we were expecting to be placed before year-end to next year. And the other one on progress will obviously be also depending on Aviation and how that plays out over the second half of the year."

So I don't think we're going to try to frame that size-wise. But it did have, I would say, a modest impact on our revenues and our cash this quarter. And we really want to make sure that we're doing all we can, both with the vendor base and, frankly, with our own processes, too. 
To clear that, we don't like the foregone revenue. More importantly, we're late with the customer in a number of instances. I think as we look at business that we might have lost, I'm not sure we can really pinpoint particular orders that went elsewhere because our lead times have been pushed, again, because I don't think this is an isolated GE dynamic. But we're working hard to make sure that, that doesn't happen to the extent we can avoid it in the second half. So it's a day-to-day battle. It's tactical far more than it is strategic on balance.

We do know the second half, given the way COVID played out last year, will present some tougher comps. But I think we're encouraged by both what we saw with CSAs and the transactional activity. As we look to the second half, I think we're in all likelihood going to do better than that low single-digit revenue guide that we talked about for services. 
Now that will be more a first half result than it will be the second half. But we do see, I think, higher outages with the contractual business. I think the teams on the transactional side are doing a better job day in, day out. We had a higher backlog coming into the year. I like the execution improvements that we're seeing largely by way of lean. And in turn, I think as we put more emphasis on the top, you're also seeing that flow through to the bottom, which is part of the reason we're seeing the strong margin improvements in Gas and in Power broadly not only year-over-year, but again, with respect to the comparison versus 2019 where, for the segment, I think the margins are up now over 600 basis points versus the second quarter of 2019.

Overall, we delivered a strong second quarter and first half performance, and we're encouraged by the early signs of the recovery. Looking at the numbers on Slide 2. Recall that the second quarter of 2020 was challenging as we navigated the full negative effects of the pandemic. While we recognize that many are still facing continued challenges with new COVID spikes and variants, we're seeing our businesses return to growth this quarter. Orders were up 30% organically with growth across all segments. In services, we're up 50%. Industrial revenue grew in 3 of our 4 segments. We saw strength in Healthcare and in services overall. 
In Healthcare and Renewables in total as well as in Power Services, revenue was back to levels similar or better to 2019. Notably, Aviation and Commercial Services were up substantially as we're beginning to benefit from the market recovery. Our adjusted Industrial margin expanded 1,000 basis points organically, with year-over-year expansion across all segments and sequential expansion in all segments except Aviation where we took a noncash charge largely related to one customer contract. We expect Aviation margins to expand for the rest of '21. Carolina will cover this in more detail later.  
Adjusted EPS was up significantly with all segments contributing. Industrial free cash flow was up $2 billion, ex discontinued factoring programs, primarily driven by improved earnings and working capital. We're encouraged by our second quarter cash performance. And we're raising our full year Industrial free cash flow outlook to $3.5 billion to $5 billion while our outlook for organic revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted EPS remains unchanged.  
I'll take a moment here to speak to the dynamics at Aviation. Market fundamentals are improving. There was a sizable uptick in departures this quarter, with even greater momentum in June and July. Unsurprisingly, departure trends continue to vary by region. North America continues to improve, with Canada now picking up the pace. Europe has accelerated with departures now 40% below '19 levels. China dipped down to 6% below '19 levels due to increased COVID cases and government restrictions, while Asia Pacific ex China has been more tepid due to border closures and the spreading COVID variant. Importantly though, about 2/3 of our CFM departures are concentrated in regions with improved trends. We're seeing a stronger recovery in narrowbody fleets versus widebodies, and freight continues to outperform passenger traffic. While green time utilization continues to impact us, we expect this to lessen in the second half.  
Shop visit volume and scope improved slightly sequentially. We anticipate continuing sequential volume growth and scope expansion through the year. Looking ahead, we're still expecting '21 departures to be up about 20% year-over-year and down 30% versus 2019, with customer behavior driving departure and shop visit trends.  
I'm confident in our path to recovery in Aviation. We're using lean to improve our operations and our cost structure. And no business is better positioned than GE Aviation to support our customers through the upcycle, with the largest and youngest engine platform, with more than 37,000 commercial engines and more than 60% of our fleet not yet having a second shop visit, our platform will generate value for decades to come.  
Overall, we're building momentum across GE, evidenced by the significant margin expansion and positive free cash flow this quarter. And importantly, we continue to believe the improvements underway are built on stronger fundamentals and, thus, are sustainable.  
Turning to Slide 3. We're making tremendous progress in our journey to become a more focused, simpler, stronger high-tech industrial. This quarter, the GECAS and AerCap combination achieved some key milestones: AerCap shareholders approved the transaction; the U.S. Department of Justice concluded its review; and yesterday, the European Commission cleared the transaction. We expect to close by year-end. Broadly speaking, this combination serves as a significant catalyst, enabling us to focus more time, talent and capital on our 4 core Industrial franchises: Aviation, Healthcare, Renewables and Power. It also allows us to accelerate our deleveraging plan. With our actions post closing, our gross debt reduction will be more than $70 billion since the end of 2018.  
At the same time, we've been strengthening our operational foundation. This starts, of course, with the team. We've implemented new learning and development programs, such as leadership and action in our business and frontline leadership courses to equip GE leaders at all levels to drive our lean transformation. This quarter, we also made some leadership changes that complement our existing bench of GE talent. First is the retirement of Kieran Murphy, who will be stepping down as President and CEO of GE Healthcare at the end of the year. Over his high-impact 30-plus year career, Kieran has embodied candor and transparency and consistently delivered for our customers. I'm excited to welcome Pete Arduini, who will join us from Integra LifeSciences, where he served as CEO for almost a decade. Earlier in his career, Pete, in fact, worked at GE Healthcare for nearly 15 years. Pete's proven track record of driving growth across complex businesses, combined with his respected leadership style, makes him well suited to lead the important work at GE Healthcare.  
Second is the retirement of Offshore Wind CEO, John Lavelle, after a 40-year career with GE. John has positioned the business for success, leading the GE team that will help install the first large-scale U.S. offshore wind farm. We're excited to appoint Jan Kjaersgaard as the new CEO. With Jan's prior industry experience, he's well prepared to lead our offshore business to $3 billion in revenue by 2024.  
We also promoted Scott Strazik from Gas Power CEO to CEO of all of GE Power. Scott and his team, which now includes Valerie Marjollet, who was recently appointed as Steam Power CEO, will continue to run Power as 4 discrete business units, managing from the bottom up.  
Our GE team has been at the heart of driving our transformation forward, building momentum through lean and embracing a more decentralized business model. This quarter, it was good. It was really good to spend more time with our teams where I saw and heard countless Kaizen examples, and more broadly, how lean is being used to improve safety, quality, delivery and cost across GE.  
One example that stood out was from Offshore Wind where we have a global presence across 35 countries. In the first half of '21, through good lean problem-solving and daily management, we realized about $150 million of year-over-year savings in sourcing and logistics as well as through better execution on installation and commissioning cycle times.  
Now decentralization goes hand in hand with lean. This means managing not only the 4 Industrial segments we report with the nearly 30 business units under them. In our operating reviews, I continue to see how our teams are managing our operating P&Ls at a more granular level. We're having more meaningful operating reviews and, in turn, driving actions across high-impact and high-priority opportunities.  
The stronger foundation is enabling us to play more offense. The first priority, of course, is organic growth. We're improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have today. There are many recent wins across GE, but let me highlight two. At Aviation, CFM secured a new agreement with IndiGo to provide 620 of our fuel-efficient LEAP-1A engines with a multiyear service contract. This is one of the largest deals in CFM's history. In Renewables, we finalized the contracts for the world's largest offshore wind farm, Dogger Bank. In the third installment, we'll supply 87 Haliade-X turbines, the most powerful offshore wind turbine built today. 
We're also bolstering our offerings with new product introductions and future tech innovation to serve our customers and lead our industries into the future. In Healthcare, for example, we launched Xeleris V, an AI-enabled virtual radiology solution that provides simplified workflows, better data access and more time with patients. At Power, we're supporting Australia's energy transition with plans to supply a 9F.05 gas turbine capable of operating with a blend of hydrogen and natural gas at the Tallawarra B Power Station. This adds to our experience on more than 75 gas turbines worldwide using hydrogen and associated fuels for power generation.  
From time to time, we'll augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments. Take Zionexa, a recent Healthcare acquisition, whose molecular imaging agent aims to provide more targeted treatment for metastatic breast cancer patients. Zionexa further demonstrates our commitment to precision health, enabling more personalized diagnosis, improved treatment and decision-making and ultimately, better clinical outcomes. All in all, our transformation is accelerating. We're fortifying our competitive positions globally and unlocking further upside potential and profitable growth and cash generation. 
With that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter."

Our quarterly performance reflects continued progress in our transformation. During our recent operating reviews, we're gaining traction with increased granularity across our financials.

During our recent operating reviews, we're gaining traction with increased granularity across our financials. Our finance teams are providing more insightful, faster analysis, which is driving better outcomes. Looking forward, we're focused on building even deeper visibility and accountability, partnering cross-functionally to unlock margin expansion and improving working capital management to generate more cash flow.  
Now looking at Slide 4, I'll cover our highlights on an organic basis. In the quarter, we returned to growth on the top line. Healthcare and services overall were strong. In particular, services continue to keep us close to our customers and represent more than half of our orders and revenue. Total orders were up 7% sequentially. And Aviation and Power were up more than 40% year-over-year. Services orders were up 50%, where Renewables and Aviation doubled and Gas Power and Healthcare grew double digits. Revenue was up across Aviation, Healthcare and Renewables.  
Power was flat as expected. We continued to reduce turnkey scope in Gas Power and exit new unit coal at Steam. We're also seeing our mix shift towards higher-margin services, with total services revenue growing 15%. Notably, Aviation Commercial Services grew 50%, reflecting a recovering market, but we're still well below '19 levels.  Healthcare in total and Gas Power services remain bright spots with growth above 2019.  
Next, adjusted Industrial margins improved sequentially in all segments except Aviation where margins declined. I'll speak to this shortly. Year-over-year, margins expanded 1,000 basis points with all segments expanding. About half of this improvement was driven by nonrepeat of COVID charges, and the other half was driven by our lean efforts, cost productivity and mix shift to services.  
Regarding inflation, we're seeing pressure. However, it's a mixed story by business. Our shorter-cycle businesses feel the impact earliest, while our longer-cycle businesses are more protected given extended purchasing and production cycles. Our services business fall in between. Across the board, we're driving cost countermeasures and utilizing price increases and escalation features in our contracts to help mitigate this pressure.  
In our longer-cycle project businesses, we manage cost performance versus our original as-sold margins. We utilize lean to reduce cost and cycle time to execute delivery. In the second quarter, our countermeasures actually drove a slight net deflation impact on margins. Looking forward to the second half of '21 and into '22, although inflation pressure is likely to increase, particularly in Aviation and Renewables, we expect the net inflation impact to be limited.  
Finally, adjusted EPS was up $0.19 year-over-year. About 3/4 of this improvement came from our Industrial segment. As we walk from continuing to adjusted EPS, we need to exclude the positive data mark, the negative impact of significant higher-cost restructuring program, nonoperating expenses, primarily pension, and debt tender costs. Worth noting for EPS, our reverse stock split takes effect as of market open August 2. This will better align GE's number of shares outstanding with companies of our size. Overall, we're encouraged by our broader earnings performance, especially the underlying margin improvement, and we're well positioned to achieve our '21 outlook for margin expansion and EPS.  
Moving to cash. In the second quarter, Industrial free cash flow was positive $388 million, up $2.5 billion year-over-year on a reported basis or up $2 billion excluding discontinued factoring programs in both years. The majority of this improvement was driven by cash earnings with all segments growing earnings. Underpinning our solid quarterly performance versus our earlier expectations was higher Aviation orders and, in turn, higher progress collections and lower AD&A as well as strength at Healthcare and Power. 
We've made good progress exiting the majority of our factoring programs in the second quarter. This was a big step forward to becoming more operational and getting back to basics on billings and collections. For context, currently, about half of our billings occur in the final month of the quarter, driven in part by the timing of deliveries, far too back-end loaded and inconsistent with the lean principles of flow and level loading.  
Our turns across commercial, operations and finance are working to deliver earlier to our customers and, in turn, bill and collect cash earlier in the quarter. Over time, this will help us generate more linear cash flow.  
The discontinuation of factoring was a $2.7 billion impact, which was adjusted out of free cash flow. For the remainder of '21, the impact will be roughly $1 billion, split between the third and the fourth quarters.  
Going deeper on working capital. This was a source of cash at $260 million this quarter. Despite increased volume, we saw a significant year-over-year improvement, largely due to operational enhancements.  
Looking at the flows in the quarter. I'll speak to a couple. Receivables were a source of cash, driven by DSO improvement across all segments. Take our Imaging and Life Care Solutions business in the U.S. and Canada, for example. Our turns are using lean and automation to better manage contract deliverables, build customers more accurately and faster and thereby generate cash quicker.  This effort already improved DSO by 7 days. Inventory was a use of cash, largely driven by Onshore Wind inventory build for the second half deliveries as well as fulfillment and execution challenges. Overall, inventory turns improved from 2.4 to 2.6 sequentially with higher volume, but there's much more to do.  
We continue to manage our capital investments with focus on profitable growth. When the second quarter CapEx spend was down sequentially, our investments in new product programs increased. Overall, in the first half, on a reported basis, cash flow was negative $457 million, a $3.8 billion improvement year-over-year. After rebaselining for discontinued factoring programs and the BioPharma sale, we saw a $3.2 billion improvement. So while there's more to do, our near-term working capital improvements are taking hold even as we grow. Together with higher earnings, this is beginning to drive more sustainable and linear free cash flow. And based on our 2Q performance, we're now confident that we can deliver free cash flow in the range of $3.5 billion to $5 billion for the year versus our prior outlook of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion.  
Turning to liquidity and leverage on Slide 6. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of cash and recently refinanced our backup credit facility. Due to our improved financial position and cash linearity with lower peak quarterly needs, we reduced the facility size from $15 billion to $10 billion and extended the maturity date to 2026 at attractive pricing. We also continue to take meaningful actions on our deleveraging plan, completing a $7 billion debt tender. This brings our gross debt, which currently includes pension, to a reduction of $53 billion since the end of 2018.  
Additionally, we continue to derisk the pension. In the U.K., as of January 2022, we implement the proposed pension freeze. As mentioned previously, we don't expect any further funding requirements for the GE pension plan at least through the end of the decade.  Stepping back, we have a clear path to achieving less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA over the next few years.  
Moving to our business results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First, on Aviation. As Larry shared, we're starting to see improving fundamentals associated with the commercial market recovery across services and OE production. The market's sequential improvement met our expectations, with GE CFM departures currently down about 27% versus '19. While departure trends continue to vary by region, we still expect the global recovery to accelerate in the second half.  
Orders were up year-over-year. Both Commercial Engines and Services were up substantially year-over-year. Key commercial wins this quarter include IndiGo, Southwest and United driving momentum. In fact, since the beginning of '20, new wins have now outpaced canceled orders. Military orders were down, largely due to timing of new orders and a tough comp versus last year. And you'll recall, we received a large military advance. Revenue was up 10%. Commercial Services was up 50% with operational improvement. Shop visit volume trended better than our expectations, up over 30%. And overall scope was up slightly sequentially. Broadly, we're seeing higher concentration of narrowbody visits, which typically have lower revenue. Our spare part rate was up double digits year-over-year and sequentially. This was partially offset by unfavorable CSA contract margin reviews, or CMRs, where revenue is adjusted to reflect latest margins based on cost incurred to date.  
Military continues to be impacted by internal and external supply chain issues, with output expectations falling short this quarter. We're seeing some improvement as we use visual management and standard work and also other tools to solve problems in real time, and we're working to fully resolve these issues. We're now targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth for the year, but our high single-digit target remains in place through '25.  
Segment margin expanded significantly year-over-year, yet down sequentially. Margin was impacted by the noncash contract margin review charges of approximately $400 million. About 2/3 of this was related to one contract in a loss position. In this contract, continued COVID-driven utilization, contract-specific dynamics and operating behavior increased our estimated shop visit costs. While rare across our service portfolio, the loss contract designation resulted in the accelerated recognition of all future forecasted losses into 2Q. Excluding this, Aviation margins would have been low double digits. Quarterly CMRs are part of our normal process and will continue in the second half. For Q2 -- for Q3, we expect margins to expand sequentially.  
Our team continues to align fixed costs and our organizational profile to market realities. We're, maintaining our low double-digit margin guide for '21, supported by a second half recovery. However, based on the CMR and military dynamics, we now expect full year revenue growth to be about flat versus '20. These are temporary issues, and we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals of our business.  
Moving to Healthcare. Market fundamentals are improving and the team delivered another impressive quarter. Starting with the market. Global procedures volume grew mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. Europe, China and Japan were solid markets due to government spending, a sign of increasing expectations for better quality of care and patient outcomes. Private markets also grew in the U.S. across key customers as recovery momentum continues. Demand remains robust amid that backdrop. Orders were up double digits year-over-year and versus second quarter '19 and up 20%, excluding the Ford ventilator partnership last year. 
Healthcare system orders were up 7% with double-digit growth in imaging and ultrasound. This offsets a decline in Life Care Solutions, lapping higher demand for COVID-19-related equipment. However, LCS was up double digits versus second quarter '19. PDx orders were up almost 50% year-over-year, following a depressed second quarter '20 and also up versus second quarter '19. Revenue was also up double digits, with HCS up 6% and PDx up almost 50%. All Asia regions delivered double-digit growth, with China up high teens. The teams worked across the supply chain to help mitigate industry-wide supply shortages related to electronics and resins, which impacted growth this quarter.  
Segment margin expanded 460 basis points year-over-year and significantly versus second quarter '19 ex BioPharma. Margin continues to be driven by profitable growth, cost productivity through lean and prior period restructuring. At the same time, we're accelerating our growth investment, particularly in digital and AI-enabled applications with increased spend planned for the second half. And we'll continue to evaluate inorganic investments to complement this, such as Zionexa. Based on our first half, we now expect organic margins to expand more than 100 basis points for the year. This will be influenced by how quickly we can ramp certain growth investment. However, our medium-term expectations remain 25 to 75 basis points expansion. Our investment ramp will support continued innovation and help us drive higher revenue growth over time.  
Turning to Renewables. We're continuing to lead the energy transition, growing new generation, lowering the cost of electricity and modernizing the grid with a focus on new product platforms and technologies that enables profitable growth and cash generation over time.  
Looking at the market. In Onshore Wind, we still expect the U.S. market to decline in the near term before stabilizing. We're watching the potential U.S. production tax credit extension closely. A blanket long-term extension likely result in near-term uncertainty because it pushes out investment decisions for what could be years. This may impact our second half orders profile and positive free cash flow outlook for the year.  
In Offshore Wind, global momentum should continue through the decade. The recent U.S. federal approval of the Vineyard Wind project supported by our Haliade-X represents meaningful progress for the U.S. market. And as the global energy transition accelerates and government stimulus increases, the grid will need to be upgraded and more actively managed.  
Orders grew mid-single digits, where onshore services more than doubled as repower orders increased, which will convert to second half deliveries. This was partially offset by lower onshore equipment orders due to PTC dynamics. While both onshore and offshore equipment orders are lumpy, we expect them to increase significantly in the second half versus first half.  
Revenue was up 9%, driven by higher equipment revenue, offset by lower services. And reported equipment was up 12% on a 2-year view versus '19. In onshore, equipment was up year-over-year on higher international unit deliveries while services were down on fewer repower upgrades, though up sequentially. And services ex repower grew double digits again. Segment margin, while still negative, improved more than 500 basis points as we drive towards segment profitability over time. 
Onshore was profitable in the quarter and year-to-date. This was driven by continued cost out and volume leverage that more than offset mix and other headwinds, such as lower margin on new products, which typically improves our product life cycle. In grid, cost productivity was offset by elevated restructuring. Looking ahead, we're focused on our operational priorities, including cost reduction to help offset increased medium-term headwinds from the market inflation and new technology and platform transitions.  
Moving to Power. The team performed very well with operational improvements across the business, particularly at Gas Power. Looking at the market. Global gas generation grew low single digits while GE gas turbine utilization continued to be resilient, with megawatt hours growing high single digits. Encouragingly, outage starts were up 50% year-over-year and up mid-single digits versus 2Q '19. For the year, we expect the gas market to remain stable with gas generation growing low single digits. The dispatch of our fleet is well positioned with upgraded missions and a growing HA backlog. Outside of gas, markets remain mixed.  
Power orders were up significantly, driven by Gas Power equipment. This quarter, we booked 12 heavy-duty gas turbines and 35 aeroderivative orders, primarily LM, that will complement variable renewable power by providing distributed fast-response power to help deliver grid stability. Orders were also up in Gas Power services, Steel, Power Conversion and Nuclear.  
Power revenue was flat, with Gas Power declined while Power Conversion grew. Gas Power was down slightly, largely driven by equipment were similar to last quarter, we had lower turnkey scope projects. We also shipped 6 fewer heavy-duty gas turbines. Gas Power services was up significantly across both CSAs and transactional portfolios, primarily due to higher outages. And services growth is trending better than our initial outlook.  
Power Conversion was up with its highest quarterly sales level since third quarter '18. And while steel was down slightly, services returned to pre-COVID level.  
Total Power margins expanded roughly 900 basis points and improved sequentially. Gas Power has stabilized through rightsizing the cost structure, improving underwriting and operating better with lean. Margins were positive, largely driven by service equipment mix and lower costs. Now Q3 is typically our toughest service quarter with lower activity compared to the spring and the fall outages season, which are in the second and the fourth quarter, respectively. But we're confident in our high single-digit margin outlook for the year.  
Steel was negatively impacted by COVID in India, which drove work stoppages and delayed project execution. But we're on track with the planned exit of newbuild coal. Just over half of the planned $600 million to $700 million cash actions from restructuring, legal and project closeout were realized in the first half. Once the exit is completed, steel will be 2/3 services. Overall, Power is on track to deliver the outlook target and high single-digit operating margins over time.  
Moving to GE Capital on Slide 8. Continuing adjusted earnings were positive $28 million, a significant improvement year-over-year. This was primarily driven by lower marks and impairments as well as higher gains at EFS, better performance at Insurance and the discontinuation of preferred dividend payment, which are now a GE Industrial obligation. At Insurance, we saw positive investment results and lower claims continue. However, favorable claims trends due to COVID are slowing in certain parts of the portfolio. And EFS enabled $1.1 billion of orders, supporting customers at Renewables and Gas, including third-party financing. 
Based on our first half, we expect to reach the better end of our earnings outlook of negative $700 million to negative $500 million. Within discontinued operations, Capital reported a loss of approximately $600 million, primarily due to the recent decline of AerCap stock price, which is updated quarterly. 
Moving to Corporate. Costs were up slightly given the variable nature of EHS and other and the elimination activity. Importantly, functional cost and operations were better. In the first half, total costs were down more than 20% as we improved functions and operations and digital operations. Moving forward, our focus on decentralization and linear processes continues, which will drive cost and cash improvement. For the year, we're on track for the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of costs. In all, we delivered a strong quarter. I'm encouraged by the work underway at Aviation, the ongoing strength in Healthcare and our progress at Renewables and Power. 
Now Larry, back to you."

I'm incredibly proud of the GE team performance in the second quarter. As you've seen, orders and revenue returned to growth, operating margin expanded across all segments and we generated positive free cash flow. Importantly, Aviation is showing the early signs of a recovery. And we're clearly building momentum across our businesses. 
Combined, this gives us the conviction to raise our free cash flow outlook to $3.5 billion to $5 billion for the full year. So I hope you see what I see, a transformation that is accelerating. GE is becoming a more focused, simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial. And our efforts and impact extend beyond GE. We've always felt a heightened sense of responsibility when it comes to creating a more sustainable future. We recently released our annual sustainability report this month, which shares how we're tackling the world's biggest challenges through innovative solutions, developing the future of flight, advancing precision health and leading the energy transition. For example, the CFM RISE program that we've announced with Safran demonstrates our shared vision for the future of flight as we target reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions by more than 20% versus today's most efficient engines. 
So as we rise to the challenge of building a world that works, serving customers in vital global markets, we'll stay focused on profitable growth and cash generation, which I'm confident will lead to high single-digit free cash flow margins over the next few years. Steve, with that, let's go to questions."

So could you give us more color where cash has been trending better than your expectations? It looks like Aviation and Healthcare seem ahead. And then could you also talk about the differences between your performance and cash flow and earnings as you obviously didn't raise your EPS forecast for the year despite the significant raise in cash guidance?"
177031,1674471605,2352003,"General Electric Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Andy, that will be my pleasure. So let me start with the second quarter and what happened in the second quarter. When we were talking to you mid-quarter, we were expecting around negative $400 million in free cash flow for the quarter. While that was the",333,"Andy, that will be my pleasure. So let me start with the second quarter and what happened in the second quarter. When we were talking to you mid-quarter, we were expecting around negative $400 million in free cash flow for the quarter. While that was the target we thought was achievable, we clearly came in much better and we were able to do much better. And where did that come from? It's a combination. Both Power and Healthcare continue to be strong, both on profit and on cash. In Aviation, we saw cash come in much better, and that was really twofold. One part was the new orders with progress payments that came. And on the other hand, we had less AD&A because our customers didn't ship as many aircraft as expected, and therefore, we paid out less AD&A. 
So with that bit, you can say that basically, we're rolling that bit into our updated free cash flow guide, right? So we're raising it from $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion to $3.5 billion to $5 billion. And if you do the midpoint there, you basically see that cash roll through. About half of that improvement comes from earnings and half comes from working capital and other offsets. And if we then compare with what happened on earnings, so clearly, on earnings, we also saw the improvement or the strengthening from Power and Healthcare. And we had underlying Aviation as expected. What we also had in the quarter was a small charge of $400 million and that's a noncash charge. 
So if you take our guide for EPS, it is $0.15 to $0.25, we are now obviously rolling in the results of the second quarter, including that noncash charge into that number. That said, we do expect to be in the better part of that range for the full year, thanks to the good momentum that we are seeing in the businesses, both on Aviation recovery and the other businesses strengthening their operational performance."

So on the contract margin reviews, I know that you guys do these quarterly. But I remember last year when you were doing your impairment testing, you really made a concerted effort to look at the 20% of your portfolio that was high risk. And so I'm curious, as you kind of think about the expectations for low double-digit Aviation margins for the rest of the year, I'm just wondering what confidence do you have that you won't take another charge on the contract margin reviews? And then any other color that you can provide us on green time utilization impact for the second half and into 2022?"

And what we had in this quarter was a loss contract, and that's very rare. We have about 200 CSA contracts in our portfolio, and only a couple of them are loss-making. And we're not expecting that impact to repeat. I mean the length of the contract is around, what, 15 to 20 years. And the processes we have are rigorous and the controls are working. And it's really a cross-functional efforts where you can say, R&D, operations and commercial are working together to update the estimates with actuals from last year and then making a calculation for what the margin should be. 
So in this quarter with this one contract, so that turned into a loss-making contract. What technically happens then is that you don't only update history to that new margin, you also pull forward all the expected or possible losses that you would have going forward on that contract into the second quarter. And that's why it had such a big impact in the quarter with almost $300 million from that. 
What I would say though is that more importantly, is how we're working to improve how we operationally do our services. So we're working to reducing turnaround times. We're working to getting engines back to our customers faster and lowering the cost of our overhauls. So if you think about that, that brings us to lower cost, lower cash and happier customers. So that's operationally what's really important for us. 
And then your question was what about this going forward? So when we look into the second half, as we've said, we do expect departures to improve. And if you look at the Aviation margin in the second quarter, excluding the CMR impact, it would have been 11% plus, so double digits or low double digits. And that's why we're holding the low double-digit margin. And I would say, when we look at the second half, what will impact the second half? We talk about shop visit, the volume, the mix, the scope, and we do expect that the shop visit trend will move favorably for us. And then we'll continue to have the quarterly CMR process as is."

So I think our view is that we will continue to see strong year-over-year shop visit numbers. I think we'll see a gradual continuation of the improvement sequentially as well. That suggests a number of these impediments like green time fade with time, but they don't disappear, I think, as we work through the second half. So sequentially, we think we're going to see a continued gradual improvement. We think we will, as Carolina just said, see some slight improvement with respect to scope. All good. We're obviously watching some other variables here like the Delta variant. But at this point, I think we're optimistic about the second half performance in Aviation Services."

Andrew, we talked about green time earlier. I'd say USM is another one of those variables that sits between a direct one-for-one transfer from departures to our activity. That said, I think that we haven't seen much by way of USM to date. I think as we play forward through the second half of this year and into next year, I think we're anticipating that, that will be a growing but still a modest headwind for us. So we maybe trade out a little less green time for a little bit more USM. But keep in mind as well, USM doesn't happen to GE Aviation. We're an active consumer, user of USM as well. So it will help us in some respects, lower our costs with respect to the delivered services we provide our airline customers. So a number of dynamics there, but certainly one that we have an eye on as well as we think about the back half, but maybe more importantly, '22."

I would say all the working capital metrics is perhaps the one that is moving -- well, that's moved the furthest. 
Of course, you have seasonality with the volumes and the different businesses, but that's how I would look at it, to look at traction. And we're very happy to see that, that positive trend has developed over last year with all the work we put into it.

I understand that there was a lot of headwinds already from sort of legacy projects and so forth and aspects such as Grid and Hydro. But also on the wind side, it seems there is more cost pressure, and maybe some project revaluations going on as well as some of your peers. So I just wondered if you could give us an update on how comfortable you are with that trajectory of profitability expansion at Renewables. And how much more concerned you are about cost headwinds in that business this year and into next?"

We improved 520 bps year-over-year in Renewables. But when looking at Renewables, you really need to look at the different pieces a bit like you did, right? So starting with Onshore Wind, this is the second quarter where we are positive for full Onshore Wind. And that's a significant improvement compared to last year. And we expect to be positive already in 2021 for the full year. And in the second half, we will see -- where we expect to see services come back even more, including more repower, and we will continue our journey to take more costs out. 
Offshore Wind, that's more of the investment for the future. I would say you'll see more of that in our numbers beginning 2022. Grid. In Grid, well, we're continuing the turnaround, and we saw good momentum in that. We see better cost out. We saw better project execution. We are being tougher and having deal selectivity, and the restructuring is progressing as planned here. So if you take all of that together, you get to that 520 bps improvement year-over-year. But it also gives us comfort that we will be positive in 2022 just building on that momentum of operational improvement. We're cautious of inflation, and we're watching the PTC dynamics and how that will impact us. But we do see good tailwinds from growth, increased services and digital as well as our cost reduction."

And I think the 10-Q says that's down from $6.6 billion on Jan 1 to $3 billion at the end of June. So just confirm that, that's the real metric we should be focused on here. 
And then on the progress, there's been a $1.3 billion headwind in the first half of the year. Just wondering how you see that development in the second half of the year, recognizing that there is some volatility with Renewables. But what's in your plan for the second half on progress?"

We started the year with almost $7 billion in factor receivables. We took $800 million of that out in the first quarter. You saw us take another $2.7 billion out now, and we have about $1 billion to go until year-end. And then we'll end the year with around $2 billion, which is what we've talked about, right? So that's how you get to those numbers. You're absolutely correct. 
When it comes to progress, so if you look at the quarter this year, you have to compare to -- well, progress last year because you sort of look at the delta here, progress last year was including the big military progress payment that we got, which obviously didn't repeat now in the quarter. This quarter, we had a lot of deliverables in Renewables, so basically taking down progress, and that's really why it was negative compared to the deliverables. 
For the rest of the year, well, that will depend a bit on the dynamics of the PTC because we've talked about that the biggest variable for our guide, the cash guidance, that's $3.5 billion to $5 billion. One of the big parts there is the PTC dynamic and if that will change our customer behavior so that they will push out the orders that we were expecting to be placed before year-end to next year. And the other one on progress will obviously be also depending on Aviation and how that plays out over the second half of the year."

And we really want to make sure that we're doing all we can, both with the vendor base and, frankly, with our own processes, too. 
To clear that, we don't like the foregone revenue. More importantly, we're late with the customer in a number of instances. I think as we look at business that we might have lost, I'm not sure we can really pinpoint particular orders that went elsewhere because our lead times have been pushed, again, because I don't think this is an isolated GE dynamic.

I think the teams on the transactional side are doing a better job day in, day out. We had a higher backlog coming into the year. I like the execution improvements that we're seeing largely by way of lean. And in turn, I think as we put more emphasis on the top, you're also seeing that flow through to the bottom, which is part of the reason we're seeing the strong margin improvements in Gas and in Power broadly not only year-over-year, but again, with respect to the comparison versus 2019 where, for the segment, I think the margins are up now over 600 basis points versus the second quarter of 2019.

Overall, we delivered a strong second quarter and first half performance, and we're encouraged by the early signs of the recovery. Looking at the numbers on Slide 2. Recall that the second quarter of 2020 was challenging as we navigated the full negative effects of the pandemic. While we recognize that many are still facing continued challenges with new COVID spikes and variants, we're seeing our businesses return to growth this quarter. Orders were up 30% organically with growth across all segments. In services, we're up 50%. Industrial revenue grew in 3 of our 4 segments. We saw strength in Healthcare and in services overall. 
In Healthcare and Renewables in total as well as in Power Services, revenue was back to levels similar or better to 2019. Notably, Aviation and Commercial Services were up substantially as we're beginning to benefit from the market recovery. Our adjusted Industrial margin expanded 1,000 basis points organically, with year-over-year expansion across all segments and sequential expansion in all segments except Aviation where we took a noncash charge largely related to one customer contract. We expect Aviation margins to expand for the rest of '21. Carolina will cover this in more detail later.  
Adjusted EPS was up significantly with all segments contributing. Industrial free cash flow was up $2 billion, ex discontinued factoring programs, primarily driven by improved earnings and working capital. We're encouraged by our second quarter cash performance. And we're raising our full year Industrial free cash flow outlook to $3.5 billion to $5 billion while our outlook for organic revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted EPS remains unchanged.  
I'll take a moment here to speak to the dynamics at Aviation. Market fundamentals are improving. There was a sizable uptick in departures this quarter, with even greater momentum in June and July. Unsurprisingly, departure trends continue to vary by region. North America continues to improve, with Canada now picking up the pace. Europe has accelerated with departures now 40% below '19 levels. China dipped down to 6% below '19 levels due to increased COVID cases and government restrictions, while Asia Pacific ex China has been more tepid due to border closures and the spreading COVID variant. Importantly though, about 2/3 of our CFM departures are concentrated in regions with improved trends. We're seeing a stronger recovery in narrowbody fleets versus widebodies, and freight continues to outperform passenger traffic. While green time utilization continues to impact us, we expect this to lessen in the second half.  
Shop visit volume and scope improved slightly sequentially. We anticipate continuing sequential volume growth and scope expansion through the year. Looking ahead, we're still expecting '21 departures to be up about 20% year-over-year and down 30% versus 2019, with customer behavior driving departure and shop visit trends.  
I'm confident in our path to recovery in Aviation. We're using lean to improve our operations and our cost structure. And no business is better positioned than GE Aviation to support our customers through the upcycle, with the largest and youngest engine platform, with more than 37,000 commercial engines and more than 60% of our fleet not yet having a second shop visit, our platform will generate value for decades to come.  
Overall, we're building momentum across GE, evidenced by the significant margin expansion and positive free cash flow this quarter. And importantly, we continue to believe the improvements underway are built on stronger fundamentals and, thus, are sustainable.  
Turning to Slide 3. We're making tremendous progress in our journey to become a more focused, simpler, stronger high-tech industrial. This quarter, the GECAS and AerCap combination achieved some key milestones: AerCap shareholders approved the transaction; the U.S. Department of Justice concluded its review; and yesterday, the European Commission cleared the transaction. We expect to close by year-end. Broadly speaking, this combination serves as a significant catalyst, enabling us to focus more time, talent and capital on our 4 core Industrial franchises: Aviation, Healthcare, Renewables and Power. It also allows us to accelerate our deleveraging plan. With our actions post closing, our gross debt reduction will be more than $70 billion since the end of 2018.  
At the same time, we've been strengthening our operational foundation. This starts, of course, with the team. We've implemented new learning and development programs, such as leadership and action in our business and frontline leadership courses to equip GE leaders at all levels to drive our lean transformation. This quarter, we also made some leadership changes that complement our existing bench of GE talent. First is the retirement of Kieran Murphy, who will be stepping down as President and CEO of GE Healthcare at the end of the year. Over his high-impact 30-plus year career, Kieran has embodied candor and transparency and consistently delivered for our customers. I'm excited to welcome Pete Arduini, who will join us from Integra LifeSciences, where he served as CEO for almost a decade. Earlier in his career, Pete, in fact, worked at GE Healthcare for nearly 15 years. Pete's proven track record of driving growth across complex businesses, combined with his respected leadership style, makes him well suited to lead the important work at GE Healthcare.  
Second is the retirement of Offshore Wind CEO, John Lavelle, after a 40-year career with GE. John has positioned the business for success, leading the GE team that will help install the first large-scale U.S. offshore wind farm. We're excited to appoint Jan Kjaersgaard as the new CEO. With Jan's prior industry experience, he's well prepared to lead our offshore business to $3 billion in revenue by 2024.  
We also promoted Scott Strazik from Gas Power CEO to CEO of all of GE Power. Scott and his team, which now includes Valerie Marjollet, who was recently appointed as Steam Power CEO, will continue to run Power as 4 discrete business units, managing from the bottom up.  
Our GE team has been at the heart of driving our transformation forward, building momentum through lean and embracing a more decentralized business model. This quarter, it was good. It was really good to spend more time with our teams where I saw and heard countless Kaizen examples, and more broadly, how lean is being used to improve safety, quality, delivery and cost across GE.  
One example that stood out was from Offshore Wind where we have a global presence across 35 countries. In the first half of '21, through good lean problem-solving and daily management, we realized about $150 million of year-over-year savings in sourcing and logistics as well as through better execution on installation and commissioning cycle times.  
Now decentralization goes hand in hand with lean. This means managing not only the 4 Industrial segments we report with the nearly 30 business units under them. In our operating reviews, I continue to see how our teams are managing our operating P&Ls at a more granular level. We're having more meaningful operating reviews and, in turn, driving actions across high-impact and high-priority opportunities.  
The stronger foundation is enabling us to play more offense. The first priority, of course, is organic growth. We're improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have today. There are many recent wins across GE, but let me highlight two. At Aviation, CFM secured a new agreement with IndiGo to provide 620 of our fuel-efficient LEAP-1A engines with a multiyear service contract. This is one of the largest deals in CFM's history. In Renewables, we finalized the contracts for the world's largest offshore wind farm, Dogger Bank. In the third installment, we'll supply 87 Haliade-X turbines, the most powerful offshore wind turbine built today. 
We're also bolstering our offerings with new product introductions and future tech innovation to serve our customers and lead our industries into the future. In Healthcare, for example, we launched Xeleris V, an AI-enabled virtual radiology solution that provides simplified workflows, better data access and more time with patients. At Power, we're supporting Australia's energy transition with plans to supply a 9F.05 gas turbine capable of operating with a blend of hydrogen and natural gas at the Tallawarra B Power Station. This adds to our experience on more than 75 gas turbines worldwide using hydrogen and associated fuels for power generation.  
From time to time, we'll augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments. Take Zionexa, a recent Healthcare acquisition, whose molecular imaging agent aims to provide more targeted treatment for metastatic breast cancer patients. Zionexa further demonstrates our commitment to precision health, enabling more personalized diagnosis, improved treatment and decision-making and ultimately, better clinical outcomes. All in all, our transformation is accelerating. We're fortifying our competitive positions globally and unlocking further upside potential and profitable growth and cash generation. 
With that, Carolina will provide further insights on the quarter."

In particular, services continue to keep us close to our customers and represent more than half of our orders and revenue. Total orders were up 7% sequentially. And Aviation and Power were up more than 40% year-over-year. Services orders were up 50%, where Renewables and Aviation doubled and Gas Power and Healthcare grew double digits. Revenue was up across Aviation, Healthcare and Renewables.  
Power was flat as expected. We continued to reduce turnkey scope in Gas Power and exit new unit coal at Steam. We're also seeing our mix shift towards higher-margin services, with total services revenue growing 15%. Notably, Aviation Commercial Services grew 50%, reflecting a recovering market, but we're still well below '19 levels.  Healthcare in total and Gas Power services remain bright spots with growth above 2019.  
Next, adjusted Industrial margins improved sequentially in all segments except Aviation where margins declined. I'll speak to this shortly. Year-over-year, margins expanded 1,000 basis points with all segments expanding. About half of this improvement was driven by nonrepeat of COVID charges, and the other half was driven by our lean efforts, cost productivity and mix shift to services.  
Regarding inflation, we're seeing pressure. However, it's a mixed story by business. Our shorter-cycle businesses feel the impact earliest, while our longer-cycle businesses are more protected given extended purchasing and production cycles. Our services business fall in between. Across the board, we're driving cost countermeasures and utilizing price increases and escalation features in our contracts to help mitigate this pressure.  
In our longer-cycle project businesses, we manage cost performance versus our original as-sold margins. We utilize lean to reduce cost and cycle time to execute delivery. In the second quarter, our countermeasures actually drove a slight net deflation impact on margins. Looking forward to the second half of '21 and into '22, although inflation pressure is likely to increase, particularly in Aviation and Renewables, we expect the net inflation impact to be limited.  
Finally, adjusted EPS was up $0.19 year-over-year. About 3/4 of this improvement came from our Industrial segment. As we walk from continuing to adjusted EPS, we need to exclude the positive data mark, the negative impact of significant higher-cost restructuring program, nonoperating expenses, primarily pension, and debt tender costs. Worth noting for EPS, our reverse stock split takes effect as of market open August 2. This will better align GE's number of shares outstanding with companies of our size. Overall, we're encouraged by our broader earnings performance, especially the underlying margin improvement, and we're well positioned to achieve our '21 outlook for margin expansion and EPS.  
Moving to cash. In the second quarter, Industrial free cash flow was positive $388 million, up $2.5 billion year-over-year on a reported basis or up $2 billion excluding discontinued factoring programs in both years. The majority of this improvement was driven by cash earnings with all segments growing earnings. Underpinning our solid quarterly performance versus our earlier expectations was higher Aviation orders and, in turn, higher progress collections and lower AD&A as well as strength at Healthcare and Power. 
We've made good progress exiting the majority of our factoring programs in the second quarter. This was a big step forward to becoming more operational and getting back to basics on billings and collections. For context, currently, about half of our billings occur in the final month of the quarter, driven in part by the timing of deliveries, far too back-end loaded and inconsistent with the lean principles of flow and level loading.  
Our turns across commercial, operations and finance are working to deliver earlier to our customers and, in turn, bill and collect cash earlier in the quarter. Over time, this will help us generate more linear cash flow.  
The discontinuation of factoring was a $2.7 billion impact, which was adjusted out of free cash flow. For the remainder of '21, the impact will be roughly $1 billion, split between the third and the fourth quarters.  
Going deeper on working capital. This was a source of cash at $260 million this quarter. Despite increased volume, we saw a significant year-over-year improvement, largely due to operational enhancements.  
Looking at the flows in the quarter. I'll speak to a couple. Receivables were a source of cash, driven by DSO improvement across all segments. Take our Imaging and Life Care Solutions business in the U.S. and Canada, for example. Our turns are using lean and automation to better manage contract deliverables, build customers more accurately and faster and thereby generate cash quicker.  This effort already improved DSO by 7 days. Inventory was a use of cash, largely driven by Onshore Wind inventory build for the second half deliveries as well as fulfillment and execution challenges. Overall, inventory turns improved from 2.4 to 2.6 sequentially with higher volume, but there's much more to do.  
We continue to manage our capital investments with focus on profitable growth. When the second quarter CapEx spend was down sequentially, our investments in new product programs increased. Overall, in the first half, on a reported basis, cash flow was negative $457 million, a $3.8 billion improvement year-over-year. After rebaselining for discontinued factoring programs and the BioPharma sale, we saw a $3.2 billion improvement. So while there's more to do, our near-term working capital improvements are taking hold even as we grow. Together with higher earnings, this is beginning to drive more sustainable and linear free cash flow. And based on our 2Q performance, we're now confident that we can deliver free cash flow in the range of $3.5 billion to $5 billion for the year versus our prior outlook of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion.  
Turning to liquidity and leverage on Slide 6. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of cash and recently refinanced our backup credit facility. Due to our improved financial position and cash linearity with lower peak quarterly needs, we reduced the facility size from $15 billion to $10 billion and extended the maturity date to 2026 at attractive pricing. We also continue to take meaningful actions on our deleveraging plan, completing a $7 billion debt tender. This brings our gross debt, which currently includes pension, to a reduction of $53 billion since the end of 2018.  
Additionally, we continue to derisk the pension. In the U.K., as of January 2022, we implement the proposed pension freeze. As mentioned previously, we don't expect any further funding requirements for the GE pension plan at least through the end of the decade.  Stepping back, we have a clear path to achieving less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA over the next few years.  
Moving to our business results, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. First, on Aviation. As Larry shared, we're starting to see improving fundamentals associated with the commercial market recovery across services and OE production. The market's sequential improvement met our expectations, with GE CFM departures currently down about 27% versus '19. While departure trends continue to vary by region, we still expect the global recovery to accelerate in the second half.  
Orders were up year-over-year. Both Commercial Engines and Services were up substantially year-over-year. Key commercial wins this quarter include IndiGo, Southwest and United driving momentum. In fact, since the beginning of '20, new wins have now outpaced canceled orders. Military orders were down, largely due to timing of new orders and a tough comp versus last year. And you'll recall, we received a large military advance. Revenue was up 10%. Commercial Services was up 50% with operational improvement. Shop visit volume trended better than our expectations, up over 30%. And overall scope was up slightly sequentially. Broadly, we're seeing higher concentration of narrowbody visits, which typically have lower revenue. Our spare part rate was up double digits year-over-year and sequentially. This was partially offset by unfavorable CSA contract margin reviews, or CMRs, where revenue is adjusted to reflect latest margins based on cost incurred to date.  
Military continues to be impacted by internal and external supply chain issues, with output expectations falling short this quarter. We're seeing some improvement as we use visual management and standard work and also other tools to solve problems in real time, and we're working to fully resolve these issues. We're now targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth for the year, but our high single-digit target remains in place through '25.  
Segment margin expanded significantly year-over-year, yet down sequentially. Margin was impacted by the noncash contract margin review charges of approximately $400 million. About 2/3 of this was related to one contract in a loss position. In this contract, continued COVID-driven utilization, contract-specific dynamics and operating behavior increased our estimated shop visit costs. While rare across our service portfolio, the loss contract designation resulted in the accelerated recognition of all future forecasted losses into 2Q. Excluding this, Aviation margins would have been low double digits. Quarterly CMRs are part of our normal process and will continue in the second half. For Q2 -- for Q3, we expect margins to expand sequentially.  
Our team continues to align fixed costs and our organizational profile to market realities. We're, maintaining our low double-digit margin guide for '21, supported by a second half recovery. However, based on the CMR and military dynamics, we now expect full year revenue growth to be about flat versus '20. These are temporary issues, and we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals of our business.  
Moving to Healthcare. Market fundamentals are improving and the team delivered another impressive quarter. Starting with the market. Global procedures volume grew mid-single digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. Europe, China and Japan were solid markets due to government spending, a sign of increasing expectations for better quality of care and patient outcomes. Private markets also grew in the U.S. across key customers as recovery momentum continues. Demand remains robust amid that backdrop. Orders were up double digits year-over-year and versus second quarter '19 and up 20%, excluding the Ford ventilator partnership last year. 
Healthcare system orders were up 7% with double-digit growth in imaging and ultrasound. This offsets a decline in Life Care Solutions, lapping higher demand for COVID-19-related equipment. However, LCS was up double digits versus second quarter '19. PDx orders were up almost 50% year-over-year, following a depressed second quarter '20 and also up versus second quarter '19. Revenue was also up double digits, with HCS up 6% and PDx up almost 50%. All Asia regions delivered double-digit growth, with China up high teens. The teams worked across the supply chain to help mitigate industry-wide supply shortages related to electronics and resins, which impacted growth this quarter.  
Segment margin expanded 460 basis points year-over-year and significantly versus second quarter '19 ex BioPharma. Margin continues to be driven by profitable growth, cost productivity through lean and prior period restructuring. At the same time, we're accelerating our growth investment, particularly in digital and AI-enabled applications with increased spend planned for the second half. And we'll continue to evaluate inorganic investments to complement this, such as Zionexa. Based on our first half, we now expect organic margins to expand more than 100 basis points for the year. This will be influenced by how quickly we can ramp certain growth investment. However, our medium-term expectations remain 25 to 75 basis points expansion. Our investment ramp will support continued innovation and help us drive higher revenue growth over time.  
Turning to Renewables. We're continuing to lead the energy transition, growing new generation, lowering the cost of electricity and modernizing the grid with a focus on new product platforms and technologies that enables profitable growth and cash generation over time.  
Looking at the market. In Onshore Wind, we still expect the U.S. market to decline in the near term before stabilizing. We're watching the potential U.S. production tax credit extension closely. A blanket long-term extension likely result in near-term uncertainty because it pushes out investment decisions for what could be years. This may impact our second half orders profile and positive free cash flow outlook for the year.  
In Offshore Wind, global momentum should continue through the decade. The recent U.S. federal approval of the Vineyard Wind project supported by our Haliade-X represents meaningful progress for the U.S. market. And as the global energy transition accelerates and government stimulus increases, the grid will need to be upgraded and more actively managed.  
Orders grew mid-single digits, where onshore services more than doubled as repower orders increased, which will convert to second half deliveries. This was partially offset by lower onshore equipment orders due to PTC dynamics. While both onshore and offshore equipment orders are lumpy, we expect them to increase significantly in the second half versus first half.  
Revenue was up 9%, driven by higher equipment revenue, offset by lower services. And reported equipment was up 12% on a 2-year view versus '19. In onshore, equipment was up year-over-year on higher international unit deliveries while services were down on fewer repower upgrades, though up sequentially. And services ex repower grew double digits again. Segment margin, while still negative, improved more than 500 basis points as we drive towards segment profitability over time. 
Onshore was profitable in the quarter and year-to-date. This was driven by continued cost out and volume leverage that more than offset mix and other headwinds, such as lower margin on new products, which typically improves our product life cycle. In grid, cost productivity was offset by elevated restructuring. Looking ahead, we're focused on our operational priorities, including cost reduction to help offset increased medium-term headwinds from the market inflation and new technology and platform transitions.  
Moving to Power. The team performed very well with operational improvements across the business, particularly at Gas Power. Looking at the market. Global gas generation grew low single digits while GE gas turbine utilization continued to be resilient, with megawatt hours growing high single digits. Encouragingly, outage starts were up 50% year-over-year and up mid-single digits versus 2Q '19. For the year, we expect the gas market to remain stable with gas generation growing low single digits. The dispatch of our fleet is well positioned with upgraded missions and a growing HA backlog. Outside of gas, markets remain mixed.  
Power orders were up significantly, driven by Gas Power equipment. This quarter, we booked 12 heavy-duty gas turbines and 35 aeroderivative orders, primarily LM, that will complement variable renewable power by providing distributed fast-response power to help deliver grid stability. Orders were also up in Gas Power services, Steel, Power Conversion and Nuclear.  
Power revenue was flat, with Gas Power declined while Power Conversion grew. Gas Power was down slightly, largely driven by equipment were similar to last quarter, we had lower turnkey scope projects. We also shipped 6 fewer heavy-duty gas turbines. Gas Power services was up significantly across both CSAs and transactional portfolios, primarily due to higher outages. And services growth is trending better than our initial outlook.  
Power Conversion was up with its highest quarterly sales level since third quarter '18. And while steel was down slightly, services returned to pre-COVID level.  
Total Power margins expanded roughly 900 basis points and improved sequentially. Gas Power has stabilized through rightsizing the cost structure, improving underwriting and operating better with lean. Margins were positive, largely driven by service equipment mix and lower costs. Now Q3 is typically our toughest service quarter with lower activity compared to the spring and the fall outages season, which are in the second and the fourth quarter, respectively. But we're confident in our high single-digit margin outlook for the year.  
Steel was negatively impacted by COVID in India, which drove work stoppages and delayed project execution. But we're on track with the planned exit of newbuild coal. Just over half of the planned $600 million to $700 million cash actions from restructuring, legal and project closeout were realized in the first half. Once the exit is completed, steel will be 2/3 services. Overall, Power is on track to deliver the outlook target and high single-digit operating margins over time.  
Moving to GE Capital on Slide 8. Continuing adjusted earnings were positive $28 million, a significant improvement year-over-year. This was primarily driven by lower marks and impairments as well as higher gains at EFS, better performance at Insurance and the discontinuation of preferred dividend payment, which are now a GE Industrial obligation. At Insurance, we saw positive investment results and lower claims continue. However, favorable claims trends due to COVID are slowing in certain parts of the portfolio. And EFS enabled $1.1 billion of orders, supporting customers at Renewables and Gas, including third-party financing. 
Based on our first half, we expect to reach the better end of our earnings outlook of negative $700 million to negative $500 million. Within discontinued operations, Capital reported a loss of approximately $600 million, primarily due to the recent decline of AerCap stock price, which is updated quarterly. 
Moving to Corporate. Costs were up slightly given the variable nature of EHS and other and the elimination activity. Importantly, functional cost and operations were better. In the first half, total costs were down more than 20% as we improved functions and operations and digital operations. Moving forward, our focus on decentralization and linear processes continues, which will drive cost and cash improvement. For the year, we're on track for the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of costs. In all, we delivered a strong quarter. I'm encouraged by the work underway at Aviation, the ongoing strength in Healthcare and our progress at Renewables and Power. 
Now Larry, back to you."

I'm incredibly proud of the GE team performance in the second quarter. As you've seen, orders and revenue returned to growth, operating margin expanded across all segments and we generated positive free cash flow. Importantly, Aviation is showing the early signs of a recovery. And we're clearly building momentum across our businesses. 
Combined, this gives us the conviction to raise our free cash flow outlook to $3.5 billion to $5 billion for the full year. So I hope you see what I see, a transformation that is accelerating. GE is becoming a more focused, simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial. And our efforts and impact extend beyond GE. We've always felt a heightened sense of responsibility when it comes to creating a more sustainable future. We recently released our annual sustainability report this month, which shares how we're tackling the world's biggest challenges through innovative solutions, developing the future of flight, advancing precision health and leading the energy transition. For example, the CFM RISE program that we've announced with Safran demonstrates our shared vision for the future of flight as we target reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions by more than 20% versus today's most efficient engines. 
So as we rise to the challenge of building a world that works, serving customers in vital global markets, we'll stay focused on profitable growth and cash generation, which I'm confident will lead to high single-digit free cash flow margins over the next few years. Steve, with that, let's go to questions."

So could you give us more color where cash has been trending better than your expectations? It looks like Aviation and Healthcare seem ahead. And then could you also talk about the differences between your performance and cash flow and earnings as you obviously didn't raise your EPS forecast for the year despite the significant raise in cash guidance?"
177031,1674471605,2352005,"General Electric Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2021",2021-07-27,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Andy, that will be my pleasure. So let me start with the second quarter and what happened in the second quarter. When we were talking to you mid-quarter, we were expecting around negative $400 million in free cash flow for the quarter. While that was the",333,"Andy, that will be my pleasure. So let me start with the second quarter and what happened in the second quarter. When we were talking to you mid-quarter, we were expecting around negative $400 million in free cash flow for the quarter. While that was the target we thought was achievable, we clearly came in much better and we were able to do much better. And where did that come from? It's a combination. Both Power and Healthcare continue to be strong, both on profit and on cash. In Aviation, we saw cash come in much better, and that was really twofold. One part was the new orders with progress payments that came. And on the other hand, we had less AD&A because our customers didn't ship as many aircraft as expected, and therefore, we paid out less AD&A. 
So with that bit, you can say that basically, we're rolling that bit into our updated free cash flow guide, right? So we're raising it from $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion to $3.5 billion to $5 billion. And if you do the midpoint there, you basically see that cash roll through. About half of that improvement comes from earnings and half comes from working capital and other offsets. And if we then compare with what happened on earnings, so clearly, on earnings, we also saw the improvement or the strengthening from Power and Healthcare. And we had underlying Aviation as expected. What we also had in the quarter was a small charge of $400 million and that's a noncash charge. 
So if you take our guide for EPS, it is $0.15 to $0.25, we are now obviously rolling in the results of the second quarter, including that noncash charge into that number. That said, we do expect to be in the better part of that range for the full year, thanks to the good momentum that we are seeing in the businesses, both on Aviation recovery and the other businesses strengthening their operational performance."

But I remember last year when you were doing your impairment testing, you really made a concerted effort to look at the 20% of your portfolio that was high risk. And so I'm curious, as you kind of think about the expectations for low double-digit Aviation margins for the rest of the year, I'm just wondering what confidence do you have that you won't take another charge on the contract margin reviews? And then any other color that you can provide us on green time utilization impact for the second half and into 2022?"

And what we had in this quarter was a loss contract, and that's very rare. We have about 200 CSA contracts in our portfolio, and only a couple of them are loss-making. And we're not expecting that impact to repeat. I mean the length of the contract is around, what, 15 to 20 years. And the processes we have are rigorous and the controls are working. And it's really a cross-functional efforts where you can say, R&D, operations and commercial are working together to update the estimates with actuals from last year and then making a calculation for what the margin should be. 
So in this quarter with this one contract, so that turned into a loss-making contract. What technically happens then is that you don't only update history to that new margin, you also pull forward all the expected or possible losses that you would have going forward on that contract into the second quarter. And that's why it had such a big impact in the quarter with almost $300 million from that. 
What I would say though is that more importantly, is how we're working to improve how we operationally do our services. So we're working to reducing turnaround times. We're working to getting engines back to our customers faster and lowering the cost of our overhauls. So if you think about that, that brings us to lower cost, lower cash and happier customers. So that's operationally what's really important for us. 
And then your question was what about this going forward? So when we look into the second half, as we've said, we do expect departures to improve. And if you look at the Aviation margin in the second quarter, excluding the CMR impact, it would have been 11% plus, so double digits or low double digits. And that's why we're holding the low double-digit margin. And I would say, when we look at the second half, what will impact the second half? We talk about shop visit, the volume, the mix, the scope, and we do expect that the shop visit trend will move favorably for us. And then we'll continue to have the quarterly CMR process as is."

That suggests a number of these impediments like green time fade with time, but they don't disappear, I think, as we work through the second half. So sequentially, we think we're going to see a continued gradual improvement. We think we will, as Carolina just said, see some slight improvement with respect to scope. All good. We're obviously watching some other variables here like the Delta variant. But at this point, I think we're optimistic about the second half performance in Aviation Services."

Andrew, we talked about green time earlier. I'd say USM is another one of those variables that sits between a direct one-for-one transfer from departures to our activity. That said, I think that we haven't seen much by way of USM to date. I think as we play forward through the second half of this year and into next year, I think we're anticipating that, that will be a growing but still a modest headwind for us. So we maybe trade out a little less green time for a little bit more USM. But keep in mind as well, USM doesn't happen to GE Aviation. We're an active consumer, user of USM as well. So it will help us in some respects, lower our costs with respect to the delivered services we provide our airline customers. So a number of dynamics there, but certainly one that we have an eye on as well as we think about the back half, but maybe more importantly, '22."

Is that number going to be consistently in that range? And then secondly, just on this charge. Can you just give us some color as to like what type of engine? Is it narrowbodies? And should we expect kind of the same at Safran, if that's the case?"

I think it's important when we look at receivables, to put that in context with our volume. And obviously, looking at it, excluding factoring, so that we can see what traction are we really getting and what is our DSO because that's the best way of measuring how we're improving or not on our underlying performance on working capital management. And when it comes to receivables and DSO, we have actually improved significantly compared to a year ago. I would say all the working capital metrics is perhaps the one that is moving -- well, that's moved the furthest. 
Of course, you have seasonality with the volumes and the different businesses, but that's how I would look at it, to look at traction. And we're very happy to see that, that positive trend has developed over last year with all the work we put into it. And I do believe that now with factoring soon all out of the game, that will help us drive billings and collections earlier in the quarter and therefore, also improve overall the DSO. So good improvement there, but probably even more opportunity going forward on that topic. 
And the other question you had was on the chart."

But also on the wind side, it seems there is more cost pressure, and maybe some project revaluations going on as well as some of your peers.

We improved 520 bps year-over-year in Renewables. But when looking at Renewables, you really need to look at the different pieces a bit like you did, right? So starting with Onshore Wind, this is the second quarter where we are positive for full Onshore Wind. And that's a significant improvement compared to last year. And we expect to be positive already in 2021 for the full year. And in the second half, we will see -- where we expect to see services come back even more, including more repower, and we will continue our journey to take more costs out. 
Offshore Wind, that's more of the investment for the future. I would say you'll see more of that in our numbers beginning 2022. Grid. In Grid, well, we're continuing the turnaround, and we saw good momentum in that. We see better cost out. We saw better project execution. We are being tougher and having deal selectivity, and the restructuring is progressing as planned here. So if you take all of that together, you get to that 520 bps improvement year-over-year. But it also gives us comfort that we will be positive in 2022 just building on that momentum of operational improvement. We're cautious of inflation, and we're watching the PTC dynamics and how that will impact us. But we do see good tailwinds from growth, increased services and digital as well as our cost reduction."

And I think the 10-Q says that's down from $6.6 billion on Jan 1 to $3 billion at the end of June. So just confirm that, that's the real metric we should be focused on here. 
And then on the progress, there's been a $1.3 billion headwind in the first half of the year. Just wondering how you see that development in the second half of the year, recognizing that there is some volatility with Renewables. But what's in your plan for the second half on progress?"

We started the year with almost $7 billion in factor receivables. We took $800 million of that out in the first quarter. You saw us take another $2.7 billion out now, and we have about $1 billion to go until year-end. And then we'll end the year with around $2 billion, which is what we've talked about, right? So that's how you get to those numbers. You're absolutely correct. 
When it comes to progress, so if you look at the quarter this year, you have to compare to -- well, progress last year because you sort of look at the delta here, progress last year was including the big military progress payment that we got, which obviously didn't repeat now in the quarter. This quarter, we had a lot of deliverables in Renewables, so basically taking down progress, and that's really why it was negative compared to the deliverables. 
For the rest of the year, well, that will depend a bit on the dynamics of the PTC because we've talked about that the biggest variable for our guide, the cash guidance, that's $3.5 billion to $5 billion. One of the big parts there is the PTC dynamic and if that will change our customer behavior so that they will push out the orders that we were expecting to be placed before year-end to next year. And the other one on progress will obviously be also depending on Aviation and how that plays out over the second half of the year."

And we really want to make sure that we're doing all we can, both with the vendor base and, frankly, with our own processes, too. 
To clear that, we don't like the foregone revenue. More importantly, we're late with the customer in a number of instances. I think as we look at business that we might have lost, I'm not sure we can really pinpoint particular orders that went elsewhere because our lead times have been pushed, again, because I don't think this is an isolated GE dynamic.

We do know the second half, given the way COVID played out last year, will present some tougher comps. But I think we're encouraged by both what we saw with CSAs and the transactional activity. As we look to the second half, I think we're in all likelihood going to do better than that low single-digit revenue guide that we talked about for services. 
Now that will be more a first half result than it will be the second half. But we do see, I think, higher outages with the contractual business. I think the teams on the transactional side are doing a better job day in, day out. We had a higher backlog coming into the year. I like the execution improvements that we're seeing largely by way of lean. And in turn, I think as we put more emphasis on the top, you're also seeing that flow through to the bottom, which is part of the reason we're seeing the strong margin improvements in Gas and in Power broadly not only year-over-year, but again, with respect to the comparison versus 2019 where, for the segment, I think the margins are up now over 600 basis points versus the second quarter of 2019.

Our team delivered another strong quarter as orders, margins and cash improved.

Our team delivered another strong quarter as orders, margins and cash improved. While the aviation market is showing continued signs of recovery and contributed to the quarter, our focus on continuous improvement and lean is driving broader operational and financial progress. At the same time, we're managing through significant challenges that we'll discuss further today. 
Starting with the numbers on Slide 2. 
Orders were robust, up 42%, with growth in all segments in both services and equipment, reflecting continued demand for our technology and solutions and better commercial execution. Industrial revenue was mixed. We saw a continued strength in services, up 7% organically. Aviation improved significantly, benefiting from the market recovery. Equipment was down 9% organically, largely due to supply chain disruptions, the Ford ventilator comparison in health care, and as expected, lower power equipment. Adjusted industrial margin expanded 270 basis points organically, largely driven by operational improvement in many of our businesses, growth in higher-margin services at Aviation and Power, and net restructuring benefits. Adjusted EPS was up significantly, driven by Industrial. Industrial free cash flow was up $1.8 billion ex discontinued factoring programs due to better earnings, working capital and the short-term favorable timing impact of aircraft delivery delays. 
Overall, I'm encouraged by our performance, especially at Aviation. Let me share what gives me -- gives us confidence there. 
First, our results reflect a significant improvement in near-term market fundamentals. Departure trends are better than the August dip and have recovered to down 23% of '19 levels. We expect this acceleration in traffic to continue as travel restrictions lift and vaccination rates increase. 
Our results also reflect operating improvements. For example, at Aviation's overhaul shops, our teams have used lean to increase turnaround time by nearly 10% and decrease shop inventory levels by 15% since the fourth quarter of 2020. These improvements are enabling us to get engines back to customers faster and at a lower cost. 
No business is better positioned than GE Aviation to support our customers through the coming up cycle. We're ready with the industry's largest and youngest fleet, while we continue to invest for the next generation with lower carbon technologies, such as the CFM Rise program. This platform will generate value for decades to come. 
We're also clearly navigating headwinds as we close this year and look to 2022. We're feeling the impact of supply chain disruptions in many of our businesses, with the largest impact to date in Healthcare. Based on broader industry trends, we expect company-wide pressure to continue, at least into the first half of next year. Our teams are working diligently to increase supply by activating dual sources, qualifying alternative parts, redesigning and requalifying product configurations, and expanding factory capacity. We're also focused on margins as we deploy lean to decrease inventory and costs as well as implement appropriate pricing actions and to reduce select discounts. 
Our C team -- our CT team in Japan, for example, has been experiencing higher customer demand so we're making our production even more efficient to help offset the challenge of delayed inputs. The team used value stream mapping, standard work and quarterly Kaizens to reduce production lead time once parts are received by more than 40% from a year ago. And there's line of sight there to another 25% reduction by the end of the year. While this is a single example within Healthcare, taken together with other efforts, and over time, these add up. 
At Renewables, we're encouraged by the U.S. administration's commitment to offshore wind development. However, in onshore wind, the pending U.S. production tax credit extension is creating uncertainty for customers and causing much less U.S. market activity in preparation for 2022. As we've shared, a blanket extension, while a well-intended policy, has the unintended consequence of pushing out investment decisions. In our business, given the lag between orders and revenue, the impact will continue through the fourth quarter and into '22. This environment along with inflation headwinds picking up next year makes Renewables ongoing work to improve cost productivity even more urgent. 
Given these puts and takes, we now expect revenue to be about flat for the year, driven by changes to some of our business outlooks, which Carolina will cover in a moment. 
Importantly, even with lower revenue, we're raising our margin and EPS expectations, underscoring improved profitability and services growth and reflecting our strengthened operations. And we're narrowing our free cash flow range around the existing midpoint. 
Looking further out to next year, as our businesses continue to strengthen, we expect revenue growth, margin expansion and higher free cash flow despite the pressures that we're managing through currently. We'll provide more detail as usual during our fourth quarter earnings and outlook calls. 
Moving on to Slide 3. 
Challenges aside, our performance reflects the continued progress in our journey to become a more focused, simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial. The GECAS and AerCap combination is a tremendous catalyst, enabling us to focus on our industrial core and accelerate our deleveraging plan. Just last week, GE and AerCap satisfied all regulatory clearances for the GECAS transaction. And we're now targeting to close November 1. We'll use the proceeds to further reduce debt, which we now expect to reach approximately $75 billion since the end of 2018. This is enabling GE to look longer term even as we execute our deleveraging. 
As we accelerate our transformation, lean and decentralization are key to improving operational results. This quarter, we hosted our global Kaizen week in each of our businesses, with over 1,600 employees participating. John Slattery, the CEO of GE Aviation, and I joined our military team in Lynn, Massachusetts for the full week, while our business CEOs joined their teams across the globe. Lean is fundamentally about going to Gemba, where the real work is done, and is best learned in operations where you can see it, touch it, smell it firsthand. And in Lynn, we were there to serve those closest to the work, our operators. Our mission was to improve first-time yield on midframes, a key subassembly of the military engines we produce in Lynn, whose stubborn variability has been directly and negatively impacting our on-time delivery. By the end of the week, we had improved processes for welding and quality checks on mid-frame parts, improvements that we're convinced will help us reach our goals for military on-time delivery by the middle of next year, if not earlier. And we can improve our performance on the back of these changes for years to come. 
There are countless other examples of how our teams are leveraging Lean to drive sustainable, impactful improvements in safety, quality, delivery, cost and cash. They reflect how we're running GE better and how we're sustaining these efforts to drive operational progress and lasting cultural change. 
Our significant progress on deleveraging and operational execution sets us up well to play offense in the future. Our first priority of course, is organic growth. This starts with improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have. There are many recent wins across GE this quarter, but to highlight one. 
Our Gas Power team delivered, installed and commissioned 4 TM2500 aeroderivative gas turbines in only 42 days to complement renewable power generation for California's Department of Water Resources during peak demand season. These turbines, using jet engine technology adapted for industrial and utility power generation, start and ramp in just minutes, providing rapid and reliable intermittent power, helping enhance the flexibility and sustainability of California's grid. 
And we're bolstering our offerings with innovative new technology that serves our customers and leads our industries forward. For example, at Renewables, our Haliade-X offshore wind turbine prototype operating in the Netherlands, set an industry record by operating at 14 megawatts, more output than has ever been produced by any wind turbine. 
From time to time, we'll augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments. Our recently announced acquisition of BK Medical represents a step forward as we advance our mission of precision health care. Bringing BK's intraoperative ultrasound technology together with the pre- and postoperative capabilities in our Ultrasound business creates a compelling customer offering across the full continuum of care, from diagnostics, through surgical, and therapeutic interventions as well as patient monitoring. Not only does BK expand our high-performing $3 billion ultrasound business, but it also is growing rapidly with attractive margins itself. We expect the transaction to close in '22, and I'm looking forward to welcoming the BK team to GE. 
All told, we hope that you see that GE is operating from a position of strength today. We delivered another strong quarter. And we're playing more offense, which will only accelerate over time. We're excited about the opportunities ahead to drive long-term growth and value. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Carolina, who will provide further insights on the quarter."

Our results reflect our team's commitment to driving operational improvement. We're leveraging Lean across GE and our finance function. In addition to Kaizen week that Larry mentioned, over 1,800 finance members completed a full waste work week, applying Lean and digital tools to reduce nonvalue-added work by 26,000 hours and counting. For example, at Renewables, our team streamlined and automated account reconciliations, intercompany settlements and cash applications. This type of transactional Lean frees up time so we can focus more on driving higher quality, faster operational insights and improvement, helping our operating teams run the businesses more efficiently. 
Looking at Slide 4, I'll cover on an organic basis. 
Orders were robust, up 42% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially on a reported basis, building on revenue momentum heading into '22. Equipment and Services in all businesses were up year-over-year, with strength in Aviation, Renewables and Healthcare. We are more selective in the commercial deals we pursue, with a greater focus on pricing in an inflation environment, economic terms and cash. Together with targeting more profitable segments like services, we're enhancing order quality to drive profitable growth. 
Revenue was up sequentially, with growth in services, driven by Aviation and Power, but down year-over-year. Equipment revenue was down, with the largest impact in Healthcare and Power. Overall, mix continues to shift towards higher-margin services, now representing half of the revenue. 
Adjusted Industrial margins improved sequentially, largely driven by Aviation Services. Year-over-year, total margins expanded 270 basis points, driven by our Lean efforts, cost productivity and services growth. Both Aviation and Power delivered margin expansion, which offset the challenges in Healthcare and Renewables. 
Consistent with the broader market, we are experiencing inflation pressure, which we expect to be limited for the balance of '21. Next year, we anticipate a more challenging inflation environment. The most adverse impact is expected in onshore wind due to the rising cost of transportation and commodities, such as steel and resin, impacting the entire industry. We are taking action to mitigate inflation in each of our businesses. Our shorter-cycle businesses felt the impact earliest, while our longer-cycle businesses were more protected given extended purchasing and production cycles. Our service business is full in between. Our teams are working hard across functions to drive cost countermeasures and improve how we bid on businesses, including price escalation. Finally, adjusted EPS was up 50% year-over-year, driven by Industrial. 
Overall, we're pleased with the robust demand, evidenced by orders growth and our year-to-date margin performance. While we're navigating headwinds caused by supply chain and PTC pressure, these have impacted our growth expectations. We're now expecting revenue to be about flat for the year. However, due to our continued improvement across GE, we are raising our '21 outlook for organic margin expansion to 350 basis points or more and our adjusted EPS to a range of $1.80 to $2.10. 
Moving to cash. A major focus of our transformation has been strengthening our cash flow generation through better working capital management and improved linearity, ultimately to drive more consistent and sustainable cash flow. Our quarterly results show the benefits of these efforts. 
Industrial free cash flow was up $1.8 billion ex discontinued factoring programs in both years. Aviation, Power and Healthcare all had robust free cash flow conversion in the quarter. Cash earnings, working capital, and allowance and discount payments or AD&A, driven by the deferred aircraft delivery payment, contributed to this significant increase. 
Looking at working capital, I'll focus on receivables, where we saw the largest operational improvement. Receivables were a source of cash, up $1.3 billion year-over-year ex the impact of discontinued factoring, mainly driven by Gas Power collections. Overall, strengthening our operational muscles in billings and collections is translating into DSO improvement, as evidenced by our total DSO, which is down 13 days year-over-year. Also positively impacting our free cash flow by about $0.5 billion in the quarter was AD&A. Given the year-to-date impact and our fourth quarter estimate aligned with the current airframer aircraft delivery schedule, we now expect positive flow in '21, about $300 million, which is $700 million better than our prior outlook. This year's benefit will reverse in 2022, and together with higher aircraft delivery schedule expectations, will drive an outflow of approximately $1.2 billion next year. To be clear, this is a timing issue. 
You'll recall that we decided to exit the majority of our factoring programs earlier this year. In the quarter, discontinued factoring impact was just under $400 million, which was adjusted out of free cash flow. The fourth quarter impact should be under $0.5 billion, bringing our full year factoring adjustment to approximately $3.5 billion. 
Without the factoring dynamics, better operational management of Receivables has become a true cross-functional effort. Let me share an example. Our Stone Power tin recently shifted to this from a more siloed approach. Leveraging problem solving and value stream mapping, they have reduced average billing cycle time by 30% so far. So only 2 quarters in, more linear business operations, both up and downstream, are starting to drive more linear billings and collections. While we have a way to go, more linear business operations drive better and sustainable free cash flow. Year-to-date, ex discontinuing factoring across all quarters, free cash flow increased $4.8 billion year-over-year. In each of our businesses, our returns are driving working capital improvement, which together with higher earnings make a real and measurable impact. Taking the strong year-to-date performance, coupled with the headwinds we've described, we're narrowing our full year free cash flow range to $3.75 billion to $4.75 billion. 
Turning to Slide 6. 
We expect to close the GECAS transaction on November 1. This strategic transaction not only deepens our focus on our Industrial core, but also enables us to accelerate our debt reduction, with approximately $ billion in consideration. Given our deleveraging progress and cash flow improvement to date plus our expected actions and better past performance, we now expect a total reduction of approximately $75 billion since the end of 2018. GE will receive a 46% equity stake in one of the world's leading aviation letters, which we will monetize as the aviation industry continues to recover. As we've shared, we expect near-term leverage to remain elevated. And we remain committed to further debt reduction and our leverage target over the next few years. 
On liquidity, we ended the quarter with $25 billion of cash. We continued to see significant improvement in lowering GE's cash needs, currently at $11 billion, down from $13 billion. In the quarter, taken these decrease, due to reduced factoring and better working capital management. This is an important proof point that we are able to operate with lower and more predictable cash needs, creating opportunities for high return investments. 
Moving to the businesses, which I'll also speak to on an organic basis. 
First, on Aviation. Our improved results reflect a significantly stronger market. Departure trends recovered from August. It's early, but the pickup that began in September is continuing through October. Better departures and customer confidence contributed to higher shop visits and spare part sales than we had initially anticipated. The impact of green time utilization has also lessened. We expect these positive trends will continue into the fourth quarter. 
Orders were up double-digits. Both commercial engines and services were up substantially again year-over-year. Military orders were also up, reflecting a large Hindustan Aeronautics order for nearly 100 F404 engines along with multiple 2700 orders. 
For revenue, Commercial Services was up significantly, with strength in external spares. Shop visit volume was up over 40% year-over-year and double-digits sequentially, with the overall scope slightly improved. We continued to see higher concentration of narrow-body and regional aircraft shop visits. 
Commercial Engines was down double-digits, with lower shipments. Our mix continues to shift from legacy to more NPI units, specifically like, and lower production rates on GE NX. We're also navigating through material fulfillment constraints, amplified by increased industry demand, which impacted deliveries. 
Military was down marginally. Unit shipments were flat sequentially, but up year-over-year. Without the delivery challenges, Military revenue growth would have been high single-digits this quarter. Given this continued impact, Military growth is now expected to be negative for the year. 
Segment margin expanded significantly, primarily driven by Commercial Services and operational cost reduction. In the fourth quarter, we expect margins to continue to expand sequentially, achieving our low double-digit margin guide for the year. We now expect 21 shop visits to be up at least mid-single-digit year-over-year versus about flat. Our solid performance, especially in Services, underscores our strong underlying business fundamentals as the commercial market recovers. 
Moving to Healthcare. Market momentum is driving very high demand while we navigate supply chain constraints. Government and private health systems are investing in capital equipment to support capacity demand and to improve quality of care across the market. Building on a 20-year partnership, we recently signed a 5-year renewal to service diagnostic imaging and biomedical equipment with HCA Healthcare, one of the nation's leading providers of health care. Broadly, we're adapting to overarching market needs of health system efficiency, digitization, as well as resiliency and sustainability. 
Against that backdrop, orders were up double-digits, both year and versus '19, with strength in Healthcare Systems, up 20% year-over-year, and PDX up high single-digits. However, revenue was down, with a high single-digit decline at HCS, more than offsetting the high single-digit growth we saw at PDX. You'll recall that last year, the Ford ventilator partnership was about $300 million of Life Care Solutions revenue. This comp negatively impacted revenue by 6 points. And thinking about the industry-wide supply shortages, we estimate that growth would have been approximately 9 points higher if we were able to fill our orders. And these challenges will continue into at least the first half of '22. 
Segment margin declined year-over-year, largely driven by higher inflation and lower Life Care Solutions revenue. This was partially offset by productivity and higher PDX volume. Even with the supply chain challenges, we now expect to deliver close to 100 basis point of margin expansion as we proactively manage sourcing and logistics. 
Overall, we're well positioned to keep investing in future growth, underscoring our confidence in profit and cash flow generation. We're putting capital to work differently than in the past, supplementing organic growth with inorganic investments that are a good strategic fit. These are focused on accelerating our Precision Health mission, like BK Medical. And we're strengthening our operational and strategic integration muscles. 
At Renewables, we're excited by our long-term growth potential, supported by new technologies like Haliade-X and Cypress and our leadership in energy transition despite the current industry headwinds. 
Looking at the market, since the second quarter, the pending PTC extension has caused further deterioration in the U.S. onshore market outlook. Based on the latest Wood Mac forecast for equipment and repower, the market is now expected to decline from 14 gigawatts of wind installments this year to approximately 10 gigawatts in 2022. This pressures orders and cash in '21. 
In offshore wind, global momentum continues, and we're aiming to expand our commitment pipeline through the decade. And modernizing the grid is a key enabler of the energy transition. And we saw record orders, driven by offshore, where the project-driven profile will remain uneven. This leads to continued variability for progress collection. 
Onshore orders grew modestly, driven by services and international equipment, partially offset by lower U.S. equipment due to the PTC dynamics. Revenue declined significantly. Services was the main driver, largely due to fewer onshore repower deliveries. X repower, onshore services was up double-digits. Equipment was down to a lesser extent, driven by declines in the U.S. onshore and grid. This was partially offset by continued growth in international onshore and offshore. For the year, we now expect revenue growth to be roughly flat. 
Segment margin declined 250 basis points. Onshore was slightly positive, but down year-over-year. Cost reductions were more than offset by lower U.S. repower volume, mixed headwinds as new products ramp and come down the cost curve as well as supply chain pressure. Offshore margins remain negative as we work through legacy projects and continue to ramp Haldex production. At grid, better execution was more than offset by lower volume. Due mainly to the PTC impact, we now expect Renewables free cash flow to be down and negative this year. Looking forward, where we are facing headwinds, we're intently focused on improving our operational performance, profitability and cash generation. 
Moving to Power. We're performing well. Looking at the market, global gas generation was down high single-digits due to price-driven gas to coal switching. Yes, you heard me right, gas to coal switching. However, GE gas turbine utilization continues to be resilient as megawatt hours grew low single-digits. Despite recent price volatility, gas continues to be a reliable and economic source of power generation. Over time, as more baseload coal comes offline and with the challenges of intermediate renewables power, customers continue to need gas. Through the next decade, we expect the gas market to remain stable, with gas generation growing low single-digits. 
Orders were driven by Gas Power services, Aero and Steam, each up double-digits. Gas Equipment was down despite booking 6 more heavy-duty gas turbine as timing for HA remain uneven across quarters. We continued to stay selective with disciplined underwriting to grow our installed base. And this quarter, we booked orders for smaller frame units. 
Demand for aeroderivative power continues. For the year, we expect about 60 unit orders, up more than 5x year-over-year. Revenue was down slightly. Equipment was down due to reduced turnkey scope at Gas Power and the continued exit of new build coal at steam. Consistent with our strategy, we are on track to achieve about 30% turnkey revenue as a percentage of heavy-duty equipment revenue this year, down from 55% in 2019, a better risk return equation. 
At the same time, Gas Power shipped 11 more units year-over-year. Gas Power Services was up high single-digits, trending better than our initial outlook due to strong CSR volume. We now expect Gas Power services to grow high single-digits this year. 
Steam services was also up. Margins expanded year-over-year, yet were down sequentially due to outage seasonality. Gas Power was positive and improved year-over-year, driven by services growth and aero shipments. We remain confident in our high single-digit margin outlook for the year. Steam is progressing through the new build coal exit. And by year-end, we expect our equipment backlog to be less than $1 billion compared to $3 billion a year ago. Power Conversion was positive and expanded in the quarter. 
Overall, we're encouraged by our steady performance. Power is on track to meet its outlook, including high single-digit margins in [ 23 plus ]. Our team is focused on winning the right orders, growing services and increasing free cash flow generation. 
Moving to Slide 8. 
As a reminder, following the GECAS close in the fourth quarter, we will transition to one column reporting and roll in the remainder of GE Capital into corporate. Going forward, our results, including adjusted revenue, profit and free cash flow, will exclude insurance. To be clear, we'll continue to provide the same level of insurance disclosures. In all, this simplifies the presentation of our results as we focus on our industrial core. 
At Capital, the loss in continuing operations was up year-over-year, driven primarily by a nonrepeat of prior year tax benefit, partially offset by the discontinuation of the preferred dividend payment. At Insurance, we generated $360 million in net income year-to-date, driven by positive investment results and claims still favorable to pre-COVID levels. However, this favorable claim trends are slowing in certain parts of the portfolio. 
As planned, we conducted our annual premium deficiency test, also known as the loss recognition test. This resulted in a positive margin, with no impact to earnings for a second consecutive year. The margin increase was largely driven by a higher discount rate, reflecting our investment portfolio realignment strategy, with a higher allocation towards select growth assets. Claims costs curve continued to hold. In addition, the teams are preparing to implement the new FASB accounting standard, consistent with the industry, and we're working on modeling updates. Based on our year-to-date performance, Capital still expects a loss of approximately $500 million for the year. In discontinued operations, Capital reported a gain of about $600 million, primarily due to the recent increase in AerCap stock price, which is updated quarterly. 
Moving to Corporate. Our priorities are to reduce functional and operational costs as we drive leaner processes and embrace decentralization. The results are flowing through, with costs down double-digits year-over-year. We are now expecting corporate costs to be about $1 billion for the year, and this is better than our prior $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion guidance. 
As you can see, Lean and decentralization aren't just concepts. They are driving better execution and cultural change. They are supporting another strong quarter. And they are enabling our businesses to play more offense. And ultimately, they're driving sustainable, long-term profitable growth. 
Now Larry, back to you."

Let's turn to Slide 9. 
Our teams continued to deliver strong performance. We're especially encouraged by our earnings improvement, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our outlook for the year. 
You've seen today that our transformation to a more focused, simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial is accelerating. We're on the verge of closing the GECAS AerCap merger, a tremendous milestone for GE. 
Stepping back, our progress has positioned us to play offense. We just wrapped up our annual strategic reviews with nearly 30 of our business units. These complement our quarterly operating reviews, but have a longer-term focus as we answer 2 fundamental questions: what game are we playing and how do we win? These reviews were exceptionally strong this year across the board, with the most strategic and cross-functional thinking we've seen in my 3 years, enabling us to drive long-term growth and value across GE, while delivering on our mission of building a world that works. We're positioned to truly shape the future of flight with new technology for sustainability and efficiency, such as the recent Catalyst engine launch, the first clean sheet turboprop design entering the business in general aviation market in 50 years. 
Touching 1 billion patients per year, we're delivering more personalized and efficient care through Precision Health and combining digital AI within our products, including our new cloud-based Edison True packs, to help radiologists adapt to higher workloads and increase exam complexity with improved diagnostic accuracy. 
Through our leadership in the energy transition, we're helping the world tackle the trilemma of sustainability, affordability and reliability from launching new tech platforms at Renewables, such as the Holidex and Cypress to our recently announced flexible transformer project with the Department of Energy, to growth in the world's most efficient gas turbines. 
To be clear, we still have work to do. And as we do it, we're operating increasingly from a position of strength, serving our customers in vital global markets with a focus on profitable growth and cash generation. Our free cash flow will continue to grow towards a high single-digit percentage of sales level. And we have an opportunity to allocate more resources on capital deployment to support GE's growth over time. 
Steve, with that, let's go to questions."

Like-for-like, we expect Industrial free cash flow to step up. We expect our business earnings to improve. We expect that through top line growth and margin expansion that will turn into profit, which we then believe -- well, which we then will see go to cash, right? 
Then if you look a little bit outside of earnings, we do have a couple of significant cash flow items to think about. We have mentioned the supply chain headwinds that we think will continue into next year. So that will hamper both on the profitability but also on inventory. And then we have the headwind of AD&A. We talked about that in this year. It's going to be more positive, but it's going to be a big headwind in next year. And this is really only a timing effect because of when customers expect to deliver the aircraft, right? 
And overall, my last comment on Industrial side will be, if you look at working capital, with that growth in mind, we will need some working capital to fund the top line growth, right? But on the other hand, we also expect to continue to improve working capital management, for example, in receivables, and to some extent, also to inventory. Within that, we do see improvement in linearity as possible as well. So that's like-for-like on the Industrial side. 
If we then add the consolidated capital or basically what's left of capital than consolidated in, like-for-like, we expect it to also increase. And the increase on top of that would mainly be driven by the lower interest that we will see from debt reduction. So we are confident in the overall growing trajectory, both Industrial like-for-like as well as including capital."

Lower restructuring spend and better working capital management story, clearly, from a profit perspective, that's going to be an Aviation-led dynamic. Healthcare right in behind it. And then we still anticipate that we turn Power profitable, and we get a couple of billion dollars of profit from Power. You deduct, call it, $1.4 billion for Corporate, but you get close to, let's call it, $10 billion of op profit, convert that net of interest and taxes at 90%, you get to that same $7 billion figure.

The other variables had -- like morbidity and mortality, inflation in premium, they were a small impact. So we're really happy with that. 
And your question then on top of that sort of for CFT, so CFT or the cash flow testing, that is what decides if there's a need to add cash to the usual. I would say like this, it's not 1 to 1. The variables are similar to LRT, but they are used under moderately adverse conditions. I would say the modeling will happen beginning of next year, as usual. We will look at our investment portfolio realignment and the changes pace into that model. We'll also look at the future cash flow.

Maybe what kind of the price/cost total headwind or tailwind is in 2021 versus what you're kind of expecting in 2022 based on what you can see in the backlog."

We have the shorter cycle businesses like Healthcare, where we are feeling the impact faster than the longer cycle like Power, and we have sort of services in between. On the longer cycle ones, they are more protected because of the, I would say, the extended purchasing and production cycles. We are seeing the main pressures on commodities like steel, but also logistics pressures increasing, right? 
Specific to 2021, we have felt inflation, but so far, we've been able to offset it. And we expect the impact for the full year to be limited in '21, the net impact. For 2022, we do expect to see significant pressure. And I would say it's top of our list of priorities for next year. And we're taking both price and cost countermeasures."

Jeff, I think that's right. And as you would imagine, in an environment like this, we're not only working the value add value engineering, the more traditional cost actions aggressively, we're working with the supply base as feverishly as we can, both on availability and on cost. That said, as Carolina was alluding to on the price side, we're doing all we can in the shorter-cycle businesses. It's a little easier, say, in Healthcare, where we've got more like-for-like. We can see those price actions. We're beginning to see some early traction there. Services is a bit mixed. But where we have opportunities, say, on spares and within the escalation frameworks. Within some of the longer-term service agreements, we're obviously going to get what we can there. 
You spoke to projects. I mean that's -- it's a little bit more bespoke. But it -- while it's difficult to measure price like-for-like, we are managing the margins with some of the longer-term procurement efforts that Carolina alluded to. 
Just more broadly on the backlog, it's important to remember, when you look at what is, what, $380 billion of backlog, 70% of that's in Aviation. Virtually, all of that is in Services. So certainly, a competitive space. But between the catalog pricing dynamics and some of the escalation protection, we think we're well positioned. But we take nothing for granted there. Outside of Aviation, the bulk of the backlog is also in Services where similar dynamics apply. But again, limited pressure net-net in '21, building headwinds for us next year. We've got time to work both the cost and the price countermeasures. And as Carolina said, I don't think we've got a higher priority operationally here in the short term than those 2."

It's not going to be as pronounced [ year to year ]. The fourth quarter, probably it's going to be up, call it, 30%. In October thus far, we're off to a good start in terms of underlying activity. All of that's been coupled with, I would say, robust spare part demand from third-party providers, so right, is that coupling up, if you will, volume and value that are going to set us up for a pretty good second half here and going into next year. 
We're working through supply chain challenges here, be it material, be it labor, as we are everywhere else. I think we're positioned here at least as we -- as best we can see. I'm glad you highlighted the Lean improvements, right? Rather than just filling a lot of bodies and a lot of capital into the breach, we really are trying to work the process. Russell Stokes and the team in Services understand that very well, which is why we highlighted some of the turnaround improvements that we did in our formal remarks. 
You go back to, I guess, what was technically the second quarter, but the middle of June, John Slattery in concert with our partners at Safran announced the CFM Rise program, which really is a multigenerational technology investment program to make sure we're on a path, be it with sustainable aviation fuels, be it hybrids, be it hydrogen, to be in a position to maintain the industry leadership this business has enjoyed for decades. So there's a lot to come. We're going to be spending. And we're going to be spending smartly in and around those areas to launch technologies that ultimately transition into product programs as our airframer and airline customers deem appropriate. So a lot going on short term and long term. But again, we really like where Aviation is, particularly with the departure trends and the outlook here in the near term."

And then as a follow-up to that, for next year, with the $1.5 billion headwind as AD&A normalizes, what mechanically -- like what's the math that can overcome that kind of headwind for Aviation to grow, free cash?"

So if we start with the Aviation and the margin, and you talked about the margin going into the fourth quarter, right? So what we are seeing, and I think an important add on the third quarter, is that we see a shift clearly towards services, right? So in the third quarter, we had 20% growth of services, while Equipment was down. So this better mix also tilted toward external really is what makes you see the drop-through, right? 
And Larry talked about higher shop visits, so 40% up year-over-year. We also saw the strong third-party sales, up around 30%. For the fourth quarter, we have the seasonality, as you know, but we also don't expect it to be as high for the fourth quarter. So we expect to continue sort of from the third quarter into the fourth quarter with the sequential improvement. And overall, that's how we get to our low double-digit margins for 2021. We haven't specifically said exactly what the profit is in the fourth quarter for Aviation. But with all those pieces, you sort of piece it together. 
For 2022, you asked about Aviation free cash flow. So I would say a couple of things. You're right on the AD&A. It is a timing issue. So we'll have a big headwind next year on the AD&A side. But what we do see is we expect return to flight to continue. So we will expect to see basically utilization being driven, which means more hours flown, which means higher billings on our CSAs. You know that cash comes before the profit. So we do expect to have really good uptick on services and the cash flow. So basically, on the CSA side there. Yes, AD&A will be a headwind. But on top of that, we also have the profit that we will see from more shop visits. So overall, the mix of that gets us to a positive place. I think it's mainly the services and the CSAs. That is the big positive."

So I think it's important to take a step back.

And if we look at jumping off point for 2020 for free cash flow for the full year, the free cash flow, excluding factoring and biopharma, we were on $2.4 billion in 2020. If you take our -- a midpoint of our guide now and you add back the factoring, you get to $5 billion for this year. Just to put it in perspective, we're going from last year, $2.4 billion to midpoint of $5 billion this year. So we're doubling the cash flow for 2021. We are also seeing linearity improvements in 2021, which is part of the reason the fourth quarter not being as unlinear as it has been before. 
After the range that we have, there are basically 2 main areas that bring us uncertainty: one, some of the supply chain challenges and the other one is the PTC pressure that we then expect to impact progress. 
So what does that exactly mean for the fourth quarter? Well, we'll have higher sequential profit. And we expect to see free cash from the market improving and some of the usual seasonality, but it would still be down year-over-year. The supply chain challenges, you'll see through earnings, but also through inventory, right? It's going to be a lot stack in WIP that isn't going out. 
And then for the full year, fourth quarter last year, you remember we had big Renewables progress of $1 billion. So we don't expect that to happen this year. And then I've also previously talked about the Aviation MAX Settlements and CARES Act as positive one-offs in quarter last year. If you take that all together, that's how we get to the fourth quarter, and importantly, how we get to $5 billion of jumping off point of free cash flow this year, which is really important proof point and step to our high single-digit free margin journey that Larry talked about a little while ago."

I would say that, again, we're really pleased with the progress on both the deleveraging and the operational improvements. We still have to close the transaction, work through the follow-on debt reductions. But to be in a position to have line of sight now on what will be a cumulative approximately $75 billion debt reduction over the last 3 years allows us, I think, to look at the balance sheet and begin to think about playing more offense and take advantage of the strategic optionality that we have been looking to build and grow. That goes hand in hand with the underlying improvements. Some of which, I would argue, you see in these numbers. Others, like what I saw in the shop floor and Lynn a few weeks back, you don't see yet, which I think give us confidence that more improvements in terms of top line, bottom line and cash are forthcoming. And all that really does is, I think, allow us to both invest in the business more aggressively organically and inorganically. That's why we were so excited about the BK Medical transaction. Admittedly small, but the strategic logic behind it, the value-add operationally, our $3 billion high-performing ultrasound business will generate and the high single-digit returns we think we will have in time, that's what we should be doing more of in concert with what we're going to do organically. All of that really sets us up, I think, Andrew, to be in a position to really realize the full potential of these wonderful businesses in the GE portfolio. 
There are a host of ways that could play out over time. But first things first, right? We've got some business here with the GECAS and AerCap merger to work through. We've got these operating challenges to navigate through the fourth quarter and going into next year. But I really do think we're increasingly operating from a position of strength.

But if you step back for a moment, I think we are of the view that nuclear overall has an important role to play in the energy transition. We know the French government is strongly of that view. They aren't alone. I was in the U.K. last week where we had similar conversations, particularly in and around advanced nuclear technology, particularly in the case of the small modular reactors, which we know can provide carbon-free dependable baseload and flexible capacity as we move forward here. So we've got a lot of capabilities in and around nuclear, really the whole nuclear life cycle. So we don't talk a lot about it, but it is part of the power framework for the energy transition and one we'll continue to manage as best we can going forward."

It's not yet set in stone because these conversations are active and underway in Washington given all the legislation under review that run up to COP 26 and the like. 
I think what we are incorporating in our commentary here today is a more pessimistic but updated view relative to the very near term. So in the absence of those incentives in the short term, we're going to feel pressure both on new unit orders and in repowering. So some of that impacts cash. Some of that impacts margins relative to repowering installations this year. The good news is this is all part of a long-term extension given the administration's commitment to the energy transition to the role of both onshore and relatedly offshore wind in that transition. 
So if you take the decade-long view, the impetus or the imperative for us is really to manage these businesses better to generate better margins -- operating margins. But in the short term, we've got some additional pressures just given the reduction in demand that will follow the uncertainty around the tax incentives. And they hit us hard because the North American market, the U.S. market is clearly the best onshore wind market for us on a global basis."

But that's 9 points of real pressure given the supply chain issues that Nicole was just probing us on. And again, I think Carolina mentioned that the Ford ventilator effort a year ago for the HHS was a significantly tough comp. 
But if you look at the 19% orders growth, if you look at what's happening both in the public and the private spheres, plus what we're doing increasingly both from a commercial and from a product perspective, we've talked about the opportunity to take this business from a low single-digit grower in the mid-single-digit range to grow margins in the 25 to 70 basis points over time. I've got more conviction about our potential to do that than I did a year ago. Just off a U.K. trip where I had some quality time with a number of our business leaders over there, our PDX business in particular, lots of good things going on. We've got a CEO transition here in the offing that we're excited about. Karen Murphy has done a heck of a job with that business. Pete Arduini coming in is, I think, very much committed to those types of expectations. He's certainly coming because he's excited about the potential that he sees across the GE Healthcare portfolio. So we wish it weren't as much of a camouflage the headline here given the supply chain issues. We'll work through it and just feel like this is a strong business that will get stronger over time."

Our team delivered another strong quarter as orders, margins and cash improved. While the aviation market is showing continued signs of recovery and contributed to the quarter, our focus on continuous improvement",1486,"Steve, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Our team delivered another strong quarter as orders, margins and cash improved. While the aviation market is showing continued signs of recovery and contributed to the quarter, our focus on continuous improvement and lean is driving broader operational and financial progress. At the same time, we're managing through significant challenges that we'll discuss further today. 
Starting with the numbers on Slide 2. Orders were robust, up 42%, with growth in all segments in both services and equipment, reflecting continued demand for our technology and solutions and better commercial execution. Industrial revenue was mixed. We saw a continued strength in services, up 7% organically. Aviation improved significantly, benefiting from the market recovery. Equipment was down 9% organically, largely due to supply chain disruptions, the Ford ventilator comparison in health care, and as expected, lower power equipment. Adjusted Industrial margin expanded 270 basis points organically, largely driven by operational improvement in many of our businesses, growth in higher-margin services at Aviation and Power, and net restructuring benefits. Adjusted EPS was up significantly, driven by Industrial. Industrial free cash flow was up $1.8 billion ex discontinued factoring programs due to better earnings, working capital and the short-term favorable timing impact of aircraft delivery delays. 
Overall, I'm encouraged by our performance, especially at Aviation. Let me share what gives me -- gives us confidence there. First, our results reflect a significant improvement in near-term market fundamentals. Departure trends are better than the August dip and have recovered to down 23% of '19 levels. We expect this acceleration in traffic to continue as travel restrictions lift and vaccination rates increase.
Our results also reflect operating improvements. For example, at Aviation's overhaul shops, our teams have used lean to increase turnaround time by nearly 10% and decrease shop inventory levels by 15% since the fourth quarter of 2020. These improvements are enabling us to get engines back to customers faster and at a lower cost.
No business is better positioned than GE Aviation to support our customers through the coming up cycle. We're ready with the industry's largest and youngest fleet, while we continue to invest for the next generation with lower carbon technologies, such as the CFM RISE program. This platform will generate value for decades to come. 
We're also clearly navigating headwinds as we close this year and look to 2022. We're feeling the impact of supply chain disruptions in many of our businesses, with the largest impact to date in Healthcare. Based on broader industry trends, we expect company-wide pressure to continue, at least into the first half of next year. Our teams are working diligently to increase supply by activating dual sources, qualifying alternative parts, redesigning and requalifying product configurations and expanding factory capacity. We're also focused on margins as we deploy lean to decrease inventory and costs as well as implement appropriate pricing actions and to reduce select discounts.
Our C team -- our CT team in Japan, for example, has been experiencing higher customer demand, so we're making our production even more efficient to help offset the challenge of delayed inputs. The team used value stream mapping, standard work and quarterly Kaizens to reduce production lead time once parts are received by more than 40% from a year ago. And there's line of sight there to another 25% reduction by the end of the year. While this is a single example within Healthcare, taken together with other efforts, and over time, these add up.
At renewables, we're encouraged by the U.S. administration's commitment to offshore wind development. However, in Onshore Wind, the pending U.S. production tax credit extension is creating uncertainty for customers and causing much less U.S. market activity in preparation for 2022. As we've shared, a blanket extension, while a well-intended policy, has the unintended consequence of pushing out investment decisions. In our business, given the lag between orders and revenue, the impact will continue through the fourth quarter and into '22. This environment, along with inflation headwinds picking up next year, makes renewables' ongoing work to improve cost productivity even more urgent. 
Given these puts and takes, we now expect revenue to be about flat for the year, driven by changes to some of our business outlooks, which Carolina will cover in a moment. Importantly, even with lower revenue, we're raising our margin and EPS expectations, underscoring improved profitability and services growth and reflecting our strengthened operations. And we're narrowing our free cash flow range around the existing midpoint. 
Looking further out to next year, as our businesses continue to strengthen, we expect revenue growth, margin expansion and higher free cash flow despite the pressures that we're managing through currently. We'll provide more detail as usual during our fourth quarter earnings and outlook call. 
Moving on to Slide 3. Challenges aside, our performance reflects the continued progress in our journey to become a more focused, simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial. The GECAS and AerCap combination is a tremendous catalyst, enabling us to focus on our industrial core and accelerate our deleveraging plan. Just last week, GE and AerCap satisfied all regulatory clearances for the GECAS transaction. And we're now targeting to close November 1. We'll use the proceeds to further reduce debt, which we now expect to reach approximately $75 billion since the end of 2018. This is enabling GE to look longer term even as we execute our deleveraging.
As we accelerate our transformation, lean and decentralization are key to improving operational results. This quarter, we hosted our global Kaizen week in each of our businesses, with over 1,600 employees participating. John Slattery, the CEO of GE Aviation, and I joined our Military team in Lynn, Massachusetts for the full week, while our business CEOs joined their teams across the globe. 
Lean is fundamentally about going to Gemba, where the real work is done, and is best learned in operations where you can see it, touch it, smell it firsthand. And in Lynn, we were there to serve those closest to the work, our operators. Our mission was to improve first-time yield on midframes, a key subassembly of the military engines we produce in Lynn, whose [ stubborn ] variability has been directly and negatively impacting our on-time delivery. By the end of the week, we had improved processes for welding and quality checks on midframe parts, improvements that we're convinced will help us reach our goals for military on-time delivery by the middle of next year, if not earlier. And we can improve our performance on the back of these changes for years to come. 
There are countless other examples of how our teams are leveraging lean to drive sustainable, impactful improvements in safety, quality, delivery, cost and cash. They reflect how we're running GE better and how we're sustaining these efforts to drive operational progress and lasting cultural change.
Our significant progress on deleveraging and operational execution sets us up well to play offense in the future. Our first priority of course, is organic growth. This starts with improving our team's abilities to market, sell and service the products we have. 
There are many recent wins across GE this quarter, but to highlight one, our Gas Power team delivered, installed and commissioned 4 TM2500 aeroderivative gas turbines in only 42 days to complement renewable power generation for California's Department of Water Resources during peak demand season. These turbines, using jet engine technology adapted for industrial and utility power generation, start and ramp in just minutes, providing rapid and reliable intermittent power, helping enhance the flexibility and sustainability of California's grid.
And we're bolstering our offerings with innovative new technology that serves our customers and leads our industries forward. For example, at renewables, our Haliade-X offshore wind turbine prototype operating in the Netherlands, set an industry record by operating at 14 megawatts, more output than has ever been produced by any wind turbine. 
From time to time, we'll augment our organic efforts with inorganic investments. Our recently announced acquisition of BK Medical represents a step forward as we advance our mission of precision health care. Bringing BK's intraoperative ultrasound technology together with the pre- and postoperative capabilities in our Ultrasound business creates a compelling customer offering across the full continuum of care, from diagnostics, through surgical, and therapeutic interventions as well as patient monitoring. Not only does BK expand our high-performing $3 billion Ultrasound business, but it also is growing rapidly with attractive margins itself. We expect the transaction to close in '22, and I'm looking forward to welcoming the BK team to GE.
All told, we hope that you see that GE is operating from a position of strength today. We delivered another strong quarter, and we're playing more offense, which will only accelerate over time. We're excited about the opportunities ahead to drive long-term growth and value.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Carolina, who will provide further insights on the quarter."
177031,1684891743,2412909,"General Electric Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Larry.

Our results reflect our team's commitment to driving operational improvement. We're leveraging lean across GE and our finance function. In addition to Kaizen week that Larry mentioned, over 1,800 finance team members completed a full waste work week, applying lean and digital tools to reduce nonvalue-added work by 26,000 hours and counting. For example, at renewables, our team streamlined and automated account reconciliations, intercompany settlements and cash applications. This type of transactional lean frees up time so we can focus more on driving higher-quality, faster operational insights and improvement, helping our operating teams run the businesses more efficiently.
Looking at Slide 4, I'll cover on an organic basis. Orders were robust, up 42% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially on a reported basis, building on revenue momentum heading into '22. Equipment and services in all businesses were up year-over-year, with strength in Aviation, renewables and Healthcare. We are more selective in the commercial deals we pursue, with a greater focus on pricing in an inflation environment, economic terms and cash. Together with targeting more profitable segments like services, we're enhancing order quality to drive profitable growth.
Revenue was up sequentially, with growth in services, driven by Aviation and Power, but down year-over-year. Equipment revenue was down, with the largest impact in Healthcare and Power. Overall, mix continues to shift towards higher-margin services, now representing half of the revenue. 
Adjusted Industrial margins improved sequentially, largely driven by aviation services. Year-over-year, total margins expanded 270 basis points, driven by our lean efforts, cost productivity and services growth. Both Aviation and Power delivered margin expansion, which offset the challenges in Healthcare and renewables. 
Consistent with the broader market, we are experiencing inflation pressure, which we expect to be limited for the balance of '21. Next year, we anticipate a more challenging inflation environment. The most adverse impact is expected in onshore wind due to the rising cost of transportation and commodities, such as steel and resin, impacting the entire industry. 
We are taking action to mitigate inflation in each of our businesses. Our shorter-cycle businesses felt the impact earliest, while our longer-cycle businesses were more protected given extended purchasing and production cycles. Our service businesses fall in between. Our teams are working hard across functions to drive cost countermeasures and improve how we bid on businesses, including price escalation. Finally, adjusted EPS was up 50% year-over-year, driven by Industrial. 
Overall, we're pleased with the robust demand, evidenced by orders growth and our year-to-date margin performance. While we're navigating headwinds caused by supply chain and PTC pressure, these have impacted our growth expectations. We're now expecting revenue to be about flat for the year. However, due to our continued improvement across GE, we are raising our '21 outlook for organic margin expansion to 350 basis points or more and our adjusted EPS to a range of $1.80 to $2.10. 
Moving to cash. A major focus of our transformation has been strengthening our cash flow generation through better working capital management and improved linearity, ultimately to drive more consistent and sustainable cash flow. Our quarterly results show the benefits of these efforts.
Industrial free cash flow was up $1.8 billion ex discontinued factoring programs in both years. Aviation, Power and Healthcare all had robust free cash flow conversion in the quarter. Cash earnings, working capital, and allowance and discount payments, or AD&A, driven by the deferred aircraft delivery payment, contributed to this significant increase.
Looking at working capital, I'll focus on receivables, where we saw the largest operational improvement. Receivables were a source of cash, up $1.3 billion year-over-year ex the impact of discontinued factoring, mainly driven by Gas Power collections. Overall, strengthening our operational muscles in billings and collections is translating into DSO improvement, as evidenced by our total DSO, which is down 13 days year-over-year. 
Also positively impacting our free cash flow by about $0.5 billion in the quarter was AD&A. Given the year-to-date impact and our fourth quarter estimate aligned with the current airframer aircraft delivery schedule, we now expect positive flow in '21, about $300 million, which is $700 million better than our prior outlook. This year's benefit will reverse in 2022, and together with higher aircraft delivery schedule expectations, will drive an outflow of approximately $1.2 billion next year. To be clear, this is a timing issue.
You'll recall that we decided to exit the majority of our factoring programs earlier this year. In the quarter, discontinued factoring impact was just under $400 million, which was adjusted out of free cash flow. The fourth quarter impact should be under $0.5 billion, bringing our full year factoring adjustment to approximately $3.5 billion.
Without the factoring dynamics, better operational management of receivables have become a true cross-functional effort. Let me share an example. Our Steam Power team recently shifted to this from a more siloed approach. Leveraging problem solving and value stream mapping, they have reduced average billing cycle time by 30% so far. So only 2 quarters in, more linear business operations, both up and downstream, are starting to drive more linear billings and collections. While we have a way to go, more linear business operations drive better and sustainable free cash flow. Year-to-date, ex discontinuing factoring across all quarters, free cash flow increased $4.8 billion year-over-year. 
In each of our businesses, our teams are driving working capital improvement, which together with higher earnings make a real and measurable impact. Taking the strong year-to-date performance, coupled with the headwinds we've described, we're narrowing our full year free cash flow range to $3.75 billion to $4.75 billion. 
Turning to Slide 6. We expect to close the GECAS transaction on November 1. This strategic transaction not only deepens our focus on our industrial core, but also enables us to accelerate our debt reduction, with approximately $30 billion in consideration. Given our deleveraging progress and cash flow improvement to date, plus our expected actions and better [ pass-through ] performance, we now expect a total reduction of approximately $75 billion since the end of 2018. 
GE will receive a 46% equity stake in one of the world's leading aviation lessors, which we will monetize as the aviation industry continues to recover. As we've shared, we expect near-term leverage to remain elevated. And we remain committed to further debt reduction and our leverage target over the next few years. 
On liquidity, we ended the quarter with $25 billion of cash. We continued to see significant improvement in lowering GE's cash needs, currently at $11 billion, down from $13 billion in the quarter, taking this decrease due to reduced factoring and better working capital management. This is an important proof point that we are able to operate with lower and more predictable cash needs, creating opportunities for high-return investments. 
Moving to the businesses, which I'll also speak to on an organic basis. First, on Aviation. Our improved results reflect a significantly stronger market. Departure trends recovered from August. It's early, but the pickup that began in September is continuing through October. Better departures and customer confidence contributed to higher shop visits and spare part sales than we had initially anticipated. The impact of green time utilization has also lessened. We expect these positive trends will continue into the fourth quarter. 
Orders were up double-digits. Both commercial engines and services were up substantially again year-over-year. Military orders were also up, reflecting a large Hindustan Aeronautics order for nearly 100 F404 engines along with multiple T700 orders. 
For revenue, Commercial Services was up significantly, with strength in external spares. Shop visit volume was up over 40% year-over-year and double-digits sequentially, with the overall scope slightly improved. We continued to see higher concentration of narrowbody and regional aircraft shop visits. 
Commercial Engines was down double-digits with lower shipments. Our mix continues to shift from legacy to more NPI units, specifically LEAP, and lower production rates on GEnx. We're also navigating through material fulfillment constraints, amplified by increased industry demand, which impacted deliveries.
Military was down marginally. Unit shipments were flat sequentially, but up year-over-year. Without the delivery challenges, Military revenue growth would have been high single-digits this quarter. Given this continued impact, Military growth is now expected to be negative for the year.
Segment margin expanded significantly, primarily driven by Commercial Services and operational cost reduction. In the fourth quarter, we expect margins to continue to expand sequentially, achieving our low double-digit margin guide for the year. We now expect '21 shop visits to be up at least mid-single-digit year-over-year versus about flat. Our solid performance, especially in services, underscores our strong underlying business fundamentals as the commercial market recovers.
Moving to Healthcare. Market momentum is driving very high demand while we navigate supply chain constraints. Government and private health systems are investing in capital equipment to support capacity demand and to improve quality of care across the market. Building on a 20-year partnership, we recently signed a 5-year renewal to service diagnostic imaging and biomedical equipment with HCA Healthcare, one of the nation's leading providers of health care. Broadly, we're adapting to overarching market needs of health system efficiency, digitization as well as resiliency and sustainability.
Against that backdrop, orders were up double-digits, both year and versus '19, with strength in Healthcare Systems up 20% year-over-year, and PDx up high single-digits. However, revenue was down with a high single-digit decline at HCS, more than offsetting the high single-digit growth we saw at PDx. You'll recall that last year, the Ford ventilator partnership was about $300 million of Life Care Solutions revenue. This comp negatively impacted revenue by 6 points. And thinking about the industry-wide supply shortages, we estimate that growth would have been approximately 9 points higher if we were able to fill our orders. And these challenges will continue into at least the first half of '22.
Segment margin declined year-over-year, largely driven by higher inflation and lower Life Care Solutions revenue. This was partially offset by productivity and higher PDx volume. Even with the supply chain challenges, we now expect to deliver close to 100 basis point of margin expansion as we proactively manage sourcing and logistics. 
Overall, we're well positioned to keep investing in future growth, underscoring our confidence in profit and cash flow generation. We're putting capital to work differently than in the past, supplementing organic growth with inorganic investments that are a good strategic fit. These are focused on accelerating our precision health mission, like BK Medical. And we're strengthening our operational and strategic integration muscles. 
At renewables, we're excited by our long-term growth potential, supported by new technologies like Haliade-X and Cypress and our leadership in energy transition despite the current industry headwinds. Looking at the market, since the second quarter, the pending PTC extension has caused further deterioration in the U.S. onshore market outlook. Based on the latest WoodMac forecast for equipment and repower, the market is now expected to decline from 14 gigawatts of wind installments this year to approximately 10 gigawatts in 2022. This pressures orders and cash in '21. 
In Offshore Wind, global momentum continues, and we're aiming to expand our commitment pipeline through the decade. And modernizing the grid is a key enabler of the energy transition. And we saw record orders, driven by offshore, where the project-driven profile will remain uneven. This leads to continued variability for progress collection. 
Onshore orders grew modestly, driven by services and international equipment, partially offset by lower U.S. equipment due to the PTC dynamics. Revenue declined significantly. Services was the main driver, largely due to fewer onshore repower deliveries. Ex repower, onshore services was up double-digits. Equipment was down to a lesser extent, driven by declines in the U.S. onshore and grid. This was partially offset by continued growth in international onshore and offshore. For the year, we now expect revenue growth to be roughly flat.
Segment margin declined 250 basis points. Onshore was slightly positive, but down year-over-year. Cost reductions were more than offset by lower U.S. repower volume, mix headwinds as new products ramp and come down the cost curve as well as supply chain pressure. Offshore margins remain negative as we work through legacy projects and continue to ramp Haliade-X production. At grid, better execution was more than offset by lower volume. Due mainly to the PTC impact, we now expect renewables free cash flow to be down and negative this year. Looking forward, where we are facing headwinds, we're intently focused on improving our operational performance, profitability and cash generation. 
Moving to Power. We're performing well. Looking at the market, global gas generation was down high single-digits due to price-driven gas-to-coal switching. Yes, you heard me right, gas to coal switching. However, GE gas turbine utilization continues to be resilient as megawatt hours grew low single-digits. Despite recent price volatility, gas continues to be a reliable and economic source of power generation. Over time, as more baseload coal comes offline and with the challenges of intermediate renewables power, customers continue to need gas. Through the next decade, we expect the gas market to remain stable, with gas generation growing low single digits. 
Orders were driven by Gas Power services, aero and steam, each up double-digits. Gas equipment was down despite booking 6 more heavy-duty gas turbine as timing for HAs remain uneven across quarters. We continued to stay selective with disciplined underwriting to grow our installed base. And this quarter, we booked orders for smaller-frame units.
Demand for aeroderivative power continues. For the year, we expect about 60 unit orders, up more than 5x year-over-year. Revenue was down slightly. Equipment was down due to reduced turnkey scope at Gas Power and the continued exit of new build coal at steam. Consistent with our strategy, we are on track to achieve about 30% turnkey revenue as a percentage of heavy-duty equipment revenue this year, down from 55% in 2019, a better risk-return equation. 
At the same time, Gas Power shipped 11 more units year-over-year. Gas Power services was up high single-digits, trending better than our initial outlook due to strong CSA volume. We now expect Gas Power services to grow high single-digits this year. Steam services was also up. 
Margins expanded year-over-year, yet were down sequentially due to outage seasonality. Gas Power was positive and improved year-over-year, driven by services growth and aero shipments. We remain confident in our high single-digit margin outlook for the year. Steam is progressing through the new build coal exit. And by year-end, we expect our equipment backlog to be less than $1 billion compared to $3 billion a year ago. Power Conversion was positive and expanded in the quarter. 
Overall, we're encouraged by our steady performance. Power is on track to meet its outlook, including high single-digit margins in '23 plus. 
Our team is focused on winning the right orders, growing services and increasing free cash flow generation. 
Moving to Slide 8. As a reminder, following the GECAS close in the fourth quarter, we will transition to one column reporting and roll in the remainder of GE Capital into Corporate. Going forward, our results, including adjusted revenue, profit and free cash flow, will exclude insurance. To be clear, we'll continue to provide the same level of insurance disclosures. In all, this simplifies the presentation of our results as we focus on our industrial core. 
At Capital, the loss in continuing operations was up year-over-year, driven primarily by a nonrepeat of prior year tax benefit, partially offset by the discontinuation of the preferred dividend payment. At Insurance, we generated $360 million net income year-to-date, driven by positive investment results and claims still favorable to pre-COVID levels. However, this favorable claim trends are slowing in certain parts of the portfolio.
As planned, we conducted our annual premium deficiency test, also known as the loss recognition test. This resulted in a positive margin, with no impact to earnings for a second consecutive year. The margin increase was largely driven by a higher discount rate, reflecting our investment portfolio realignment strategy, with a higher allocation towards select growth assets. Claims costs curve continued to hold. In addition, the teams are preparing to implement the new FASB accounting standard, consistent with the industry, and we're working on modeling updates. 
Based on our year-to-date performance, Capital still expects a loss of approximately $500 million for the year. In discontinued operations, Capital reported a gain of about $600 million, primarily due to the recent increase in AerCap stock price, which is updated quarterly. 
Moving to Corporate. Our priorities are to reduce functional and operational costs as we drive leaner processes and embrace decentralization. The results are flowing through, with costs down double-digits year-over-year. We are now expecting Corporate costs to be about $1 billion for the year, and this is better than our prior $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion guidance.
As you can see, lean and decentralization aren't just concepts. They are driving better execution and cultural change. They are supporting another strong quarter. They are enabling our businesses to play more offense. And ultimately, they're driving sustainable, long-term profitable growth. 
Now Larry, back to you."

Let's turn to Slide 9. Our teams continued to deliver strong performance. We're especially encouraged by our earnings improvement, which makes us confident in our ability to deliver our outlook for the year. You've seen today that our transformation to a more focused, simpler, stronger, high-tech industrial is accelerating. We're on the verge of closing the GECAS-AerCap merger, a tremendous milestone for GE. 
Stepping back, our progress has positioned us to play offense. We just wrapped up our annual strategic reviews with nearly 30 of our business units. These complement our quarterly operating reviews, but have a longer-term focus as we answer 2 fundamental questions: What game are we playing? And how do we win? These reviews were exceptionally strong this year across the board, with the most strategic and cross-functional thinking we've seen in my 3 years, enabling us to drive long-term growth and value across GE, while delivering on our mission of building a world that works. We're positioned to truly shape the future of flight with new technology for sustainability and efficiency, such as the recent Catalyst engine launch, the first clean sheet turboprop design entering the business in general aviation market in 50 years. 
Touching 1 billion patients per year, we're delivering more personalized and efficient care through precision health and combining digital AI within our products, including our new cloud-based Edison TruePACS, to help radiologists adapt to higher workloads and increased exam complexity with improved diagnostic accuracy. 
Through our leadership in the energy transition, we're helping the world tackle the trilemma of sustainability, affordability and reliability from launching new tech platforms at renewables, such as the Haliade-X and Cypress; to our recently announced flexible transformer project with the Department of Energy; to growth in the world's most efficient gas turbines. 
To be clear, we still have work to do. And as we do it, we're operating increasingly from a position of strength, serving our customers in vital global markets with a focus on profitable growth and cash generation. Our free cash flow will continue to grow towards a high single-digit percentage of sales level. And we have an opportunity to allocate more resources on capital deployment to support GE's growth over time. 
Steve, with that, let's go to questions."

Like-for-like, we expect Industrial free cash flow to step up. We expect our business earnings to improve. We expect that through top line growth and margin expansion that will turn into profit, which we then believe -- well, which we then will see go to cash, right? 
Then if you look a little bit outside of earnings, we do have a couple of significant cash flow items to think about. We have mentioned the supply chain headwinds that we think will continue into next year. So that will hamper both on the profitability but also on inventory. And then we have the headwind of AD&A. We talked about that in this year. It's going to be more positive, but it's going to be a big headwind in next year. And this is really only a timing effect because of when customers expect to deliver the aircraft, right?
And overall, my last comment on Industrial side will be, if you look at working capital, with that growth in mind, we will need some working capital to fund the top line growth, right? But on the other hand, we also expect to continue to improve working capital management, for example, in receivables, and to some extent, also to inventory. Within that, we do see improvement in linearity as possible as well. So that's like-for-like on the Industrial side. 
If we then add the consolidated Capital or basically what's left of Capital then, consolidated in, like-for-like, we expect it to also increase. And the increase on top of that would mainly be driven by the lower interest that we will see from debt reduction. So we are confident in an overall growing trajectory, both Industrial like-for-like as well as including Capital."

When we talk about that, let's just take for simplicity's sake, 8% on a revenue base akin to where we were in 2019, right? That pencils out on a $85 billion to $90 billion revenue base to, say, $7 billion of free cash. 
That's really going to be an earnings, lower restructuring spend and better working capital management story. Clearly, from a profit perspective, that's going to be an Aviation-led dynamic. Healthcare right in behind it. And then we still anticipate that we turn Power profitable, and we get a couple of billion dollars of profit from Power. You deduct, call it, $1.4 billion for Corporate. But you get close to, let's call it, $10 billion of op profit, convert that to, net of interest and taxes, at 90%, you get to that same $7 billion figure. So we think we're on our way.

And when you have a positive margin, that means no charge to the P&L. Yes, and the margin was 11% positive, which is significantly higher than what we have seen. It was mainly driven by the discount rate increase. It increased from 5.7% to 6.15%. And I would say that increase was really driven by asset allocation and really, our plan to increase the amount allocated to growth assets, where we're going from [ 9 to 15 ]. The other variables had -- like morbidity and mortality, inflation in premium, they were a small impact. So we're really happy with that. 
And your question then on top of that, sort of for CFT, so CFT or the cash flow testing, that is what decides, yes, if there's a need to add cash to the insurance. I would say like this, it's not one to one. Yes, the variables are similar to LRT, but they are used under moderately adverse conditions. I would say the modeling will happen beginning of next year, as usual. We will look at our investment portfolio realignment and the changes factored into that model. Also look at the future cash flow. But it could have some adverse effect because we're using more granular assumptions. But I would say, overall, the good news from the LRT bodes very well for the CFT, but it's not one to one."

We have the shorter-cycle businesses like Healthcare, where we are feeling the impact faster than the longer cycle, like Power, and we have sort of services in between. On the longer cycle ones, they are more protected because of the, I would say, the extended purchasing and production cycles. We are seeing the main pressures on commodities like steel, but also logistics pressure is increasing, right? 
Specific to 2021, we have felt inflation, but so far, we've been able to offset it. And we expect the impact for the full year to be limited in '21, the net impact. For 2022, we do expect to see significant pressure. And I would say it's top of our list of priorities for next year. And we're taking both price and cost countermeasures."

And as you would imagine, in an environment like this, we're not only working the value add, value engineering, the more traditional cost actions aggressively. We're working with the supply base as feverishly as we can, both on availability and on cost. 
That said, as Carolina was alluding to on the price side, we're doing all we can in the shorter-cycle businesses. It's a little easier, say, in Healthcare, where we've got more like-for-like. We can see those price actions. We're beginning to see some early traction there. Services is a bit mixed. But where we have opportunities, say, on spares and within the escalation frameworks within some of the longer-term service agreements, we're obviously going to get what we can there. 
You spoke to projects. I mean that's -- it's a little bit more bespoke. But it -- while it's difficult to measure price like-for-like, we are managing the margins with some of the longer-term procurement efforts that Carolina alluded to. 
Just more broadly on the backlog, it's important to remember, when you look at what -- it's what, $380 billion of backlog, 70% of that's in Aviation. Virtually, all of that is in services. So certainly, a competitive space. But between the catalog pricing dynamics and some of the escalation protection, we think we're well positioned. But we take nothing for granted there. Outside of Aviation, the bulk of the backlog is also in services, where similar dynamics apply. But again, limited pressure net-net in '21, building headwinds for us next year. We've got time to work both the cost and the price countermeasures. And as Carolina said, I don't think we've got a higher priority operationally here in the short term than those 2."

It's not going to be as pronounced year to year here. In the fourth quarter, probably it's going to be up, call it, 30%. In October thus far, we're off to a good start in terms of underlying activity. 
All of that's been coupled with, I would say, robust spare part demand from third-party providers. So right, it's that coupling up, if you will, of volume and value that are going to set us up for a pretty good second half here and going into next year.
We're working through supply chain challenges here, be it material, be it labor, as we are everywhere else. I think we're positioned here, at least as we -- as best we can see. I'm glad you highlighted the lean improvements, right? Rather than just throwing a lot of bodies and a lot of capital into the breach, we really are trying to work the process. Russell Stokes and the team in services understand that very well, which is why we highlighted some of the turnaround improvements that we did in our formal remarks. 
You go back to, I guess, what was technically the second quarter, but the -- middle of June, John Slattery, in concert with our partners at Safran, announced the CFM RISE program, which really is a multigenerational technology investment program to make sure we're on a path, be it with sustainable aviation fuels, be it hybrids, be it hydrogen, to be in a position to maintain the industry leadership this business has enjoyed for decades. 
So there's a lot to come. We're going to be spending. And we're going to be spending smartly in and around those areas to launch technologies that ultimately transition into product programs as our airframer and airline customers deem appropriate. So a lot going on short term and long term. But again, we really like where Aviation is, particularly with the departure trends and the outlook here in the near term."

So if we start with the Aviation and the margin -- and you talked about the margin going into the fourth quarter, right? So what we are seeing, and I think an important add on the third quarter, is that we see a shift clearly towards services, right? So in the third quarter, we had 20% growth of services, while equipment was down. So this better mix also tilted toward external really is what makes you see the drop-through, right? 
And Larry talked about higher shop visits, so 40% up year-over-year. We also saw the strong third-party sales, up around 30%. For the fourth quarter, we have the seasonality, as you know, but we also don't expect it to be as high for the fourth quarter. So we expect to continue sort of from the third quarter into the fourth quarter with a sequential improvement. And overall, that's how we get to our low double-digit margins for 2021. We haven't specifically said exactly what the profit is in the fourth quarter for Aviation. But with all those pieces, you sort of piece it together. 
For 2022, you asked about Aviation free cash flow. So I would say a couple of things. You're right on the AD&A. It is a timing issue. So we'll have a big headwind next year on the AD&A side. But what we do see is we expect return to flight to continue. So we will expect to see basically utilization being driven, which means more hours flown, which means higher billings on our CSAs. You know that cash comes before the profit. So we do expect to have really good uptick on services and the cash flow. So basically, on the CSA side there. 
Yes, AD&A will be a headwind. But on top of that, we'll also have the profit that we will see from more shop visits. So overall, the mix of that gets us to a positive place. I think it's mainly the services and the CSAs. That is the big positive."

So I think it's important to take a step back.

And if we look at jumping off point for 2020 for free cash flow for the full year, the free cash flow, excluding factoring and biopharma, we were $2.4 billion in 2020. If you take our -- a midpoint of our guide now and you add back the factoring, you get to $5 billion for this year. So just to put in perspective, we're going from last year, $2.4 billion to midpoint of $5 billion this year. So we're doubling the cash flow for 2021. We are also seeing linearity improvements in 2021, which is part of the reason the fourth quarter not being as unlinear as it has been before. 
After the range that we have, there are basically 2 main areas that bring us uncertainty: one, some of the supply chain challenges; and the other one is the PTC pressure that we then expect to impact progress. So what does that exactly mean for the fourth quarter? Well, we'll have higher sequential profit, and we expect to see free cash from the market improving and some of the usual seasonality. But it would still be down year-over-year. The supply chain challenges, you'll see through earnings, but also through inventory, right? It's going to be a lot stack in WIP that isn't going out.
And then for the full year, fourth quarter last year, you remember we had big renewables progress of $1 billion. So we don't expect that to happen this year. And then I've also previously talked about the Aviation MAX settlements and CARES Act as positive one-offs in fourth quarter last year. If you take that all together, that's how we get to the fourth quarter, and importantly, how we get to $5 billion jumping off point of free cash flow this year, which is really important proof point and step to our high single-digit fee margin journey that Larry talked about a little while ago."

But to be in a position to have line of sight now on what will be a cumulative approximately $75 billion debt reduction over the last 3 years allows us, I think, to look at the balance sheet and begin to think about playing more offense and take advantage of the strategic optionality that we have been looking to build and grow. That goes hand in hand with the underlying improvements, some of which, I would argue, you see in these numbers. Others, like what I saw in the shop floor and Lynn a few weeks back, you don't see yet, but which I think give us confidence that more improvements in terms of top line, bottom line and cash are forthcoming. 
And all that really does is, I think, allow us to both invest in the business more aggressively, organically and inorganically. That's why we were so excited about the BK Medical transaction. Admittedly small, but the strategic logic behind it, the value-add, operationally, our $3 billion high-performing Ultrasound business will generate and the high single-digit returns we think we will have in time, that's what we should be doing more of in concert with what we're going to do organically. 
All of that really sets us up, I think, Andrew, to be in a position to really realize the full potential of these wonderful businesses in the GE portfolio. There are a host of ways that could play out over time. But first things first, right? We've got some business here with the GECAS and AerCap merger to work through. We've got these operating challenges to navigate through the fourth quarter and going into next year. But I really do think we're increasingly operating from a position of strength. I like where we are. And in time, we will realize the full value of these businesses."

First of all, in steam, which is now part of the Power segment and also run by Scott, we have Valerie and her team working through the restructuring there. I would say they are on track. It's a big restructuring. We do expect margins to turn in 2023 and basically have the restructuring to temper down by them. And then the business is going to be 2/3 services going forward at a significantly lower overhead cost, which is what you were alluding to. So we see good traction, but we're still in the middle of it. So again, it will take time until 2023. But then we'll have a very different business with a high service element and lower overheads."

As you will appreciate, our focus continues to be on running that business as well as we can for our customers. Recently, we did acknowledge that we are in discussions with EDF regarding a potential transaction. If there's an opportunity to create value, we'll certainly pursue it. 
But if you step back for a moment, I think we are of the view that nuclear overall has an important role to play in the energy transition. We know the French government is strongly of that view. They aren't alone. I was in the U.K. last week where we had similar conversations, particularly in and around advanced nuclear technology, particularly in the case of the small modular reactors, which we know can provide carbon-free, dependable baseload and flexible capacity as we move forward here. So we've got a lot of capabilities in and around nuclear, really the whole nuclear life cycle. So we don't talk a lot about it, but it is part of the power framework for the energy transition and one we'll continue to manage as best we can going forward."

I think with respect to the U.S. market for onshore wind, we do see a step-down here going into '22, probably stepping down from, say, 14 to 10 gigawatts.

I think with respect to the U.S. market for onshore wind, we do see a step-down here going into '22, probably stepping down from, say, 14 to 10 gigawatts. It's not yet set in stone because these conversations are active and underway in Washington, given all the legislation under review that run up to COP26 and the like. 
I think what we are incorporating in our commentary here today is a more pessimistic, perhaps, but updated view relative to the very near term. So in the absence of those incentives in the short term, we're going to feel pressure, both on new unit orders and in repowering. So some of that impacts cash. Some of that impacts margins relative to repowering installations this year. The good news is this is all part of a long-term extension given the administration's commitment to the energy transition, to the role of both onshore and relatedly offshore wind in that transition.
So if you take the decade-long view, the impetus or the imperative for us is really to manage these businesses better to generate better margins -- operating margins. But in the short term, we've got some additional pressures just given the reduction in demand that will follow the uncertainty around the tax incentives. And they hit us hard because the North American market, the U.S. market is clearly the best onshore wind market for us on a global basis."

I'm not sure we're yet at a place where we would say that things are stable. We may have line of sight. We may have improvements in one commodity or in one business. But almost without fail, the next day, right, a commodity, a supplier, a logistics provider that we thought was good for the next 6 weeks or the next 6 months offers up a revision to that outlook. So I think I've used a phrase I probably shouldn't, but I'll repeat it. It really is akin to playing Whac-A-Mole, right? By business, by commodity, by geography, it just seems like every day, there's new news to battle with. 
I couldn't be more pleased with the way our team is navigating all of this, both in terms of availability and cost. We've got new procurement leadership in a number of businesses. We're really trying to make sure that we're true to our lean imperative of safety, quality, delivery and cost in that order. We don't want to have a short-term Band-Aid that costs us long term. But it really is a tactical, muscular endeavor right now that we're working our way through. 
You've heard others. You've heard some of the key suppliers talk about electronic components likely to be at least a 2-, 3-quarter challenge, maybe longer. That's important for us in certain businesses and certainly in some of our higher-margin businesses. But we're working through it. It's probably more challenging, if not more challenging than I've ever seen in my career. But we'll work our way through it. Things will level out in time. And I think that given this was an area where we wanted to strengthen our operational capabilities, while it's more challenging in the short term, we'll be better for it medium to long term."

But that's 9 points of real pressure given the supply chain issues that Nicole was just probing us on. And again, I think Carolina mentioned that the Ford ventilator effort a year ago for the HHS was a significantly tough comp.
But if you look at the 19% orders growth, if you look at what's happening both in the public and the private spheres, plus what we're doing increasingly both from a commercial and from a product perspective, we've talked about the opportunity to take this business from a low single-digit grower in the mid-single-digit range to grow margins in the 25 to 70 basis points over time. 
I've got more conviction about our potential to do that than I did a year ago. Just off a U.K. trip where I had some quality time with a number of our business leaders over there, our PDx business in particular, lots of good things going on. We've got a CEO transition here in the offing that we're excited about. Kieran Murphy has done a heck of a job with that business. Pete Arduini coming in is, I think, very much committed to those types of expectations. He's certainly coming because he's excited about the potential that he sees across the GE Healthcare portfolio. 
So we wish it weren't as much of a camouflage, the headline here given the supply chain issues. We'll work through it and just feel like this is a strong business that will get stronger over time."
