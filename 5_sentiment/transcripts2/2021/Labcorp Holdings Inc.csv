With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to 2021 guidance and the related assumptions, including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial conditions, our responses to and the expected future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business more generally as well as on general economic, business and market conditions. Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.

Before I cover 2020 results, I want to first thank Clarissa for her leadership in Investor Relations for the last several years. Clarissa has been promoted to lead our revenue cycle management team, which is a very important role. 
I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Chas Cook, who has been appointed to Vice President of Investor Relations, and will continue to strengthen the foundation built upon by the IR team. Chad has been a strong leader in our finance organization since he joined LabCorp in 2018. 
Moving now to 2020 results. 2020 will be remembered for many things, including the fight against COVID and the tragic loss that it brought. It also emphasizes the critical importance of frontline health care workers and scientists, amongst others. 
Looking back on this past year, I cannot be more impressed or thankful to my colleagues across LabCorp. Together, our team developed 6 FDA EUA COVID tests, performed approximately 35 million COVID test in 2020 and help to bring multiple treatments and vaccines to market in record time. Our ability to adapt quickly to changing environment. Our resilience and our strength of our more than 50-year history have been foundational in the fight against COVID and 2020 was transformational for LabCorp. 
Let me begin with a brief update on our financial results, which Glenn will cover in more detail shortly. We reported full year 2020 revenue of $14 billion, adjusted EPS of $23.94 and free cash flow of $1.8 billion. Our base businesses in both segments continued to improve as we close the year. 
In Diagnostics, our base business performed well. However, volume remains below prior year. We also reported continued improvement in our drug development business, with strength across all 3 business lines, leading to a revenue increase in the total and the base business in the fourth quarter. Our Drug Development business ended the year with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.43, driven by strong demand across therapeutic areas. 
Our performance was strong in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. Our teams are agile. They move fast and it clearly demonstrated the strength of our science, technology and innovation. We quickly brought innovations to market while simultaneously advancing each pillar of our company's strategy. Here are just some of the highlights from the year. 
I'll start with we were the first commercial lab to bring an FDA EUA COVID test to market. We became the first to offer an at home PCR collection kit with or without a prescription through Pixel by LabCorp. And we were early to market with neutralizing antibody tests that are important in the development of COVID vaccines. 
In addition, early in a pandemic, our scientist partnered with PacBio to genetically sequence COVID samples so that we can detect changes to the virus and use that information to develop future therapies. Recently, we announced our efforts to Sequence COVID samples for the CDC as the agency continues its important work in the fight against covet. We are seeing the importance of these efforts and believe sequencing will be critical going forward. 
Also, in our Diagnostics business, we brought innovative platforms and test to market that it can prove the diagnosis of important health conditions such as lung cancer and liver disease. Looking at oncology, it continues to be a strategic focus for us. In 2020, we expanded our leadership position in oncology through the launch of a new noninvasive liquid biopsy test using next-generation sequencing for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
We were also selected by a major pharmaceutical company as their partner for late-stage oncology trials. We collaborated with Tempus to accelerate clinical trial patient participation. And as you read in our recent announcement, we have formed an oncology team made up of strong and talented leaders in the field. Additionally, we are continuing to integrate digital, data analytics and artificial intelligence in everything we do. 
Our Drug Development business is changing how clinical trials are managed using digital technology. We completed acquisitions of global Care and Snap IoT and are working with clients to use mobile and digital technology to accelerate trials and to make virtual and hybrid clinical trials a reality. 
Also, within our own lab operations, our engineers and scientists developed proprietary robotics capabilities that increased our COVID testing capacity. As we look at several innovative partnerships to support our clients, patients and scientists, our partnership with PacBio, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Microsoft and Ciox Health enable scientists and researchers to better understand COVID. 
Our collaborations with Infirmary Health, Rush University System for health, Walgreens and others, expanded our services to patients and providers across the United States. We also extended an agreement with BML to further the development of Companion Diagnostics in Japan. 
And lastly, we remain committed to customer satisfaction and remain focused on increasing access to testing, improving time to results and improving delivery to provide our customers with the best-in-class testing and support for important clinical trials. As noted, science, technology and innovation are behind these successes and are foundational to our future. Our updated brand represents the power of our combined businesses and highlights our commitment to science and innovation to improve the health and lives of people around the world. 
I'll close with a few comments about 2021. As you can appreciate, there's still uncertainty heading into 2021, but we believe we have enough visibility to reinstate full year guidance targets, albeit with a wider range than we've historically provided. The fight against COVID is not over, and neither is our commitment to defeating it. We believe the lessons earned in this past year have enhanced the progression of our long-term strategic goals. 
We will continue to seek and invest in high-growth opportunities and positively impact people's health around the world, in areas such as cancer, NASH, Alzheimer's disease and autoimmune diseases, just to name a few. There remain many significant unmet needs in health care, and LabCorp will continue to play an important role in helping to solve them. 
I am confident in both our short-term and our long-term prospects and in our strategy. It will continue to provide a strong platform for growth as we move forward. Before I turn it over to Glenn, I want to thank all of our employees around the world. We were honored to be recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most admired companies for the efforts of our over 75,000 global employees that have worked tirelessly every day to help people live better and move longer. 
Glenn, I'll turn it to you."
30643,700595964,2205618,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Labcorp Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Adam.

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2021 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, an increase of 52% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 50.1%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 46.4% and organic base business growth of 3.7%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 0.6%. 
Operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion or 28.8% of revenue compared to $336 million or 11.4% last year. During the quarter, we had $46 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily due to COVID-related costs and acquisition integration charges. We also had $91 million of amortization, which was higher than recent quarters. 
As part of our new branding initiative, we are transitioning out of the Covance trading. As a result, we are accelerating the amortization of its trade name over the next year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 31.8% of revenue compared to $422 million or 14.3% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic base business growth, acquisitions and launchpad savings, partially offset by PAMA, higher personnel costs and investments to support the company's new branding initiative. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 24.5% compared to 22.4% last year. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.8% compared to 22.9% last year. The higher adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. For modeling purposes, we expect the company's adjusted tax rate for 2021 to be comparable to 2020 at approximately 25%. This does not include any potential increase in the federal tax rate in 2021. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $938 million or $9.54 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items were $10.56 in the quarter, up from $2.86 last year. Operating cash flow was $775 million in the quarter, compared to $570 million a year ago. 
The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by higher working capital to support growth. The higher working capital was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivables and supplies related to COVID testing. 
Capital expenditures totaled $99 million or 2.2% of revenue and included investments to increase COVID testing capacity. This compares to $128 million or 4.3% of revenue in the same period last year. As a result, free cash flow was $675 million in the quarter compared to $442 million last year. This brings our full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion, up from $1 billion in 2019. 
During the quarter, we invested $59 million of acquisitions at year-end, the company had $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. 
As previously communicated, the company will repurchase shares in 2021 as part of its capital allocation strategy. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 79.5% compared to last year, primarily due to organic growth of 78.5%. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 78% and base business growth of 0.5%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 1%. 
Total volume increased 33.9% over last year, primarily due to organic volume growth of 33.3%. The increase in organic volume was due to the contribution from COVID testing volumes of 41%, partially offset by a decline in base business volumes of 7.7%. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 2% to our organic base business volume growth. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved both its highest coved testing results, as well as the highest year-over-year volume performance in the base business since the pandemic began in March of 2020. Price/mix increased 45.5% over last year, primarily driven by Cova testing of 37% and favorable mix in the organic base business of 8.2%. 
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or 39.1% of revenue compared to $277 million or 15.8% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing and Launchpad savings, partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA and higher personnel costs. Diagnostics 3-year launchpad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021. 
Now I'll review the performance of drug development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 16.4% compared to last year, primarily due to organic growth of 13.1%. The increase in organic revenue was due to base business growth of 8.4% and a 4.7% contribution from COVID testing performed through its central lab business. Drug Development delivered broad-based revenue growth, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $248 million or 17.8% of revenue compared to $183 million or 15.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margins were primarily due to COVID testing, organic based business demand and launchpad savings partially offset by higher personnel costs. 
The company achieved its goal to deliver approximately $150 million of net savings from its 3-year drug development LaunchPad initiative. LaunchPad will continue to be the company's primary business process improvement initiative going forward. 
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7 billion and $1.43, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2021 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, for the entire year. In addition, enterprise guidance includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions and share repurchases. 
We expect a change in revenue for the enterprise of minus 1% to plus 4.5% compared to 2020 revenue of $14 billion and includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will grow 11% to 13.5% over 2020 revenue of $11.2 billion. While COVID testing revenue will decline 35% to 50%. We expect a decline in revenue for diagnostics of minus 0.5% to minus 7.5% compared to 2020 revenue of $9.3 billion. This guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will grow 11% to 14% over 2020 revenue of $6.5 billion, while come testing revenue will decline 35% to 50%. We expect drug development revenue to grow 8% to 10.5% over 2020 revenue of $4.9 billion and includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 220 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will grow 9.5% to 12% over 2020 revenue of $4.8 billion despite the continuing negative impact from the pandemic. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $19 to $23 compared to 2020 adjusted EPS of $23.94. The adjusted EPS guidance reflects the expected decline in COVID testing in 2021. 
And free cash flow is expected to be $1.70 to $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion last year. In 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 4% of revenue, driven by investments to support base business growth and productivity. In summary, the company achieved strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have remained focused on ramping up COVID testing capacity while also managing our base business, including continuing to execute on our LaunchPad initiatives. 
As we look to 2021, we expect to drive profitable growth in our base business, while cove testing is expected to decline throughout the year. We also expect another strong year of free cash flow generation that we will use for acquisitions to supplement our organic growth while returning excess cash flow to shareholders through our share repurchase program. 
This concludes our formal remarks. And operator, we will now take questions."

The reason we had to give such a wide range, minus 35% to minus 50% for the testing is because, as you say, it's very difficult to have precision. And you could get to the minus 35% to minus 50% in several different ways. Right now, we've seen a decline in tests. If you look at the last several weeks versus the end of 2020. If that decline continued, and then you saw it continue throughout the whole year, you could get there. If the amount of testing we're doing today, on average, was maintained for the 6 months of this year -- in the first 6 months, well, then you could do 0 for the second half of the year and still be there. So there are multiple different ways to get there. My assumption going in is that the price is going to remain at where it is right now. So right now, it's $100. We're still in the emergency situation. That's been extended through the year. You have to hit the CMS guidelines, which is basically for the previous month, you have to have more than 50% at a 2-day turnaround. And then they look at each sample for the current month. We're well within that range. I mean right now, we did 275,000 tests a day. We're not doing anywhere near that in our turnaround times about a day. So I expect that the price you should assume is still about what we've averaged until now. I think for this quarter, it was about $90 on average. It then comes down to the volume. And I assume that the volume is going to continue to decline, albeit maybe at a lower rate than we saw from the end of last year into this year. And then for the second half of the year, they'll be significantly less than the first half of this year. That's our base case assumption."

So it's the first time we've seen the positive to your point, it's a combination that we still saw lower volumes down 7.7%, but still that's an improvement as we trended through the earlier parts of the year. And it was more than offset by favorable price/mix and we continue to see an unusually high level of favorable mix, primarily driven by higher test prerecession. So the feeling is with the fewer visits that patients are going, they're conducting more tests per visit that they're going through. So again, as we think going forward and reflected in the guidance is we'll continue to see over time, the pickup in our base volumes. But with that, you'll see the core level core lever, if you will. You'll start to see that favorable mix start to come back down to more historical levels."

If you look at COVID right now, basically, the COVID trials accounted for about 12% of our net orders, if you look at the last 3 quarters. So you can see that it's meaningful, but a lot of our growth is coming from outside of Cova trials. And we mentioned in the last quarter that we won a large pharmas oncology book of business. I think that's helpful to us, but also we've won another pharma's non-oncology business. So we continue to show strength outside of COVID, which is very important as we move forward to the base business.

So I'll start by saying that I continue to believe that having diagnostic and drug development together, is a winning scenario. And that you can do significantly better with drug development business by having diagnostic capabilities. There's no dou",481,"Sure. So I'll start by saying that I continue to believe that having diagnostic and drug development together, is a winning scenario. And that you can do significantly better with drug development business by having diagnostic capabilities. There's no doubt in my mind that we've seen that with COVID. I mean, being able to do the diagnostic test of what we're doing drug development, enable us to win more than 400 opportunities across COVID at the same time, I believe that people now have seen it in pharma and biotech. So it opens up the doors for other areas. We won large Pharmas oncology business. I think oncology is the next area that we'll be able to show the benefit of having diagnostic capabilities, particularly Companion Diagnostic capabilities along with drug development. And we are beginning to see in the biotech and pharma clients that this is mattering more and more. So I continue to be very bullish about the ability to have both these businesses together. I've always said that I think that the drug development business benefits more by having diagnostic capabilities than diagnostics does by having drug development. But with that said, we've seen some synergies going the other way, where the drug development group has been working on companion diagnostics, and we're able to potentially launch that in the diagnostic area. So I'm actually seeing benefit to diagnostics over time from drug development. So we continue to make progress there. If you look at virtual and hybrid trials, the reason we've invested there is because I believe it's going to be more important than it's been in the past. And it's been talked about for quite some time. I don't think a lot of pharma companies were willing to go there because they know how to do the other trials, and we still have to get regulators to approve how to look at virtual hybrid trials. But with COVID, all that has changed. I mean there's still about 20% to 30% of clinical sites that are not open. And if you start a trial now, you want to make sure if there's another event that, for example, if in November, there's a new variant and you need another vaccine. There could be another impact from COVID later this year. You don't want your trials to be interrupted. You want to have the possibility to do virtual and hybrid trials. So I think it's going to serve, number one, as a backup to, ensure that trials can continue. Number two, I believe that, particularly in specialty areas, you're going to see more and more use of the hybrid trials. Because what we're seeing is they can work and they can work well, and they can actually allow you to potentially enroll more patients faster. And therefore, I think it's here to stay now that we've seen it work."

Erin, that's an important question. It's a very important scientific question. We are very specific to say, COVID testing and not break apart PCR and serology because it could go in multiple different directions. I think if you end up having to have a vaccine every year, serology might not be that important. If you need a vaccine every several years, then I believe serology will be very important. And the real question is going to be, what level, what's the quantitative analysis that you need for a certain level of antibodies to feel like you're protected. If there is a quantitative number, that people can feel comfortable they can fly, they can go to events, that they can do many other things, then it will be very important. And what we're doing is we're preparing for that just in case. So we already have the ability to do a semi quantitative antibody test, which I think would help if you have to get to a certain level, know what that level is. And we're going to be prepared to scale that. We already have -- we can run thousands, but I want to be prepared in case we need hundreds of thousands in the future. It's just too early to know from the science, and we're learning so much about the variance and so forth, that there'll be more to come as we go through this year."

They are accretive in the first year, typically, you return your cost of capital in about 2 years, and we know how to integrate those. We are seeing more opportunities for those. We're spending a lot more time and discussions with various hospitals and local laboratories. And I can tell you, even as a senior management team, we're spending a lot more time in those discussions ourselves. So I feel good that there will be multiple opportunities as we go through this year. The second thing I look for is strategic acquisitions. So if there's something in one of the pillars of our strategy, for example, oncology, that we need to acquire in order to be successful, we would look to do something like that. And those would be kind of smaller tuck-in type of acquisitions versus large-scale mega deals. And then the third thing we look at is the share buybacks. If you ask me about large-scale acquisitions, so for example, another large CRO, I don't think we need to do that. I think we have what we need to be successful. So we're mostly interested in laboratory hospital laboratories, local retail laboratories and strategic positions -- acquisitions helping us in the pillars."

As we look back to 2019 kind of pre pandemic levels, to your point, your growth rates, we actually look at it even on a compound growth rate, let's say, is that kind of fitting in within our historical growth rates. And the guidance range that we have kind of implies, obviously, we're getting a range. But for both businesses, clearly at the upper end of the range that we're back to kind of the normal historical growth. And so as we think about the pieces, so first, within diagnostics, while we've already seen a favorable revenue trend in the fourth quarter compared to '19. So revenue is already there. But our volume wasn't. We were down, call it, around 8% in the fourth quarter. So the range that we have as we look to 2019 is that, for the most part, call it, the mid part of the guidance that the volume now will get back to 2019 levels, call it, in the midyear to second half of the year. And again, the price will come down to more historical levels as well. But similarly, within the drug development side of the business, we've already had good growth compared to a year ago, and we expect that to continue relative to 2019 levels, where, again, the range, if you looked at it as a CAGR similarly, within the range, gets us back to our historical growth rates, again, depending where you are in the range. So with the recognition that there's still going to be some softness in the base business that's expected in the first half of '21 because of the pandemic still here the vaccine not broadly available. But clearly, with the second half of the year expectations, we're now growing relative to '19 at a more historical level."

To your point, within that, obviously, there is some M&A and currency that impacts the numbers. But as we think about, again, the volume for diagnostics, depending where you are in the range, at some point, we're going to cross over to being favorable volume. And so again, at the midpoint of the range, just assume that's relatively midpoint of the year. After that point, we're then looking at getting back to more historical growth rates. But even there, the trajectory of the recovery be stronger, it could be a little softer. But overall, we do expect to see, depending on where you are from the range to -- for the full year, we could be still below on volume for the full year, but favorable on price/mix. Or at the upper end of the range, we can be both favorable on volume as well as favorable on price for the full year.

So many hospitals had to update their labs to be able to do COVID testing at any scale. And as they start to look at keeping those labs updated outside of COVID, they realize they probably need to do some additional upgrading to the equipment. So they'd rather use that capital for, for example, for a new surgeries versus us having to just update the lab to run the test that they've done in the past. The second thing is that even though COVID has been significant, many of the hospitals haven't had their base business back to the level that we've seen, and they don't have the COVID testing ability that we have. So the COVID testing has not necessarily offset the other base business issues that they face. So I feel pretty good about deals this year, and I don't think it will slow down.

So the good news is that there are many additional alternatives that are coming to market. And I think that most countries right now have learned how to use the testing they have. In some countries don't use nearly as much testing as the U.S. So for example, in Japan, they do significantly less testing even though they have the capacity that they could do more if they chose to.

For back to work, back-to-school, we've been a big part of that. But many companies have not gone back to work yet, and you see more and more companies saying that they might not go back to work in the ways that they've done it in the past. Some of the companies that we're working with were actually using point-of-care testing to help them get up and running. Some were using our pixel by LabCorp at home tests where they can send them to employees, particularly if they have large sales forces across the country. It's a very easy way for them to do it. So our LabCorp employee services is very busy with back to work and back-to-school. And it really is just a matter of how many of those tests do you do while you're also vaccinating people. And then at the end of the day, frankly, it's going to come down to in the fall, where there'll be another strain, and will there be another outbreak will be a big flu season, and everybody has flu, you're going to want a test for both Covet and for flu. So I do believe that there's opportunity in the second half of the year potentially, it's just too hard to know right now, and that's why we gave you such a wide range of possibilities."

In terms of the trials, we're -- again, we're doing mostly non-COVID trials, clinical trials, but we're also doing some covering trials. I think the best way for you to kind of engage it is to know that the trials were 12% of our net orders over the last 3 quarters. That should give you the best sense of what that's going to look like over time. I don't think it's going to slow down a lot this year. I think there's going to be more work that you're going to need for variance for vaccines, for example. There's still a lot of antivirals that are being studied. So I do think for this year, you're going to still see significant work for Covet. And then we'll have to see where it ends up as we go to next year."

I believe that because people are not going to their doctor as often as they have, where they may have missed their wellness programs that when the doctors are seeing the patients who are just trying to get as many tests on as they can to make sure they can treat that patient appropriately. I do not personally believe it's going to be a long-term, sustainable number of tests per acquisition. I think we'll get back to closer to where it was. But we're also trying to understand the difference between telemedicine and doctor visits. And if there's a difference there, we don't think there is, but we're still trying to understand that. So our base case assumes that as the business comes back and starts to grow again, that it's not based upon increasing numbers of tests per acquisition. It's based upon more people going to their physicians."

Do you think that there's anything that's going to impact physician behavior because they're not getting reimbursed for drawing the specimen when it's a telehealth visit? Ricky, I think that, first of all, telemedicine has been very important as we've gone through the Finami. I think that there have been some restrictions that have lifted that will probably stay lifted in terms of being able to do things over state lines and so forth. And I think it's going to be important to understand it more as we move forward. The good news for LabCorp is that we're involved with almost every major telemedicine company. So if they can easily access the ability to get testing done for patients. And we have so many service centers across the country, including the ones through Walgreens. That I believe that we're easily accessible to patients, whether it's in their physicians' offices or through telemedicine. But I do believe it's here to stay.

And the real question, it's going to be how well are those therapeutics. And our hope is that we get great therapeutics and that we can keep everybody out of the hospital and from dine.

Before I cover 2020 results, I want to first thank Clarissa for her leadership in Investor Relations for the last several years. Clarissa has been promoted to lead our revenue cycle management team, which is a very important role. 
I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Chas Cook, who has been appointed to Vice President of Investor Relations, and will continue to strengthen the foundation built upon by the IR team. Chad has been a strong leader in our finance organization since he joined LabCorp in 2018. 
Moving now to 2020 results. 2020 will be remembered for many things, including the fight against COVID and the tragic loss that it brought. It also emphasizes the critical importance of frontline health care workers and scientists, amongst others. 
Looking back on this past year, I cannot be more impressed or thankful to my colleagues across LabCorp. Together, our team developed 6 FDA EUA COVID tests, performed approximately 35 million COVID test in 2020 and help to bring multiple treatments and vaccines to market in record time. Our ability to adapt quickly to changing environment. Our resilience and our strength of our more than 50-year history have been foundational in the fight against COVID and 2020 was transformational for LabCorp. 
Let me begin with a brief update on our financial results, which Glenn will cover in more detail shortly. We reported full year 2020 revenue of $14 billion, adjusted EPS of $23.94 and free cash flow of $1.8 billion. Our base businesses in both segments continued to improve as we close the year. 
In Diagnostics, our base business performed well. However, volume remains below prior year. We also reported continued improvement in our drug development business, with strength across all 3 business lines, leading to a revenue increase in the total and the base business in the fourth quarter. Our Drug Development business ended the year with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.43, driven by strong demand across therapeutic areas. 
Our performance was strong in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. Our teams are agile. They move fast and it clearly demonstrated the strength of our science, technology and innovation. We quickly brought innovations to market while simultaneously advancing each pillar of our company's strategy. Here are just some of the highlights from the year. 
I'll start with we were the first commercial lab to bring an FDA EUA COVID test to market. We became the first to offer an at home PCR collection kit with or without a prescription through Pixel by LabCorp. And we were early to market with neutralizing antibody tests that are important in the development of COVID vaccines. 
In addition, early in a pandemic, our scientist partnered with PacBio to genetically sequence COVID samples so that we can detect changes to the virus and use that information to develop future therapies. Recently, we announced our efforts to Sequence COVID samples for the CDC as the agency continues its important work in the fight against covet. We are seeing the importance of these efforts and believe sequencing will be critical going forward. 
Also, in our Diagnostics business, we brought innovative platforms and test to market that it can prove the diagnosis of important health conditions such as lung cancer and liver disease. Looking at oncology, it continues to be a strategic focus for us. In 2020, we expanded our leadership position in oncology through the launch of a new noninvasive liquid biopsy test using next-generation sequencing for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
We were also selected by a major pharmaceutical company as their partner for late-stage oncology trials. We collaborated with Tempus to accelerate clinical trial patient participation. And as you read in our recent announcement, we have formed an oncology team made up of strong and talented leaders in the field. Additionally, we are continuing to integrate digital, data analytics and artificial intelligence in everything we do. 
Our Drug Development business is changing how clinical trials are managed using digital technology. We completed acquisitions of global Care and Snap IoT and are working with clients to use mobile and digital technology to accelerate trials and to make virtual and hybrid clinical trials a reality. 
Also, within our own lab operations, our engineers and scientists developed proprietary robotics capabilities that increased our COVID testing capacity. As we look at several innovative partnerships to support our clients, patients and scientists, our partnership with PacBio, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Microsoft and Ciox Health enable scientists and researchers to better understand COVID. 
Our collaborations with Infirmary Health, Rush University System for health, Walgreens and others, expanded our services to patients and providers across the United States. We also extended an agreement with BML to further the development of Companion Diagnostics in Japan. 
And lastly, we remain committed to customer satisfaction and remain focused on increasing access to testing, improving time to results and improving delivery to provide our customers with the best-in-class testing and support for important clinical trials. As noted, science, technology and innovation are behind these successes and are foundational to our future. Our updated brand represents the power of our combined businesses and highlights our commitment to science and innovation to improve the health and lives of people around the world. 
I'll close with a few comments about 2021. As you can appreciate, there's still uncertainty heading into 2021, but we believe we have enough visibility to reinstate full year guidance targets, albeit with a wider range than we've historically provided. The fight against COVID is not over, and neither is our commitment to defeating it. We believe the lessons earned in this past year have enhanced the progression of our long-term strategic goals. 
We will continue to seek and invest in high-growth opportunities and positively impact people's health around the world, in areas such as cancer, NASH, Alzheimer's disease and autoimmune diseases, just to name a few. There remain many significant unmet needs in health care, and LabCorp will continue to play an important role in helping to solve them. 
I am confident in both our short-term and our long-term prospects and in our strategy. It will continue to provide a strong platform for growth as we move forward. Before I turn it over to Glenn, I want to thank all of our employees around the world. We were honored to be recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most admired companies for the efforts of our over 75,000 global employees that have worked tirelessly every day to help people live better and move longer. 
Glenn, I'll turn it to you."
30643,700595964,2205624,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Labcorp Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Adam.

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2021 guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, an increase of 52% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 50.1%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 46.4% and organic base business growth of 3.7%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 0.6%. 
Operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion or 28.8% of revenue compared to $336 million or 11.4% last year. During the quarter, we had $46 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily due to COVID-related costs and acquisition integration charges. We also had $91 million of amortization, which was higher than recent quarters. 
As part of our new branding initiative, we are transitioning out of the Covance trading. As a result, we are accelerating the amortization of its trade name over the next year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 31.8% of revenue compared to $422 million or 14.3% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic base business growth, acquisitions and launchpad savings, partially offset by PAMA, higher personnel costs and investments to support the company's new branding initiative. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 24.5% compared to 22.4% last year. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.8% compared to 22.9% last year. The higher adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. For modeling purposes, we expect the company's adjusted tax rate for 2021 to be comparable to 2020 at approximately 25%. This does not include any potential increase in the federal tax rate in 2021. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $938 million or $9.54 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items were $10.56 in the quarter, up from $2.86 last year. Operating cash flow was $775 million in the quarter, compared to $570 million a year ago. 
The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by higher working capital to support growth. The higher working capital was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivables and supplies related to COVID testing. 
Capital expenditures totaled $99 million or 2.2% of revenue and included investments to increase COVID testing capacity. This compares to $128 million or 4.3% of revenue in the same period last year. As a result, free cash flow was $675 million in the quarter compared to $442 million last year. This brings our full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion, up from $1 billion in 2019. 
During the quarter, we invested $59 million of acquisitions at year-end, the company had $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. 
As previously communicated, the company will repurchase shares in 2021 as part of its capital allocation strategy. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 79.5% compared to last year, primarily due to organic growth of 78.5%. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 78% and base business growth of 0.5%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 1%. 
Total volume increased 33.9% over last year, primarily due to organic volume growth of 33.3%. The increase in organic volume was due to the contribution from COVID testing volumes of 41%, partially offset by a decline in base business volumes of 7.7%. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 2% to our organic base business volume growth. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved both its highest coved testing results, as well as the highest year-over-year volume performance in the base business since the pandemic began in March of 2020. Price/mix increased 45.5% over last year, primarily driven by Cova testing of 37% and favorable mix in the organic base business of 8.2%. 
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or 39.1% of revenue compared to $277 million or 15.8% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing and Launchpad savings, partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA and higher personnel costs. Diagnostics 3-year launchpad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021. 
Now I'll review the performance of drug development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 16.4% compared to last year, primarily due to organic growth of 13.1%. The increase in organic revenue was due to base business growth of 8.4% and a 4.7% contribution from COVID testing performed through its central lab business. Drug Development delivered broad-based revenue growth, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $248 million or 17.8% of revenue compared to $183 million or 15.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margins were primarily due to COVID testing, organic based business demand and launchpad savings partially offset by higher personnel costs. 
The company achieved its goal to deliver approximately $150 million of net savings from its 3-year drug development LaunchPad initiative. LaunchPad will continue to be the company's primary business process improvement initiative going forward. 
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7 billion and $1.43, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2021 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, for the entire year. In addition, enterprise guidance includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions and share repurchases. 
We expect a change in revenue for the enterprise of minus 1% to plus 4.5% compared to 2020 revenue of $14 billion and includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will grow 11% to 13.5% over 2020 revenue of $11.2 billion. While COVID testing revenue will decline 35% to 50%. We expect a decline in revenue for diagnostics of minus 0.5% to minus 7.5% compared to 2020 revenue of $9.3 billion. This guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will grow 11% to 14% over 2020 revenue of $6.5 billion, while come testing revenue will decline 35% to 50%. We expect drug development revenue to grow 8% to 10.5% over 2020 revenue of $4.9 billion and includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 220 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will grow 9.5% to 12% over 2020 revenue of $4.8 billion despite the continuing negative impact from the pandemic. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $19 to $23 compared to 2020 adjusted EPS of $23.94. The adjusted EPS guidance reflects the expected decline in COVID testing in 2021. 
And free cash flow is expected to be $1.70 to $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion last year. In 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 4% of revenue, driven by investments to support base business growth and productivity. In summary, the company achieved strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have remained focused on ramping up COVID testing capacity while also managing our base business, including continuing to execute on our LaunchPad initiatives. 
As we look to 2021, we expect to drive profitable growth in our base business, while cove testing is expected to decline throughout the year. We also expect another strong year of free cash flow generation that we will use for acquisitions to supplement our organic growth while returning excess cash flow to shareholders through our share repurchase program. 
This concludes our formal remarks. And operator, we will now take questions."

The reason we had to give such a wide range, minus 35% to minus 50% for the testing is because, as you say, it's very difficult to have precision. And you could get to the minus 35% to minus 50% in several different ways. Right now, we've seen a decline in tests. If you look at the last several weeks versus the end of 2020. If that decline continued, and then you saw it continue throughout the whole year, you could get there. If the amount of testing we're doing today, on average, was maintained for the 6 months of this year -- in the first 6 months, well, then you could do 0 for the second half of the year and still be there. So there are multiple different ways to get there. My assumption going in is that the price is going to remain at where it is right now. So right now, it's $100. We're still in the emergency situation. That's been extended through the year. You have to hit the CMS guidelines, which is basically for the previous month, you have to have more than 50% at a 2-day turnaround. And then they look at each sample for the current month. We're well within that range. I mean right now, we did 275,000 tests a day. We're not doing anywhere near that in our turnaround times about a day. So I expect that the price you should assume is still about what we've averaged until now. I think for this quarter, it was about $90 on average. It then comes down to the volume. And I assume that the volume is going to continue to decline, albeit maybe at a lower rate than we saw from the end of last year into this year. And then for the second half of the year, they'll be significantly less than the first half of this year. That's our base case assumption."

So it's the first time we've seen the positive to your point, it's a combination that we still saw lower volumes down 7.7%, but still that's an improvement as we trended through the earlier parts of the year. And it was more than offset by favorable price/mix and we continue to see an unusually high level of favorable mix, primarily driven by higher test prerecession. So the feeling is with the fewer visits that patients are going, they're conducting more tests per visit that they're going through. So again, as we think going forward and reflected in the guidance is we'll continue to see over time, the pickup in our base volumes. But with that, you'll see the core level core lever, if you will. You'll start to see that favorable mix start to come back down to more historical levels."

So you can see that it's meaningful, but a lot of our growth is coming from outside of Cova trials. And we mentioned in the last quarter that we won a large pharmas oncology book of business. I think that's helpful to us, but also we've won another pharma's non-oncology business. So we continue to show strength outside of COVID, which is very important as we move forward to the base business.

So I'll start by saying that I continue to believe that having diagnostic and drug development together, is a winning scenario. And that you can do significantly better with drug development business by having diagnostic capabilities. There's no doubt in my mind that we've seen that with COVID. I mean, being able to do the diagnostic test of what we're doing drug development, enable us to win more than 400 opportunities across COVID at the same time, I believe that people now have seen it in pharma and biotech. So it opens up the doors for other areas. We won large Pharmas oncology business. I think oncology is the next area that we'll be able to show the benefit of having diagnostic capabilities, particularly Companion Diagnostic capabilities along with drug development. And we are beginning to see in the biotech and pharma clients that this is mattering more and more. So I continue to be very bullish about the ability to have both these businesses together. I've always said that I think that the drug development business benefits more by having diagnostic capabilities than diagnostics does by having drug development. But with that said, we've seen some synergies going the other way, where the drug development group has been working on companion diagnostics, and we're able to potentially launch that in the diagnostic area. So I'm actually seeing benefit to diagnostics over time from drug development. So we continue to make progress there. If you look at virtual and hybrid trials, the reason we've invested there is because I believe it's going to be more important than it's been in the past. And it's been talked about for quite some time. I don't think a lot of pharma companies were willing to go there because they know how to do the other trials, and we still have to get regulators to approve how to look at virtual hybrid trials. But with COVID, all that has changed. I mean there's still about 20% to 30% of clinical sites that are not open. And if you start a trial now, you want to make sure if there's another event that, for example, if in November, there's a new variant and you need another vaccine. There could be another impact from COVID later this year. You don't want your trials to be interrupted. You want to have the possibility to do virtual and hybrid trials. So I think it's going to serve, number one, as a backup to, ensure that trials can continue. Number two, I believe that, particularly in specialty areas, you're going to see more and more use of the hybrid trials. Because what we're seeing is they can work and they can work well, and they can actually allow you to potentially enroll more patients faster. And therefore, I think it's here to stay now that we've seen it work."

Erin, that's an important question. It's a very important scientific question. We are very specific to say, COVID testing and not break apart PCR and serology because it could go in multiple different directions. I think if you end up having to have a vaccine every year, serology might not be that important. If you need a vaccine every several years, then I believe serology will be very important. And the real question is going to be, what level, what's the quantitative analysis that you need for a certain level of antibodies to feel like you're protected. If there is a quantitative number, that people can feel comfortable they can fly, they can go to events, that they can do many other things, then it will be very important. And what we're doing is we're preparing for that just in case. So we already have the ability to do a semi quantitative antibody test, which I think would help if you have to get to a certain level, know what that level is. And we're going to be prepared to scale that. We already have -- we can run thousands, but I want to be prepared in case we need hundreds of thousands in the future. It's just too early to know from the science, and we're learning so much about the variance and so forth, that there'll be more to come as we go through this year."

So as I look at capital deployment, the first thing we look forward to see if there are hospital laboratories, local or regional laboratories that we can acquire. And those make a lot of sense. They are accretive in the first year, typically, you return your cost of capital in about 2 years, and we know how to integrate those. We are seeing more opportunities for those. We're spending a lot more time and discussions with various hospitals and local laboratories. And I can tell you, even as a senior management team, we're spending a lot more time in those discussions ourselves. So I feel good that there will be multiple opportunities as we go through this year. The second thing I look for is strategic acquisitions. So if there's something in one of the pillars of our strategy, for example, oncology, that we need to acquire in order to be successful, we would look to do something like that. And those would be kind of smaller tuck-in type of acquisitions versus large-scale mega deals. And then the third thing we look at is the share buybacks. If you ask me about large-scale acquisitions, so for example, another large CRO, I don't think we need to do that. I think we have what we need to be successful. So we're mostly interested in laboratory hospital laboratories, local retail laboratories and strategic positions -- acquisitions helping us in the pillars."

As we look back to 2019 kind of pre pandemic levels, to your point, your growth rates, we actually look at it even on a compound growth rate, let's say, is that kind of fitting in within our historical growth rates. And the guidance range that we have kind of implies, obviously, we're getting a range. But for both businesses, clearly at the upper end of the range that we're back to kind of the normal historical growth. And so as we think about the pieces, so first, within diagnostics, while we've already seen a favorable revenue trend in the fourth quarter compared to '19. So revenue is already there. But our volume wasn't. We were down, call it, around 8% in the fourth quarter. So the range that we have as we look to 2019 is that, for the most part, call it, the mid part of the guidance that the volume now will get back to 2019 levels, call it, in the midyear to second half of the year. And again, the price will come down to more historical levels as well. But similarly, within the drug development side of the business, we've already had good growth compared to a year ago, and we expect that to continue relative to 2019 levels, where, again, the range, if you looked at it as a CAGR similarly, within the range, gets us back to our historical growth rates, again, depending where you are in the range. So with the recognition that there's still going to be some softness in the base business that's expected in the first half of '21 because of the pandemic still here the vaccine not broadly available. But clearly, with the second half of the year expectations, we're now growing relative to '19 at a more historical level."

To your point, within that, obviously, there is some M&A and currency that impacts the numbers. But as we think about, again, the volume for diagnostics, depending where you are in the range, at some point, we're going to cross over to being favorable volume. And so again, at the midpoint of the range, just assume that's relatively midpoint of the year. After that point, we're then looking at getting back to more historical growth rates. But even there, the trajectory of the recovery be stronger, it could be a little softer. But overall, we do expect to see, depending on where you are from the range to -- for the full year, we could be still below on volume for the full year, but favorable on price/mix. Or at the upper end of the range, we can be both favorable on volume as well as favorable on price for the full year.

In fact, I think there might be some acceleration based upon the number of discussions that we're having.

So many hospitals had to update their labs to be able to do COVID testing at any scale. And as they start to look at keeping those labs updated outside of COVID, they realize they probably need to do some additional upgrading to the equipment. So they'd rather use that capital for, for example, for a new surgeries versus us having to just update the lab to run the test that they've done in the past. The second thing is that even though COVID has been significant, many of the hospitals haven't had their base business back to the level that we've seen, and they don't have the COVID testing ability that we have. So the COVID testing has not necessarily offset the other base business issues that they face. So I feel pretty good about deals this year, and I don't think it will slow down.

So the good news is that there are many additional alternatives that are coming to market. And I think that most countries right now have learned how to use the testing they have. In some countries don't use nearly as much testing as the U.S. So for example, in Japan, they do significantly less testing even though they have the capacity that they could do more if they chose to.

In terms of the trials, we're -- again, we're doing mostly non-COVID trials, clinical trials, but we're also doing some covering trials. I think the best way for you to kind of engage it is to know that the trials were 12% of our net orders over the last 3 quarters. That should give you the best sense of what that's going to look like over time. I don't think it's going to slow down a lot this year. I think there's going to be more work that you're going to need for variance for vaccines, for example. There's still a lot of antivirals that are being studied. So I do think for this year, you're going to still see significant work for Covet. And then we'll have to see where it ends up as we go to next year."

We have that discussion often amongst ourselves. I believe that because people are not going to their doctor as often as they have, where they may have missed their wellness programs that when the doctors are seeing the patients who are just trying to get as many tests on as they can to make sure they can treat that patient appropriately. I do not personally believe it's going to be a long-term, sustainable number of tests per acquisition. I think we'll get back to closer to where it was. But we're also trying to understand the difference between telemedicine and doctor visits. And if there's a difference there, we don't think there is, but we're still trying to understand that. So our base case assumes that as the business comes back and starts to grow again, that it's not based upon increasing numbers of tests per acquisition. It's based upon more people going to their physicians."

Do you think that there's anything that's going to impact physician behavior because they're not getting reimbursed for drawing the specimen when it's a telehealth visit? Ricky, I think that, first of all, telemedicine has been very important as we've gone through the Finami. I think that there have been some restrictions that have lifted that will probably stay lifted in terms of being able to do things over state lines and so forth. And I think it's going to be important to understand it more as we move forward. The good news for LabCorp is that we're involved with almost every major telemedicine company. So if they can easily access the ability to get testing done for patients. And we have so many service centers across the country, including the ones through Walgreens. That I believe that we're easily accessible to patients, whether it's in their physicians' offices or through telemedicine. But I do believe it's here to stay. And a that we're part of it, and we're able to make it an easy transition through their EMRS. And then just 1 last 1 on the utilization.

But again, as we talked about earlier, when we look at the range of guidance we gave for the business, depending upon where we are in the range of guidance that we do expect to see, call it, midyear into the second half of the year as the midpoint of the guidance that you should see the organic volumes be picking up relative to '19 levels."

And the real question, it's going to be how well are those therapeutics. And our hope is that we get great therapeutics and that we can keep everybody out of the hospital and from dine.

Moving now to 2020 results. 2020 will be remembered for many things, including the fight against COVID and the tragic loss that it brought. It also emphasizes the critical importance of frontline health care workers and scientists, amongst others.
Looking back on this past year, I cannot be more impressed or thankful to my colleagues across Labcorp. Together, our team developed 6 FDA EUA COVID tests, performed approximately 35 million COVID tests in 2020 and helped to bring multiple treatments and vaccines to market in record time. Our ability to adapt quickly to changing environment, our resilience and our strength of our more than 50-year history have been foundational in the fight against COVID and 2020 was transformational for Labcorp.
Let me begin with a brief update on our financial results, which Glenn will cover in more detail shortly. We reported full year 2020 revenue of $14 billion, adjusted EPS of $23.94 and free cash flow of $1.8 billion.
Our base businesses in both segments continued to improve as we closed the year. In Diagnostics, our base business performed well. However, volume remains below prior year. We also reported continued improvement in our Drug Development business, with strength across all 3 business lines, leading to a revenue increase in the total and the base business in the fourth quarter. Our Drug Development business ended the year with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.43 driven by strong demand across therapeutic areas.
Our performance was strong in the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. Our teams are agile. They move fast and it clearly demonstrated the strength of our science, technology and innovation. We quickly brought innovations to market while simultaneously advancing each pillar of our company's strategy. Here are just some of the highlights from the year.
I'll start with we were the first commercial lab to bring an FDA EUA COVID test to market. We became the first to offer an at-home PCR collection kit with or without a prescription through Pixel by Labcorp. And we were early to market with neutralizing antibody tests that are important in the development of COVID vaccines.
In addition, early in the pandemic, our scientists partnered with PacBio to genetically sequence COVID samples so that we can detect changes to the virus and use that information to develop future therapies. Recently, we announced our efforts to sequence COVID samples for the CDC as the agency continues its important work in the fight against COVID. We are seeing the importance of these efforts and believe sequencing will be critical going forward.
Also, in our Diagnostics business, we brought innovative platforms and tests to market that can improve the diagnosis of important health conditions such as lung cancer and liver disease. Looking at oncology, it continues to be a strategic focus for us. In 2020, we expanded our leadership position in oncology through the launch of a new noninvasive liquid biopsy test using next-generation sequencing for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
We were also selected by a major pharmaceutical company as their partner for late-stage oncology trials. We collaborated with Tempus to accelerate clinical trial patient participation and as you read in our recent announcement, we have formed an oncology team made up of strong and talented leaders in the field. Additionally, we are continuing to integrate digital, data analytics and artificial intelligence in everything we do.
Our Drug Development business is changing how clinical trials are managed using digital technology. We completed acquisitions of GlobalCare and SnapIOT and are working with clients to use mobile and digital technology to accelerate trials and to make virtual and hybrid clinical trials a reality. Also, within our own lab operations, our engineers and scientists developed proprietary robotics capabilities that increased our COVID testing capacity.
As we look at several innovative partnerships to support our clients, patients and scientists, our partnerships with PacBio, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Microsoft and Ciox Health enabled scientists and researchers to better understand COVID. Our collaborations with Infirmary Health, Rush University System for Health, Walgreens and others expanded our services to patients and providers across the United States. We also extended an agreement with BML to further the development of companion diagnostics in Japan. And lastly, we remain committed to customer satisfaction and remain focused on increasing access to testing, improving time to results and improving delivery to provide our customers with the best-in-class testing and support for important clinical trials.
As noted, science, technology and innovation are behind these successes and are foundational to our future. Our updated brand represents the power of our combined businesses and highlights our commitment to science and innovation to improve the health and lives of people around the world.
I'll close with a few comments about 2021. As you can appreciate, there's still uncertainty heading into 2021, but we believe we have enough visibility to reinstate full year guidance targets, albeit with a wider range than we've historically provided. The fight against COVID is not over, and neither is our commitment to defeating it. We believe the lessons learned in this past year have enhanced the progression of our long-term strategic goals.
We will continue to seek and invest in high-growth opportunities and positively impact people's health around the world in areas such as cancer, NASH, Alzheimer's disease and autoimmune diseases, just to name a few. There remain many significant unmet needs in health care, and Labcorp will continue to play an important role in helping to solve them. I am confident in both our short-term and our long-term prospects and in our strategy. It will continue to provide a strong platform for growth as we move forward.
Before I turn it over to Glenn, I want to thank all of our employees around the world. We were honored to be recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most admired companies for the efforts of our over 75,000 global employees that are working tirelessly every day to help people live better and live longer.
Glenn, I'll turn it to you."
30643,700595964,2206039,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Labcorp Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2021 guidance.Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, an increase of 52% ove",1371,"Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2021 guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, an increase of 52% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 50.1%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 46.4% and organic Base Business growth of 3.7%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 0.6%.
Operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion or 28.8% of revenue compared to $336 million or 11.4% last year. During the quarter, we had $46 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily due to COVID-related costs and acquisition integration charges. We also had $91 million of amortization, which was higher than recent quarters. As part of our new branding initiative, we are transitioning out of the Covance trade name. As a result, we are accelerating the amortization of its trade name over the next year.
Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or 31.8% of revenue compared to $422 million or 14.3% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic Base Business growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by PAMA, higher personnel costs and investments to support the company's new branding initiative.
The tax rate for the quarter was 24.5% compared to 22.4% last year. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.8% compared to 22.9% last year. The higher adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. For modeling purposes, we expect the company's adjusted tax rate for 2021 to be comparable to 2020 at approximately 25%. This does not include any potential increase in the federal tax rate in 2021.
Net earnings for the quarter were $938 million or $9.54 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $10.56 in the quarter, up from $2.86 last year.
Operating cash flow was $775 million in the quarter compared to $570 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by higher working capital to support growth. The higher working capital was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivables and supplies related to COVID testing.
Capital expenditures totaled $99 million or 2.2% of revenue and included investments to increase COVID testing capacity. This compares to $128 million or 4.3% of revenue in the same period last year. As a result, free cash flow was $675 million in the quarter compared to $442 million last year. This brings our full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion, up from $1 billion in 2019.
During the quarter, we invested $59 million in acquisitions. At year-end, the company had $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. As previously communicated, the company will repurchase shares in 2021 as part of its capital allocation strategy.
Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 79.5% compared to last year, primarily due to organic growth of 78.5%. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 78% and Base Business growth of 0.5%, which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 1%.
Total volume increased 33.9% over last year primarily due to organic volume growth of 33.3%. The increase in organic volume was due to the contribution from COVID testing volumes of 41%, partially offset by a decline in Base Business volumes of 7.7%. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 2% to our organic Base Business volume growth. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved both its highest COVID testing results as well as the highest year-over-year volume performance in the Base Business since the pandemic began in March of 2020. Price/mix increased 45.5% over last year primarily driven by COVID testing of 37% and favorable mix in the organic Base Business of 8.2%.
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or 39.1% of revenue compared to $277 million or 15.8% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA and higher personnel costs. Diagnostics' 3-year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021.
Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 16.4% compared to last year, primarily due to organic growth of 13.1%. The increase in organic revenue was due to Base Business growth of 8.4% and a 4.7% contribution from COVID testing performed through its central lab business. Drug Development delivered broad-based revenue growth, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies.
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $248 million or 17.8% of revenue compared to $183 million or 15.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margins were primarily due to COVID testing, organic Base Business demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs.
The company achieved its goal to deliver approximately $150 million of net savings from its 3-year Drug Development LaunchPad initiative. LaunchPad will continue to be the company's primary business process improvement initiative going forward.
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7 billion and 1.43, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.
Now I'll discuss our 2021 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, for the entire year. In addition, enterprise guidance includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions and share repurchases.
We expect a change in revenue for the enterprise of minus 1% to plus 4.5% compared to 2020 revenue of $14 billion and includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 11% to 13.5% over 2020 revenue of $11.2 billion, while COVID testing revenue will decline 35% to 50%. 
We expect a decline in revenue for Diagnostics of minus 0.5% to minus 7.5% compared to 2020 revenue of $9.3 billion. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 11% to 14% over 2020 revenue of $6.5 billion, while COVID testing revenue will decline 35% to 50%. We expect Drug Development revenue to grow 8% to 10.5% over 2020 revenue of $4.9 billion and includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 220 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 9.5% to 12% over 2020 revenue of $4.8 billion despite the continuing negative impact from the pandemic.
Our adjusted EPS guidance is $19 to $23 compared to 2020 adjusted EPS of $23.94. The adjusted EPS guidance reflects the expected decline in COVID testing in 2021. Free cash flow is expected to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion last year. In 2021, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 4% of revenue driven by investments to support Base Business growth and productivity.
In summary, the company achieved strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have remained focused on ramping up COVID testing capacity while also managing our Base Business, including continuing to execute on our LaunchPad initiatives.
As we look forward to 2021, we expect to drive profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing is expected to decline throughout the year. We also expect another strong year of free cash flow generation that we will use for acquisitions to supplement our organic growth while returning excess cash flow to shareholders through our share repurchase program.
This concludes our formal remarks. And operator, we will now take questions."

The reason we had to give such a wide range, minus 35% to minus 50% for the testing is because, as you say, it's very difficult to have precision. And you could get to the minus 35% to minus 50% in several different ways. Right no",326,"Thanks for the question. The reason we had to give such a wide range, minus 35% to minus 50% for the testing is because, as you say, it's very difficult to have precision. And you could get to the minus 35% to minus 50% in several different ways. Right now, we've seen a decline in tests, if you look at the last several weeks versus the end of 2020. If that decline continued and then you saw it continue throughout the whole year, you could get there. If the amount of testing we're doing today, on average, was maintained for the 6 months of this year -- the first 6 months, well, then you could do 0 for the second half of the year and still be there. So there are multiple different ways to get there.
My assumption going in is that the price is going to remain at where it is right now. So right now, it's $100. We're still in the emergency situation. That's been extended through the year. You have to hit the CMS guidelines, which is basically for the previous month, you have to have more than 50% at a 2-day turnaround. And then they look at each sample for the current month. We're well within that range. I mean right now, we did 275,000 tests a day. We're not doing anywhere near that, and our turnaround time's about a day. So I expect that the price you should assume is still about what we've averaged until now. I think for this quarter, it was about $90 on average.
It then comes down to the volume. And I assume that the volume is going to continue to decline, albeit maybe at a lower rate than we saw from the end of last year into this year. And then for the second half of the year, they'll be significantly less than the first half of this year. That's our base case assumption."

But to your point, it's a combination of we still saw lower volumes at down 7.7%, but still, that's an improvement as we trended through the earlier parts of the year, and it was more than offset by favorable price/mix. And we continue to see an unusually high level of favorable mix primarily driven by higher tests per session. So the feeling is with the fewer visits that patients are going, they're conducting more tests per visit that they're going through.
So again, as we think going forward and reflected in the guidance is we'll continue to see over time the pickup in our base volumes. But with that, you'll see the core lever, if you will. You'll start to see that favorable mix start to come back down to more historical levels."

If you look at COVID right now, basically, the COVID trials accounted for about 12% of our net orders, if you look at the last 3 quarters. So you can see that it's meaningful, but a lot of our growth is coming from outside of COVID trials. And we mentioned in the last quarter that we won a large pharma's oncology book of business. I think that's helpful to us, but also we've won another pharma's nononcology business. So we continue to show strength outside of COVID, which is very important as we move forward to the Base Business. That's what gives us confidence as we look at the range we provided for the Drug Development business for this year."

So I'll start by saying that I continue to believe that having Diagnostics and Drug Development together is a winning scenario and that you can do significantly better with Drug Development business by having diagnostic capabilities. There's no doub",484,"Sure. So I'll start by saying that I continue to believe that having Diagnostics and Drug Development together is a winning scenario and that you can do significantly better with Drug Development business by having diagnostic capabilities. There's no doubt in my mind that we've seen that with COVID. I mean being able to do the diagnostic test of what we're doing in Drug Development enabled us to win more than 400 opportunities across COVID.
At the same time, I believe that people now have seen it in pharma and biotech. So it opens up the doors for other areas. We won a large pharma's oncology business. I think oncology is the next area that we'll be able to show the benefit of having diagnostic capabilities, particularly companion diagnostic capabilities, along with drug development. And we are beginning to see in the biotech and pharma clients that this is mattering more and more. So I continue to be very bullish about the ability to have both these businesses together.
I've always said that I think that the Drug Development business benefits more by having diagnostic capabilities than Diagnostics does by having drug development. But with that said, we've seen some synergies going the other way, where the Drug Development group has been working on companion diagnostics, and we're able to potentially launch that in the diagnostic area. So I'm actually seeing benefit to Diagnostics over time from Drug Development. So we continue to make progress there.
If you look at virtual and hybrid trials, the reason we've invested there is because I believe it's going to be more important than it's been in the past. And it's been talked about for quite some time. I don't think a lot of pharma companies were willing to go there because they knew how to do the other trials, and we still have to get regulators to approve how to look at virtual and hybrid trials. But with COVID, all that has changed. I mean there's still about 20% to 30% of clinical sites that are not open. And if you start a trial now, you want to make sure if there's another event that, for example, if in November, there's a new variant and you need another vaccine, there could be another impact from COVID later this year. You don't want your trials to be interrupted. You want to have the possibility to do virtual and hybrid trials. So I think it's going to serve, number one, as a backup to ensure that trials can continue.
Number two, I believe that, particularly in specialty areas, you're going to see more and more use of the hybrid trials. Because what we're seeing is they can work and they can work well, and they can actually allow you to potentially enroll more patients faster. And therefore, I think it's here to stay now that we've seen it work."

I think if you end up having to have a vaccine every year, serology might not be that important. If you need a vaccine every several years, then I believe serology will be very important. And the real question is going to be what level, what's the quantitative analysis that you need for a certain level of antibodies to feel like you're protected. If there is a quantitative number that people can feel comfortable they can fly, they can go to events, that they can do many other things, then it will be very important.
And what we're doing is we're preparing for that just in case. So we already have the ability to do a semiquantitative antibody test, which I think would help if you have to get to a certain level and know what that level is. And we're going to be prepared to scale that. We already have -- we can run thousands, but I want to be prepared in case we need hundreds of thousands in the future. It's just too early to know from the science, and we're learning so much about the variance and so forth, but there'll be more to come as we go through this year."

So -- but again, it's a smaller piece of the total COVID business that we have."

So as I look at capital deployment, the first thing we look for is to see if there are hospital laboratories, local or regional laboratories that we can acquire. And those make a lot of sense. They are accretive in the first year, typically, you return your cost of capital in about 2 years, and we know how to integrate those. We are seeing more opportunities for those. We're spending a lot more time in discussions with various hospitals and local laboratories. And I can tell you, even as a senior management team, we're spending a lot more time in those discussions ourselves. So I feel good that there will be multiple opportunities as we go through this year.
The second thing I look for is strategic acquisitions. So if there's something in one of the pillars of our strategy, for example, oncology, that we need to acquire in order to be successful, we would look to do something like that. And those would be kind of smaller tuck-in type of acquisitions versus large-scale megadeals.
And then the third thing we look at is the share buybacks. If you ask me about large-scale acquisitions, so for example, another large CRO, I don't think we need to do that. I think we have what we need to be successful. So we're mostly interested in laboratories, hospital laboratories, local regional laboratories and strategic oppositions -- acquisitions helping us in the pillars."

From our perspective, it's kind of an interesting viewpoint because as we go into 2021 and look at a comp to 2020, obviously, we see significant growth in both -- in our base businesses because it's coming off of the -- a pandemic here. As we look back to 2019 kind of prepandemic levels, to your point, your growth rates, we actually look at it even on a compound growth rate and say, is that kind of fitting in within our historical growth rates. And the guidance range that we have kind of implies -- obviously, we're getting a range. But for both businesses, clearly at the upper end of the range that we're back to kind of the normal historical growth.
And so as we think about the pieces, so first, within Diagnostics, while we've already seen a favorable revenue trend in the fourth quarter compared to '19, so revenue is already there, but our volume wasn't. We were down, call it, around 8% in the fourth quarter. So the range that we have, as we looked at 2019, is that for the most part, call it, the mid-part of the guidance, that the volume now will get back to 2019 levels, call it, in the midyear to second half of the year. And again, the price will come down to more historical levels as well.
But similarly, within the Drug Development side of the business, we've already had good growth compared to a year ago, and we expect that to continue relative to 2019 levels, where, again, the range, if you looked at it as a [ cager ] to '19, similarly, within the range gets us back to our historical growth rates, again, depending where you are in the range. So with the recognition that there's still going to be some softness in the Base Business that's expected in the first half of '21 because the pandemic's still here, the vaccine not broadly available, but clearly, with the second half of the year expectations, we're now growing relative to '19 at a more historical level."

It sounds like you're saying the 2021 core base volumes maybe start the year below 2019, finish the year -- the second half above 2019.

To your point, within that, obviously, there is some M&A and currency that impacts the numbers. But as we think about, again, the volume for Diagnostics, depending where you are in the range, at some point, we're going to cross over to being favorable volume. And so again, at the midpoint of the range, just assume that's relatively midpoint of the year.
After that point, we're then looking at getting back to more historical growth rates. But even there, the trajectory of the recovery could be stronger, it could be a little softer. But overall, we do expect to see, depending on where you are from the range to -- for the full year, we could be still below on volume for the full year but favorable on price/mix or at the upper end of the range, we can be both favorable on volume as well as favorable on price for the full year.

In fact, I think there might be some acceleration based upon the number of discussions that we're having. And I think there's a couple of reasons why. One is, for example, hospitals have realized how capital intensive this business is. So many hospitals had to update their labs to be able to do COVID testing at any scale. And as they start to look at keeping those labs updated outside of COVID, they realize they probably need to do some additional upgrading to the equipment. So they'd rather use that capital, for example, for a new surgery suite versus having to just update the lab to run the test that they've done in the past.
The second thing is that even though COVID has been significant, many of the hospitals haven't had their base business back to the level that we've seen, and they don't have the COVID testing ability that we have. So the COVID testing has not necessarily offset the other base business issues that they face. So I feel pretty good about deals this year, and I don't think it will slow down.

What I was worried about with other countries is turnaround time. Would it be easy to get the samples to the U.S. and turn those around fast enough? And then the ability to move equipment or have equipment in those other parts of the world, I don't think is necessarily that feasible. So the good news is that there are many additional alternatives that are coming to market. And I think that most countries right now have learned how to use the testing that they have.
And some countries don't use nearly as much testing as the U.S. So for example, in Japan, they do significantly less testing even though they have the capacity that they could do more if they chose to.

Some were using our Pixel by Labcorp at-home tests where they can send them to employees, particularly if they have large sales forces across the country. It's a very easy way for them to do it. So our Labcorp employee services is very busy with back to work and back to school. And it really is just a matter of how many of those tests do you do while you're also vaccinating people. And then at the end of the day, frankly, it's going to come down to in the fall, will there be another strain? And will there be another outbreak? Will it be a big flu season?

So I do think for this year, you're going to still see significant work for COVID. And then we'll have to see where it ends up as we go to next year."

Ricky, it's a very important question. We have that discussion often amongst ourselves. I believe that because people are not going to their doctor as often as they have or they may have missed their wellness programs, that when the doctors are seeing the patients, they're just trying to get as many tests on as they can to make sure that they can treat that patient appropriately. I do not personally believe it's going to be a long-term, sustainable number of tests per requisition. I think we'll get back to closer to where it was. But we're also trying to understand the difference between telemedicine and doctor visits. And if there's a difference there, we don't think there is, but we're still trying to understand that. So our base case assumes that as the business comes back and starts to grow again, that it's not based upon increasing numbers of tests per requisition. It's based upon more people going to their physicians."

I think that there have been some restrictions that have lifted that will probably stay lifted in terms of being able to do things over state lines and so forth. And I think it's going to be important to understand it more as we move forward.
The good news for Labcorp is that we're involved with almost every major telemedicine company. So if they can easily access the ability to get testing done for patients, and we have so many service centers across the country, including the ones through Walgreens, that I believe that we're easily accessible to patients, whether it's in their physicians' offices or through telemedicine. But I do believe it's here to stay and that we're a part of it, and we're able to make it an easy transition through their EMRs."

If at the end of the day, you're diagnosed with COVID in the future, but we know you're not going to end up in a hospital or you're going to die because we have great ways to treat it, then I think it could become point-of-care testing like flu. If it's as serious as it is today, where people aren't vaccinated, they could end up in a hospital, could end up dying, then I think it's going to end up PCR testing, particularly for people with symptoms. Because we do know that the point-of-care testing is not necessarily as accurate, and you do miss some people through that. I don't think you're going to want to miss people if they can end up in a hospital and die.
So I think it's really going to take some time for us to understand how good the therapeutics work outside of vaccinations. Because when you think about it, if 20% or 25% of the population doesn't get vaccinated and if the vaccine doesn't work in 10% of the population, that's 35% of several hundred million people in the U.S. That's a big number of people that we're still going to have to worry about getting COVID over time. And the real question is going to be how well are those therapeutics. And our hope is that we get great therapeutics and that we can keep everybody out of the hospital and from dying. But we just don't know yet. If it ends up there, it will be more point of care. I think that we're going to end up doing PCR testing for quite some time at some level."

Our focus continues to be on bringing innovations to market that help improve people's health and lives. As you'll see from our first quarter results, doing so can generate strong growth and returns for our shareholders. I'm going to begin by covering our overall performance in the first quarter, which is very strong across all of our businesses. 
Revenue increased 47% versus the same period in 2020. While a good amount of growth can be attributed to COVID testing, we also delivered 15% year-over-year growth in our base business. In Diagnostics and Drug Development, base business revenue increased 8% and 24%, respectively, from the prior year. Our drug development book-to-bill remains very strong and reached 1.47 for the trailing 12 months. Our adjusted EPS of $8.79 represents significant growth from last year. And we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up from $97 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our first quarter results and our improved outlook for the year enabled us to increase our full year guidance. 
We're also encouraged to see that patients continue to return to the pre-pandemic health care teams as well as our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers resuming their important research and development work. Our first quarter results demonstrate Labcorp's strong position in both diagnostics and drug development. We continue to play a central role in helping health care professionals assess a patient's health and deciding appropriate treatment options. We're also aiding in the development of treatments and cures that are critically important for the future. 
Now I'm going to turn to our response to COVID. As you know, Labcorp's capabilities in testing and drug development have been critical to the pandemic response. Our fight against this virus is not over, but we are thankfully seeing a reduction in cases from pandemic eyes especially in the United States. And with that, our COVID testing volume has declined. While we can't fully predict how the pandemic will evolve as the year goes on, we are confident in our ability to leverage the considerable experience and expertise that we've gained over the last year to continue to build on our leading COVID testing and treatment capabilities. 
Our scientists are developing new testing solutions. We have sufficient capacity to serve our customers, and our teams continue to support important COVID science and trials. We're also proud to be a part of getting people back to work, to school and to life. Our employer services team offers testing and vaccination services to support workplace and community safety. Our recently announced offering for small businesses can help employers, including restaurants reopen. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, we've been focused on serving all communities, including underserved populations. This quarter, we furthered let commitment in a partnership with the State of North Carolina to provide Pixel COVID home kits at no cost to underserved communities. Additionally, our Walgreens partnership expanded to include new integrated digital experiences available to all Walgreens customers and access to our Pixel Home Kit in over 6,000 locations. We're also helping patients securely access their results through their personal devices and apps like Common Health and Common Pass. Finally, we're continuing our important work for the CDC to genetically sequence approximately 5,000 virus samples every week in order to identify variance. 
Now I'll provide several updates to our strategy. In the quarter, as we delivered growth in our base business and we responded to the needs of our customers in a pandemic, We also made progress in advancing our strategy. In our essential laboratory business, which supports trials across many therapeutic areas, we continue to automate our processes using robotics and proprietary analytics. Our investments in our central labs business will enable us to increase our productivity, create resiliency in our supply chain and better meet the needs of our customers. 
We recently opened a new automated clinical trial kit production facility in Belgium. We expect that to eventually double our capacity. The facility will offer faster kit delivery, more flexible ordering and reduced transportation costs for biopharma clients and clinical trial investigator sites across Europe, Middle East and Africa. We're also advancing our position in oncology by strengthening our leadership team and investing in this important area where novel diagnostic testing and better treatments are needed around the world. 
Our science and technology continue to be critical to Labcorp's success and future growth. We made continuing strides during the first quarter and developing future tests for cancer, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune and liver disease. We also increased access to testing and trials through telemedicine, pharmacies, employers, home kits and our decentralized clinical trial capabilities. 
In fact, our continued scientific and technology advancements were recognized by Fast Company, which named us one of the world's most innovative companies for 2021. This accolade is great recognition for Labcorp's talented teams who are resilient, fast and agile. It's a testament to our company's ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing environment. 
In closing, as announced in March, the Board and leadership team are undertaking a review of the company's structure and capital allocation strategy. The goal is to ensure we are best positioned to unlock shareholder value while continuing to support the patients and the customers who rely on us around the world. This process will take time, and there will be no updates until conclusion is reached. 
Our team is focused. We're focused on delivering on our mission of improving health and improving lives, which we believe drive strong shareholder returns. I want to thank our more than 70,000 employees around the world who continue to rise to the occasion. We look forward to brighter days ahead as vaccines continue to roll out. And I remain very confident in our strength across our businesses as we move forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn."
30643,709730056,2262545,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Labcorp Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our 2021 full year guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion,",1375,"Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our 2021 full year guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 47.4% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 45%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 140 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 32.9% and organic base business growth of 12.2%. Operating income for the quarter was $1.1 billion or 25.4% of revenue. 
During the quarter, we had $32 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily due to COVID-related costs and acquisition integration charges. We also had $92 million of amortization, which was higher than last year due to the accelerated amortization of the Covance trade name related to our previously announced branding initiative. 
Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $1.2 billion or 28.4% of revenue compared to $366 million or 12.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic base business growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.5% compared to 25.3% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $770 million or $7.82 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $8.79 in the quarter, up from $2.37 last year. 
Operating cash flow was $1.2 billion in the quarter compared to $204 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $95 million or 2.3% of revenue compared to $107 million or 3.8% of revenue last year. As a result, free cash flow was $1.1 billion in the quarter compared to $97 million last year. 
During the quarter, we paid down $375 million of debt, invested $34 million in acquisitions and repurchased $69 million of stock. At quarter end, the company had $732 million remaining of its board authorized share repurchase program. 
Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, an increase of 62% compared to last year, driven by COVID testing of 54.5% and base business growth of 7.5%. The base business growth was primarily driven by organic growth of 6.3%, which includes the negative impact of weather of approximately 2%. Relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compounded annual growth rate for the base business revenue was 2.7% and was primarily due to organic growth. 
Total volume increased 27.3% over last year, primarily due to organic volume growth of 26.6%. The increase in organic volume was due to the contribution from COVID testing volumes of 27.9%, partially offset by a reduction in organic base business of 1.3%, which was negatively impacted by weather of approximately 2%. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 1.3% to organic base business volume growth. 
Price/mix increased 34.7% over last year, driven by COVID testing of 26.6% and a favorable mix in the organic base business of 7.5%, which was primarily due to higher test per accession. 
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $992 million or 36% of revenue compared to $254 million or 14.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic base business demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Diagnostics 3-year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021. 
Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 25.7% compared to last year due to organic growth of 21.9%, acquisitions of 1% and favorable foreign currency translation of 290 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was due to base business growth of 19.7% and a 2.2% contribution from COVID testing performed through its central lab business. 
Drug Development delivered broad-based revenue growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies. And relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compounded annual growth rate for the base business revenue was 14.7% and was primarily driven by organic growth. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $234 million or 16.3% of revenue compared to $151 million or 13.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margins were primarily due to organic base business demand, COVID testing and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. The company continues to develop and execute new LaunchPad programs to support profitable growth in Drug Development. 
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.6 billion and 1.47, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14 billion, an increase of approximately $210 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.6 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2021, for the full year. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong first quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year for both our Diagnostics and Drug Development base businesses. 
We expect enterprise level revenue to grow 2% to 6.5% from our prior guidance of minus 1% to plus 4.5%. This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 70 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 13.5% to 16%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 13.5%. The revenue guidance on the contribution from COVID testing is unchanged at down 35% to 50%. However, current estimates are less favorable than the midpoint of the range. 
We are raising our expectations for revenue in Diagnostics of flat to minus 5% from prior guidance of minus 0.5% to minus 7.5%. This guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 13.5% to 16%, given our first quarter performance and improved outlook, and we continue to expect COVID testing revenue again to decline 35% to 50%. 
We're also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 12% to 14% from prior guidance of 8% to 10.5%. Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 140 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 14% to 16%, reflecting strong first quarter broad-based performance and an improved outlook. 
Given the improved top line growth expectation of our base businesses, we're now raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $20 to $24, up from prior guidance of $19 to $23. Free cash flow is now expected to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
Our earnings guidance assumes we will use our free cash flow for acquisitions and share repurchases, which we expect to accelerate in the second quarter. We continue to expect the capital expenditures will be approximately 4% of revenue, driven by investments to support base business growth and productivity. 
For additional comparison purposes, we have also included in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website, a view of our 2021 first quarter results and full year guidance compared to our 2019 results. 
In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic, while also managing our base business. And as we progress through 2021, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business as COVID testing volumes are expected to decline over the remainder of the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders.

Central Laboratory was particularly strong, but we saw good growth in early stage as well in late-stage. And as I mentioned on previous calls, we had recently won some larger pharmaceutical clients that are helping with our book-to-bill. So if you look at our book-to-bill, it reached a record of 1.47 for the trailing 12 months. And the total backlog, as you said, grew to $13.97 billion. And I'll just add to that, that only a very small percent of that backlog is related to COVID work. So it's really related to the other therapeutic areas."

So right now, we continue to have a lot of good momentum. Our orders continue to be very strong. We're building up a very strong backlog, again, at $14 billion. So nothing from our view long term would change. Obviously, in the first quarter especially, you'll see kind of a really strong growth rate in part because of the COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic studies that we have that at some point will obviously start to taper off."

Whenever you have large-scale integrations or mergers and consolidation, you see some interruption of business. So we're going to be prepared to take advantage of whatever is out there in terms of disruption distractions of companies that are being acquired or that are going through the significant integrations. Integrations are just hard to do. 
We've said all along that we believe that there was going to be additional consolidation in the industry. So it's not a surprise to us. I mean we're aware of the marketplace and all the competitors. And obviously, we know what's happening. At the same time, we've always said you need a certain level of critical mass to be successful. And the good news is we have that critical mass. And as you said, Erin, you can see it in our numbers. You can see it in the strength of our book-to-bill, you can see it in the strength of our ability to continue to grow in the Covance business. So we know the industry, we know the other players very well. And that's a great thing about Labcorp. I mean everybody comes and talks to us. At the same time, we feel like we're in a very strong position. 
With regard to your second question was, as we go through a strategic review, we're focused on executing in the marketplace. And we're not going to lose focus and we're not going to spend time in the vast majority of our organization, they're just meeting the needs of our clients and our customers every single day. It's going to be the Board, the management team that are working together to do this thorough review. And We're not going to distract the largest parts of our organization. We're going to keep them focused on delivering. Hopefully, you see that our execution in the marketplace has been really strong across Diagnostics and Drug Development. It's been strong with everything we're doing for COVID. It's been strong in our base business. I mean our base business for the overall grew 15%, and the base business for Diagnostics was up 8%. Drug Development was up 24%. So you see strength there. That's because we're so focused on executing on the needs of our customers. And we're going to continue to do that while we also perform the strategic review."

The first thing is that if you look at people that have built capabilities to do COVID testing, those are really doing molecular testing. Molecular testing is a very, very small part of the 530 million or so tests that Labcorp does a year. So no matter how much capacity is out there for molecular testing, I don't think that there would be a significant impact to our business with new competition that can do some molecular tests. What I do believe is that some of those competitors are not going to be able to make it with just COVID testing as we've seen the number of tests per day go down. And therefore, I believe there will continue to be consolidation in the industry. And frankly, that's something that we'll continue to look at. We've always said that acquiring local laboratories or hospital laboratories, even regional laboratories are a great way for us to use our capital. We know how to integrate those. They return their cost of capital very quickly, and they're accretive typically in the first year. So we'll look for opportunities for continued consolidation, but not just in the smaller new competitors, but also in the hospitals and other laboratories."

They were down around 1.3% but actually would have been favorable if you took out the negative impact from weather. So we've really started to see the trend change. And when you think about it, not too surprising when you're comping now at the end of the first quarter to the beginning of the pandemic impact last year. But what we're equally pleased to see is that the volume levels continue to improve while still be down from 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Low single digits as well. And so while revenue continues to be up year-on-year to '20, while revenues continue to be up compounded compared to '19, kind of a normalized year, volumes are still a little bit down. And our expectation continues to be that the volume levels will now start to kind of kick in above '19 levels, call it at the middle of the year. But the good news is that we -- while volumes are still a little bit soft compared to historical levels, we're making that up on our price/mix, which we're attributing more to the number of tests we're doing because we report volume on an accession basis. So maybe fewer visits to the physicians, but they're doing more tests for each of those visits, but good momentum that we're continuing to see."

We tend to start off slower in the first quarter, just historically, even with our buyback program just to let the year a little bit unfold and see what the M&A opportunities are there. We continue, as Adam said, to have really a strong pipeline of M&A transactions. The reason why we said we were accelerating especially on the share repurchase side because we can obviously you unilaterally control that, is that with 1 quarter under our belt 3 to go, we still have that midpoint of 1.9 to fully deploy. So you would normally expect that instead of it just being done all towards the end of the year, you'll start to see a pickup. But we're encouraged with the pipeline of deals that we feel we can do. We're encouraged, obviously, that we'll continue to redeploy our capital with M&A. And from our perspective, we're on track with what we were expecting to see happen."

And clearly, there's a little bit more uncertainty visibility, if you will, on the level of PCR testing depending on what's going on with, obviously, the pandemic and how it impacts. So from our perspective, when we gave that range, we've said 2 things. That it's going to be a combination of different volume levels, but also potentially different levels of pricing. So right now, we obviously had a very strong first quarter relative to PCR volumes, 112,000 tests per day. But we ended the quarter at kind of the 80,000 test per day level. So you can see that we continue to see and expect that volume levels will continue to trail down. But again, we'll see if it picks up again, if you will. But at the midpoint, we're clearly considering that the volumes will come down. 
And there's also pricing. With CMS, we've always held to the pricing on the reimbursement We continue to do that. At some point, that pricing may change. CMS may change their pricing reimbursement. So there's just a lot of variability. So at this point, we continue to do. We have all the capacity there. Our turnaround times are extremely strong.

If you look at the PCR testing today and you looked at our range between down 35% and down 50%, you would actually get closer to down 50% today versus the 35%. But let's see what happens because in November, there could be another outbreak of the flu, and therefore, a lot of people might come in for PCR tests.

Obviously, we've talked a little bit about kind of the leverage that we get on that volume for PCR depending upon the pricing. So we've talked about it being kind of north of our 65% incremental leverage on PCR volumes. Kind of comparable, but a little bit north of what we would normally have seen like on incremental volume from weather, if you will. So as Adam said, when we gave our guidance, we give a range. Obviously, the midpoint is kind of where the most expectations. But clearly, we could see our way to getting higher at the upper end and other things that could be headwinds on the lower end. 
The reason we commented on the PCR one is that it's a little bit south of of the center point is because, one, that's what we're currently seeing on the trends. But two, as Adam said, we could see it pick up again. So we were just trying to provide some color. And given where the extension of the public health emergency continues to go out, if it gets extended again, that could reinforce better pricing than what -- that would hold our pricing, which would be an improvement because we do assume in some of the scenarios we'll see lower pricing overall. 
But when you look at our earnings, and it's kind of interesting, we obviously had a very solid first quarter and you compare it to, call it, the midpoint of the guidance that we give for earnings for the year, we had a much higher percentage of earnings than we would historically do. We tend to try to track not this precisely, but let's say, 1/4 of our earnings would normally be -- or 1 quarter, a quarter of the year. Here, we did around 40% of our earnings. And frankly, in the second quarter, I think it's fair to say It will be a strong quarter relative to the full year as well because we're still going to have another strong quarter of COVID testing, even though it will be less than what we saw in the first quarter. 
From our standpoint, the bigger question will be the second half of the year, which was really where we do expect to see a decline in volumes and potentially a declining in pricing. But there's still that uncertainty out there that could potentially be upside if the volume levels hold up greater and the pricing holds up greater. But there's just a wide range of outcomes."

So we expect to be involved in both, but we'll see as it plays out. At the minimum, it's hard to imagine where you wouldn't need the capacity and the capabilities we have for the testing itself. It's really going to come down to how many schools want to implement the screening. And as more and more people are vaccinated, as more parts of the country are opening up, I mean, almost fully in certain parts of the country, it's hard to tell to be honest, how many schools are going to say, we're going to want to screen on a fairly often basis all of our students. 
So we -- as we said, that's why we have this broad kind of guidance between down 35% and down 50%. We're turning more down towards the 50%.

And it's strong across Diagnostics for Drug Development and frankly, each area of Drug Development. When you look at the diagnostics, we're seeing that people are coming back to the more routine health care. And if you look at the volume and you compare it to 2019, it's only down in the low single digits now versus if you look at the end of last year, it was in the mid- to upper single digits. So we've seen continued improvement in people coming back to the routine test. 
The other thing that we're seeing is that for each blood draw, that there's more tests being run in that blood draw than historically happened. And the question is, will that be maintained? We are hypothesizing that some people have been out of health care for a while. So when they finally do go to their doctor or telemedicine, they're doing a lot of tests just to check on people's overall health, and therefore, that might not continue over time. But on the other hand, it may. And we're going to have to watch that closely in terms of how many tests per accession we see over time. 
There's no doubt that the Diagnostic team is executing extraordinarily well in the marketplace. The team is focused. They're energized. They're doing a great job. They've worked through COVID. Our sales folks were out there the entire time doing whatever they could where doctors' offices were open, doing things remotely. One of our platforms for our key pillars of our strategy was digitalization. So we were able to do a lot of things digitally through the pandemic that historically we would not have been able to do.

So especially as we continue to grow, when we talk about a normal historical growth rate of kind of 2% to 3%, if you will, in, call it, the organic revenue with 1% to 2% coming from volume, one from price.

So there's still a lot of unknowns as we go to 2022. I mean I would expect there will still be testing for COVID in 2022 that we'll be doing. The level of which will be determined to some degree by the vaccines. But on the other hand, if the vaccines last a longer period of time, will we need to do more serology tests? Will we need to do more T cell testing? I think that the story is still going to be written as we learn more scientifically. And PCR testing will play a role, but serology and/or T cell, another test may play a very different role as we go into 2022 and beyond. 
With regard to the testing capabilities that we've built, the machinery, we can still use a lot of that. I mean we use it for our other tests. There might be some excess capacity that has to be written off over time.

So again, with the longer-term COA testing, it's early to understand exactly how that's going to play out. Part of it is going to depend on vaccines, but part of it will also depend on if we have good therapeutics. So for example, if we get to next year and it's a big flu season, And if somebody gets COVID, they still have a high likelihood of being hospitalized and/or dying from COVID. I think people are going to want to use a molecular PCR test and have it done by us. If there's great therapeutics and if people get COVID, they end up not being hospitalized and they can be managed from their home and it's more like the flu, then I think you might find more testing that's done in physicians' offices. So really, it's going to depend on how the science plays out. I assume there will be some testing needed in the long term that we'll be doing. But obviously, it will be significantly less over time than what we've done in the past. 
To me, the real question continues to be, will there be a role for serology? Will we need to know if people are still immune to the disease or are vaccinated and have titers at the right level for the disease. And there might be other tests in the future that play a more important role than they do today, and we'll have to continue to watch that. 
The last thing I'd say is with regard to capacity in the future, I've seen some countries that are going to use that capacity to do significantly more screening for things like HCV or HIV, things where molecular tests are done routinely today, but they're routinely done to diagnose versus the screen. So there might be some opportunities to do those types of things. But in general, as I said, molecular testing is a very small amount of the 530 million tests or so that we do every year. And therefore, for us, it's not going to be a significant issue. I feel very optimistic as I look at our base businesses moving forward."

With regard to geographical differences, weather was probably a bigger impact than other things. So when we saw the Northeast get hit by weather, there was a 2% impact. A lot of it came from where the weather was, obviously. In Texas, we saw a significant issue with what was occurring there at some point when electricity was out for a week. So it was more driven, I believe, by that than it was differences in other testing. Obviously, you're going to see some differences by geography as different parts of the country open up in different ways at different times. But frankly, you saw strength pretty much across all parts of the country when you compare it to where we were at the end of last year."

We are very pleased to see our base businesses perform well across every single area of our business.

Our focus continues to be on bringing innovations to market that help improve people's health and lives. As you'll see from our first quarter results, doing so can generate strong growth and returns for our shareholders. I'm going to begin by covering our overall performance in the first quarter, which is very strong across all of our businesses. 
Revenue increased 47% versus the same period in 2020. While a good amount of growth can be attributed to COVID testing, we also delivered 15% year-over-year growth in our base business. In Diagnostics and Drug Development, base business revenue increased 8% and 24%, respectively, from the prior year. Our drug development book-to-bill remains very strong and reached 1.47 for the trailing 12 months. Our adjusted EPS of $8.79 represents significant growth from last year, and we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's up from $97 million in the first quarter of 2020. Our first quarter results and our improved outlook for the year enabled us to increase our full year guidance. 
We're also encouraged to see that patients continued to return to their pre-pandemic health care routines as well as our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers resuming their important research and development work. Our first quarter results demonstrate Labcorp's strong position in both diagnostics and drug development. We continue to play a central role in helping health care professionals assess a patient's health and deciding appropriate treatment options. We're also aiding in the development of treatments and cures that are critically important for the future. 
Now I'm going to turn to our response to COVID. As you know, Labcorp's capabilities in testing and drug development have been critical to the pandemic response. Our fight against this virus is not over, but we are thankfully seeing a reduction in cases from pandemic eyes, especially in the United States. And with that, our COVID testing volume has declined. While we can't fully predict how the pandemic will evolve as the year goes on, we are confident in our ability to leverage the considerable experience and expertise that we've gained over the last year to continue to build on our leading COVID testing and treatment capabilities. 
Our scientists are developing new testing solutions. We have sufficient capacity to serve our customers, and our teams continue to support important COVID science and trials. We're also proud to be a part of getting people back to work, to school and to life. Our employer services team offers testing and vaccination services to support workplace and community safety. Our recently announced offering for small businesses can help employers, including restaurants, reopen. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, we've been focused on serving all communities, including underserved populations. This quarter, we furthered that commitment in a partnership with the state of North Carolina to provide Pixel COVID home kits at no cost to underserved communities. Additionally, our Walgreens partnership expanded to include new integrated digital experiences available to all Walgreens customers and access to our Pixel home kits in over 6,000 locations. We're also helping patients securely access their results through their personal devices and apps like CommonHealth and CommonPass. Finally, we're continuing our important work for the CDC to genetically sequence approximately 5,000 virus samples every week in order to identify variance.
Now I'll provide several updates to our strategy. In the quarter, as we delivered growth in our base business and we responded to the needs of our customers in a pandemic, we also made progress in advancing our strategy. In our central laboratory business, which supports trials across many therapeutic areas, we continued to automate our processes using robotics and proprietary analytics. Our investments in our central labs business will enable us to increase our productivity, create resiliency in our supply chain and better meet the needs of our customers. 
We recently opened a new automated clinical trial kit production facility in Belgium. We expect that to eventually double our capacity. The facility will offer faster kit delivery, more flexible ordering and reduced transportation costs for biopharma clients and clinical trial investigator sites across Europe, Middle East and Africa. We're also advancing our position in oncology by strengthening our leadership team and investing in this important area, where novel diagnostic testing and better treatments are needed around the world. 
Our science and technology continue to be critical to Labcorp's success and future growth. We made continuing strides during the first quarter in developing future tests for cancer, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune and liver disease. We also increased access to testing and trials through telemedicine, pharmacies, employers, home kits and our decentralized clinical trial capabilities. In fact, our continued scientific and technology advancements were recognized by Fast Company, which named us one of the world's most innovative companies for 2021. This accolade is great recognition for Labcorp's talented teams who are resilient, fast and agile. It's a testament to our company's ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing environment. 
In closing, as announced in March, the Board and leadership team are undertaking a review of the company's structure and capital allocation strategy. The goal is to ensure we are best positioned to unlock shareholder value while continuing to support the patients and the customers who rely upon us around the world. This process will take time, and there will be no updates until a conclusion is reached. 
Our team is focused. We're focused on delivering on our mission of improving health and improving lives, which we believe drive strong shareholder returns. I want to thank our more than 70,000 employees around the world who continue to rise to the occasion. We look forward to brighter days ahead as vaccines continue to roll out, and I remain very confident in our strength across our businesses as we move forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our 2021 full year guidance.Revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion,",1374,"Thank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our 2021 full year guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 47.4% over last year due to organic revenue growth of 45%, acquisitions of 0.9% and favorable foreign currency translation of 140 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was driven by COVID testing of 32.9% and organic base business growth of 12.2%. Operating income for the quarter was $1.1 billion or 25.4% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $32 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily due to COVID-related costs and acquisition integration charges. We also had $92 million of amortization, which was higher than last year due to the accelerated amortization of the Covance trade name related to our previously announced branding initiative.  
Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $1.2 billion or 28.4% of revenue compared to $366 million or 12.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic base business growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.5% compared to 25.3% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $770 million or $7.82 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $8.79 in the quarter, up from $2.37 last year. 
Operating cash flow was $1.2 billion in the quarter compared to $204 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $95 million or 2.3% of revenue compared to $107 million or 3.8% of revenue last year. As a result, free cash flow was $1.1 billion in the quarter compared to $97 million last year. 
During the quarter, we paid down $375 million of debt, invested $34 million in acquisitions and repurchased $69 million of stock. At quarter end, the company had $732 million remaining of its Board-authorized share repurchase program. 
Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, an increase of 62% compared to last year, driven by COVID testing of 54.5% and base business growth of 7.5%. The base business growth was primarily driven by organic growth of 6.3%, which includes the negative impact of weather of approximately 2%. Relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compounded annual growth rate for the base business revenue was 2.7% and was primarily due to organic growth. 
Total volume increased 27.3% over last year, primarily due to organic volume growth of 26.6%. The increase in organic volume was due to the contribution from COVID testing volumes of 27.9%, partially offset by a reduction in organic base business of 1.3%, which was negatively impacted by weather of approximately 2%. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 1.3% to organic base business volume growth. Price/mix increased 34.7% over last year, driven by COVID testing of 26.6% and a favorable mix in the organic base business of 7.5%, which was primarily due to higher test per accession. 
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $992 million or 36% of revenue compared to $254 million or 14.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to COVID testing, organic base business demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Diagnostics' 3-year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of 2021. 
Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 25.7% compared to last year due to organic growth of 21.9%, acquisitions of 1% and favorable foreign currency translation of 290 basis points. The increase in organic revenue was due to base business growth of 19.7% and a 2.2% contribution from COVID testing performed through its central lab business. Drug Development delivered broad-based revenue growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies. And relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compounded annual growth rate for the base business revenue was 14.7% and was primarily driven by organic growth. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $234 million or 16.3% of revenue compared to $151 million or 13.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margins were primarily due to organic base business demand, COVID testing and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. The company continues to develop and execute new LaunchPad programs to support profitable growth in Drug Development. 
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.6 billion and 1.47, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14 billion, an increase of approximately $210 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.6 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2021, for the full year. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong first quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year for both our Diagnostics and Drug Development base businesses. 
We expect enterprise level revenue to grow 2% to 6.5% from our prior guidance of minus 1% to plus 4.5%. This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 70 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 13.5% to 16%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 13.5%. The revenue guidance on the contribution from COVID testing is unchanged at down 35% to 50%. However, current estimates are less favorable than the midpoint of the range. 
We are raising our expectations for revenue in Diagnostics of flat to minus 5% from prior guidance of minus 0.5% to minus 7.5%. This guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 13.5% to 16%, given our first quarter performance and improved outlook. And we continue to expect COVID testing revenue again to decline 35% to 50%. 
We're also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 12% to 14% from prior guidance of 8% to 10.5%. Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 140 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 14% to 16%, reflecting strong first quarter broad-based performance and an improved outlook. 
Given the improved top line growth expectation of our base businesses, we're now raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $20 to $24, up from prior guidance of $19 to $23. Free cash flow is now expected to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Our earnings guidance assumes we will use our free cash flow for acquisitions and share repurchases, which we expect to accelerate in the second quarter. We continue to expect the capital expenditures will be approximately 4% of revenue, driven by investments to support base business growth and productivity. 
For additional comparison purposes, we have also included in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of our 2021 first quarter results and full year guidance compared to our 2019 results.
In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also managing our base business. And as we progress through 2021, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business as COVID testing volumes are expected to decline over the remainder of the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders.

Whenever you have large-scale integrations or mergers and consolidation, you see some interruption of business. So we're going to be prepared to take advantage of whatever is out there in terms of disruption and distractions of companies that are being acquired or that are going through the significant integrations. Integrations are just hard to do. 
We've said all along that we believe that there was going to be additional consolidation in the industry. So it's not a surprise to us. I mean, we're aware of the marketplace and all of the competitors. And obviously, we know what's happening. At the same time, we've always said you need a certain level of critical mass to be successful. And the good news is we have that critical mass. And as you said, Erin, you can see it in our numbers. You can see it in the strength of our book-to-bill. You can see it in the strength of our ability to continue to grow in the Covance business. So we know the industry. We know the other players very well, and that's a great thing about Labcorp. I mean, everybody comes and talks to us. At the same time, we feel like we're in a very strong position. 
With regard to your second question was -- as we go through a strategic review, we're focused on executing in the marketplace, and we're not going to lose focus. And we're not going to spend time -- in the vast majority of our organization, they're just meeting the needs of our clients and our customers every single day. It's going to be the Board, the management team that are working together to do this thorough review, and we're not going to distract the largest parts of our organization. We're going to keep them focused on delivering. Hopefully, you see that our execution in the marketplace has been really strong across Diagnostics and Drug Development. It's been strong with everything we're doing for COVID. It's been strong in our base business. I mean, our base business for the overall grew 15%, and the base business for Diagnostics was up 8%. Drug Development was up 24%. 
So you see strength there. That's because we're so focused on executing on the needs of our customers. And we're going to continue to do that while we also perform the strategic review."

The first thing is that if you look at people that have built capabilities to do COVID testing, those are really doing molecular testing. Molecular testing is a very, very small part of the 530 million or so tests that Labcorp does a year. So no matter how much capacity is out there for molecular testing, I don't think that there would be a significant impact to our business with new competition that can do some molecular tests. 
What I do believe is that some of those competitors are not going to be able to make it with just COVID testing, as we've seen the number of tests per day go down. And therefore, I believe there will continue to be consolidation in the industry. And frankly, that's something that we'll continue to look at. We've always said that acquiring local laboratories or hospital laboratories, even regional laboratories are a great way for us to use our capital. We know how to integrate those. They return their cost of capital very quickly, and they're accretive typically in the first year. So we'll look for opportunities for continued consolidation but not just in the smaller new competitors, but also in the hospitals and other laboratories."

When you look at the breakup of the, call it, the 6% plus organic revenue growth, volumes are still down year-on-year. They were down around 1.3% but actually would have been favorable if you took out the negative impact from weather. So we've really started to see the trend change and when you think about it, not too surprising when you're comping now at the end of the first quarter to the beginning of the pandemic impact last year. But what we're equally pleased to see is that the volume levels continue to improve while still being down from 2019 pre-pandemic levels, low single digits as well. 
And so while revenue continues to be up year-on-year to '20, while revenues continue to be up compounded compared to '19, kind of a normalized year, volumes are still a little bit down. And our expectation continues to be that the volume levels will now start to kind of kick in above '19 levels, call it, at the middle of the year. But the good news is that we -- while volumes are still a little bit soft compared to historical levels, we're making that up on our price/mix, which we're attributing more to the number of tests we're doing because we report volume on an accession basis. So maybe fewer visits to the physicians, but they're doing more tests for each of those visits, but good momentum that we're continuing to see."

And we continue, as Adam said, to have really a strong pipeline of M&A transactions. 
The reason why we said we were accelerating especially on the share repurchase side, because we can obviously unilaterally control that, is that with 1 quarter under our belt, 3 to go, we still have that midpoint of $1.9 billion to fully deploy. So you would normally expect that instead of it just being done all towards the end of the year, you'll start to see a pickup. But we're encouraged with the pipeline of deals that we feel we can do.

And clearly, there's a little bit more uncertainty, visibility, if you will, on the level of PCR testing, depending on what's going on with obviously the pandemic and how it impacts. So from our perspective, when we gave that range, we've said 2 things: That it's going to be a combination of different volume levels, but also potentially different levels of pricing. 
So right now, we obviously had a very strong first quarter relative to PCR volumes, 112,000 tests per day. But we ended the quarter at kind of the 80,000 test per day level. So you can see that we continue to see and expect that volume levels will continue to trail down. But again, we'll see if it picks up again, if you will. But at the midpoint, we're clearly considering that the volumes will come down.  
And there's also pricing. With CMS, we've always held to the pricing on the reimbursement. We continue to do that. At some point, that pricing may change. CMS may change their pricing reimbursement. So there's just a lot of variability. So at this point, we continue to do -- we have all the capacity there. Our turnaround times are extremely strong.

Obviously, we've talked a little bit about kind of the leverage that we get on that volume for PCR depending upon the pricing. So we've talked about it being kind of north of our 65% incremental leverage on PCR volumes, kind of comparable but a little bit north of what we would normally have seen like on incremental volume from weather, if you will. So as Adam said, when we gave our guidance, we give a range. So obviously, the midpoint is kind of where the most expectations. But clearly, we could see our way to getting higher at the upper end and other things that could be headwinds on the lower end. 
The reason we commented on the PCR one is that it's a little bit south of the center point is because, one, that's what we're currently seeing on the trends. But two, as Adam said, we could see it pick up again. So we were just trying to provide some color. And given where the extension of the public health emergency continues to go out, if it gets extended again, that could reinforce better pricing than what -- that would hold our pricing, which would be an improvement because we do assume in some of those scenarios, we'll see lower pricing overall. 
But when you look at our earnings, and it's kind of interesting, we obviously had a very solid first quarter. And you compare it to, call it, the midpoint of the guidance that we give for earnings for the year, we had a much higher percentage of earnings than we would historically do. We tend to try to track not this precisely, but let's say, 1/4 of our earnings would normally be -- or 1 quarter, 1/4 of the year. Here, we did around 40% of our earnings. And frankly, in the second quarter, I think it's fair to say, it'll be a strong quarter relative to the full year as well because we're still going to have another strong quarter of COVID testing, even though it will be less than what we saw in the first quarter. 
From our standpoint, the bigger question will be the second half of the year, which was really where we do expect to see a decline in volumes and potentially a declining in pricing. But there's still that uncertainty out there that could potentially be upside if the volume levels hold up greater and the pricing holds up greater. But there's just a wide range of outcomes."

So we expect to be involved in both, but we'll see as it plays out. At a minimum, it's hard to imagine where you wouldn't need the capacity and the capabilities we have for the testing itself. It's really going to come down to how many schools want to implement the screening. And as more and more people are vaccinated, as more parts of the country are opening up, I mean, almost fully in certain parts of the country, it's hard to tell, to be honest, how many schools are going to say, ""We're going to want to screen on a fairly often basis all of our students."" 
So we -- as we said, that's why we have this broad kind of guidance between down 35% and down 50%. We're turning more down towards the 50%.

But Drug Development -- and frankly, each area of Drug Development. When you look at the Diagnostics, we're seeing that people are coming back to the more routine health care. And if you look at the volume and you compare it to 2019, it's only down in the low single digits now versus if you look at the end of last year, it was in the mid- to upper single digits. So we've seen continued improvement in people coming back to the routine tests. 
The other thing that we're seeing is that for each blood draw, that there's more tests being run in that blood draw than historically happened. And the question is, will that be maintained? We are hypothesizing that some people have been out of health care for a while. So when they finally do go to their doctor or telemedicine, they're doing a lot of tests just to check on people's overall health. And therefore, that might not continue over time. But on the other hand, it may, and we're going to have to watch that closely in terms of how many tests per accession we see over time. 
There's no doubt that the diagnostic team is executing extraordinarily well in the marketplace. The team is focused. They're energized. They're doing a great job. They've worked through COVID. Our sales folks were out there the entire time doing whatever they could, where doctors' offices were open, doing things remotely. One of our platforms for our key pillars of our strategy was digitalization. So we were able to do a lot of things digitally through the pandemic that historically we would not have been able to do. So I agree with your assessment that we're performing well in the marketplace versus others."

And I've said all along that we have the scale that we need in late-stage clinical trials. That's the area that as you get more trials, you can scale the quickest. And you can do that to some degree organically. You don't necessarily have to scale in clinical trials inorganically. 
So for example, we wanted to have more capabilities in China and Japan, we were able to build scale for clinical development in those countries fairly quickly. So we see what's happening in the marketplace. We understand the marketplace well. We understand the importance of scale. And to me, it's a certain level of scale you need to have and then you can be successful. And I believe we have the level of scale across each of our 3 businesses that we need."

Again, when you think about it that now those people are going to the physician's office more normally, you'll start to see a more normal cadence of how many tests per accession they would have. So especially as we continue to grow, when we talk about a normal historical growth rate of kind of 2% to 3%, if you will, in, call it, the organic revenue with 1% to 2% coming from volume, 1% from price, so we normally always still do expect to have a contribution from favorable price/mix. But given that the volume levels have been negative from year-over-year comparisons, we've seen an unusually high price/mix. So again, as we get more to normal, so you'll see both kind of fall back into where we would normally expect it to be."

That's why we have such a broad range. It makes it even more difficult to predict 2022. What I would say is part of it is going to depend on how long the vaccines work for. Are we going to need a booster shot every year? Is it going to last for several years? Part of it is going to depend on how tough the flu seasons are. So there's still a lot of unknowns as we go to 2022. 
I mean, I would expect there will still be testing for COVID in 2022 that we'll be doing, the level of which will be determined to some degree by the vaccines. But on the other hand, if the vaccines last a longer period of time, will we need to do more serology tests? Will we need to do more T-cell testing? So I think that the story is still going to be written as we learn more scientifically, and PCR testing will play a role. But serology and/or T-cell, another test may play a very different role as we go into 2022 and beyond. 
With regard to the testing capabilities that we've built, the machinery, we can still use a lot of that. I mean, we use it for our other tests. There might be some excess capacity that has to be written off over time. But for us, it wouldn't be a significant issue. Where others that all they do is COVID testing and all they've done is build capacity for that, I think they'll have a significant issue. We're in very good shape there, frankly."

So again, with the longer-term COVID testing, it's early to understand exactly how that's going to play out. Part of it's going to depend on vaccines, but part of it will also depend on if we have good therapeutics. So for example, if we get to next year and it's a big flu season, and if somebody gets COVID, they still have a high likelihood of being hospitalized and/or dying from COVID. I think people are going to want to use a molecular PCR test and have it done by us. If there's great therapeutics and if people get COVID, they end up not being hospitalized and they can be managed from their home. And if it's more like the flu, then I think you might find more testing that's done in physicians' offices. So really, it's going to depend on how the science plays out. I assume there will be some testing needed in the long term that we'll be doing. But obviously, it will be significantly less over time than what we've done in the past. 
To me, the real question continues to be, will there be a role for serology? Will we need to know if people are still immune to the disease or are vaccinated and have titers at the right level for the disease? And there might be other tests in the future that play a more important role than they do today. And we'll have to continue to watch that. 
The last thing I'd say is with regard to capacity in the future, I've seen some countries that are going to use that capacity to do significantly more screening for things like HCV or HIV, things where molecular tests are done routinely today, but they're routinely done to diagnose versus to screen. So there might be some opportunities to do those types of things. But in general, as I said, molecular testing is a very small amount of the 530 million tests or so that we do every year. And therefore, for us, it's not going to be a significant issue. I feel very optimistic as I look at our base businesses moving forward."

With regard to geographical differences, weather was probably a bigger impact than other things. So when we saw the Northeast get hit by weather, there was a 2% impact. A lot of it came from where the weather was, obviously. In Texas, we saw a significant issue with what was occurring there at some point when electricity was out for a week. So it was more driven, I believe, by that than it was differences in other testing.

It's a pleasure to be with you this morning. We remain committed to using our extensive diagnostics and drug development capabilities to advance our mission of improving health and improving lives around the world. 
Innovation, technology and science remains at the forefront of all we do to benefit patients, providers and shareholders. To that end, the second quarter of 2021 was very strong across both Diagnostics and Drug Development. 
Revenue totaled $3.8 billion, a 39% increase from the same period in 2020. Much of this growth was driven by the continued strength in our base businesses. Adjusted EPS reached $6.13 versus $2.50 from the prior year. Free cash flow was $390 million in the quarter versus $272 million in 2020. 
The strong performance in the quarter and the improved outlook for the year resulted in us raising full year guidance for revenue, EPS and cash flow. Glenn will review the new guidance with you in a moment. Our base business continued to recover and grew 51% and 32% for Diagnostics and Drug Development, respectively. The Drug Development trailing 12-month book-to-bill remained strong at 1.41. This performance was driven by patients and providers returning to routine health care checkups, and pharmaceutical clients resuming their important research activities at an even faster pace than expected. 
I'll now turn to the company's continued response to the pandemic. Our organization's collective strength and scale have allowed us to play a substantial role in the fight against COVID. Although much progress has been made, it is clear that there's still a lot of work to do in the U.S. and around the world. 
Labcorp remains vigilant and stands ready to help wherever and however we can as we have since the earliest days of the pandemic. To date, Labcorp has performed over 50 million COVID tests. In the quarter, a steady decline in positive cases drove an overall decrease in COVID testing with an average of 54,000 PCR tests per day. 
The month of June was lower than the quarter average. However, testing started to increase again in recent weeks. We continue to monitor developments in the United States and around the world, and are watching the Delta variant closely. 
To support the CDC in tracking and monitoring the Delta and other variants, this quarter, we announced an extension to our contract to provide genetic sequencing from positive PCR test samples. It is difficult to predict exactly what COVID testing demand will look like for the remainder of the year as variants continues to spread and we enter the flu season. 
Therefore, we will maintain our ability to scale testing capacity quickly and expand access for communities and individuals in need. At the same time, our Drug Development teams continue to be involved in many studies on potential vaccines and treatment for COVID around the world. 
Our new automated clinical trial kit production facility in Belgium is up and running, which will double our automated kit production capacity over time. This will allow us to better serve our pharmaceutical clients and study investigators in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Other COVID-related actions this quarter include the collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to raise awareness of monoclonal antibody therapies. 
And at state and local levels, we expanded notable partnerships in places like Massachusetts and North Carolina to facilitate mass vaccination programs and expand access to at-home test collections for underserved populations. 
In addition, we continued our collaboration with Walgreens. Pixel by Labcorp test kits are now available in 6,000 Walgreens and through on-demand delivery services like DoorDash and Instacart. 
Importantly, our scientists use data available through our robust testing infrastructure to contribute to essential research. In the quarter, we released the results of one of the largest COVID-related studies of its time, which analyzed the tests of more than 39,000 patients. This offered useful detail on the body's reaction to natural infection as we work to learn more about the nature of the immuno response. 
We are also building upon our portfolio of serology testing, including semi quantitative analysis and T cell memory. We remain proud of our significant contributions to extending the spread of proven and in the development of treatments and vaccines, all of which are intended to assist people to safely go back to work and normal life activities. 
Now I'll provide updates to our strategy. We are focused on leveraging our industry-leading positions to drive growth, enhance customer patient experiences and advanced science and health care. We seek intensified customer focus and integrate data and digitalization across our business. 
As part of that objective, we announced plans to add a state-of-the-art bioanalytical laboratory in Singapore, expanding our global drug development offering and elevating our client experience through faster turnaround times in Asia. 
In the United States, we continue to improve our patients' experience in our service centers, focusing our efforts to create a seamless digital journey from appointment scheduling to result delivery. With an average of 3 million patients served in a given week, we are starting to enhance their experience using our digital channels. In the first half of the year, users of our website totaled $22 million, a 20% increase over last year. 
And adoption of our patient application is growing approximately 300,000 users per month. I'll now turn to oncology. We made significant strides for the quarter in oncology led by highly trained multidisciplinary team. We launched several new oncology tests, including [ OmniSeq Insight ], a pan-cancer tissue-based sequencing test for patients with advanced solid tumor cancers. The test specific to an individual's molecular and immune profile provides clinical decision support that helps medical professionals identify the most appropriate treatment options for a patient as well as to identify potential eligibility for clinical trials. 
We also launched a companion diagnostic test to identify patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are eligible for a new treatment option developed by Amgen. This important test helps physicians identify patients who may benefit from the treatment promoting personalized precision medicine. 
Our work in oncology has created meaningful business relationships across the health care ecosystem that we will continue to enhance and grow. An important opportunity presented itself with OmniSeq, a long-time oncology partner and a pioneer in solid tumor profiling. 
As announced today, we recently exercised our option to acquire the remaining stake in the company. Adding OmniSeq enhances our integrated oncology platform, expanding Labcorp's extensive oncology diagnostics betting portfolio, and opening the door to more patient participation in clinical trials. 
We continue to concentrate on identifying and engaging in high-growth opportunities. We announced we are acquiring an autoimmune business unit for Myriad Genetics, including Vectra, rheumatoid arthritis assay. This will strengthen our position in RA which the CDC predicts will impact roughly 25% of adults in the United States by 2040. 
Additionally, we agreed this week to acquire the outreach laboratory business of Minnesota-based North Memorial Health, and we'll provide management services to its increasing lab. Our pipeline of acquisition and investment targets is robust, and we believe there are meaningful business development opportunities this year to enhance growth and our strategy moving forward. 
Finally, I want to touch briefly on the Board and management team's ongoing review of Labcorp's structure and capital allocation strategy that we announced in March of this year. Working closely with our advisers, we are making progress to identify the best path forward to position Labcorp to unlock shareholder value while continuing to support our patients and customers around the world. Though we won't have further updates today, we look forward to sharing our conclusions once our review is complete. We expect to do so in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, the quarter was strong across both Diagnostics and Drug Development businesses. Significant progress was achieved on our strategy and our mission to improve health and improve lives of people around the world, and we will continue to support efforts to stem COVID however we can. I am very optimistic about the future growth opportunities before us and our continued success. I want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their tireless efforts to help stem COVID while also retaining focus on our strategy and our underlying business.

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance.

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, an increase of 38.7% over last year due to organic growth of 35.5%, acquisitions of [ 1.3% ] and favorable foreign currency translation of 200 basis points. 
Our organic base business increased 42.4% when compared to our base business last year, while COVID testing revenues of $444 million were flat with last year. Operating income for the quarter was $704 million or 18.3% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $92 million of amortization and $43 million of restructuring charges and special items. 
Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $840 million or 21.9% of revenue compared to $381 million or 13.8% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to organic base business growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings partially offset by higher personnel costs. 
During the second quarter, interest expense was $78 million, up from $53 million last year. The increase was due to onetime costs associated with the company's refinancing of $1 billion in senior notes that were due to mature in 2022, taking advantage of the historically low interest rate environment. 
Excluding these onetime costs, interest expense would have been down $7 million versus last year due to lower debt levels and interest rates. The tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 25.1% compared to 23.9% last year. 
The higher adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%. Net earnings for the quarter were $467 million or $4.76 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.13 in the quarter, up from $2.57 last year. 
Operating cash flow was $487 million in the quarter compared to $371 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to favorable working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $97 million or 2.5% of revenue compared to $99 million or 3.6% of revenue last year. 
As a result, free cash flow was $390 million in the quarter, compared to $272 million last year. During the quarter, we used $300 million of our cash flow for our share repurchase program. Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. 
Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 39.7% compared to last year due to organic growth of 37.8%, acquisitions of 1.1% and favorable foreign exchange translation of 90 basis points. 
Organic base business growth was 51.2% compared to our base business last year, while COVID testing revenues were flat versus last year. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for the base business revenue was 4.5%, primarily due to organic growth. 
Total volume increased 39.6% over last year, primarily due to organic volume growth of 38.7%. The increase in organic volume was due to a 39.4% increase in the base business, partially offset by a reduction in COVID testing of 0.7%. 
As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 3.3% to organic base business volume growth. Price/mix increased 0.1% over last year due to currency of 0.9%, COVID testing of 0.7% and acquisitions of 0.2% partially offset by organic base business of minus 1.7% due to mix associated with the volume recovery. 
Of Diagnostics organic base business revenue growth of 51.2% compared to its base business last year, 48.2% was driven by volume, while 3.1% was from price mix, which was due to an increase in test per recession. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $663 million or 28% of revenue compared to $309 million or 18.2% last year. 
The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to organic base business demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, base business margins were down slightly due to the negative impact from PAMA. 
Diagnostics margins were down in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter due to lower coated testing, while base business margins increased. Diagnostics 3-year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of this year. 
Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 36.7% compared to last year due to organic growth of 31.8%, acquisitions of 1.3% and favorable foreign currency translation of 370 basis points. Drug Development delivered broad-based revenue growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies. 
Relative to the second quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for the base business revenue was approximately 15%, primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $201 million or 14.8% of revenue compared to $113 million or 10.3% last year. 
The increase in adjusted operating income and margins were primarily due to organic base business demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, a base business margins were up approximately 200 basis points. 
While second quarter margins this year were lower than first quarter, we expect our second half base business margins to be up versus the first half. We also expect our full year margins this year to be up over 2020, which was up over 2019. For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.9 billion and $1.41, respectively. 
Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14.3 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2021, for the full year. 
We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong second quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year for both our Diagnostics and Drug Development based businesses. We expect enterprise level revenue to grow 6.5% to 9% from prior guidance of 2% to 6.5%. This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 17% to 19%, while COVID testing is expected to be down 38% to down 33%. 
We are raising our expectations for revenue in Diagnostics to minus 1% to plus 2% from prior guidance of minus 5% to flat. This guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 15% to 17%, while COVID testing revenue is now expected to be down 38% to down 33%. 
 We are also raising our growth expectations for revenue in drug development to 17% to 19% from prior guidance of 12% to 14%. Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 200 basis points. 
This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 19% to 21%. Given the improved top line growth expectations of our base businesses, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $21.5 to $25, up from prior guidance of $20 to $24. 
Free cash flow is now expected to be between $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Earnings guidance assumes we will use our free cash flow for acquisitions and share repurchases, which we expect to accelerate in the second half of the year. We expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% to 4% of revenue driven by investments to support base business growth and productivity. 
For additional comparison purposes, we have also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website, a view of 2021 second quarter results and full year guidance compared to 2019 results. 
In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic, while also growing our base business. As we progress through 2021, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline in the second half. 
We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Operator, we will now take questions."

And if you look at our Labcorp Drug Development business in total, we have progress in all parts of the drug development business. So all 3 grew strong in the double digits. And as I look at the margins going forward, I've always said, be careful to look at any one quarter of the margin, especially as we're going through COVID. 
There are certain areas where we continue to maintain people. And when we maintain those people, we're doing it because we're going through COVID and we know we're going to need them for after COVID. So some of our margins look a little bit odd from quarter-to-quarter. 
We're also seeing a slight increase in material costs and in labor costs, which people are seeing in almost every industry. But we're going to continue to offset that with things like our LaunchPad initiatives. So I would look at the margin on a yearly basis. And we believe that this year will be better than last year, which was better than the year before. 
And I would expect, as we go into next year in our Drug Development business, the margins will little better than this year. So we're going to continue to find ways to expand our margins moving forward."

And then we said we're going to look to do more hospital regional, local laboratory acquisitions. 
And you saw one of those this quarter with what we announced we were doing with one of the hospitals in Minneapolis area -- Minnesota. So those are the types of acquisitions we're going to continue to do. What I would say is the pipeline is as robust as I've ever seen it. And frankly, I thought we'd have a couple more flows this quarter, but I feel confident we will close more of those as we go through this year. 
Separate and distinct from that, we continue to make progress on our strategic review. And we're going to do the strategic review. Once you reach the conclusion, we look forward to sharing those with you, and we expect to do that in the fourth quarter of this year. Glenn?"

But also, when you look at the improvement in our EBITDA because of COVID testing, it's higher than normal. 
So as you do look at our leverage relative to, call it, pre-pandemic using a pro forma 2019, you'd get that our leverage currently gross debt-to-EBITDA is towards the upper end of our range. Having said that, as Adam commented on, we expect to use our free cash flow this year for M&A and share repurchases. 
The midpoint of our range a little bit over $2 billion. We spent around $400 million so far in the first half of the year. So needless to say, it implies that the second half, you'll see more capital allocation given to both share repurchases and M&A. 
We spoke to the strength of our M&A pipeline, which again gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to deploy more towards M&A than we've done in the first half, but we'll continue to use our share repurchase program as well."

When you look at Covance, though, to your point, sequentially, you move from kind of the first quarter to the second, margins were down, principally related to -- COVID testing was down within that segment. The level of COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies was down compared to the first quarter. We had higher pass-throughs in the second quarter versus the first, and obviously, the tight labor market also impacting it. 
So a lot of things that will impact a quarter-to-quarter kind of change. What we've commented on is that the second half margins within drug development, we expect to be higher than the first half. And that for the full year, we expect it to be up over the prior year. So we feel good about how the business is leveraging the top line growth from the base business standpoint."

Ricky, just -- maybe just a couple of follow-on comments because, as Adam said, we crossed over where revenue and Diagnostics base business really in the fourth quarter of last year was favorable to 2019 levels, but that was driven off of the price mix. 
We were seeing more tests per session that was making up for the volume shortfall. So June was a signal a month for us, if you will, as we now have crossed over with volume now comparing favorably as well as price/mix continues to be higher than normal. But as we continue to progress through the rest of this year and obviously going forward, expect those to fall more in line with kind of the historical patterns. 
As your comment on LaunchPad, and really with the tight labor market in particular, but both businesses have LaunchPad initiatives. We completed the drug development on at least publicly last year and this year, we'll wrap up our Diagnostics business. But that's part of an ongoing business process improvement initiative of the company every single year. 
We know we have just high inflationary costs as we go in every year and launch pad is really set to offset, mitigate those rising costs. So continue to see a lot of opportunities to continue to drive productivity through technology, labor efficiency that will continue to help mitigate those costs going forward."

As we said, the average number of tests per day in the second quarter was 54,000. And if you look at the month of June, it actually was lower than the average of the 54,000. If you would have just trended based upon the June data, you would have been in the 35% to 50% reduction that we have been quoting for the beginning of the year in terms of test. 
But we saw a slight change with the Delta variant, and we also saw the extension of the the government saying that we're going to continue to be in an emergency situation. And those 2 things gave us confidence that the reduction in codices would be less than what we had originally had in the plan. And that's why we lowered and narrowed the guidance for COVID testing to 33% down to 38% down. 
So we really did narrow that and provide some additional guidance there. If you look at those numbers, I know it's still a fairly wide range going from 33% to 38%. But there's a lot of different ways that you can actually get there. 
One is by number of tests. And if you start to think about the variance and what we're seeing, will that continue, if you start to think about what could happen if there's a strong flu season or mass or mandated again in certain states, maybe the flu season will be very light like it was last year. 
And then the other is obviously price. And the question is, will there continue to be an emergency declaration as we go through the fourth quarter of this year. So what we've tried to do is kind of triangulate and all those different variables, and that's why we give you the range of 33% to 38%, which I think is a good reasonable range for us to being with uncertainties that still exist."

Ralph, the only thing I guess I would add to that is that ranges are -- we don't disagree this year kind of wider than they would be in a normal year. and it just reflects the lack of visibility and the uncertainty that's ahead of us. Having said that, with the new guidance that we provided, we've not narrowed the ranges. So we've shrunk the range given that we have 6 months remaining, we give annual guidance. And more importantly, we've increased the call it, the midpoints of all the key financial metrics that we guide to, so reflecting the company's performance. 
So when you look at the midpoint of the range, as you would expect, that's kind of where we see things if we were to have to kind of put it in a point, but we then give the ranges around it because there's a lot of things that go on the positive or the negative side that could occur overall. 
And as Adam said, with regard specifically to the COVID testing, again, narrowing the range and improving it. But what we did see, which was the first time, which we didn't have when we gave our guidance last quarter was that we've seen a sequential decline in COVID testing each month as we've gone through the year, as Adam said, with June being lower than the average for the quarter. 
For July was the first month, frankly, that we've seen the level of COVID testing higher than the prior month. And so obviously, with the advent of the Delta virus, the advent of the extension of the public health emergency gives us reason to feel now better about where we are with COVID testing for this year than we did just a quarter ago, but still with a lot of uncertainty that's ahead of us."

No. I think from our standpoint and why we kind of focus on the 2019 comparison, just to kind of get back to more normalcy, if you will. We're still obviously seeing a strong recovery as we compare to 2020. 
But similarly, when we look at a comp relative to 2020, last year, we saw the trough really being early in the year with pandemic and then it got better throughout the year, but we continue to expect to see good growth and favorable margins year-on-year compared to '20. 
So really kind of taking a look back to '19. And to your point, Diagnostics has definitely has seasonality to the business. So when you look at sequentially, you really have to look at all of these where the days lay. So we do expect normal seasonal patterns to occur within Diagnostics, again, especially when you look at it relative to '19, more normal times. So from a -- call it, a margin standpoint, while we expect margins to be up year-on-year, we expect them to be flat to slightly down compared to 2019 because of the negative impact of PAMA. 
As far as just revenue growth, we feel good that the volume, again, revenues have been up even compared to '19, but we're seeing the volumes pick up. So volumes will be positive, which will be a continued trend pricing mix should start to come down from where it's been. Again, as volumes pick up to get back to that more normal pattern. But again, good growth expectations for the second half of this year from volume and from favorable mix. And obviously, as we go into '22, we expect that to continue."

I think there are all important questions as we go through the rest of this year into next year. I'll start with the serology first. 
At the moment, we have the ability to do as many serology tests as we would need to do. The CDC has not come out to recommend utilization of serology to try to understand titer. So therefore, not many people are going for serology tests, although we continue to do several thousands every day. but we're prepared to do as many as we may need, but we're also developing and have the ability to do T cell memory testing as well as semiquantitative testing, which ultimately might be helpful as you start to think about a titer that you might need to understand the waiting of effectiveness of vaccines over time. 
So what I would say is we are prepared for whatever might be necessary and we're building capacity to be ready for whatever that could be. My personal point of view is that I believe that serology testing over time will be more important, particularly if vaccination is not going to be every single year. 
It could be less or more than a year, and it could be different by individuals, then I think you're going to need significant serology testing. And that's why we continue to develop it. With regard to back-to-school, we're having a lot of discussions about back-to-school. 
We're prepared to do as many PCR testing as we may need for back-to-school, whether it be through individual tests or through pooling. But to be honest, they've really been discussions. We haven't seen a lot of schools willing to pull the trigger and say, we're going to put in a significant back-to-school testing program. 
So we're going to have to wait and see. And even though we're having a lot of discussions within the range that we provided of the down 33% to down 38%, and there's multiple different ways you can get there. One would be a lot of back-to-school testing but a lower price. 
Otherwise, would be not much back-to-school testing, but you could continue to have growth in other areas. And then the last thing I would say is it's too early to get the end of July. But as we look at the first couple of weeks of July, we're certainly starting to see numbers that are not yet there, but closer to the average that we have for the last quarter versus where we ended for the month of June."

But we would expect continued improvement there as we go through the year. 
I would say though, I would have thought it would be a little bit further than where it is, 80% right now. But the good news is the RFP flow is very strong. And we continue to see a significant number of RFPs. I think we have a good chance to win many of those, and it's a very healthy flow of the RFPs that we're getting. And just to give you a sense, I mean, we were really pleased with our 1.41 trailing 12-month book-to-bill. 
And if you look at that, I mean, you just kind of bring it to our backlog, but backlog was $14.3 billion, and that was an increase of $300 million from the first quarter. It was also a 21% increase year-over-year. If you look at our trailing 12 months net orders, they were almost $8 billion, and they were up almost 30% year-over-year. 
So with that performance and the continued RFPs that we're seeing, we believe that there's continued significant growth opportunities before us.

It's something that we're dealing with. I think we're doing a good job with it. But we're going to have to continue to find ways to reduce costs in other areas as we go through. 
And then the last thing I would say is if you -- you asked about COVID and the percent of our net orders, it's still relatively small. It's less than 3% of our backlog, and it's about 7.5% of our net orders over the past 4 quarters. So overall, it's small."

The one thing that's interesting, I mentioned before that we continue to keep the capacity that we have despite the fact that it impacts our margins to some degree. And part of the way we're able to do that is because of the emergency and the pricing that we're able to get for this test.

With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.
Additionally, we're making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2021 guidance and the related assumptions, including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition, our responses to and the expected future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business more generally as well as on general economic, business and market conditions. Each of the forward-looking statements is based upon current expectations and is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control that could affect our financial results. Some of these factors are set forth in detail in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter."

It's a pleasure to be with you this morning. We remain committed to using our extensive diagnostics and drug development capabilities to advance our mission of improving health and improving lives around the world. Innovation, technology and science remains at the forefront of all we do to benefit patients, providers and shareholders. 
To that end, the second quarter of 2021 was very strong across both Diagnostics and Drug Development. Revenue totaled $3.8 billion, a 39% increase from the same period in 2020. Much of this growth was driven by the continued strength in our base businesses. Adjusted EPS reached $6.13 versus $2.50 from the prior year. Free cash flow was $390 million in the quarter versus $272 million in 2020.
The strong performance in the quarter and the improved outlook for the year resulted in us raising full year guidance for revenue, EPS and cash flow. Glenn will review the new guidance with you in a moment. Our base business continued to recover and grew 51% and 32% for Diagnostics and Drug Development, respectively. The Drug Development trailing 12-month book-to-bill remained strong at 1.41. This performance was driven by patients and providers returning to routine health care checkups and pharmaceutical clients resuming their important research activities at an even faster pace than expected.
I'll now turn to the company's continued response to the pandemic. Our organization's collective strength and scale have allowed us to play a substantial role in the fight against COVID. Although much progress has been made, it is clear that there's still a lot of work to do in the U.S. and around the world.
Labcorp remains vigilant and stands ready to help wherever and however we can as we have since the earliest days of the pandemic. To date, Labcorp has performed over 50 million COVID tests. In the quarter, a steady decline in positive cases drove an overall decrease in COVID testing with an average of 54,000 PCR tests per day. The month of June was lower than the quarter average. However, testing started to increase again in recent weeks. We continue to monitor developments in the United States and around the world and are watching the Delta variant closely.
To support the CDC in tracking and monitoring the Delta and other variants, this quarter, we announced an extension to our contract to provide genetic sequencing from positive PCR test samples. It is difficult to predict exactly what COVID testing demand will look like for the remainder of the year as variants continues to spread and we enter the flu season. Therefore, we will maintain our ability to scale testing capacity quickly and expand access for communities and individuals in need. At the same time, our drug development teams continue to be involved in many studies on potential vaccines and treatment for COVID around the world.
Our new automated clinical trial kit production facility in Belgium is up and running, which will double our automated kit production capacity over time. This will allow us to better serve our pharmaceutical clients and study investigators in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Other COVID-related actions this quarter include the collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to raise awareness of monoclonal antibody therapies. And at state and local levels, we expanded notable partnerships in places like Massachusetts and North Carolina to facilitate mass vaccination programs and expand access to at-home test collections for underserved populations. In addition, we continued our collaboration with Walgreens. Pixel by LabCorp test kits are now available in 6,000 Walgreens stores and through on-demand delivery services like DoorDash and Instacart.
Importantly, our scientists use data available through our robust testing infrastructure to contribute to essential research. In the quarter, we released the results of one of the largest COVID-related studies of its time, which analyzed the tests of more than 39,000 patients. This offered useful detail on the body's reaction to natural infection as we work to learn more about the nature of the immuno response. We are also building upon our portfolio of serology testing, including semiquantitative analysis and T-cell memory. We remain proud of our significant contributions to extending the spread of COVID and in the development of treatments and vaccines, all of which are intended to assist people to safely go back to work and normal life activities.
Now I'll provide updates to our strategy. We are focused on leveraging our industry-leading positions to drive growth, enhance customer and patient experiences and advance science and health care. We seek to intensify customer focus and integrate data and digitalization across our business. As part of that objective, we announced plans to add a state-of-the-art bioanalytical laboratory in Singapore, expanding our global drug development offering and elevating our client experience through faster turnaround times in Asia. In the United States, we continued to improve our patients' experience in our service centers, focusing our efforts to create a seamless digital journey through appointment scheduling to result delivery. 
With an average of 3 million patients served in a given week, we are excited to enhance their experience using our digital channels. In the first half of the year, users of our website totaled $22 million, a 20% increase over last year. And adoption of our patient application is growing approximately 300,000 users per month. 
I'll now turn to oncology. We made significant strides for the quarter in oncology led by highly trained multidisciplinary team. We launched several new oncology tests, including OmniSeq INSIGHT, a pan-cancer tissue-based sequencing test for patients with advanced solid tumor cancers. The test specific to an individual's molecular and immune profile provides clinical decision support that helps medical professionals identify the most appropriate treatment options for a patient as well as to identify potential eligibility for clinical trials.
We also launched a companion diagnostic test to identify patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are eligible for a new treatment option developed by Amgen. This important test helps physicians identify patients who may benefit from the treatment promoting personalized precision medicine. Our work in oncology has created meaningful business relationships across the health care ecosystem that we will continue to enhance and grow. An important opportunity presented itself with OmniSeq, a long-time oncology partner and a pioneer in solid tumor profiling. As announced today, we recently exercised our option to acquire the remaining stake in the company. Adding OmniSeq enhances our integrated oncology platform, expanding Labcorp's extensive oncology diagnostics testing portfolio and opening the door to more patient participation in clinical trials.
We continue to concentrate on identifying and engaging in high-growth opportunities. We announced we are acquiring an autoimmune business unit from Myriad Genetics, including Vectra, rheumatoid arthritis assay. This will strengthen our position in RA, which the CDC predicts will impact roughly 25% of adults in the United States by 2040. Additionally, we agreed this week to acquire the outreach laboratory business of Minnesota-based North Memorial Health, and we'll provide management services to its inpatient lab. Our pipeline of acquisition and investment targets is robust, and we believe there are meaningful business development opportunities this year to enhance growth and our strategy moving forward.
Finally, I want to touch briefly on the Board and management team's ongoing review of Labcorp's structure and capital allocation strategy that we announced in March of this year. Working closely with our advisers, we are making progress to identify the best path forward to position Labcorp to unlock shareholder value while continuing to support our patients and customers around the world. Though we won't have further updates today, we look forward to sharing our conclusions once our review is complete. We expect to do so in the fourth quarter.
In conclusion, the quarter was strong across both Diagnostics and Drug Development businesses. Significant progress was achieved on our strategy and our mission to improve health and improve lives of people around the world, and we will continue to support efforts to stem COVID however we can. I am very optimistic about the future growth opportunities before us and our continued success. I want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their tireless efforts to help stem COVID while also retaining focus on our strategy and our underlying business. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Glenn to review more details of our second quarter performance."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. Revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, an increase of 38.7% over last year due to organic growth of 35.5%, acquisitions of 1.2% and favorable foreign currency translation of 200 basis points. Our organic base business increased 42.4% when compared to our base business last year, while COVID testing revenues of $444 million were flat with last year. 
Operating income for the quarter was $704 million or 18.3% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $92 million of amortization and $43 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $840 million or 21.9% of revenue compared to $381 million or 13.8% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to organic base business growth, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs.
During the second quarter, interest expense was $78 million, up from $53 million last year. The increase was due to onetime costs associated with the company's refinancing of $1 billion in senior notes that were due to mature in 2022, taking advantage of the historically low interest rate environment. Excluding these onetime costs, interest expense would have been down $7 million versus last year due to lower debt levels and interest rate. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 25.1% compared to 23.9% last year. The higher adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $467 million or $4.76 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.13 in the quarter, up from $2.57 last year.  
Operating cash flow was $487 million in the quarter compared to $371 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to favorable working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $97 million or 2.5% of revenue compared to $99 million or 3.6% of revenue last year. As a result, free cash flow was $390 million in the quarter compared to $272 million last year. During the quarter, we used $300 million of our cash flow for our share repurchase program. 
Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 39.7% compared to last year due to organic growth of 37.8%, acquisitions of 1.1% and favorable foreign exchange translation of 90 basis points. Organic base business growth was 51.2% compared to our base business last year, while COVID testing revenues were flat versus last year. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for the base business revenue was 4.5% primarily due to organic growth.  
Total volume increased 39.6% over last year primarily due to organic volume growth of 38.7%. The increase in organic volume was due to a 39.4% increase in the base business, partially offset by a reduction in COVID testing of 0.7%. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 3.3% to organic base business volume growth. Price/mix increased 0.1% over last year due to currency of 0.9%, COVID testing of 0.7% and acquisitions of 0.2%, partially offset by organic base business of minus 1.7% due to mix associated with the volume recovery. Of Diagnostics organic base business revenue growth of 51.2% compared to its base business last year, 48.2% was driven by volume, while 3.1% was from price mix, which was due to an increase in test per accession. 
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $663 million or 28% of revenue compared to $309 million or 18.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to organic base business demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, base business margins were down slightly due to the negative impact from PAMA. Diagnostics margins were down in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter due to lower COVID testing, while base business margins increased. Diagnostics 3-year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of this year.
Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 36.7% compared to last year due to organic growth of 31.8%, acquisitions of 1.3% and favorable foreign currency translation of 370 basis points. Drug Development delivered broad-based revenue growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for the base business revenue was approximately 15% primarily driven by organic growth. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $221 million or 14.8% of revenue compared to $113 million or 10.3% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margins were primarily due to organic base business demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, base business margins were up approximately 200 basis points. While second quarter margins this year were lower than first quarter, we expect our second half base business margins to be up versus the first half. We also expect our full year margins this year to be up over 2020, which was up over 2019. 
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.9 billion and 1.41, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14.3 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million from last quarter. We expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2021, for the full year. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong second quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year for both our Diagnostics and Drug Development base businesses. We expect enterprise-level revenue to grow 6.5% to 9% from prior guidance of 2% to 6.5%. This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 17% to 19%, while COVID testing is expected to be down 38% to down 33%. 
We are raising our expectations for revenue in Diagnostics to minus 1% to plus 2% from prior guidance of minus 5% to flat. This guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 15% to 17%, while COVID testing revenue is now expected to be down 38% to down 33%. We are also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 17% to 19% from prior guidance of 12% to 14%. Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 200 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will now grow 19% to 21%. Given the improved top line growth expectations of our base businesses, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $21.5 to $25, up from prior guidance of $20 to $24.
Free cash flow is now expected to be between $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Earnings guidance assumes we will use our free cash flow for acquisitions and share repurchases, which we expect to accelerate in the second half of the year. We expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% to 4% of revenue driven by investments to support base business growth and productivity. For additional comparison purposes, we have also included, in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website, a view of 2021 second quarter results and full year guidance compared to 2019 results.
In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our base business. As we progress through 2021, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline in the second half. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program.

So Covance had a very strong quarter again. And if you look at our Labcorp Drug Development business in total, we had progress in all parts of the Drug Development business, so all 3 grew strong into double digits. And as I look at the margins going forward, I've always said, be careful to look at any one quarter of the margin, especially as we're going through COVID. There are certain areas where we continue to maintain people. And when we maintain those people, we're doing it because we're going through COVID and we know we're going to need them for after COVID. So some of our margins look a little bit odd from quarter-to-quarter. 
We're also seeing a slight increase in material costs and in labor costs, which people are seeing in almost every industry, but we're going to continue to offset that with things like our LaunchPad initiatives. So I would look at the margin on a yearly basis. And we believe that this year will be better than last year, which was better than the year before. And I would expect, as we go into next year in our Drug Development business, the margins will look better than this year. So we're going to continue to find ways to expand our margins moving forward."

One is we continue to execute on our strategy, and we continue to do our capital allocation. And we've always said our allocation is focused on strategic acquisitions.

And then we said we're going to look to do more hospital regional, local laboratory acquisitions. And you saw one of those this quarter with what we announced we were doing with one of the hospitals in Minneapolis area -- Minnesota. So those are the types of acquisitions we're going to continue to do. What I would say is the pipeline is as robust as I've ever seen it. And frankly, I thought we'd have a couple more close this quarter, but I feel confident we will close more of those as we go through this year.
Separate and distinct from that, we continue to make progress on our strategic review, and we're going to do the strategic review. Once you reach the conclusions, we look forward to sharing those with you, and we expect to do that in the fourth quarter of this year. Glenn?"

Our targeted leverage has been the 2.5 to 3x and a couple of things are going. Obviously, we have the benefit of the COVID testing, which has generated and helped our free cash flow this year, which has helped improve it. But also, when you look at the improvement in our EBITDA because of COVID testing, it's higher than normal. So as you do look at our leverage relative to, call it, pre-pandemic using a pro forma 2019, you'd get that our leverage currently gross debt-to-EBITDA is towards the upper end of our range. 
Having said that, as Adam commented on, we expect to use our free cash flow this year for M&A and share repurchases. The midpoint of our range a little bit over $2 billion. We spent around $400 million so far in the first half of the year. So needless to say, it implies that the second half you'll see more capital allocation given to both share repurchases and M&A. We spoke to the strength of our M&A pipeline, which again gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to deploy more towards M&A than we've done in the first half, but we'll continue to use our share repurchase program as well."

When you look at Covance, though, to your point, sequentially, you move from kind of the first quarter to the second, margins were down, principally related to COVID testing was down within that segment, the level of COVID vaccine and therapeutic studies was down compared to the first quarter. We had higher pass-throughs in the second quarter versus the first and, obviously, the tight labor market also impacting it. 
So a lot of things that will impact a quarter-to-quarter kind of change. What we've commented on is that the second half margins within Drug Development, we expect to be higher than the first half.

Ricky, just -- maybe just a couple of follow-on comments because, as Adam said, we crossed over where our revenue in Diagnostics base business really in the fourth quarter of last year was favorable to 2019 levels, but that was driven off of the price mix. We were seeing more tests per accession that was making up for the volume shortfall. So June was a signal month for us, if you will, as we now have crossed over with volume now comparing favorably as well as price/mix continues to be higher than normal. But as we continue to progress through the rest of this year and, obviously going forward, expect those to fall more in line with kind of the historical patterns. 
To your comment on LaunchPad and really with the tight labor market in particular, but both businesses have LaunchPad initiatives. We completed the Drug Development one at least publicly last year and this year, we'll wrap up our Diagnostics business. But that's part of an ongoing business process improvement initiative of the company every single year. We know we have just high inflationary costs as we go in every year and launch pad is really set to offset, mitigate those rising costs. So continue to see a lot of opportunities to continue to drive productivity through technology, labor efficiency that will continue to help mitigate those costs going forward."

As we said, the average number of tests per day in the second quarter was 54,000. And if you look at the month of June, it actually was lower than the average of the 54,000. If you would have just trended based upon the June data, you would have been in the 35% to 50% reduction that we have been quoting for the beginning of the year in terms of tests. But we saw a slight change with the Delta variant, and we also saw the extension of the government saying that we're going to continue to be in an emergency situation. And those 2 things gave us confidence that the reduction in COVID tests would be less than what we originally had in the plan. And that's why we lowered and narrowed the guidance for COVID testing to 33% down to 38% down. So we really did narrow that and provide some additional guidance there. 
If you look at those numbers, I know it's still a fairly wide range going from 33% to 38%, but there's a lot of different ways that you can actually get there. One is by number of tests. And if you start to think about the variants and what we're seeing, will that continue, if you start to think about what could happen if there's a strong flu season or masks are mandated again in certain states, maybe the flu season will be very light like it was last year. And then the other is obviously price. And the question is, will there continue to be an emergency declaration as we go into the fourth quarter of this year? So what we've tried to do is kind of triangulate on all those different variables, and that's why we give you the range of 33% to 38%, which I think is a good reasonable range for us to be in with uncertainties that still exist."

Ralph, the only thing I guess I would add to that is that what ranges are, we disagree this year, kind of wider than they would be in a normal year and it just reflects the lack of visibility and the uncertainty that's ahead of us. Having said that, with the new guidance that we provided, we've not only narrowed the ranges. So we've shrunk the range given that we have 6 months remaining we give annual guidance. And more importantly, we've increased the, call it, the midpoints of all the key financial metrics that we guide to, so reflecting the company's performance. So when you look at the midpoint of the range, as you would expect, it's kind of where we see things if we were to have to kind of put in a point, but we then give the ranges around it because there's a lot of things that -- on the positive or the negative side that could occur overall. 
And as Adam said, with regard specifically to the COVID testing, again, narrowing the range and improving it. But what we did see, which was the first time, which we didn't have when we gave our guidance last quarter, was that we've seen a sequential decline in COVID testing each month as we've gone through the year, as Adam said, with June being lower than the average for the quarter. For July was the first month, frankly, that we've seen the level of COVID testing higher than the prior month. And so obviously, with the advent of the Delta virus, the advent of the extension of the public health emergency gives us reason to feel now better about where we are with COVID testing for this year than we did just a quarter ago, but still with a lot of uncertainty that's ahead of us."

So really kind of taking a look back to '19. And to your point, Diagnostics definitely has seasonality to the business. So when you look at sequentially, you really have to look at holidays and where the days lay. So we do expect normal seasonal patterns to occur within Diagnostics, again, especially when you look at it relative to '19 more normal times. So from, call it, a margin standpoint, while we expect margins to be up year-on-year, we expect them to be flat to slightly down compared to 2019 because of the negative impact of PAMA. As far as just revenue growth, we feel good that the volume -- again, revenues have been up even compared to '19, but we're seeing the volumes pick up. So volumes will be positive, which will be a continued trend, pricing/mix should start to come down from where it's been, again, as volumes pick up to get back to that more normal pattern. But again, good growth expectations for the second half of this year from volume and from favorable mix. And obviously, as we go into '22, we expect that to continue."

I think they're all important questions as we go through the rest of this year into next year. I'll start with the serology first. At the moment, we have the ability to do as many serology tests as we would need to do. The CDC has not come out to recommend utilization of serology to try to understand titer. So therefore, not many people are going for serology tests, although we continue to do several thousands every day. But we're prepared to do as many as we may need, but we're also developing and have the ability to do T-cell memory testing as well as semiquantitative testing, which ultimately might be helpful if you start to think about a titer that you might need to understand the waning of effectiveness of vaccines over time. So what I would say is we are prepared for whatever might be necessary, and we're building capacity to be ready for whatever that could be. My personal point of view is that I believe that serology testing over time will be more important, particularly if vaccination is not going to be every single year. If it could be less or more than a year and if it could be different by individuals, then I think you're going to need significant serology testing, and that's why we continue to develop it. 
With regard to back-to-school, we're having a lot of discussions about back-to-school. We're prepared to do as many PCR testing as we may need for back-to-school, whether it be through individual tests or through pooling. But to be honest, they've really been discussions. We haven't seen a lot of schools willing to pull the trigger and say, we're going to put in a significant back-to-school testing program. So we're going to have to wait and see. And even though we're having a lot of discussions, within the range that we provided of the down 33% to down 38%, there's multiple different ways you can get there. One would be a lot of back-to-school testing but a lower price. Other ways would be not much back-to-school testing, but you could continue to have growth in other areas. And then the last thing I would say is it's too early to get the end of July. But as we look at the first couple of weeks of July, we're certainly starting to see numbers that are not yet there, but closer to the average that we had the last quarter versus where we ended for the month of June."

I'll give you some additional context on the business. The first thing I would say is about 80% of sites are currently open, so we still have sites around the world that have not yet fully opened to allow us to go into help them enroll patients. But",358,"Sure. I'll give you some additional context on the business. The first thing I would say is about 80% of sites are currently open, so we still have sites around the world that have not yet fully opened to allow us to go into help them enroll patients. But we would expect continued improvement there as we go through the year. I would say though, I would have thought it would be a little bit further than where it is at the 80% right now. But the good news is the RFP flow is very strong, and we continue to see a significant number of RFPs. I think we have a good chance to win many of those, and it's a very healthy flow of the RFPs that we're getting. And just to give you a sense, I mean, we were really pleased with our 1.41 trailing 12-month book-to-bill. And if you look at that, I mean, you just kind of bring it to our backlog, our backlog was $14.3 billion, and that was an increase of $300 million from the first quarter. It was also a 21% increase year-over-year. If you look at our trailing 12-month net orders, they were almost $8 billion, and they were up almost 30% year-over-year. So with that performance and the continued RFPs that we're seeing, we believe that there's continued significant growth opportunities before us. 
And then, Glenn, I don't know if you want to talk any more about the labor costs that we're seeing, but we're seeing that and we're hearing that, not just in Drug Development but across different industries, Diagnostics, Drug Development. It's something that we're dealing with. I think we're doing a good job with it. But we're going to have to continue to find ways to reduce costs in other areas as we go through. And then the last thing I would say is if you -- you asked about COVID and the percent of our net orders, it's still relatively small. It's less than 3% of our backlog, and it's about 7.5% of our net orders over the past 4 quarters. So overall, it's small."

We continue to have a lot of discussions with our colleagues and payers. But having emergency declared is certainly a help and enables us to continue to provide the testing that we need. 
The one thing that's interesting, I mentioned before that we continue to keep the capacity that we have despite the fact that it impacts our margins to some degree. And part of the way we're able to do that is because of the emergency and the pricing that we're able to get for this test. If we were in a normal time period, we might have reduced certain things as we saw the total number of tests through the second quarter decline every month. I'm so glad we didn't do that because when all of a sudden there was a significant increase because of Delta variant, we were able to respond immediately. We kept our 1-day on average turnaround time, and we're going to continue to do that. But with the emergency declaration, the price certainly is helpful for us to be able to do that."

Okay. So I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and spending time with us. I mean it's clear that the second quarter was a very strong one across the enterprise and that enabled us to increase our full year guidance. I want to thank all of our dedicated employees around the world.

I would really encourage people to get vaccinated as quickly as possible if you're eligible and to face diligence and vigilance about the disease and the pandemic. We're all in this together.

This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. 
Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements.

In last quarter, we continue to leverage innovation, science and technology to accelerate our strategy as we work to improve health and improve lives around the world. We serve as a trusted source of health information that helps customers advance health care and guide medical decisions. At the same time, we've remained focused on helping them grow through the pandemic. 
In the third quarter, we delivered strong results. Revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted EPS reached $6.82 and free cash flow was $650 million. As a result of our strong performance and our improved outlook, we're raising full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Glenn will cover those in more detail in a few minutes. 
The Base Business for both diagnostics and drug development performed well with 10% and 22% growth, respectively. We saw consistent recovery across both businesses. 
In Diagnostics, we experienced broad geographic recovery in our Base Business and across our testing portfolio. Esoteric and routine testing demonstrated solid year-over-year growth for the quarter. The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill for drug development remains strong at 1.34. Drug development continues to recover with nearly 85% of sites now open. The business also saw decentralized trials increasing by more than 50% versus prior year. 
Now I'd like to turn our ongoing role in the pandemic response. Labcorp continues to support the fight against the pandemic in every way possible through both our diagnostic and our drug development capabilities. We experienced greater-than-anticipated COVID testing volumes in the quarter, although levels were below the same period last year. Time to results for COVID test remains an average of 1 to 2 days with results typically available within 1 day. PCR testing volume averaged $85,000 per day in the quarter, up from $54,000 per day in the second quarter. We averaged 114,000 tests per day in September with volumes declining week over week since that time. We will continue to break out come COVID testing from Base Business revenue and volume as it remains difficult to forecast. We will also continue to maintain high capacity levels to be prepared for potential future scenarios. 
We also had another successful quarter of bringing new innovations to market. Notably, we recently received emergency youth authorization for a combined COVID and flu-at-home collection kit. With flu season upon us, the kit offers a convenient way to test for both viruses. This new offering will be available for adults and children ages 2 and over and no upfront cost for those who meet clinical guidelines. 
In addition, we collaborated with AstraZeneca on both a COVID prevention and treatment trial of its new long-acting antibody combination. In the trial, the investigational antibody combination demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in preventive symptomatic COVID and in reducing severe COVID or death in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID, promising milestones in the development of new treatments. 
Also earlier this month, Merck filed for FDA emergency use authorization for its investigational oral antiviral medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate coded in at-risk adults, a treatment that we supported through Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. 
I'll now discuss progress on our strategy, and I'll start with oncology. The OmniSeq integration is going as planned, and their leading cancer diagnostic capabilities extend our portfolio of solutions in this area. Additionally, we launched [ Kunos ], the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer. As part of our efforts to address health equity health equity issues, we recently partnered with the community Clinical Oncology Research Network to assess social and economic impacts of cancer care disparities. And we also recently began work with Pillar Biosciences to enhance our next-generation sequencing and plan to offer a specialty oncology assay. 
During the quarter, we advanced our commitment to intensifying our customer focus and embedding technology and data throughout our business. We acquired Ovia Health, a leading digital platform trusted by millions of women for family planning, pregnancy and parenting support. Ovia Health extends our position as a go-to source for women's health insights through our deep expertise in diagnostic, genetic and specialty testing. 
Additionally, we are working with several organizations to begin deploying Labcorp diagnostic assistant, which delivers comprehensive lab results and clinical insights directly to the point of care. We're also using technology to improve health for low-income individuals and families. We partnered with medical home network to incorporate lab testing results into the records of Medicaid SafetyNet patients. 
And lastly, through a collaboration with Medidata, we are utilizing digital biomarkers with drug vaccine and device trials to enhance our decentralized clinical trialing offers. 
Pursuing opportunities with long-term high-growth potential remains a focus. Our recent acquisitions, including OmniSeq, Myriad's vector test for rheumatoid arthritis and Ovia Health, advance our position in key growth markets. We're making progress on our integrations, and we welcome new team members who joined Labcorp. Our M&A pipeline remains robust. We expect continued activity on this front for the balance of fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2022. 
Importantly, Labcorp continues to be recognized for the significant work we do. Just this month, we were named by Forbes as one of the world's best employers in 2021. In addition, Informa Pharma Intelligence selected Labcorp as a finalist for Best Contract Research Organization of the Year. These recognitions are only possible, thanks to our diverse and talented workforce, which is at the core of our ability to innovate. 
Lastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on the Board and management team's ongoing assessment of the company's structure and capital allocation strategy. We remain committed to ensuring Labcorp is best positioned to unlock shareholder value while offering patients and customers the support that they've come to expect. Working closely with our advisers, we have made significant progress on assessing both our capital allocation and our structure. And as previously shared, we expect to update you on our conclusions in this quarter. 
To summarize, our Base Business in both Diagnostics and Drug Development had a strong third quarter and is well positioned for continued success. We remain dedicated to the fight against COVID, all while delivering on our strategy and carrying out our mission. I'm excited by the progress we've made and for what lies ahead. 
With that, Glenn will take you through the details of our third quarter results."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year due to organic growth of 3.4%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 50 basis points. The 3.4% increase in organic revenue is driven by a 10.2% increase in the company's Organic Base business. partially offset by a 6.8% decrease in COVID testing. 
Operating income for the quarter was $767 million or 18.9% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $92 million of amortization and $48 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $907 million or 22.3% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 29.7% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased base business demand and a tight labor market as the company continues to invest in its workforce. Partially offsetting these headwinds were the benefit from organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. 
The tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%. The adjusted tax rate excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization was 24.4% compared to 25.7% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Net earnings for the quarter were $587 million or $6.05 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.82 in the quarter, down from $8.41 last year. 
Operating cash flow was $767 million in the quarter compared to $786 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million or 2.9% of revenue compared to $77 million or 2% of revenue last year. As a result, free cash flow was $650 million in the quarter compared to $709 million last year. During the quarter, we used $300 million of our cash flow for our share repurchase program and invested $292 million on acquisitions. 
Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 3.2% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 3.9%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 30 basis points. The decrease in organic revenue was due to a 9.7% reduction from COVID testing, partially offset by a 5.8% increase in the Base Business. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.7%, primarily due to organic growth. 
Total volume increased 0.2% over last year as acquisition volume contributed 0.2% and organic volume decreased by 0.1%. The decrease in organic volume was due to a 5.9% decrease in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5.9% increase in the Base Business. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 1.1% to our organic Base Business volume growth. 
Price/mix decreased 3.4% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 3.8%, partially offset by currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%. Diagnostics organic Base Business revenue growth was 9% compared to its Base Business last year with 7.7% coming from volume and 1.3% coming from price/mix, which was primarily due to an increase in test per recession. 
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $775 million or 29.6% of revenue compared to $1 billion or 37.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction of COVID testing and higher personnel costs, partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, Base Business margins were down slightly due to the negative impact from PAMA. Diagnostics 3-year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of this year. 
Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 17.5% compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth of 19.9%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. This was partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its central lab business of 3.5% and divestitures of 0.3%. Drug Development Base Business benefited from broad-based growth across all businesses, included COVID vaccine and therapeutic work. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 11.4%, primarily driven by organic growth. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $226 million or 15.5% of revenue compared to $210 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by lower COVID testing and higher personnel costs. The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to lower COVID testing. Excluding the impact from COVID testing, operating margins would have been up compared to last year. 
For comparability to peers, Drug Development earnings exclude $36 million of expense related to the enterprise component of its bonus, which is included in unallocated corporate expense. We expect full year margins to be up over 2020, which were up over 2019, 
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.8 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively. During the quarter, orders were negatively impacted by approximately $150 million due to a significant scope change, which decreased the book-to-bill. 
Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14.4 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to last year. We expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. 
Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2021, for the remainder of the year. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong third quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect enterprise revenue to grow 13% to 14% from prior guidance of 6.5% to 9%. This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 18.5% to 19.5%, while COVID testing is expected to be down 11% to down 6%. 
We are raising our expectations for revenue to grow in Diagnostics by 8% to 10% from prior guidance of minus 1% to plus 2%. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 16% to 17%, while COVID testing revenue is expected to be down 11% to down 6%. 
We're also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 19.5% to 20.5% from prior guidance of 17% to 19%. Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 170 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 21.5% to 22.5%. 
Given the improved top line growth expectations, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $26 to $28, up from prior guidance of $21.5 to $25. Free cash flow is now expected to be between $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion. 
For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 third quarter results and full year guidance compared to 2019 results. 
In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our base business. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the remainder of the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase programs.

One is we kept our headcount at a level that is higher than we typically would to ensure that we're prepared for whatever scenario could occur with COVID. And by the way, I'm glad we did that. If you would have gone back to the second quarter where we averaged 55,000 PCR tests, there was good reason to say we should reduce headcount because we saw tests going down. We didn't do that. And then when the test came to 110,000 or so per day in the month of September, we still had a 1-day turnaround time for the majority of tests. So we're going to continue to keep our labor costs a bit higher based upon number of people to ensure that we're prepared for any scenario. And that's for both Diagnostics and Drug Development. I said Drug Development continues to rebound. 85% of sites are now open, but that still means 15% of sites are not open. We're continuing to keep that headcount because these people are hard to retain, they're hard to train and we believe the business will come back. 
Separate and distinct from that, we are seeing impacts in certain materials and people-related costs, and we're seeing that through the supply chain constraints but also a very tight labor market. I don't think it's any different than what our peers are seeing. Everybody is seeing the same thing. So we're focused on maintaining our operational continuity, and we're going to continue to look for ways to reduce expenses. Now the increased material costs and increased labor cross situ very quickly. It takes us time to take out the expenses, but we're going to continue to find ways, to find efficiencies and reduce costs wherever we can to offset those things. 
I think the biggest factor, again, going to 2022 is what happens with COVID and COVID testing. And when we provide guidance, we're going to break out the guidance for COVID testing like we did this year so that we can give you a range of possibilities, and then we'll also give you what we believe the range of opportunities would be for the Base Business. 
And then the last thing I would say is we also are working on our capital allocation and that we are doing -- continuing to do M&A, and we have a significant pipeline as we go into next year. I'm very excited about the pipeline of M&A that we have, and we'll continue to do share repos where appropriate. So hopefully, that gives you some kind of context of how we're thinking about next year. I think that we have good momentum as we go into the year."

And I've said time and time again, I wouldn't too much into one quarter. I look at the trailing 12 months because it gives you a better understanding over time. And with book-to-bill, it could be lumpy. So you could fall in one quarter this year and fall out into a different quarter versus next year. So the quarterly tried to watch carefully, obviously, but I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from one quarter versus another. 
What I look at is the RFPs, which continue to be very strong, and we continue to do very well as we go through the RFPs. So if you look at the trailing 12-month net orders, they were $7.8 billion. They were up 27% year-over-year. And if you look at the backlog, it was $14.4 billion. That increased by over $100 million in the second quarter, and that was up 15% year-over-year. I think there's still strength there that you can see. But again, I focus on the trailing 12 months and I think above 1.2 is where you want to be.

And Jack, in our remarks, we talked about this change in scope that we had that was $150 million that obviously negatively impacted the quarter. So as Adam said, when you put it in the perspective of the trailing 12 months, it gets kind of rounded out, if you will. We still have strong levels of backlog, strong levels of orders. To your point, while our orders on a trailing 12 would have been up around 27% year-on-year, including the scope change for the quarter, we would have been down slightly, down around 4%. 
However, what's interesting is that we actually received the order in the third quarter of a year ago. So it really has kind of a double effect. If you back it out of the year that we received it, the third quarter, and you take it out of now the change from the third quarter of this, would actually would have been up around 13% in orders, excluding it for the quarter. So it still reinforces, frankly, from our perspective, why we really focus on the trailing 12 because even with the volatility, you really get a sense of the true growth and the future potential of the business."

I've said before, those sometimes take longer than I would expect, but the good news is that we continue to have a very strong pipeline, and I'm confident that we're going to have some really interesting things that we can do with regard to those types of acquisitions. 
Then we look for strategic acquisitions, and those can be something like Ovia, where it's a digital platform that enhances our capabilities and technology and digitalization, but it's also in a very important high-growth market where we have a very strong share in women's health. 
And then you look at things that we've done before, like Snap IoT or Global Care, where it gives us strategic capabilities in drug development. I mentioned that the decentralized clinical trials that we're doing were 50% higher year-over-year, and we're going to need more capabilities and more technology in areas like that. So I kind of separate it into 3 buckets. The diagnostic laboratory acquisition opportunities, then the strategic opportunities for both diagnostics and for drug development, and we've got multiple different things that we're looking at in each of those areas."

I also think that with COVID, they've realized they had to update a lot of their machinery in order to do the COVID testing if they want to do it in a hospital. They had to take a look at how they were using their capital. And they realized that running their laboratory might not be core to what they do every day, and they probably would do better if they had another surgical operating suite or put their money towards something like that versus updating laboratory equipment. 
So as we have more and more discussions with the hospitals and hospital systems and local laboratories, I think the realization that Diagnostics does take capital. In order to have the right machinery, you have to run that machinery often to get the best output and margins through running that type of equipment, and that we can do it extraordinarily well for them. So I think all 3 of those things have led to us having a more robust pipeline now than I've seen in the past."

I'd be very careful comparing versus 2020 or 2021 because the base business was recovering, the COVID testing was different. For example, as we saw COVID testing grow significantly in September, we saw an impact on the base business in September. It was slightly less than August. Now we see COVID tested less for the first couple of weeks of October. We've seen the base business now nearly flat to where it was in 2019. So using 2020, 2021, so you have to be really thoughtful and careful with that. I use 2019 as the baseline to figure out where we should kind of get from a normalized perspective as we look at next year.

What's interesting and unique, and I think a little bit to your question within the Diagnostics business, is that we're keeping our revenues at the same level of growth compared to '19, but we're doing it through price/mix because effectively, our volume levels have been plus or minus relatively flat to '19. So as we go forward, obviously, we would expect volume to continue to tick up and go above '19 levels. But obviously, we see a corresponding decline, if you will, in test or price/mix, which has been driven by test per session that have been higher than normal given people have had fewer visits.

So I just believe that as an organization, we have to continually pressure your cost base, and you have to continually find ways to take out cost.

And other certain areas within our business where we may be able to, of course, we'll look at that. And if there are opportunities, we would work on those opportunities, but I don't think that's something you should put in your base case. In your base case, I think it has to be how do you have cost reduction initiatives that continue to have the quality that you need, that continue to enable you to retain the people that you have, but also that you can do it more efficiently. So as we go forward, we're going to continue to really find ways to reduce our cost base."

I'd imagine 4 would be lower than that, but I'm not sure if you have some baseline or and sort of at least figure per day? And then just what about reimbursement for next year as you think about sort of COVID and PHE?

We have a great relationship with the vast majority of the telehealth providers. And in fact, we work with them. And technologically, we have most of them where they can be directly working with us through their electronic medical records. So we embrace telehealth medicine. We think that it's good for health care where it makes sense. And we'll continue to work to ensure that as people get telemedicine, they can also get the appropriate diagnostic testing. And we have a team that is focused on ensuring that we have those relationships and that they work smoothly. 
With regard to COVID testing, I want to get through this year and see where we end up, and we will provide guidance next year, and it will be a range of potential. It really comes down to a couple of things. Will there be another variant that is not as manageable with the current vaccines? Will you need a different booster in the future? Will antibody testing become more important in order to know if and when people should get vaccines? So I don't want to give numbers for next year. I want to get through this year and see how it plays out. We gave a range between 50,000 and 70,000 tests per day this year. 
I also want to see flu season because if you have a high flu season, I believe you'll probably see more COVID testing to the work that we do. Because if somebody is not sure if they have flu or COVID, I think they're going to want to come to us and get an answer as quickly as they can. And we have the at-home collection kit, but also physicians can prescribe a diagnostic test to look at both of those, and our turnaround time is very good. So let's see how this year plays out. Let's see what happens with the flu season. And then when we give guidance for next year, we'll give you an appropriate range."

It's what was the demand going to be and what was the reimbursement going to be. And then obviously, as we kept to see the public health emergency continuing to expand, the pricing kind of that held out. So as we tighten the range, if you will, especially with the fourth quarter, as Adam said, we have a range of testing that we feel as best as we can. Here's a range that we think will happen but with an assumption that pricing will hold. As we think about '22, and again, we'll give you our best guess at that time, but I think it's fair to assume you're going to see a fairly wide range starting out the year because you go back to the uncertainty with regard to both volume and pricing. And again, we'll wait and see and update it, which is, again, to Adam's point earlier, that we'll continue to break out COVID testing separate from the base business so you can see the impact of both."

So the view would be that long term, that's where we'll gravitate to. Obviously, we continue to add new innovative tests that could skew it hopefully upwards. Obviously, we would add acquisitions to the mix that would skew it upwards. But just the organic base business trends, you would expect to see that. So it wasn't surprising that our revenues right now is still tracking at or slightly higher compared to '19 from a revenue standpoint, but we're seeing just an unusually high level of price/mix than what we would normally expect to see, call it, in a normal environment."

It's much less of the surveillance. A lot of the surveillance work is being done by the other types of tests out there in the marketplace. 
So as we look to next year, we'll continue to make the service available. We do more of that through our Labcorp employee services group than we do through the core Labcorp Diagnostics business when it comes to surveillance. But of course, if there are opportunities out there, we are ready to help with those and serving those, but it's not a significant amount of the testing that we do today."

At Labcorp, we continue to leverage innovation, science and technology to accelerate our strategy as we work to improve health and improve lives around the world. We serve as a trusted source of health information that helps customers advance health care and guide medical decisions. At the same time, we've remained focused on helping the world through the pandemic.
In the third quarter, we delivered strong results. Revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted EPS reached $6.82, and free cash flow was $650 million. As a result of our strong performance and our improved outlook, we're raising full year guidance for revenue, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Glenn will cover those in more detail in a few minutes.
The Base Business for both Diagnostics and Drug Development performed well with 10% and 22% growth, respectively. We saw consistent recovery across both businesses.
In Diagnostics, we experienced broad geographic recovery in our Base Business and across our testing portfolio. Esoteric and routine testing demonstrated solid year-over-year growth for the quarter.
The trailing 12-month net book-to-bill for Drug Development remains strong at 1.34. Drug Development continues to recover with nearly 85% of sites now open. The business also saw decentralized trials increasing by more than 50% versus prior year.
Now I'd like to turn to our ongoing role in the pandemic response. Labcorp continues to support the fight against the pandemic in every way possible through both our diagnostic and our drug development capabilities. We experienced greater-than-anticipated COVID testing volumes in the quarter, although levels were below the same period last year. Time to results for COVID test remains an average of 1 to 2 days, with results typically available within 1 day. PCR testing volume averaged 85,000 per day in the quarter, up from 54,000 per day in the second quarter. We averaged 114,000 tests per day in September, with volumes declining week-over-week since that time. We will continue to break out COVID testing from Base Business revenue and volume as it remains difficult to forecast. We will also continue to maintain high capacity levels to be prepared for potential future scenarios.
We also had another successful quarter of bringing new innovations to market. Notably, we recently received Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu-at-home collection kit. With flu season upon us, the kit offers a convenient way to test for both viruses. This new offering will be available for adults and children ages 2 and over and no upfront cost for those who meet clinical guidelines.
In addition, we collaborated with AstraZeneca on both a COVID prevention and treatment trial of its new long-acting antibody combination. In the trial, the investigational antibody combination demonstrated statistically significant benefit in preventing symptomatic COVID and in reducing severe COVID or death in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID, promising milestones in the development of new treatments.
Also earlier this month, Merck filed for FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its investigational oral antiviral medicine for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID in at-risk adults, a treatment that we supported through Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials.
I'll now discuss progress on our strategy, and I'll start with oncology. The OmniSeq integration is going as planned, and their leading pan-cancer diagnostic capabilities extend our portfolio of solutions in this area. Additionally, we launched clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer.
As part of our efforts to address healthy equity -- health equity issues, we recently partnered with the Community Clinical Oncology Research Network to assess social and economic impacts of cancer care disparities. And we also recently began work with Pillar Biosciences to enhance our next-generation sequencing and plan to offer a specialty oncology assay.
During the quarter, we advanced our commitment to intensifying our customer focus and embedding technology and data throughout our business. We acquired Ovia Health, a leading digital platform trusted by millions of women for family planning, pregnancy and parenting support. Ovia Health extends our position as a go-to source for women's health insights through our deep expertise in diagnostic, genetic and specialty testing.
Additionally, we are working with several organizations to begin deploying Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant, which delivers comprehensive lab results and clinical insights directly to the point of care. We're also using technology to improve health for low-income individuals and families. We partnered with Medical Home Network to incorporate lab testing results into the records of Medicaid safety net patients. And lastly, through a collaboration with Medidata, we are utilizing digital biomarkers with drug, vaccine and device trials to enhance our decentralized clinical trialing offers.
Pursuing opportunities with long-term, high-growth potential remains a focus. Our recent acquisitions, including OmniSeq, Myriad's Vectra test for rheumatoid arthritis and Ovia Health advance our position in key growth markets. We're making progress on our integrations, and we welcome new team members who joined Labcorp.
Our M&A pipeline remains robust. We expect continued activity on this front for the balance of fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2022.
Importantly, Labcorp continues to be recognized for the significant work we do. Just this month, we were named by Forbes as one of the world's best employers in 2021. In addition, Informa Pharma Intelligence selected Labcorp as a finalist for Best Contract Research Organization of the Year. These recognitions are only possible thanks to our diverse and talented workforce, which is at the core of our ability to innovate.
Lastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on the Board and management team's ongoing assessment of the company's structure and capital allocation strategy. We remain committed to ensuring Labcorp is best positioned to unlock shareholder value while offering patients and customers the support that they've come to expect. Working closely with our advisers, we have made significant progress on assessing both our capital allocation and our structure. And as previously shared, we expect to update you on our conclusions in this quarter.
To summarize, our Base Business in both Diagnostics and Drug Development had a strong third quarter and is well positioned for continued success. We remain dedicated to the fight against COVID, all while delivering on our strategy and carrying out our mission. I'm excited by the progress we've made and for what lies ahead.
With that, Glenn will take you through the details of our third quarter results."

I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance.
Revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of 4.3% over last year due to organic growth of 3.4%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 50 basis points. The 3.4% increase in organic revenue is driven by a 10.2% increase in the company's organic Base business partially offset by a 6.8% decrease in COVID testing.
Operating income for the quarter was $767 million or 18.9% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $92 million of amortization and $48 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $907 million or 22.3% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 29.7% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased Base Business demand and a tight labor market as the company continues to invest in its workforce. Partially offsetting these headwinds were the benefit from organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings.
The tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.4% compared to 25.7% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%.
Net earnings for the quarter were $587 million or $6.05 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.82 in the quarter, down from $8.41 last year.
Operating cash flow was $767 million in the quarter compared to $786 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings partially offset by favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million or 2.9% of revenue compared to $77 million or 2% of revenue last year. As a result, free cash flow was $650 million in the quarter compared to $709 million last year. During the quarter, we used $300 million of our cash flow for our share repurchase program and invested $292 million on acquisitions.
Now I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 3.2% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 3.9%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 30 basis points. The decrease in organic revenue was due to a 9.7% reduction from COVID testing partially offset by a 5.8% increase in the Base Business. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.7%, primarily due to organic growth.
Total volume increased 0.2% over last year as acquisition volume contributed 0.2% and organic volume decreased by 0.1%. The decrease in organic volume was due to a 5.9% decrease in COVID testing partially offset by a 5.9% increase in the Base Business. As a reminder, we do not include hospital lab management agreements in our volume, which would have added approximately 1.1% to our organic Base Business volume growth.
Price/mix decreased 3.4% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 3.8% partially offset by currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%. Diagnostics organic Base Business revenue growth was 9% compared to its Base Business last year, with 7.7% coming from volume and 1.3% coming from price/mix, which was primarily due to an increase in test per session.
Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $775 million or 29.6% of revenue compared to $1 billion or 37.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction of COVID testing and higher personnel costs partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, Base Business margins were down slightly due to the negative impact from PAMA. Diagnostics 3-year LaunchPad initiative remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings by the end of this year.
Now I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 17.5% compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth of 19.9%, acquisitions of 0.4% and favorable foreign currency translation of 100 basis points. This was partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its central lab business of 3.5% and divestitures of 0.3%. Drug Development's Base Business benefited from broad-based growth across all businesses, including COVID vaccine and therapeutic work. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 11.4% primarily driven by organic growth.
Adjusted operating income for the segment was $226 million or 15.5% of revenue compared to $210 million or 16.9% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings partially offset by lower COVID testing and higher personnel costs. The decline in adjusted operating margin was due to lower COVID testing. Excluding the impact from COVID testing, operating margins would have been up compared to last year.
For comparability to peers, Drug Development earnings exclude $36 million of expense related to the enterprise component of its bonus, which is included in unallocated corporate expense. We expect full year margins to be up over 2020, which were up over 2019.
For the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.8 billion and 1.34, respectively. During the quarter, orders were negatively impacted by approximately $150 million due to a significant scope change, which decreased the book-to-bill.
Backlog at the end of the quarter was $14.4 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to last year. We expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.
Now I'll discuss our 2021 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2021, for the remainder of the year. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect the company's strong third quarter performance and improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect enterprise revenue to grow 13% to 14% from prior guidance of 6.5% to 9%. This includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 90 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 18.5% to 19.5%, while COVID testing is expected to be down 11% to down 6%.
We are raising our expectations for revenue to grow in Diagnostics by 8% to 10% from prior guidance of minus 1% to plus 2%. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 16% to 17%, while COVID testing revenue is expected to be down 11% to down 6%.
We're also raising our growth expectations for revenue in Drug Development to 19.5% to 20.5% from prior guidance of 17% to 19%. Our current guidance includes the benefit from foreign currency translation of 170 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 21.5% to 22.5%.
Given the improved top line growth expectations, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $26 to $28, up from prior guidance of $21.5 to $25. Free cash flow is now expected to be between $2.45 billion to $2.6 billion, up from prior guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.15 billion.
For additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 third quarter results and full year guidance compared to 2019 results.
In summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our Base Business. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the remainder of the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase programs.
Operator, we will now take questions."

First of all, the Base Business for both Drug Development",558,"Sure. Ann, again, we're not, as you said, providing guidance for 2022, but as I look at 2022, I think there are things that you've seen this quarter that you can kind of start to think about 2022. First of all, the Base Business for both Drug Development and Diagnostics is rebounding well. And if you look even for the first couple of weeks of October, that rebounded from where we were even in September. So we would expect the Base Business to continue to improve.
At the same time, we've said before, we actually have several things that we're looking at when it comes to cost. One is we kept our headcount at a level that is higher than we typically would to ensure that we're prepared for whatever scenario could occur with COVID. And by the way, I'm glad we did that. If you would have gone back to the second quarter where we averaged 55,000 PCR tests, there was good reason to say we should reduce headcount because we saw tests going down. We didn't do that. And then when the tests came to 110,000 or so per day in the month of September, we still had a 1-day turnaround time for the majority of tests. So we're going to continue to keep our labor costs a bit higher based upon number of people to ensure that we're prepared for any scenario.
And that's for both Diagnostics and Drug Development. I said Drug Development continues to rebound. 85% of sites are now open, but that still means 15% of sites are not open. We're continuing to keep that headcount because these people are hard to retain, they're hard to train, and we believe the business will come back.
Separate and distinct from that, we are seeing impacts in certain materials and people-related costs, and we're seeing that through the supply chain constraints but also a very tight labor market. I don't think it's any different than what our peers are seeing. Everybody is seeing the same thing. So we're focused on maintaining our operational continuity, and we're going to continue to look for ways to reduce expenses. Now the increased material costs and increased labor costs, if you -- very quickly, it takes us time to take out the expenses, but we're going to continue to find ways, to find efficiencies and reduce costs wherever we can to offset those things.
I think the biggest factor, again, going to 2022 is what happens with COVID and COVID testing. And when we provide guidance, we're going to break out the guidance for COVID testing like we did this year so that we can give you a range of possibilities, and then we'll also give you what we believe the range of opportunities would be for the Base Business.
And then the last thing I would say is we also are working on our capital allocation and that we are doing -- continuing to do M&A, and we have a significant pipeline as we go into next year. I'm very excited about the pipeline of M&A that we have, and we'll continue to do share repos where appropriate. So hopefully, that gives you some kind of context of how we're thinking about next year. I think that we have good momentum as we go into the year."

So we still have a strong book-to-bill, it was 1.34, and we've always said that a 1.2 or above gets you high single -- mid- to high single-digit growth. So anything above a 1.2, we think, is a very strong book-to-bill.
And I've said time and time again, I wouldn't read too much into one quarter. I look at the trailing 12 months because it gives you a better understanding over time. And with book-to-bill, it could be lumpy. So you could fall in one quarter this year and fall out into a different quarter versus next year. So the quarterly, we try to watch carefully, obviously, but I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from one quarter versus another.
What I look at is the RFPs, which continue to be very strong, and we continue to do very well as we go through the RFPs. So if you look at the trailing 12-month net orders, they were $7.8 billion. They were up 27% year-over-year. And if you look at the backlog, it was $14.4 billion. That increased by over $100 million in the second quarter, and that was up 15% year-over-year. So I think there's still strength there that you can see. But again, I focus on the trailing 12 month and I think above 1.2 is where you want to be.

And Jack, in our remarks, we talked about this change in scope that we had that was $150 million that obviously negatively impacted the quarter. So as Adam said, when you put it in the perspective of the trailing 12 months, it gets kind of rounded out, if you will. We still have strong levels of backlog, strong levels of orders. To your point, while our orders on a trailing 12 would have been up around 27% year-on-year, including the scope change for the quarter, we would have been down slightly, down around 4%.
However, what's interesting is that we actually received the order in the third quarter of a year ago. So it really has kind of a double effect. If you back it out of the year that we received it, the third quarter, and you take it out of now the change from the third quarter of this, would actually would have been up around 13% in orders, excluding it for the quarter. So it still reinforces, frankly, from our perspective, why we really focus on the trailing 12 because even with the volatility, you really get a sense of the true growth and the future potential of the business."

I've said before, those sometimes take longer than I would expect, but the good news is that we continue to have a very strong pipeline, and I'm confident that we're going to have some really interesting things that we can do with regard to those types of acquisitions.
Then we look for strategic acquisitions, and those can be something like Ovia, where it's a digital platform that enhances our capabilities in technology and digitalization, but it's also in a very important high-growth market where we have a very strong share in women's health. And then you look at things that we've done before, like SnapIOT or GlobalCare, where it gives us strategic capabilities in drug development.
I mentioned that the decentralized clinical trials that we're doing were 50% higher year-over-year, and we're going to need more capabilities and more technology in areas like that. So I kind of separate it into 3 buckets. The diagnostic laboratory acquisition opportunities, then the strategic opportunities for both diagnostics and for drug development, and we've got multiple different things that we're looking at in each of those areas."

I also think that with COVID, they've realized they had to update a lot of their machinery in order to do the COVID testing if they want to do it in a hospital. They had to take a look at how they were using their capital. And they realized that running their laboratory might not be core to what they do every day, and they probably would do better if they had another surgical operating suite or put their money towards something like that versus updating laboratory equipment.
So as we have more and more discussions with the hospitals and hospital systems and local laboratories, I think the realization is that: diagnostics does take capital; in order to have the right machinery, you have to run that machinery often to get the best output and margins through running that type of equipment; and that we can do it extraordinarily well for them. So I think all 3 of those things have led to us having a more robust pipeline now than what I've seen in the past."

And then I look at what the growth would have been if everything was normalized. And that's kind of just how I think about how to grow the Base Business as we move into the future.
I'd be very careful comparing versus 2020 or 2021 because the Base Business was recovering, the COVID testing was different. For example, as we saw COVID testing grow significantly in September, we saw an impact on the Base Business in September. It was slightly less than August. Now we see COVID tested less for the first couple of weeks of October. We've seen the Base Business now nearly flat to where it was in 2019.
So using 2020, 2021, I'd say you have to be really thoughtful and careful with that. I use 2019 as the baseline to figure out where we should kind of get from a normalized perspective as we look at next year.
And then with regard to long-term guidance, we're looking at everything as we go through the strategic review, and we're discussing all options for structure as well as capital allocation and how we communicate those things.

What's interesting and unique, and I think a little bit to your question within the Diagnostics business, is that we're keeping our revenues at the same level of growth compared to '19, but we're doing it through price/mix because effectively, our volume levels have been plus or minus relatively flat to '19. So as we go forward, obviously, we would expect volume to continue to tick up and go above '19 levels but obviously, see a corresponding decline, if you will, in tests or price/mix, which has been driven by tests per session that have been higher than normal given people have had fewer visits.

But if you look at the total trials that we do, it's still less than 10% of the total trials that have that type of component. So it just shows that as we move forward, having those skills and capabilities are obviously going to be more important. And that's why the acquisitions that we made last year, like GlobalCare and SnapIOT, were so important. We were able to get ahead of where we knew the market or believe the market was going to end up."

If you look at our guidance, we think it will be somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000 per day as we look at the fourth quarter and where we are currently, and I think that's a kind of pretty good range for you to work within."

We have a great relationship with the vast majority of the telehealth providers. And in fact, we work with them. And technologically, we have most of them where they can be directly working with us through their electronic medical records. So we embrace telemedicine. We think that it's good for health care where it makes sense. And we'll continue to work to ensure that as people get telemedicine, they can also get the appropriate diagnostic testing. And we have a team that is focused on ensuring that we have those relationships and that they work smoothly.
With regard to COVID testing, I want to get through this year and see where we end up, and we will provide guidance next year, and it will be a range of potential. It really comes down to a couple of things. Will there be another variant that is not as manageable with the current vaccines? Will you need a different booster in the future? Will antibody testing become more important in order to know if and when people should get vaccines? So I don't want to give numbers for next year. I want to get through this year and see how it plays out. We gave a range, between 50,000 and 70,000 tests per day this year.
I also want to see flu season because if you have a high flu season, I believe you'll probably see more COVID testing to the work that we do. Because if somebody is not sure if they have flu or COVID, I think they're going to want to come to us and get an answer as quickly as they can. And we have the at-home collection kit, but also physicians can prescribe a diagnostic test to look at both of those, and our turnaround time is very good. So let's see how this year plays out. Let's see what happens with the flu season. And then when we give guidance for next year, we'll give you an appropriate range."

It's what was the demand going to be and what was the reimbursement going to be. And then obviously, as we kept to see the public health emergency continuing to expand, the pricing kind of just held out. So as we tighten the range, if you will, especially with the fourth quarter, as Adam said, we have a range of testing that we feel as best as we can. Here's a range that we think will happen but with an assumption that pricing will hold.
As we think about '22, and again, we'll give you our best guess at that time, but I think it's fair to assume you're going to see a fairly wide range starting out the year because you go back to the uncertainty with regard to both volume and pricing. And again, we'll wait and see and update it, which is, again, to Adam's point earlier, that we'll continue to break out COVID testing separate from the Base Business so you can see the impact of both."

So the view would be that long term, that's where we'll gravitate to. Obviously, we continue to add new innovative tests that could skew it hopefully upward. Obviously, we would add acquisitions to the mix that would skew it upwards. But just the organic Base Business trends, you would expect to see that. So it wasn't surprising that our revenues right now is still tracking at or slightly higher compared to '19 from a revenue standpoint, but we're seeing just an unusually high level of price/mix than what we would normally expect to see, call it, in a normal environment."
