Good morning. We're going to start off on Slide #3. We had very, very strong free cash flow generation of approximately $300 million, driven by strong production, low CapEx due to continued efficiency improvements from the operational",1084,"Thank you, Neal. Good morning. 
We're going to start off on Slide #3. 
We had very, very strong free cash flow generation of approximately $300 million, driven by strong production, low CapEx due to continued efficiency improvements from the operational teams at all levels. We're announcing our formalized long-term variable dividend structure, which we have several slides. We'll be returning up to 75% of post based dividend free cash flow to shareholders, and we'll give you some examples later on, significantly improving return of capital to shareholders. 
We'll generate significant free cash flow generation of approximately $2 billion expected in 2021 at $55 WTI. Currently, the strip is about $60 WTI. So we hope to beat that, driven by peer-leading corporate breakeven in the high 20s per barrel range. 
Synergies from Parsley acquisition are exceeding previous guidance, especially on a recent bond deal, interest savings, additional $25 million. And we expect to achieve better savings on G&A as we go into the second and third quarters. We expect the synergies there of about $100 million. 
We also expect to realize our full operational synergy run rate of $150 million per  year by year-end '21. Rich will talk more -- give more detail about that, and fully benefiting 2022 and thereafter. 
We remain focused on environmentally responsible operations, with new emission reduction goals announced during our fourth quarter '20, with the release of our comprehensive sustainability report. 
Going to Slide #4. 
Our execution continues to remain strong. Both total production and oil production in the upper half of our guidance ranges for both fourth quarter and for full year. We generated $700 million in free cash flow despite averaging $39 WT oil price during 2020. In addition, we're continuing to gain on lease operating expenses. They were down 15% from 2019 levels. 
Going to Slide #5, our outlook. 
In 2020, obviously, many E&Ps experienced year-on-year production declines. Pioneer continued its trajectory of strong performance, setting up a robust '21 and especially going into '22. 
As seen on Slide 5, we're expecting to generate approximately $2 billion in free cash flow at $55 WTI. Again, the strip is about $60, so we hope to beat that. Our 2021 production outlook was impacted by the harsh winter weather encountered across the state of Texas last week. That left millions without power for an extended period of time. Our 2021 production outlook reflects these impacts, which amounts to approximately 8,000 barrels of oil per day on a full year basis, a little above 2% of our total oil production. 
With our announced CapEx range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, we're expecting to produce between 307,000 and 322,000 in '21, which includes the impacts of the winter storm and also excludes 11 days of Parsley production from January 4 through January 11, prior to the close. Our current production trajectory will drive strong exit-to-exit growth of approximately 8%, which sets up a very highly capital efficiency 2022 and beyond. 
Going into Slide #6, the framework for the variable dividend and discuss more detail over the next several slides. 
Top-tier inventory supports a low maintenance capital breakeven price of about $29 per barrel. And as you look, our maintenance capital is about $2 billion now with both companies combined together. At $55 oil, the 2021 plan generates $2 billion of free cash flow, that's WTI. As I said already, the strip is about $60 for the rest of the year, allowing for a substantial return of capital to our shareholders via a base and a variable, while concurrently further strengthening our balance sheet. 
Going to Slide #7. 
We've been talking about this for 18 months. We've been exploring it with shareholders, both long-term and short-term, for about 18 months. We're happy to announce the initiation of our variable dividend policy, which significantly enhances our long-term shareholder returns. Specifically, after the base dividend is paid, we expect up to 75% of the remaining annual free cash flow to be returned to shareholders in the form of variable dividend, which will be paid out quarterly the following year. To further strengthening Pioneer's balance sheet, which we think is critical and has been critical long-term for us, the 2022 variable payout will be up to 50% of the '21 post based dividend free cash flow. We believe that a strong capital return strategy, one that encompasses a stable and growing base dividend with a significant variable dividend, presents an attractive value proposition for our shareholders. 
Now I'm going to go into some mechanics for '21 and '22 to make sure it's clear. 
In '21, let's assume we do generate the $2 billion of free cash flow. We have a base of about $500 million. We're left with $1.5 billion. We're going to split that 50-50 for '21 payable in '22. So $750 million will be for the variable and $750 million will go to debt reduction. The $750 million will be split equally into 4 equal payments paid in the quarter -- each quarter. It will be offset to be a different part of the month of that quarter. So we want each shareholder receive 8 checks a year from Pioneer. The estimated dividend yield based on the current stock price is about 4.5% when you add the base plus the barrel. 
Let's go to 2022. Right now, at the current strip, we expect to generate about $3 billion of free cash flow. Take away about $500 million for the base, you're left with $2.5 billion. And we split that 75-25. That's $1.9 billion as a variable and $600 million for debt reduction. That equates to the current stock price to a 7.5% dividend yield. 
So we hope that is clear as we move forward in '21 and '22 with those examples. 
Going to Slide #8, our long-term thesis. We've had this slide before. It remains the same. 
Remains focused on driving free cash flow generation and creating significant value for shareholders. At the current strip, our long-term reinvestment rate is 50% to 60% of cash flow, which supports a program that delivers approximately 5% annual growth, adding 1 to 2 rigs per year-long term. We expect this framework to generate approximately $16 billion in free cash flow during '21 through '26 at $52 WTI, which is greater than 50% of our current market capitalization. We believe this differentiated strategy positions Pioneer to be competitive across all sectors and a leader within our industry. 
Let me now turn it over to Rich."

I'm going to start on Slide 9. 
And with the combination with Parsley, we are the only 100% focused Permian N.V. of size and scale. You can see from the math, that on a combined basis, we have a footprint of about 920,000 net acres, with a substantial inventory of high-returning wells, and importantly, 0 exposure to federal land. 
Looking at the specifics for the 2021 plan. We plan to run on average 18 to 20 drilling rigs and 5 to 7 frac fleets. As you can see from the bar chart there, we are continuing to move towards larger pads, which helps drive efficiencies and can be applied to the Parsley acreage position. Other than the larger pad sizes in 2021, our development plan in 2020 is very similar in both lateral length and well mix compared to the 2020 program. 
As Scott mentioned, the winter storm last week did impact our portfolio of production by approximately 30,000 barrel of oil per day. The vast majority of this production is back online, and we expect to see the remaining production back online in the next week or so. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees, and especially our field employees, supply chain team and our service company partners for all their efforts to restore production and resume drilling and completion activities. They have done a terrific job, while many of them have been dealing with their own personal home repairs from being without power and having broken products. So I personally thank everyone for the hard work, and most importantly, for doing it safely. 
Turning to Slide 10. 
You can see, we are increasing our initial Parsley synergy target from $325 million annually, as Scott mentioned, to $350 million. In January, we completed the refinancing of the Parsley debt and saved on an annual basis $100 million of interest, exceeding our target of $75 million by $25 million. In aggregate, post the refinancing, this lowered Pioneer's overall average coupon interest rate to approximately 2%. 
We expect to realize the G&A synergies of $100 million in the first half of the year, and we're well on our way towards [indiscernible]. On the operational synergy target of $150 million, we expect to achieve that by year-end 2021, which will drive a recurring benefit beginning in 2022. 
To give a little color on the work in progress. We're in the process of optimizing our field production operations given the adjacent operations in the Midland Basin. We are consolidating our supply chain activities. And we're looking at further capital efficiency improvements associated with tank batteries, water systems and water disposal systems, just to name a few of the initiatives underway. 
As Scott will discuss as well, achieving these synergies is part of our 2021 compensation incentives. 
If you look at the right side of the page, you can see these synergies when coupled with our unmatched inventory of high-return wells, which supports our free cash flow model. 
Turning to Slide 11, and controllable costs. We are continuing our journey to reduce our controllable cash costs. And you can see here, we've decreased them 23% in 2020 and expected to decrease them another 8% or so in 2021. These costs were comprised of cash interest, which I just mentioned being now at a low average cash cost of 2%. The second component is cash G&A, which we expect to be around approximately $1.20 per BOE in 2021. And then thirdly, our industry-leading horizontal LOE costs. We won't stop here, and we expect this trend to continue to improve through time. 
So with that, I'm going to stop here and turn it over to Neal."

This low breakeven price reflects the quality and the resilience of Pioneer's portfolio, underpinning our operational and financial strength. In addition, our unmatched high-quality asset base has no exposure to federal lands. 
Turning to Page 13. 
To the right, you can see the graphic that demonstrates our best-in-class breakeven price with our low leverage that supports substantial return of capital to shareholders as well as providing Pioneer both operational and financial flexibility. We witnessed the benefits of our strong balance sheet during the downturn in 2020. And it was Pioneer's strong financial position that facilitated the refinancing of Parsley's debt from an average coupon of greater than 5% to an average coupon of less than 1.5%, driving our interest savings synergies of $100 million that Rich discussed earlier. 
With our investment framework, our net debt-to-EBITDA will continue to trend lower, while concurrently returning significant capital to shareholders through our base and variable dividends, creating value for shareholders while bolstering our fortress balance sheet. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Joey."

I'm going to be starting on Slide 14. 
We came off our best year ever in 2019, and the drilling and completions teams committed to demonstrate similar gains in 2020. And the graph on the left shows they delivered on their promise. The chart on the right-hand side illustrates the significant progress also made in reducing our facilities costs. Our construction and operation teams partnered together to decrease the initial cost of our facilities by 40% since 2018. All of this has been accomplished without compromising our commitment to safety and protecting the environment. To the contrary, and most importantly, we improved on all safety metrics in 2020. These gains would not have been possible without the hard work of our entire staff, supply chain team, and great collaboration with our suppliers and service companies. Adding the complexities introduced by the pandemic, then this has been a truly remarkable year by any measure. 
Now moving on to Slide 15. 
Often get asked, what's driving all these improvements? We're certainly very proud of the engineers and field staff that have worked hard to make these gains possible, but they did so in partnership with our technology solutions and data science teams. Their expertise has allowed us to effectively use our extensive data set to make better decisions and to leverage technology. This represents a very small subset of examples in different areas where we have used advanced analytics and technology to improve performance. 
Just a few examples as I move from left to right on the slide. By creating digital twins of our drill strings, we can use predictive analytics to push the performance envelope and reduce failures. Machine learning has allowed us to reduce cost by optimizing our proppant and fluid systems without compromising the deliverability of the stimulation or well performance. Mobility projects have allowed us to put more applications in the hands of our field staff to ensure they have convenient access to the information they need to perform their jobs and minimize driving time and improve uptime. And to further progress our best-in-class emissions performance, we are deploying various sensor technologies that will allow us to detect emission events in real time and reduce cycle time for repairs. Ultimately, we are using our vast data set and the best available technologies to create more value while improving safety and environmental performance. 
Coming into 2021, our teams remain committed to keeping our people safe, reducing our environmental footprint and demonstrating top performance when compared to our peers. Congratulations to the entire Pioneer team for their contributions to our safe and efficient execution in 2020. 
And I'll now turn it back over to Scott."

On -- starting on Slide 16, developing low-emission barrels. I think being in the Permian Basin and the actions that we have taken as a company, we were at the lowest -- one of the lowest CO2 emissions per BOE produced worldwide. This is an interesting chart that we have found. It's essentially all state owned oil companies, majors, large independents. So it's the largest global operators in the world, making up over 64 million barrels of hydrocarbon liquids per day. Pioneer's operations produced barrels that's one of the lowest associated CO2 emission intensity globally. Our low cost, low emissions barrels continue to be desired around the world. 
Jumping to Slide 17. 
We continued to make changes in our executive compensation going forward. One of the first things we've done, we did this last year, was tie myself, the CEO, for 100% on any LTIP based on performance. So it's all based on performance. So Pioneer has to perform for myself, the CEO, to be paid anything long term. We started that program last year. Right now, we're the only company that is doing this. No CEOs average about 51% in the S&P 500. 
We added the S&P 500 index into our PSR peer group beginning in 2021. We've also added some new goals and increased some goals. We increased ESG and HSE from 10% to 20%. We have now ROCE and CROCE combined rating of 20%. And last year, we did remove any production and reserve goals going forward. 
As Rich mentioned, we do have 20% in strategic. He mentioned that in that strategic, we do have to achieve our Parsley synergies to make that number work on any annual incentive in that regard. 
Going to Slide #18, strong focus on ESG. Pioneer continues to hold all pillars of ESG of great importance. Our new Sustainability Report was released last quarter reflects our significant strides in reducing both Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas and methane emissions. It incorporates emissions intensity reduction goals on both. Inclusive of Parsley, we have a very low clearing intensity of 0.7% compared to the peers' average of 1.4%. We continue to promote a diverse workforce, which reflects community in which we live and work. 
Finally, on the last slide, #19, we're committed to driving value for our shareholders, and we're looking forward to finally commencing with our variable dividend structure. 
Again, thank you. We'll open it up now for Q&A."

So our intention -- true intention is to do 50% and 75% long term. That's our goal. And at some point, I didn't make this point. But if you look at the numbers over 6 years, our debt-to-EBITDA targets are even get better than 0.75. We actually, after a 6-year time period, we get our debt essentially down to 0. So at point -- at some point, the Board will reopen whether or not we continue at 75%. We could go higher, because, at some point, if we have no debt, no balance sheet. And the reason we're doing that, as you have heard me talk, we're not a firm believer of buying back stock annually long term. But we think when you have extreme downturns, like we experienced last year, which we had the firepower to buy a lot of stock at $50. So we'd like to have a great enough balance sheet to go into any future downturns to be able to buy back stock at 1/3 of the current price. And so you'll see our balance sheet get better and better over time. We just think it's better to have a great balance sheet due to the volatility of our industry. So I hope that helps."

I think as you mentioned, clearly, oil prices were a driver, which I'll get on to the NG on gas ones. But as you know, oil prices, I guess using the SEC pricing, was down 30% from 2019 to 2020 and start from $56 WTI down to about $40 WTI. So that's really driving the negative revisions on oil for the most part. When you look at the positive revisions that we're seeing on gas and NGL, it's really coming from a couple of things. One is just our enhanced completions continue to improve our fracture networks. And so that's leading to better recoveries from the wells, not only on oil, but NGLs and gas as well. We've also seen improved infrastructure out there, and so better capacity, which has reduced line pressures to allow more gas to flow, and therefore, added more NGL and gas reserves. So if you kind of strip those out, that F&D that was in the low 4s, probably moving closer to $7. And so I think that's kind of the background of what the reserve changes were during the year."

When you think about where production this year is going to exit, I think you said it could be up -- you might have said up about 8% -- to 8%, but something that's above the 5% threshold. The plan, when you announced it, you had some materially lower oil price views than where we're at today. And I just wonder if how you're thinking about that flexibility into 2022 and the torque between growing at an above 5% rate versus reducing or potentially reducing activity to increase free cash flow and stick within the 5%."

And the volatility and less liquidity in the market makes it tough to do any floors, to do any collar. So when you used to be able to do a collar on each side of the strip, $5 on each side or $10, so they give you very little upside anymore. So it's really -- as long as it's an extreme backwardation, we'll probably see us do less hedging. And then lastly, the variable dividend is something that's going directly into the shareholder base. So if we try to hedge that guess, it's a direct reflection on what happens to that variable dividend. And so I'm going to guess, long term, we're probably going to do less. But at the same time, we continue to see spikes or the backwardation that's taken out of the market, you may see us do a bit more. So we're going to remain opportunistic."

So congratulations on the framework consumers, the shot has got fingerprints all over this. So congratulations guys on leaving us at it. My question is really a couple of things about the longer term. You've talked about 5% plus as a growth trajectory. I just want to make sure that, that hasn't changed with the 75% of the free cash beyond the dividend, because it's probably a bit more than market is expecting. I'm just wondering what that means then for the 5% cost? That's my first question. 
And my second question is, I wonder if I could press you to think more about, you spoke about a 5-year view from a capital activity standpoint. I wonder if you can give us some thinking as to what that would look like in terms of rig activity and spending. Because, obviously, you talk about 2022, but CapEx takes on versus ore on it at.

But the first part, when we say 5% plus, we're just leaving the flexibility. So we can't get 5% exactly. Some years, we may be 6%, 7%. Some years, we may be 3% or 4%. So our goal is to really average 5% on the production growth. If we go through down periods, I gave examples of low oil prices like we did last year, we're going to be flat growth. And so the goal is really not to exceed 5%. But we do have to have the flexibility based on rig cadence and pop cadence to have that flexibility, some years to go to 6% or 7%. But some years, we may be 3% or 4%. And so I stated, I think a couple of the analysts have already asked me about '22. So it looks like we're going to be too capital efficient going into '22, and we're going to hit 8% to 10% production growth. In '22, we'll reduce capital to get it back closer to 5% or 6%. So I hope that answers your question. So the target is really 5% long term. 
In regard to long term, I gave out some numbers going out the next 6 years. And I've seen some other projections by sell side. Over a 10-year time period, we basically will throw off enough free cash flow that's equal to our current market cap at current strip, that $52, $51 WTI or $55 brent. Over a 6-year time period, it's $16 billion. And so that $16 billion, we'll be paying out about 75% of that as a variable and 25% actually goes toward debt reduction. And so that's why I made some comments about our debts actually going to be going down over the next 6 years to almost 0 after a 6-year time period, for the reasons I gave. 
So I'd rather have a much better balance sheet. It gives us more options in regard to whether we buy back stock during extreme down periods like we had last year at $50, are examples where we want to pay a higher variable than our free cash flow during a given year. And also, as I also gave the optimism that as our debt moves towards 0, that we could increase the 75% up to a higher amount obviously, up to 90%, 95% or 100% of free cash flow. So hopefully, we're trying to give the Board various options and flexibility, obviously, in this fluctuating commodity price market."

So there's no concern on our part in terms of being able to get the volumes and move those down and get to the higher -- what we'd hope would be a higher priced market with brent prices in the refinery markets on the Gulf Coast. I mean, clearly, where our differentials are now is that, yes, we've been slightly negative in 2020 and so far in '21.

Good morning. We're going to start off on Slide #3. We had very, very strong free cash flow generation of approximately $300 million, driven by strong production, low CapEx due to continued efficiency improvements from the operational tea",1086,"Thank you, Neal. Good morning. We're going to start off on Slide #3. We had very, very strong free cash flow generation of approximately $300 million, driven by strong production, low CapEx due to continued efficiency improvements from the operational teams at all levels. We're announcing our formalized long-term variable dividend structure, which we have several slides. We'll be returning up to 75% of post base dividend free cash flow to shareholders, and we'll give you some examples later on, significantly improving return of capital to shareholders.
We'll generate significant free cash flow generation of approximately $2 billion expected in 2021 at $55 WTI. Currently, the strip is about $60 WTI. So we hope to beat that, driven by peer-leading corporate breakeven in the high $20s per barrel range. 
Synergies from Parsley acquisition are exceeding previous guidance, especially on a recent bond deal, interest savings additional $25 million. And we expect to achieve better savings on G&A as we go into the second and third quarters. We expect the synergies there of about $100 million.
We also expect to realize our full operational synergy run rate of $150 million per year by year-end '21, Rich will talk more -- give more detail about that, and fully benefiting 2022 and thereafter.
We remain focused on environmentally responsible operations, with new emission reduction goals announced during our fourth quarter '20, with the release of our comprehensive sustainability report. 
Going to Slide #4. Our execution continued to remain strong, both total production and oil production in the upper half of our guidance ranges for both fourth quarter and for full year. We generated $700 million in free cash flow despite averaging $39 WT oil price during 2020. In addition, we're continuing to gain on lease operating expenses. They were down 15% from 2019 levels.
Going to Slide #5, our outlook. In 2020, obviously, many E&Ps experienced year-on-year production declines. Pioneer continued its trajectory of strong performance, setting up a robust '21 and especially going into '22. As seen on Slide 5, we're expecting to generate approximately $2 billion in free cash flow at $55 WTI. Again, the strip is about $60, so we hope to beat that.
Our 2021 production outlook was impacted by the harsh winter weather encountered across the state of Texas last week. That left millions without power for an extended period of time. Our 2021 production outlook reflects these impacts, which amounts to approximately 8,000 barrels of oil per day on a full year basis, a little above 2% of our total oil production.
With our announced CapEx range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, we're expecting to produce between 307,000 and 322,000 in '21, which includes the impacts of the winter storm and also excludes 11 days of Parsley production from January 4 through January 11, prior to the close. Our current production trajectory will drive strong exit-to-exit growth of approximately 8%, which sets up a very highly capital efficiency 2022 and beyond.
Going into Slide #6, the framework for the variable dividend and discuss more detail over the next several slides. Top-tier inventory supports a low maintenance capital breakeven price of about $29 per barrel. And as you look, our maintenance capital is about $2 billion now with both companies combined together. At $55 oil, the 2021 plan generates $2 billion of free cash flow, that's WTI. As I said already, the strip is about $60 for the rest of the year, allowing for a substantial return of capital to our shareholders via a base and a variable, while concurrently further strengthening our balance sheet. 
Going to Slide #7. We've been talking about this for 18 months. We've been exploring it with shareholders, both long term and short term, for about 18 months. We're happy to announce the initiation of our variable dividend policy, which significantly enhances our long-term shareholder returns. Specifically, after the base dividend is paid, we expect up to 75% of the remaining annual free cash flow to be returned to shareholders in the form of variable dividend, which will be paid out quarterly the following year. 
To further strengthening Pioneer's balance sheet, which we think is critical and has been critical long term for us, the 2022 variable payout will be up to 50% of the '21 post base dividend free cash flow. We believe that a strong capital return strategy, one that encompasses a stable and growing base dividend paired with a significant variable dividend, presents an attractive value proposition for our shareholders.
Now I'm going to go into some mechanics for '21 and '22 to make sure it's clear. In '21, let's assume we do generate the $2 billion of free cash flow. We have a base of about $500 million. We're left with $1.5 billion. We're going to split that 50-50 for '21 payable in '22. So $750 million will be for the variable and $750 million will go to debt reduction. The $750 million will be split equally into 4 equal payments paid in the quarter -- each quarter. It will be offset with a different part of the month of that quarter. So we want each shareholder receive 8 checks a year from Pioneer. The estimated dividend yield based on the current stock price is about 4.5% when you add the base plus the variable. 
Let's go to 2022. Right now, at the current strip, we expect to generate about $3 billion of free cash flow. Take away about $500 million for the base, you're left with $2.5 billion. And we split that 75-25. That's $1.9 billion as a variable and $600 million for debt reduction. That equates the current stock price to a 7.5% dividend yield. So we hope that is clear as we move forward in '21 and '22, those examples.
Going to Slide #8, our long-term thesis. We've had this slide before. It remains the same, remains focused on driving free cash flow generations and creating significant value for shareholders. At the current strip, our long-term reinvestment rate is 50% to 60% of cash flow, which supports a program that delivers approximately 5% annual growth, adding 1 to 2 rigs per year long term. We expect this framework to generate approximately $16 billion in free cash flow during '21 through '26 at $52 WTI, which is greater than 50% of our current market capitalization. We believe this differentiated strategy positions Pioneer to be competitive across all sectors and a leader within our industry.
Let me now turn it over to Rich."

I'm going to start on Slide 9. And with the combination with Parsley, we are the only 100% focused Permian entity of size and scale. You can see from the math, that on a combined basis, we have a footprint of about 920,000",622,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 9. And with the combination with Parsley, we are the only 100% focused Permian entity of size and scale. You can see from the math, that on a combined basis, we have a footprint of about 920,000 net acres, with a substantial inventory of high-returning wells. And importantly, 0 exposure to federal land. 
Looking at the specifics for the 2021 plan. We plan to run on average 18 to 20 drilling rigs and 5 to 7 frac fleets. As you can see from the bar chart there, we are continuing to move towards larger pads, which helps drive efficiencies and can be applied to the Parsley acreage position. Other than the larger pad sizes in 2021, our development plan in 2020 is very similar in both lateral length and well mix compared to the 2020 program.
As Scott mentioned, the winter storm last week did impact our portfolio of production by approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day. The vast majority of this production is back online, and we expect to see the remaining production back online in the next week or so.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees, and especially our field employees, supply chain team and our service company partners for all their efforts to restore production and resume drilling and completion activities. They have done a terrific job, while many of them have been dealing with their own personal home repairs from being without power and having broken pipes. So I want to personally thank everyone for the hard work, and most importantly, for doing it safely.
Turning to Slide 10. You can see, we are increasing our initial Parsley synergy target from $325 million annually, as Scott mentioned, to $350 million. In January, we completed the refinancing of the Parsley debt and saved, on an annual basis, $100 million of interest, exceeding our target of $75 million by $25 million. In aggregate, post the refinancing, this lowered Pioneer's overall average coupon interest rate to approximately 2%.
We expect to realize the G&A synergies of $100 million in the first half of the year, and we're well on our way towards that. On the operational synergy target of $150 million, we expect to achieve that by year-end 2021, which will drive a recurring benefit beginning in 2022.
To give a little color on the work in progress. We're in the process of optimizing our field production operations given the adjacent operations in the Midland Basin. We are consolidating our supply chain activities. And we're looking at further capital efficiency improvements associated with tank batteries, water systems and water disposal systems, just to name a few of the initiatives underway. As Scott will discuss as well, achieving these synergies is part of our 2021 compensation incentives. If you look at the right side of the page, you can see these synergies when coupled with our unmatched inventory of high-return wells, which supports our free cash flow model. 
Turning to Slide 11, controllable costs. We are continuing our journey to reduce our controllable cash costs. And you can see here, we've decreased them 23% in 2020 and expect to decrease them another 8% or so in 2021. These costs were comprised of cash interest, which I just mentioned being now at a low average cash cost of 2%. The second component is cash G&A, which we expect to be around approximately $1.20 per BOE in 2021. And then thirdly, our industry-leading horizontal LOE costs. We won't stop here, and we expect this trend to continue to improve through time.
So with that, I'm going to stop here and turn it over to Neal."

This low breakeven price reflects the quality and the resilience of Pioneer's portfolio, underpinning our operational and financial strength. In addition, our unmatched high-quality asset base has no exposure to federal lands.
Turning to Page 13. To the right, you can see the graphic that demonstrates our best-in-class breakeven price with our low leverage that supports substantial return of capital to shareholders as well as providing Pioneer both operational and financial flexibility. We witnessed the benefits of our strong balance sheet during the downturn in 2020. And it was Pioneer's strong financial position that facilitated the refinancing of Parsley's debt from an average coupon of greater than 5% to an average coupon of less than 1.5%, driving our interest savings synergies of $100 million that Rich discussed earlier. With our investment framework, our net debt-to-EBITDA will continue to trend lower, while concurrently returning significant capital to shareholders through our base and variable dividends, creating value for shareholders while bolstering our fortress balance sheet.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joey."

We came off our best year ever in 2019, and the drilling and completions teams committed to demonstrate similar gains in 2020. And the graph on the left shows they delivered on their promise. The chart on the right-hand side illustrates the significant progress also made in reducing our facilities costs. Our construction and operation teams partnered together to decrease the initial cost of our facilities by 40% since 2018. All of this has been accomplished without compromising our commitment to safety and protecting the environment. To the contrary, and most importantly, we improved on all safety metrics in 2020. These gains would not have been possible without the hard work of our entire staff, supply chain team, and great collaboration with our suppliers and service companies. Adding the complexities introduced by the pandemic, then this has been a truly remarkable year by any measure. 
Now moving on to Slide 15. I often get asked, what's driving all these improvements? We're certainly very proud of the engineers and field staff that have worked hard to make these gains possible, but they did so in partnership with our technology solutions and data science teams. Their expertise has allowed us to effectively use our extensive data set to make better decisions and to leverage technology. This represents a very small subset of examples in different areas where we have used advanced analytics and technology to improve performance.
Just a few examples as I move from left to right on the slide. By creating digital twins of our drill strings, we can use predictive analytics to push the performance envelope and reduce failures. Machine learning has allowed us to reduce cost by optimizing our proppant and fluid systems without compromising the deliverability of the stimulation or well performance. 
Mobility projects have allowed us to put more applications in the hands of our field staff to ensure they have convenient access to the information they need to perform their jobs and minimize driving time and improve uptime. And to further progress our best-in-class emissions performance, we are deploying various sensor technologies that will allow us to detect emission events in real time and reduce cycle time for repairs. Ultimately, we are using our vast data set and the best available technologies to create more value while improving safety and environmental performance.
Coming into 2021, our teams remain committed to keeping our people safe, reducing our environmental footprint and demonstrating top performance when compared to our peers. 
Congratulations to the entire Pioneer team for their contributions to our safe and efficient execution in 2020. And I'll now turn it back over to Scott."

On -- starting off on Slide 16, developing low-emission barrels. I think being in the Permian Basin and the actions that we have taken as a company, we are at the lowest -- one of the lowest CO2 emissions per BOE produced worldwide. This is an interesting chart that we have found. It's essentially all state-owned oil companies, majors, large independents. So it's the largest global operators in the world, making up over 64 million barrels of hydrocarbon liquids per day. Pioneer's operations produced barrels is one of the lowest associated CO2 emission intensity globally. Our low cost, low emissions barrels continue to be desired around the world.
Jumping to Slide 17. We continue to make changes in our executive compensation going forward. One of the first things we've done, we did this last year, was tie myself, the CEO, for 100% on any LTIP based on performance. So it's all based on performance. So Pioneer has to perform for myself, the CEO, to be paid anything long term. We started that program last year. Right now, we're the only company that is doing this. No CEOs average about 51% in the S&P 500.
We added the S&P 500 index into our TSR peer group beginning in 2021. We've also added some new goals and increased some goals. We increased ESG and HSE from 10% to 20%. And We have now ROCE and CROCI combined weighting of 20%. And last year, we did remove any production and reserve goals going forward. As Rich mentioned, we do have 20% in strategic, he mentioned that. In that strategic, we do have to achieve our Parsley synergies to make that number work on any annual incentive in that regard.
Going to Slide #18, strong focus on ESG. Pioneer continues to hold all pillars of ESG of great importance. Our new sustainability report was released last quarter and reflects our significant strides in reducing both Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas and methane emissions. It incorporates emissions intensity reduction goals on both. Inclusive of Parsley, we have a very low flaring intensity of 0.7% compared to the peers' average of 1.4%. We continue to promote a diverse workforce, which reflects community in which we live and work.
Finally, on the last slide, #19, we're committed to driving value for our shareholders, and we're looking forward to finally commencing with our variable dividend structure.
Again, thank you. We'll open it up now for Q&A."

And then -- but this first year, it will be basically up to 50% of the '21 free cash flow after the base. Just maybe sort of how to think about in any given year how you all are deciding between if it's 50% and 75%. Obviously, your leverage metrics are already really low.

And at some point, I didn't make this point, but if you look at the numbers over 6 years, our debt-to-EBITDA targets are -- even get better than 0.75. We actually, after a 6-year time period, we get our debt essentially down to 0. So at point -- at some point, the Board will reopen whether or not we continue at 75%. 
We could go higher because at some point, if we have no debt, no balance sheet. And the reason we're doing that, as you have heard me talk, we're not a firm believer of buying back stock annually long term. But we think when you have extreme downturns like we experienced last year, which we had the firepower to buy a lot of stock at $50. So we'd like to have a great enough balance sheet to go into any future downturns to be able to buy back stock at 1/3 of the current price. And so you'll see our balance sheet get better and better over time. We just think it's better to have a great balance sheet due to the volatility of our industry. So I hope that helps."

I think as you mentioned, clearly, oil prices were a driver, which I'll get on to the NGL and gas ones. But as you know, oil prices, I guess using the SEC pricing, was down 30% from 2019 to 2020 and start from $56 WTI down to about $40 WTI. So that's really driving the negative revisions on oil for the most part. When you look at the positive revisions that we're seeing on gas and NGL, it's really coming from a couple of things. One is just our enhanced completions continue to improve our fracture networks. And so that's leading to better recoveries from the wells, not only on oil, but NGLs and gas as well. We've also seen improved infrastructure out there, and so better capacity, which has reduced line pressures to allow more gas to flow, and therefore, added more NGL and gas reserves. So if you kind of strip those out, that F&D that was in the low $4s, probably be moving closer to $7. And so I think that's kind of the background of what the reserve changes were during the year."

We may hedge enough to protect the base dividend. But because the market is in extreme -- the way Saudi and OPEC has engineered this latest rise, it's in extreme backwardation. And the volatility and less liquidity in the market makes it tough to do any floors, to do any collars. So when you used to be able to do a collar on each side of the strip, $5 on each side or $10, so they give you very little upside anymore. 
So it's really -- as long as it's an extreme backwardation, we'll probably see us do less hedging. And then lastly, the variable dividend is something that's going directly into the shareholder base. So if we try to hedge that guess, it's a direct reflection on what happens to that variable dividend. And so I'm going to guess, long term, we're probably going to do less. But at the same time, we continue to see spikes or the backwardation that's taken out of the market, you may see us do a little bit more. So we're going to remain opportunistic."

And I think your exit rate is, in the ballpark, it may be slightly higher than that, but it's in that zip code. And then on capital, I think we were pretty good about getting the activity to the average rig and frac fleet rates starting in January.

So congratulations on the framework consumers that Shah has got his fingerprints all over this. So congratulations, guys, on laying this out. My question is really a couple of things about the longer term. You've talked about 5% plus as a growth trajectory. I just want to make sure that, that hasn't changed with the 75% of the free cash beyond the dividend because it's probably a bit more than market is expecting. I'm just wondering what that means then for the 5% cost? That's my first question.
And my second question is, I wonder if I could press you to think more about -- you spoke about a 5-year view from a capital activity standpoint. I wonder if you can give us some thinking as to what that would look like in terms of rig activity and spending. Because, obviously, you talk about 2022, but [indiscernible]. So 2 questions, one on the 5% plus, and 2, on the longer-term trajectory."

The second part, I've talked about already, but I'll go over it again. But the first part, when we say 5% plus, we're just leaving the flexibility. So we can't get 5% exactly. Some years, we may be 6%, 7%. Some years, we may be 3% or 4%. So our",434,"Yes, Doug. The second part, I've talked about already, but I'll go over it again. But the first part, when we say 5% plus, we're just leaving the flexibility. So we can't get 5% exactly. Some years, we may be 6%, 7%. Some years, we may be 3% or 4%. So our goal is to really average 5% on the production growth. If we go through down periods, I gave examples of low oil prices like we did last year, we're going to be flat growth. And so the goal is really not to exceed 5%. But we do have to have the flexibility based on rig cadence and POP cadence to have that flexibility some years to go to 6% or 7%. But some years, we may be 3% or 4%. 
And so as stated, I think -- a couple of the analysts have already asked me about '22. So it looks like we're going to be too capital efficient going into '22, and we're going to hit 8% to 10% production growth. In '22, we'll reduce capital to get it back closer to 5% or 6%. So I hope that answers your question. So the target is really 5% long term. 
In regard to long term, I gave out some numbers going out the next 6 years. And I've seen some other projections by sell side. Over a 10-year time period, we basically will throw off enough free cash flow that's equal to our current market cap at current strip, that $52, $51 WTI or $55 Brent. Over a 6-year time period, it's $16 billion. And so of that $16 billion, we'll be paying out about 75% of that as a variable and 25% actually goes toward debt reduction. And so that's why I made some comments about our debts actually going to be going down over the next 6 years to almost 0 after a 6-year time period, for the reasons I gave.
So I'd rather have a much better balance sheet. It gives us more options in regard to whether we buy back stock during extreme down periods like we had last year at $50, are examples where we want to pay a higher variable than our free cash flow during a given year. And also, as I also gave the optimism that as our debt moves towards 0, that we could increase the 75% up to a higher amount obviously, up to 90%, 95% or 100% of free cash flow. So hopefully, we're trying to give the Board various options and flexibility, obviously, in this fluctuating commodity price market."

So there's no concern on our part in terms of being able to get the volumes and move those down and get to the higher -- what we'd hope would be a higher-priced market with Brent prices in the refinery markets on the Gulf Coast. I mean, clearly, where our differentials are now is that, yes, we've been slightly negative in 2020 and so far in '21.

Good morning. Slide #3. Pioneer delivered a very strong first quarter, generating free cash flow of approximately $370 million when adjusted for partially acquisition cost. You can see that we increased our '21 estimated free cash flow",918,"Thank you, Neal. Good morning. 
Slide #3. Pioneer delivered a very strong first quarter, generating free cash flow of approximately $370 million when adjusted for partially acquisition cost. You can see that we increased our '21 estimated free cash flow up to about $2.7 billion. That's at strip pricing, which includes the contribution on a very accretive acquisition at DoublePoint and obviously, higher commodity prices as the strip continues to move up. You can see the magnitude of the synergies, $525 million, which will improve our free cash flow generation, which will be highlighted on a subsequent slide. And again, we'll remain focused on environmental stewardship and minimize flaring through our operations. 
Lastly, you can see now with DoublePoint, we're the largest producer in the Permian. That brings lower cost of capital, economies of scale, shared facilities and infrastructure. And going into 2022, the company will be over 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day just in the Permian Basin in 2022. 
Going to Slide #4. I think the key point here, solid execution from all levels of operation and our field drive strong first quarter results. Again, the outperformance have exceeded the top end of guidance, oil production, was due to our field staff, bringing our production back online sooner, in the wake of the winter storm and also the outperformance of new wells. 
Going to Slide #5. As Neal mentioned, we closed yesterday on our DoublePoint acquisition, approximately 100,000 acres right in the heart -- core of the core of the Midland Basin. This will take our Midland Basin on up to over 900,000 net acres. This transaction generates double-digit free cash flow on accretion per share, enabling increased variable dividends over the next several years. 
Now with the contiguous acreage and the operational synergies, just to give you an idea how dominant we are in the Midland Basin, we'll have 25% of the basin rig count and 25% of the basin frac fleet rig count. Again, allow us for continued synergies, drilling longer laterals on which Rich will talk about later. 
Our production exceeded as discussed in the press release. Production of DoublePoint exceeded 92,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this week, which is way ahead of schedule, as we're moving forward to averaging over about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the last 6 months of 2021. 
Going to Slide #6, long-term investment thesis. When you look at the strip, last year -- I mean, of the strip over the next several years as it continues to move up and look at our model of growing oil production 5% per year over the next several years. Our reinvestment rate will actually be below. We say 50% to 60% here. It'll actually be below 50%. 
Generate strong corporate returns, double-digit returns. We'll continue to reduce our leverage. It's at 1 today. We'll continue to reduce it below 0.75 next year and continue to drive it down to a very, very low level. We remain committed to our -- really our key thesis and returning most of our capital back to the shareholders. So we're targeting a 10% total return. We'll talk more about that later. 
Going to Slide #7, compelling free cash flow generation. We're showing now with DoublePoint Energy on top in the brighter -- darker blue color, adding about $5 billion of free cash flow over the next several years to 2026, increasing our total free cash flow at the company. With the strip, and this is a strip a few days ago. So the number continues to move up with the strip moving up, generating $23 billion of free cash flow. 
As we have already stated, approximately -- this actually represents 50% of our current enterprise value, that 20 -- total enterprise value, including market cap plus debt. 
The addition of DoublePoint is a 25% increase on top of our free cash flow. That's taken the $5 billion over the $23 billion -- $5 billion over $23 billion. I think what's key is that when you look at the current stock price, our dividend yield will move up from 1.5% to over 4% in 2022 and over 8% in the following years to 2026. That's at the current stock price. 
I do have to have a call out for Devon and Rick's great slide, comparing their dividend to peers, I think we're in there around 1.5% toward the bottom quartile. They're showing them leading this year at 7%. Pioneer will move the second place next year, moving over 4, and then moving up to the top spot above Devon. And the primary driver is really just our low -- our margins in the high 20s, our low-cost basis, in addition to the fact that we're paying out 75% of our cash flow versus Devon's 50%. 
Going to Slide #8. Again, just emphasizing the variable dividend long-term shareholder return model. Last quarter, we initiated the mechanics of it. Mechanics will be paying out long term, roughly 75% of the remaining annual free cash flow after the base dividend is paid. When you look at -- including the base dividend, approximately 80% of the company's free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders. Between the base and the variable dividend, shareholders next year, should expect 8 separate dividend checks per year. Obviously, this is all subject to our Board approval, like we do on the base dividend and the variable dividend. 
Let me now turn it over to Rich."
295224,712493131,2270410,"Pioneer Natural Resources Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Pioneer Natural Resources Company","Executives","Thanks, Scott, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 9. And with the closing of the DoublePoint transaction yesterday, we wanted to provide an updated outlook for our 2021 production and capital. As Scott mentioned, DoublePoint is currently prod",1034,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. 
I'm going to start on Slide 9. And with the closing of the DoublePoint transaction yesterday, we wanted to provide an updated outlook for our 2021 production and capital. As Scott mentioned, DoublePoint is currently producing at 92,000 BOEs per day, and we expect to ramp them up to about 100,000 BOEs per day by the end of the quarter and with an additional 20 to 25 POPs planned between now and quarter end. We plan to maintain that production, 100,000 BOEs a day for the second half of the year. And so that's embedded in our updated guidance. And we also have adjusted our guidance to reflect the actual results for Q1 where we were able to recover production from the winter storm quicker-than-anticipated and along with the Q1 strength of our well performance and execution by our operating teams. So overall, we are forecasting 2021 production of 351,000 barrels of oil per day to 366,000 barrels of oil per day. And on a BOE basis, 605,000 to 631,000. 
Looking at capital, we are adding $530 million to $570 million of incremental capital related to the DoublePoint transaction over the course of the remainder of the year. This is up from the bottom of our previous announcement since we were able to close the transaction earlier than originally anticipated. 
Total CapEx is now projected at $2.95 billion to $3.25 billion on cash flow of about $5.9 billion based on strip prices, which is leading to what Scott talked about, $2.7 billion of free cash flow for the year. 
Turning to Slide 10. You can see our -- for a full year, that we plan to average 22 to 24 rigs and deliver 470 to 510 POPs. If you take that just for the remainder of the year, we plan to run with the addition of DoublePoint, 24 to 26 rigs and 7 to 9 frac fleets. Currently, we're at 26 rigs and 9 frac fleets. This does reflect the fact that we do plan on reducing DoublePoint's rig count from 7 to 5 by year-end. And longer term, as we think about reducing our growth rate from 30% down to 5%, we can drive that down to 3 to 4 rigs as we are consistent with our 5% growth plan over the long term. 
You can see on the map there over 1 million acres, predominantly in the Midland Basin, 920,000 and 100,000 acres in the Delaware. In terms of Delaware plans, we will start drilling our first well later this year. The team is looking forward to bringing that same efficiency gains that we've achieved in the Midland Basin to the Delaware and see how we can further improve our wealth returns, and especially given the higher oil cut that we see in Delaware and the lower royalty burden. And just for a point of reference, first quarter production was 74% oil in the Delaware. 
Turning to Slide 11. I want to provide an update on our planned synergies related to the partially in Devon transaction. On G&A, we've accomplished $100 million of partly savings. So that's -- we checked that box. As it relates to DoublePoint, they're running about $25 million annually in G&A. We expect to bring that under $10 million on an annual basis, and we think we'll be the beginning of the third quarter of 2021. On interest, we refinanced parts these bonds in January. If you recall, those were over 5% coupon. We refinanced those on a weighted average base well under 2%. And we plan on refinancing the DoublePoint volumes later this month. So along with paying off DoublePoint's credit facility that happened yesterday, we're going to accomplish our interest savings sooner than we originally anticipated, and we'll have that fully done by the end of this month. 
On operational synergies, we are making great progress on those. We've been able to leverage our supplier relationships and are seeing significant savings on things of like pressure pumping, wireline, cement, casing and tubulars to name a few examples. We've also, and Joey will talk more about this, successfully tested time frac on our acreage during the first quarter, and we're seeing significant savings like the industry, other industry participants in that $200,000 to $300,000 per well. So this is something that we'll be able to not only execute across Pioneer's acreage, but we'll also be able to execute that, I guess, across Parsley's and DoublePoint's acreage. 
The team has also continuing to optimize our development plans to take advantage of existing facilities. So looking at tank batteries, water disposal, salt water disposal gathering system, reuse facilities and really optimizing those as we move into the 2021 -- 2022 program, sorry, to really take advantage of those savings. 
And then as Scott mentioned, one of the other significant benefits of combining Parsley and DoublePoint is really adding to our contiguous acreage position. And this allows us to do, as we've successfully drilled longer laterals out to 15,000 feet, really up from the 9,000 to 10,000 feet that we've been drilling at [indiscernible] allow for a lot of locations that we can drill longer laterals on, which is much more capital efficient and really adding essentially the same production by drilling fewer wells. So it's still early, but it should add significant long-term value across our portfolio and just demonstrates the benefit of having contiguous blocking acreage to be able to drill that type of laterals. 
Turning to Slide 12. This just reflects our trend of what we've accomplished on G&A over the past 3 years, including the synergies from the acquisitions. We are forecasting G&A per BOE to be around $1.15 to $1.20 by year-end. And so, I think this is just an example of really, and highlights, the focus of the company's had on improving returns and improving our return of capital to shareholders. So it's really lowering our overall cost structure. So you've seen us drive down well costs, lower LOE, lower G&A per BOE, lower interest per BOE, all with the idea of improving our free cash flow profile. 
With that, I'll turn it to Neal to talk about breakevens."

Our drilling and completion teams continued their streak of resetting the bar with another great quarter of efficiency gains. Our [indiscernible] frac operations contributed to these gains with the successful execution of 4 pads in Q1, where we were able to achieve approximately 3,000 feet of completed lateral per day. This is greater than a 50% improvement when compared to our program average. It's still early days, but we estimate savings to be in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 per well. We will continue to refine our frac operations and conduct more trials throughout the second quarter. 
You will note that our wells per pad projection for 2021 is down slightly from last quarter, and this is due to the integration of DoublePoint pads into our schedule. Still, our wells per pad continues to increase, which further contributes to our efficiency gains. 
I know this slide only illustrates improvements in drilling and completions, so I want to emphasize that we are also seeing tremendous performance in our production operations, facilities, construction and water management teams, and none of this would be possible with those that support development planning, our robust supply chain and our expanding use of technology. I also want to thank all the teams for their efficient integration of Parsley and a great start on DoublePoint. We remain focused on delivering peer leading performance, keeping our people safe and reducing our environmental footprint. And so congratulations to all the teams for their contributions to our safe and efficient execution in Q1. 
I'm now going to go to Slide 15. I know that Scott covered this in some detail last quarter, so I'll be brief. So this chart represents more than 64 million barrels of hydrocarbon liquids per day, including the largest national oil companies, majors and independents. Pioneer's operations produced barrels with one of the lowest associated CO2 emissions intensities globally. Our low-cost, low-emissions barrels will continue to be desired around the world. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Scott."

So this is not going to be -- so the price is going to keep going up. I've been stating we're going to bounce around between 50 and 70. But obviously, we're going to be over 70 before we know it. And the one thing that's going to bring it down, it's not going to be supplied this time because U.S. production has moderated. It's going to be what -- how long will demand continue to pay a higher price. And you have to go back to 2013 and '14 when oil was closer to $100 a barrel. And somewhere between $80 and $100 a barrel is where demand's going to reduce -- is going to take demand reducing the price.

Second question is for maybe Rich. I think why now in the DoublePoint, you're running, say, 7 rig and you're scaling down to 5. So you're averaging about 6 rigs, and you're saying that you're going to stay about flat at 100,000 barrels per day. But then that for next year, you think that at 5 rig or more, you probably would be able -- as around 5 rigs, you will be able to grow at about 5%.

Calculating at our operating cash flow, the capital necessarily embedded within those annual years and then the free cash flow that we generated and then apply that in terms of how was it accretive, what did it do to ROCE, what did it do to CROCE. 
And as Scott said earlier, the benefit to ROCE and CROCE were positive. The benefit to free cash flow was double-digit accretive. And really, what we're looking here and as Scott alluded to, on that Pioneer model, I mean, it really comes back to the model and the assets. The assets and what they provide us and allow us to do really drive that free cash flow generation with the high-margin wells with the low cost of capital we can bring to bear. It's our goal and our ability, when I think about valuation, as you and I have talked about in the past, we look at free cash flow. E&Ps tend to trade in a pretty tight band historically on EBITDA. It's our goal that Pioneer will be able to disaggregate itself from that tight band with E&Ps trade to trade consistent with other companies and other names and other sectors that generate a high level of free cash flow and return that capital to shareholders. I mean, that is our long-term vision and our long-term goal really to drive that appreciation and accretion and have it manifest itself within the stock price by returning that capital to shareholders over the course of time on an annual basis."

And so we're going to pick up 8 million to 9 million barrels a day, be back up to 100 million to 101 million.
The key is there's no extra supply. And so I think the market is going to continue to be tight over the next 2 or 3 years. So for that reason, I think the price will continue to move up. It will test where demand starts falling off. And that if you go back to the '12, '13, '14 time period, even though we had a supply issue there, we're not going to have a supply issue there. The oil price got up to $80 to $100. So I think in the easy test those prices over the next few years. So we will probably do less hedging. If it gets up into that $75 to $100 range, you'll probably see us continue to do some 3 ways at that point in time to protect, obviously, both the base and the variable dividend, not as high as we've done in the past."

Good morning. Slide #3. Pioneer delivered a very strong first quarter, generating free cash flow of approximately $370 million when adjusted for partially acquisition cost. You can see that we increased our '21 estimated free cash flow",924,"Thank you, Neil. Good morning. 
Slide #3. Pioneer delivered a very strong first quarter, generating free cash flow of approximately $370 million when adjusted for partially acquisition cost. You can see that we increased our '21 estimated free cash flow up to about $2.7 billion. That's at strip pricing, which includes the contribution for the very accretive acquisition at DoublePoint and obviously, higher commodity prices as the strip continues to move up. You can see the magnitude of the synergies, $525 million, which will improve our free cash flow generation, which will be highlighted on a subsequent slide. And again, we'll remain focused on environmental stewardship and minimize flaring through our operations. 
Lastly, you can see now with DoublePoint, we're the largest producer in the Permian. That brings lower cost of capital, economies of scale, shared facilities and infrastructure. And going into 2022, the company will be over 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day just in the Permian Basin in 2022. 
Going to Slide #4. I think the key point here, solid execution from all levels of operation and our field drive strong first quarter results. Again, the outperformance have exceeded the top end of guidance, oil production, was due to our field staff, bringing our production back online sooner, in the wake of the winter storm and also the outperformance of new wells. 
Going to Slide #5. As Neal mentioned, we closed yesterday on our DoublePoint acquisition, approximately 100,000 acres right in the heart -- core of the core of the Midland Basin. This will take our Midland Basin on up to over 900,000 net acres. This transaction generates double-digit free cash flow on accretion per share, enabling increased variable dividends over the next several years. 
Now with the contiguous acreage and the operational synergies, just to give you an idea how dominant we are in the Midland Basin, we'll have 25% of the basin rig count and 25% of the basin frac fleet rig count. Again, allow us for continued synergies, drilling longer laterals on which Rich will talk about later. 
Our production exceeded -- as discussed in the press release, production of DoublePoint exceeded 92,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this week, which is way ahead of schedule, as we're moving forward to averaging over about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the last 6 months of 2021. 
Going to Slide #6, long-term investment thesis. When you look at the strip, last year -- I mean, of the strip over the next several years as it continues to move up and look at our model of growing oil production 5% per year over the next several years, our reinvestment rate will actually be below, we say 50 to 60% here. It'll actually be below 50%. 
We generate strong corporate returns, double-digit returns. We'll continue to reduce our leverage. It's at 1 today. We'll continue to reduce it below 0.75 next year and continue to drive it down to a very, very low level. We remain committed to our -- really, our key thesis and returning most of our capital back to the shareholders. So we're targeting a 10% total return. We'll talk more about that later. 
Going to Slide #7, compelling free cash flow generation. We're showing now, with DoublePoint Energy on top in the brighter -- darker blue color, adding about $5 billion of free cash flow over the next several years to 2026, increasing our total free cash flow at the company. 
With the strip, and this is a strip a few days ago. So the number continues to move up with the strip moving up, generating $23 billion of free cash flow. As we have already stated, approximately -- this actually represents 50% of our current enterprise value, that 20 -- total enterprise value, including market cap plus debt. 
The addition of DoublePoint is a 25% increase on top of our free cash flow. That's taken the $5 billion over the $23 billion -- $5 billion over $23 billion. I think what's key is that when you look at the current stock price, our dividend yield will move up from 1.5% to over 4% in 2022 and over 8% in the following years to 2026. That's at the current stock price. 
I do have to have a call out for Devon and [ Rig's ] great slide, comparing their dividend to peers, I think we're in there around 1.5% toward the bottom quartile. They're showing them leading this year at 7%. Pioneer will move to second place next year, moving over 4, and then moving up to the top spot above Devon. And the primary driver is really just our low -- our margins in the high 20s, our low-cost basis in addition to the fact that we're paying out 75% of our cash flow versus Devon's 50%. 
Going to Slide #8. Again, just emphasizing the variable dividend long-term shareholder return model. Last quarter, we initiated the mechanics of it. Mechanics will be paying out long term, roughly 75% of the remaining annual free cash flow after the base dividend is paid. When you look at -- including the base dividend, approximately 80% of the company's free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders. Between the base and the variable dividend, shareholders next year will -- should expect 8 separate dividend checks per year. Obviously, this is all subject to our Board approval, like we do on the base dividend and the variable dividend. 
Let me now turn it over to Rich."

I'm going to start on Slide 9. And with the closing of the DoublePoint transaction yesterday, we wanted to provide an updated outlook for our 2021 production and capital. As Scott mentioned, DoublePoint is currently prod",1035,"Thanks, Scott, and good morning. 
I'm going to start on Slide 9. And with the closing of the DoublePoint transaction yesterday, we wanted to provide an updated outlook for our 2021 production and capital. As Scott mentioned, DoublePoint is currently producing at 92,000 BOEs per day, and we expect to ramp them up to about 100,000 BOEs per day by the end of the quarter and with an additional 20 to 25 POPs planned between now and quarter end. We plan to maintain that production, 100,000 BOEs a day for the second half of the year. And so that's embedded in our updated guidance. And we also have adjusted our guidance to reflect the actual results for Q1 where we were able to recover production from the winter storm quicker-than-anticipated and along with the Q1 strength of our well performance and execution by our operating teams. So overall, we are forecasting 2021 production of 351,000 barrels of oil per day to 366,000 barrels of oil per day. And on a BOE basis, 605,000 to 631,000. 
Looking at capital, we are adding $530 million to $570 million of incremental capital related to the DoublePoint transaction over the course of the remainder of the year. This is up from the bottom of our previous announcement since we were able to close the transaction earlier than originally anticipated. Total CapEx is now projected at $2.95 billion to $3.25 billion on cash flow of about $5.9 billion based on strip prices, which is leading to what Scott talked about, $2.7 billion of free cash flow for the year. 
Turning to Slide 10. You can see our -- for a full year, that we plan to average 22 to 24 rigs and deliver 470 to 510 POPs. If you take that just for the remainder of the year, we plan to run with the addition of DoublePoint, 24 to 26 rigs and 7 to 9 frac fleets. Currently, we're at 26 rigs and 9 frac fleets. This does reflect the fact that we do plan on reducing DoublePoint rig count from 7 to 5 by year-end. And longer term, as we think about reducing our growth rate from 30% down to 5%, we can drive that down to 3 to 4 rigs as we are consistent with our 5% growth plan over the long term. 
You can see on the map there over 1 million acres, predominantly in the Midland Basin, 920,000 and 100,000 acres in the Delaware. In terms of Delaware plans, we will start drilling our first well later this year. The team is looking forward to bringing that same efficiency gains that we've achieved in the Midland Basin to the Delaware and see how we can further improve our wealth returns, especially given the higher oil cut that we see in Delaware and the lower royalty burden. And just for a point of reference, first quarter production was 74% oil in the Delaware. 
Turning to Slide 11. I want to provide an update on our planned synergies related to the Parsley and DoublePoint transactions. On G&A, we've accomplished $100 million of Parsley savings. So that's -- we checked that box. As it relates to DoublePoint, they're running about $25 million annually in G&A. We expect to bring that under $10 million on an annual basis, and we think we'll be there beginning of the third quarter of 2021. 
On interest, we refinanced Parsley's bonds in January. If you recall, those were over 5% coupon. We refinanced those on a weighted average base well under 2%. And we plan on refinancing the DoublePoint volumes later this month. So along with paying off DoublePoint's credit facility that happened yesterday, we're going to accomplish our interest savings sooner than we originally anticipated, and we'll have that fully done by the end of this month. 
On operational synergies, we are making great progress on those. We've been able to leverage our supplier relationships and are seeing significant savings on things of like pressure pumping, wireline, cement, casing and tubulars to name a few examples. We've also, and Joey will talk more about this, successfully tested simulfrac on our acreage during the first quarter, and we're seeing significant savings like the industry -- other industry participants in that $200,000 to $300,000 per well. So this is something that we'll be able to not only execute across Pioneer's acreage, but we'll also be able to execute that, I guess, across Parsley's and DoublePoint's acreage. 
The team has also continuing to optimize our development plans to take advantage of existing facilities. So looking at tank batteries, water disposal, salt water disposal gathering system, reuse facilities and really optimizing those as we move into the 2021 -- 2022 program, sorry, to really take advantage of those savings. 
And then as Scott mentioned, one of the other significant benefits of combining Parsley and DoublePoint is really adding to our contiguous acreage position. And what this allows us to do, is we've successfully drilled longer laterals out to 15,000 feet, really up from the 9,000 to 10,000 feet that we've been drilling at, really allow for a lot of locations that we can drill longer laterals on, which is much more capital efficient and really adding essentially the same production by drilling fewer wells. So it's still early, but it should add significant long-term value across our portfolio and just demonstrates the benefit of having contiguous blocking acreage to be able to drill that type of laterals. 
Turning to Slide 12. Really, this just reflects our trend of what we've accomplished on G&A over the past 3 years, including the synergies from the acquisitions. We are forecasting G&A per BOE to be around $1.15 to $1.20 by year-end. And so, I think this is just an example of, really -- and highlights the focus of the company's had on improving returns and improving our return of capital to shareholders. So it's really lowering our overall cost structure. So you've seen us drive down well costs, lower LOE, lower G&A per BOE, lower interest per BOE, all with the idea of improving our free cash flow profile. 
With that, I'll turn it to Neal to talk about breakevens."

Our drilling and completions teams continued their streak of resetting the bar with another great quarter of efficiency gains. 
Our simulfrac operations contributed to these gains with the successful execution of 4 pads in Q1, where we were able to achieve approximately 3,000 feet of completed lateral per day. This is greater than a 50% improvement when compared to our program average. It's still early days, but we estimate savings to be in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 per well. We will continue to refine our simulfrac operations and conduct more trials throughout the second quarter. 
You will note that our wells per pad projection for 2021 is down slightly from last quarter, and this is due to the integration of DoublePoint pads into our schedule. Still, our wells per pad continues to increase, which further contributes to our efficiency gains. 
I know this slide only illustrates improvements in drilling and completions, so I want to emphasize that we are also seeing tremendous performance in our production operations, facilities, construction and water management teams, and none of this would be possible with those that support development planning, our robust supply chain and our expanding use of technology. I also want to thank all the teams for their efficient integration of Parsley and a great start on DoublePoint. We remain focused on delivering peer leading performance, keeping our people safe and reducing our environmental footprint. And so congratulations to all the teams for their contributions to our safe and efficient execution in Q1. 
I'm now going to go to Slide 15. I know that Scott covered this in some detail last quarter, so I'll be brief. So this chart represents more than 64 million barrels of hydrocarbon liquids per day, including the largest national oil companies, majors and independents. Pioneer's operations produced barrels with one of the lowest associated CO2 emissions intensities globally. Our low-cost, low-emissions barrels will continue to be desired around the world.

And so I just think it's a unique model, and I hope all public companies stay disciplined. Because I'm very optimistic about the pricing environment over the next several years. So this is not going to be -- so the price is going to keep going up. I've been stating we're going to bounce around between 50 and 70. But obviously, we're going to be over 70 before we know it. And the one thing that's going to bring it down, it's not going to be supplied this time because U.S. production has moderated.

Really, the plan in 2022 would be roughly around that 5-rig program.

But we've kind of got to roll that forward until then before we -- and kind of get all the pieces together. So it's still early for us to really say what that sustaining capital is to keep production flat long term just because we still need to incorporate and embed all these assets that we've brought together and the growth profile that we have this year.

On the modeling and the accretion. I can tell you the way we approached this. We really did a well-level stick-by-stick, rolling the rigs in, frac leaks in on an annual basis, understanding the synergies that we can bring to bear, both on the Parsley and DoublePoint transactions. Calculating at our operating cash flow, the capital necessarily embedded within those annual years and then the free cash flow that we generated and then apply that in terms of how was it accretive, what did it do to ROCE, what did it do to CROCI. 
And as Scott said earlier, the benefit to ROCE and CROCI were positive. The benefit to free cash flow was a double-digit accretive. And really, what we're looking here and as Scott alluded to, on that Pioneer model. I mean, it really comes back to the model and the assets. The assets and what they provide us and allow us to do is really drive that free cash flow generation with the high-margin wells with the low cost of capital we can bring to bear. 
It's our goal in our ability. When I think about valuation, as you and I have talked about in the past, we look at free cash flow. E&Ps tend to trade in a pretty tight band historically on EBITDA. It's our goal that Pioneer will be able to disaggregate itself from that tight band, which E&Ps trade to trade consistent with other companies and other names and other sectors that generate a high level of free cash flow and return that capital to shareholders. I mean, that is our long-term vision and our long-term goal, really, to drive that appreciation and accretion and have it manifest itself within the stock price by returning that capital to shareholders over the course of time on an annual basis."

The key is there's no extra supply. And so I think the market is going to continue to be tight over the next 2 or 3 years. So for that reason, I think the price will continue to move up. It'll test where demand starts falling off. 
And that if you go back to the '12, '13, '14 time period, even though we had a supply issue there, we're not going to have a supply issue there. The oil price got up to $80 to $100.

Good morning. Obviously, we're very excited after talking about it for 18 months to announce that we are both accelerating our first variable dividend payment into the third quarter this year as well as increasing the payment to reflect 7",930,"Thank you, Neil. Good morning. Obviously, we're very excited after talking about it for 18 months to announce that we are both accelerating our first variable dividend payment into the third quarter this year as well as increasing the payment to reflect 75% of second quarter free cash flow. After payment of the base dividend as our balance sheet continues to strengthen due to higher strip pricing as a result of improved oil demand and a successful vaccine. 
In addition, we had 2 highly accretive transactions that also led us to making this decision and accelerating. 
When combined with the base dividend, total dividend payments in the third quarter will be greater than $2 per share or a total of approximately $490 million returned to shareholders during the third quarter alone. The initiation of our variable dividend payments marks a significant milestone in our investment framework as shareholders will begin receiving material cash return through 8 dividend checks per year. Pioneer's strong execution continued during the second quarter, with production near the top end of guidance, delivering over $600 million of free cash flow, driving estimated 2021 free cash flow up to about $3.2 billion. 
Lastly, Pioneer is the largest producer in the Permian with the largest inventory of Tier 1 locations, over 15,000 and the lowest breakeven price in the Lower 48. Both recent acquisitions were highly accretive and added significant Tier 1 inventory. We were not looking at any more Midland Basin large acquisitions. We bought the best 2 available. Apollo, who was the largest shareholder from Double Point. Our largest shareholder from Double Point has sold down from 13 million shares to about 2 million shares and now less than 1% of the outstanding of the company. 
Going to Slide #4. Pioneer's execution remains strong as total production and oil production were in the upper half of our guidance ranges as we successfully integrated DoublePoint's operations into our program. Horizontal lease operating expense dropped by nearly $0.25 per BOE when compared to the first quarter. In total, Pioneer generated approximately $1 billion in free cash flow in the first half of '21. 
We go on to Slide #5. Our strong balance sheet underpinned by improved oil price outlook supports both the acceleration and increase of our inaugural variable dividend. The first variable dividend will be paid during the third quarter, accelerated from 22% based on second quarter free cash flow. 
Additionally, we are increasing the third quarter variable dividend payment to 75%. Post base dividend free cash flow from the previous 50%. The increase up to 75% in our variable dividend program is approximately 18 months sooner than previously planned. These changes result in over $1 billion of incremental cash to be returned to shareholders in 2021, with total dividends to exceed $6 per share. 
On Slide #6, we remain committed to our core investment thesis, predicated on low leverage, strong corporate returns to average over the next 5 years in the mid-teens, low investment rate, around 50% over the next 5 years and generating significant free cash flow. 
This durable combination creates significant value for our shareholders delivering a mid-teens total return through our stable and growing base dividend, compelling variable dividend program and high-return oil growth up to 5%. Obviously, when you look at 2022, the turn on return is much higher because the oil strip over the next 5 years is about $10 in backwardation. 
When including the base dividend, approximately 80% of the company's free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders through 8 separate dividend checks per year, inclusive of both the base and the variable dividend. We will continue to maintain our pristine balance sheet as we allocate the remaining portion of free cash flow to the balance sheet. 
Going to Slide #7. As you can see on Slide 7, the product of Pioneer's high-quality assets and top-tier capital efficiency, drive significant free cash flow generation amounting to greater than $23 billion through 2026. Again, I want to remind you that the strip is in backwardation. It drops about $10 in backwardation over the next 5 years. 
As come to free cash flow, which is based on current strip pricing, represents greater than 50% of our enterprise value and more than 65% of our market cap. Considering the greater than $23 billion of cumulative free cash flow, this program generates over $18 billion of total dividends through 2026, with the remaining free cash flow allocated towards strengthening our balance sheet, driving net debt to EBITDA to less than 0.5. 
Going to Slide #8, positioning a leading dividend yield across all sectors. The combination of Pioneer's expected free cash flow and return on capital framework creates a compelling investment opportunity with a total dividend yield that will exceed all S&P 500 sectors as well as companies and the average yield of the major oil companies and all other energy companies in the S&P 500. Annualized expected dividends paid in the second half of 2021 leads to a dividend yield of approximately 8%, which increases to 26x to an average greater than 9%, with significant free cash flow. Again, when you look at you just focus on '22, the dividend yield is about 12%. Again, a reminder, the strip with these numbers is about $10 in backwardation. 
This highly competitive yield is underpinned by the greater than $18 billion of cumulative cash returned to shareholders outlined on the previous slide and speaks to the power and underlying quality of Pioneer's assets. 
Let me turn it over to Rich for the outlook."

Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Before I start on the slide, I just wanted to give a special thanks to our entire Pioneer team, including all the great people that came over from the Parsley and DoublePoint. transactions for the excellent job they've done in integrating both transactions this year. While we have a few small items left on DoublePoint, the teams have worked extremely hard and have done a tremendous job seamlessly integrating these operations in a very short period of time. So thank you to all those that are listening. 
Turning to -- and looking at Slide 9. You can see on the slide here, there's no change to our full year oil production guidance range of $351,000 to $366,000of oil per day and total production of 605,000 to 631,000 BOEs per day. 
Similarly, on capital is unchanged at $2.95 billion to $3.25 billion, but we are seeing some inflationary pressure, although most of it is being offset by our efficiency improvements by the great work power drilling and completions and facilities teams. 
Looking at cash flow. You can see what the increase in commodity prices, our forecasted. Operating cash flow has increased to $6.45 billion, and free cash flows increased to $3.2 billion that Scott talked about. Both of those are up $500 million from what we forecasted in our May call related to Q1 earnings. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our plan remains unchanged and is set to average between 22 and 24 drilling rigs for the full year. We are currently running 24 rigs and 8 frac fleets in the Midland Basin. 
In terms of our Delaware plans, we are moving multiple rigs into the Delaware Basin this quarter, and the team is looking forward to bringing the same efficiency gains that we've achieved in the Midland Basin to the Delaware with the goal of further improving well returns, especially given the higher oil cut and lower royalty burden in our Delaware acreage. Just for reference, the Delaware production was 70% oil during Q2. 
As you can see here, with over 1 million acres in the Permian Basin, we have a significant inventory. So we will continue to evaluate opportunities to monetize portions of our longer-dated inventory. As we've done in the past, these monetization opportunities will include small noncore acreage packages as well as evaluating other DrillCo opportunities. 
Turning to Slide 11 and talk about synergies. You can see here from the slide that we have realized $275 million synergy target related to G&A in interest and on both the Parsley and DoublePoint transactions. 
On the operational synergies, we have made great progress with over 50% of the target synergies being identified and being incorporated into future plans. For instance, we have leveraged our supplier relationships, we're seeing savings on pressure pumping, wirelines, cement, casing, among other items. Joey will talk more about it. We've successfully tested our simul frac and have incorporated a second simul frac fleet into our program, which benefits mainly Pioneer, partially in DoublePoint acreage, given our -- leveraging our significant water system that we have across the Midland Basin. 
The teams are also continuing to optimize future development plans to take advantage of existing facilities and infrastructure, including tank batteries, water disposal, reuse facilities, just to name a few. Obviously, this reduces the need for future new builds. 
And lastly, just as examples, which is significant, the team has identified over 1,000 locations that we can drill additional 15,000-foot laterals across our contiguous acreage position that are being incorporated into our future development brands, providing significant improvement in capital efficiency going forward. 
Why don't I stop there, and I'll turn it to Neal."

I'm going to be starting on Slide 13, where our drilling and completions teams have continued their continuous improvement journey. As you can see, since 2017, these 2 teams have seen more than 75% improvement in their completed feet per day and more than 65% improvement in their drill feet per day. This journey is even more impressive when considering our increased activity levels, including the integration of Parsley and DoublePoint. 
As Rich mentioned, we've also seen the continued success of our simulfrac operations. Consequently, we're in the process of starting up our second simulfrac fleet. Our capital projects and production operations teams are working diligently to upgrade partially in DoublePoint facilities to our operational and environmental standards. And our teams are progressing our ESG initiatives by trialing new low-carbon technologies to power our operations. 
As in the past, we're only noting the improvements in drilling and completions, but I want to emphasize that we continue to see tremendous performance in our production operations, construction and water management teams. 
And as always, none of this will be possible without the great effort from our development planning team, our robust supply chain and other groups that support our operations. We continue to remain focused on keeping our employees and contractor partners safe, delivering peer-leading performance and reducing our environmental footprint. Congrats to the entire Pioneer team for our safe and efficient execution in Q2. 
I'm now going to move to Slide 14. Here, you can see the results of Pioneer's long-standing commitment to meeting high environmental standards by our top-tier flaring intensity and best-in-class CO2 intensity compared to U.S. peers and majors. This was only made possible through years of thoughtful planning and investments to minimize our emissions at our facilities, coupled with our comprehensive leak detection and repair program, which includes routine aerial surveys. 
Despite our leadership position, Pioneer's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 25% and methane emissions intensity by 40% through 2030, demonstrates our commitment to further increasing our environmental standards. 
And now moving to Slide 15 and continuing the storyline from the previous slide. Pioneer also produces extremely low emission intensity oil on a global scale. This, combined with our low breakeven results and exceptionally resilient production that we expect will have a place in the global marketplace for a very long time. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Scott to wrap things up."

I think one of the most important points with the recent Rystad report, the Permian Basin has declined over the last 18 months as since we've been talking about it from about a B a day to less than 200 million a day in regard to flaring. So people are focused on reducing flaring to less than 1%, almost all companies. 
We continue the biggest flares, continue to be the private companies in the Permian, and we need to continue to ask you in regard to if you find your private equity. We got to put pressure on the private companies in the Permian Basin.

So we can go on and produce 5% growth and deliver strong yields for the next several years. So it should be the go-to energy stock. If you're focused on dividends. we're focused on dividends primarily, it was because of the feedback when we talked to all of our shareholders back over the last 18 months, that was the focus feedback that we got. They really don't want buybacks. They want to take the dividends and buy back our stock, they can do that. They want the ability to invest the dividends in any stock they want to was the feedback that we got. So that's why we're focused and we have the greatest payout up to 75%. So the variability, obviously, will be commodity price. One of the feedbacks we will ask for, we do not plan to do any hedging in regard to the variable dividend. If we do any hedging, it will be at the very, very low end. It will be to protect the capital budget and balance sheet.

One of the questions I get quite often because of the great success we've seen on simulfrac is why not convert all of our fleets to simulfrac. And there's a couple of things that limit that. One. is logistics, particularly around water because we basically doubled the water requirements in one area if all of our frac fleets were working under some frac operations, we'd have to spend a significant amount of capital to upgrade our water systems and of course, logistics around the sand as well. But the other maybe more trivial matter is also the number of wells on the pad. If you have an odd number of wells on the pad, it can have a slight impact on the efficiency. But primarily, we want to make sure that we're efficiently deploying capital and we're getting the bang for the buck.

Secondly, it was a great transaction. In regard to buybacks, I'm listening to the shareholder base. As we drive our debt-to-EBITDA below one, I've stated already in prior conference calls, that the -- we will definitely be subject to Board approval. We'll be buying back stock when we see dislocations. So I'm a firm believer when we're at the bottom of the markets like we saw last year, I want to have one of the best balance sheets, so I can buy a lot of stock at $50. And so I think buying it at today's price, I think I'd rather distribute all of our cash flow, 75% or 80% of it back to the investor. So I sort of agree with you, but at the same time, I'd rather save my firepower if we see -- I hope we don't see dislocations like we saw last year in the marketplace.

I'd rather buy shares all day long at $50 instead of using firepower to buy shares at 140 or 150 million, I'd rather not risk the balance sheet and distribute 80% of our free cash flow back to the investor.

And so that is how I would, from a modeling perspective, look at it going forward. On inflation, we are seeing some pressure and fortunately, our efficiency improvements and our long-term contracts have dampened that. But overall, we're seeing it in tubulars, diesel, cement, chemicals, but we're also starting to see a little bit in labor as well. And so for this year, we're projecting what I'd call in the mid-single digits of inflation, most of which were offsetting with efficiencies. But in the back half of this year, we do expect that to grow to about 10%. And so that's something that we'll have to look at in 2022 of where do we see inflation versus what efficiency gains we've been able to capture this year. So we're still going to be highly focused on getting efficiency gains, but I do think inflation is going to play a part in our '22 capital budget."

Good morning. Obviously, we're very excited after talking about it for 18 months to announce that we are both accelerating our first variable dividend payment into the third quarter this year as well as increasing the payment to reflect 7",934,"Thank you, Neal. Good morning. Obviously, we're very excited after talking about it for 18 months to announce that we are both accelerating our first variable dividend payment into the third quarter this year as well as increasing the payment to reflect 75% of second quarter free cash flow. After payment of the base dividend as our balance sheet continues to strengthen due to higher strip pricing as a result of improved oil demand and a successful vaccine.  
In addition, we had 2 highly accretive transactions that also led us to making this decision and accelerating. When combined with the base dividend, total dividend payments in the third quarter will be greater than $2 per share, or a total of approximately $490 million return to shareholders during the third quarter alone. The initiation of our variable dividend payments marks a significant milestone in our investment framework as shareholders will begin receiving material cash return through 8 dividend checks per year. Pioneer's strong execution continued during the second quarter, with production near the top end of guidance, delivering over $600 million of free cash flow, driving estimated 2021 free cash flow up to about $3.2 billion.  
Lastly, Pioneer is the largest producer in the Permian, with the largest inventory of Tier 1 locations, over 15,000, and the lowest breakeven price in the Lower 48. Both recent acquisitions were highly accretive and added significant Tier 1 inventory. We were not looking at any more Midland Basin large acquisitions. We bought the best 2 available. Apollo, who was the largest shareholder from DoublePoint, our largest shareholder from DoublePoint has sold out from 13 million shares to about 2 million shares and now less than 1% of the outstanding of the company.  
Going to Slide #4. Pioneer's execution remains strong as total production and oil production were in the upper half of our guidance ranges as we successfully integrated DoublePoint's operations into our program. Horizontal lease operating expense dropped by nearly $0.25 per BOE when compared to the first quarter. In total, Pioneer generated approximately $1 billion in free cash flow in the first half of '21.  
We go on to Slide #5. Our strong balance sheet underpinned by improved oil price outlook supports both the acceleration and increase of our inaugural variable dividend. The first variable dividend will be paid during the third quarter, and accelerated from 22%, will be based on second quarter free cash flow.  
Additionally, we are increasing the third quarter variable dividend payment to 75%, post base dividend free cash flow from the previous 50%. The increase up to 75% in our variable dividend program is approximately 18 months sooner than previously planned. These changes result in over $1 billion of incremental cash to be returned to shareholders in 2021, with total dividends to exceed $6 per share.  
On Slide #6, we remain committed to our core investment thesis, predicated on low leverage, strong corporate returns to average over the next 5 years in the mid-teens, low investment rate, around 50% over the next 5 years and generating significant free cash flow.  
This durable combination creates significant value for our shareholders delivering a mid-teens total return through our stable and growing base dividend, compelling variable dividend program and high-return oil growth up to 5%. Obviously, when you look at 2022, the turn on return is much higher because the oil strip over the next 5 years is about $10 in backwardation.  
When including the base dividend, approximately 80% of the company's free cash flow is expected to be returned to shareholders through 8 separate dividend checks per year, inclusive of both the base and the variable dividend. We will continue to maintain our pristine balance sheet as we allocate the remaining portion of free cash flow to the balance sheet.  
Going to Slide #7. As you can see on Slide 7, the product of Pioneer's high-quality assets and top-tier capital efficiency drive significant free cash flow generation amounting to greater than $23 billion through 2026. Again, I want to remind you that the strip is in backwardation. It drops about $10 in backwardation over the next 5 years.  
Let's get into free cash flow, which is based on current strip pricing, represents greater than 50% of our enterprise value and more than 65% of our market cap. Considering the greater than $23 billion of cumulative free cash flow, this program generates over $18 billion of total dividends through 2026, with the remaining free cash flow allocated towards strengthening our balance sheet, driving net debt to EBITDA to less than 0.5.  
Going to Slide #8, positioning a leading dividend yield across all sectors, the combination of Pioneer's expected free cash flow and return on capital framework creates a compelling investment opportunity with a total dividend yield that will exceed all S&P 500 sectors as well as companies and the average yield of the major oil companies and all other energy companies in the S&P 500. Annualized expected dividends paid in the second half of 2021 leads to a dividend yield of approximately 8%, which increases '22 to '26 time period to an average greater than 9% due significant free cash flow. Again, when you look at you just focus on '22, the dividend yield is about 12%. Again, a reminder, the strip with these numbers is about $10 in backwardation.  
This highly competitive yield is underpinned by the greater than $18 billion of cumulative cash returned to shareholders outlined on the previous slide and speaks to the power and underlying quality of Pioneer's assets.  
Let me turn it over to Rich for the outlook."

Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Before I start to the slide, I just wanted to give a special thanks to our entire Pioneer team, including all the great people that came over from the Parsley and DoublePoint transactions, for the excellent job they",616,"Great. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Before I start to the slide, I just wanted to give a special thanks to our entire Pioneer team, including all the great people that came over from the Parsley and DoublePoint transactions, for the excellent job they've done in integrating both transactions this year. While we have a few small items left on DoublePoint, the teams have worked extremely hard and have done a tremendous job and seamlessly integrating these operations in a very short period of time. So thank you to all those that are listening. 
Turning to and looking at Slide 9. You can see on the slide here, there's no change to our full year oil production guidance range of $351,000 to $366,000 barrels of oil per day and total production of 605,000 to 631,000 BOEs per day. 
Similarly, on capital, it's unchanged at $2.95 billion to $3.25 billion, but we are seeing some inflationary pressure, although most of it is being offset by our efficiency improvements by the great work power of drilling and completions and facilities teams. 
Looking at cash flow. You can see with the increase in commodity prices, our forecasted Operating cash flow has increased to $6.45 billion, and free cash flows increased to $3.2 billion that Scott talked about. Both of those are up $500 million from what we forecasted in our May call related to Q1 earnings. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our plan remains unchanged and is set to average between 22 and 24 drilling rigs for the full year. We are currently running 24 rigs and 8 frac fleets in the Midland Basin. 
In terms of our Delaware plans, we are moving multiple rigs into the Delaware Basin this quarter, and the team is looking forward to bringing the same efficiency gains that we've achieved in the Midland Basin to the Delaware with the goal of further improving well returns, especially given the higher oil cut and lower royalty burden in our Delaware acreage. Just for reference, the Delaware production was 70% oil during Q2. 
As you can see here, with over 1 million acres in the Permian Basin, we have a significant inventory. So we will continue to evaluate opportunities to monetize portions of our longer-dated inventory. As we've done in the past, these monetization opportunities will include small noncore acreage packages as well as evaluating other DrillCo opportunities. 
Turning to Slide 11 and talk about synergies. You can see here from the slide that we have realized $275 million synergy target related to G&A in interest and on both the Parsley and DoublePoint transactions. 
On the operational synergies, we've made great progress with over 50% of the target synergies being identified and being incorporated into future plans. For instance, we have leveraged our supplier relationships, we're seeing savings on pressure pumping, wirelines, cement, casing, among other items. Joey will talk more about it. We've successfully tested our simul frac and have incorporated a second simul frac fleet into our program, which benefits mainly Pioneer, partially in DoublePoint acreage, given our -- leveraging our significant water system that we have across the Midland Basin. 
The teams are also continuing to optimize future development plans to take advantage of existing facilities and infrastructure, including tank batteries, water disposal, reuse facilities, just to name a few. Obviously, this reduces the need for future new builds. 
And lastly, just as examples which is significant, the team has identified over 1,000 locations that we can drill additional 15,000-foot laterals across our contiguous acreage position that are being incorporated into our future development plans, providing significant improvement in capital efficiency going forward. 
Why don't I stop there, and I'll turn it to Neal."

I'm going to be starting on Slide 13, where our drilling and completions teams have continued their continuous improvement journey. As you can see, since 2017, these 2 teams have seen more than 75% improvement in their completed feet per day and more than 65% improvement in their drill feet per day. This journey is even more impressive when considering our increased activity levels, including the integration of Parsley and DoublePoint. 
As Rich mentioned, we've also seen the continued success of our simul frac operations. Consequently, we're in the process of starting up our second simul frac fleet. Our capital projects and production operations teams are working diligently to upgrade partially in DoublePoint facilities to our operational and environmental standards. And our teams are progressing our ESG initiatives by trialing new low-carbon technologies to power our operations. 
As in the past, we're only noting the improvements in drilling and completions, but I want to emphasize that we continue to see tremendous performance in our production operations, construction and water management teams. 
And as always, none of this will be possible without the great effort from our development planning team, our robust supply chain and other groups that support our operations. We continue to remain focused on keeping our employees and contractor partners safe, delivering peer-leading performance and reducing our environmental footprint. Congrats to the entire Pioneer team for our safe and efficient execution in Q2. 
I'm now going to move to Slide 14. Here, you can see the results of Pioneer's long-standing commitment to meeting high environmental standards by our top-tier flaring intensity and best-in-class CO2 intensity compared to U.S. peers and majors. This was only made possible through years of thoughtful planning and investments to minimize our emissions at our facilities, coupled with our comprehensive leak detection and repair program, which includes routine aerial surveys. 
Despite our leadership position, Pioneer's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 25% and methane emissions intensity by 40% through 2030, demonstrates our commitment to further increasing our environmental standards. 
And now moving to Slide 15 and continuing the storyline from the previous slide. Pioneer also produces extremely low emission intensity oil on a global scale. This, combined with our low breakeven results and exceptionally resilient production that we expect, will have a place in the global marketplace for a very long time. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Scott to wrap things up."

I think one of the most important points with the recent Rystad report, the Permian Basin has declined over the last 18 months as we've been talking about it from about $1 billion a day to less than 200 million a day in regard to flaring. So people are focused on reducing flaring to less than 1% for most oil companies. 
We continue -- the biggest flares continue to be the private companies in the Permian, and we need to continue to ask you in regard to if you find your private equity, we got to put pressure on the private companies in the Permian Basin.

But our long-term intention is to pay up to 75% of free cash flow every quarter for the next several years. That's how we're running our business. 
With the number of locations that we have, we have over 15,000 locations. We're drilling roughly about probably around 500 a year. So we have probably the largest inventory of anybody out there. So we can go on and produce 5% growth and deliver strong yields for the next several years. So it should be the go-to energy stock if you're focused on dividends. We're focused on dividends, primarily, it was because of the feedback when we talked to all of our shareholders back over the last 18 months, that was the focus feedback that we got. They really don't want buybacks. If they want to take the dividends and buy back our stock, they can do that. They want the ability to invest the dividends in any stock they want to was the feedback that we got. 
So that's why we're focused and we have the greatest payout up to 75%. So the variability, obviously, will be commodity price. One of the feedbacks we will ask for, we do not plan to do any hedging in regard to the variable dividend. If we do any hedging, it will be, at the very, very low end, it will be to protect the capital budget and balance sheet. If shareholders want us to protect the variable dividend, they'll have to give us that feedback in regard to hedging. I'll stop there."

One of the questions I get quite often because of the great success we've seen on simul frac is why not convert all of our fleets to simul frac. And there's a couple of things that limit that. One is logistics, particularly around water because we basically doubled the water requirements in one area. If all of our frac fleets were working under simul frac operations, we'd have to spend a significant amount of capital to upgrade our water systems and, of course, logistics around the sand as well. 
But the other maybe more trivial matter is also the number of wells on the pad. If you have an odd number of wells on the pad, it can have a slight impact on the efficiency. But primarily, we want to make sure that we're efficiently deploying capital and we're getting the bang for the buck. So water logistics is probably the single most impactful thing that we look at to deploying simul frac."

Secondly, it was a great transaction. In regard to buybacks, I'm listening to the shareholder base.

So I'm a firm believer when we're at the bottoms of the markets, like we saw last year, I want to have one of the best balance sheets, so I can buy a lot of stock at $50. And so I think buying it at today's price, I think I'd rather distribute all of our cash flow, 75% or 80% of it back to the investor. So I sort of agree with you, but at the same time, I'd rather save my firepower if we see -- I hope we don't see dislocations like we saw last year in the marketplace.

What I'd tell you is our Q3 guidance is right where we expected it to be. And so -- and it takes into account our focus on being capital efficient and making sure that our -- we're not overspending capital on facilities and choking back wells. So we still, as we've talked about in the past, have agreed the choke wells to be capital efficient, and therefore, we have lower IP rates and flatter declines. But also, it takes into account this integration capital that we're spending to upgrade the Parsley and DoublePoint facilities and the time that those are down. So it factors all that in. And so really, no change to what we've forecasted for the full year production guidance is exactly where we are in Q3 is what we would have expected."

I think, obviously, you can see from the headlines on Slide 3, that's probably one of the best quarters in Pioneer's 25-year history, which is coming up next year, our 25th year anniversary. It's hard to imagine a company like Pioneer thrown out just in 1 quarter, $1.1 billion in free cash flow, obviously, during the quarter. And returning $880 million of that in regard to a dividend, including base plus variable. 
Our dividend payments from the third quarter is $3.58 a share made up of $3.02 variable and $0.56 on the base. Probably the big headline from the quarter, tremendous transaction for Pioneer divesting of our Delaware assets for $3.25 billion. Expected to close by year-end. And when you add the $250 million recent divestiture from Glasscock County, that makes a total for the quarter of about $3.5 billion. 
We're increasing our base after talking to a lot of our shareholders over the last several weeks. I think it's very important to continue to increase our base. So we're increasing at over 10%. That will commence in January with that base dividend payment. And we continue to look at the significant increases over the next few years as our balance sheet continues to improve and if commodity prices continue to perform like they have been. 
Then lastly, again, Neal talked about it. We released our two reports. We'll talk about it later. But again, increasing our goals to 50% in greenhouse gas intensity reduction and 75% in regard to methane intensity. 
Turning next on Slide #4. Again, production in the upper half of the third quarter guidance. Rich will give you more detail in a few minutes in regard to the effect of what the Delaware sale does to us. 
I think the most important point here with the -- both divestitures of Glasscock County and the Delaware, obviously, we're now focused on the high-margin, high-return Midland Basin. We'll end up having the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. A debt-to-EBITDA 0.4 by the end of the year. 
Going to our long-term thesis on Slide #5. Again, our focus to deliver mid-teens total return. When you look at one of the later slides, with a dividend yield of about 11% going to 2022, growing at 5% a year, that gets us to that mid-teens total return. When you look at just return on capital employed and ROCE going into '22 and beyond, we're in that low to mid-20s on both of those numbers. That's really unheard of in regard to the change in the strategy to keep production fairly flat, minimal growth and return most of the cash flow back to the investor. 
Reinvestment rate of 50% to 60% when you look at next year. It's really down in the 30% to 40% range. When you look at free cash flow generation, our free cash flow generation next year will be up 88% from 2021. When you look at a 5-year strip, we'll generate over $25 billion of free cash flow. If you just take current oil price today in the low 80s. The mid-80s, and keep it flat for the next 5 years, we're over $35 billion of free cash flow. 
When you just look at the strip pricing by the end of next year, we'll essentially, for the first time, be essentially debt-free by the end of 2022. So Pioneer will end up continuing to have one of the best balance sheets in the industry. 
As I mentioned in regard to our strong and growing annual base dividend, we went up over 10%. And we see, as long as our balance sheet stays in great shape, which we expect, commodity prices continue to stay strong. We'll continue to look at increases over and above our growth rate of 5%. 
Again, the variable dividend, up to 75% of previous quarter's free cash flow of deducting the base dividend. We'll be distributing about 80% of free cash flow back to the shareholders. 
Again, we restated we had a share repurchase program where we had spent about $900 million in 2019 and 2020. We actually are one of the few companies that bought during the pandemic, our stock back in the energy sector. We spent about $900 million and bought the stock back around $130 million. 
If you go back in history, the other time we bought our stock was back in 2005, 2006 after we sold our deepwater assets. We spent $1.1 billion at 45. 
We do think it's important over the next 5 years if we do generate $25 billion to $35 billion of free cash flow that we significantly reduce the share count over time. But it is going to be opportunistic during market dislocations. 
I think the last key point here is that the fact our EBITDA will be up about 45% to 50% next year, primarily due to the full year of both acquisitions and secondly, with very minimal hedging in 2022. 
Going to Slide #6. Again, significant increases in our variable dividend and also our base dividend. [ Obviously ], a 9x growth from '22 annual dividend over the 2020. Returning $1.6 billion in dividends in 2021, a 3x increase from 2020. So we're estimating something near about $20 per share total payout in 2022. 
When you go to Slide #7 to show Pioneer's dividend yield. It will exceed all peers and majors in the S&P 500. We're already at 8% just based on the one we declared for the fourth quarter of 2021. When you look at next year, we'll be 11%. The other two strong companies below us, obviously, are [ Debit and Cutera ] with strong variable dividends. But then you see a significant drop to the U.S. majors, European majors. Our dividend yield is over 2x versus the U.S. and European majors. 
And when you look over the rest of the peers, excluding [ Devon and Cotera ], we're basically a 10x dividend times or 10 higher over the rest of the peers. When you look at the S&P 500, which is around 1.6%, we're over 6x to 7x the S&P 500. 
I'll now turn it over to Neal to talk about our base."

Slide 8 demonstrates maintaining a strong and growing base dividend is a commitment to our shareholders and a key pillar of our investment thesis. 
As Scott stated earlier, we are further strengthening our base dividend with an increase of greater than 10%, which is an acceleration of our 2022 base dividend increase. Inclusive of this increase, as you can see in the graph, our 5-year base dividend compound annual growth rate of greater than 95% exceeds all peers and U.S. majors. Additionally, over the same period, while many peers have cut or suspended their base dividends, Pioneer has consistently maintained and grown its base dividend, demonstrating our steadfast commitment to our shareholders and creating value through dependable through-cycle return of capital. 
Turning to the next page, Slide 9. Even with inflationary pressures surfacing in 2021, we continue to reduce our controllable cash costs, which are comprised of cash interest, cash G&A and Midland horizontal LOE. As a result of our high operational efficiencies and acquisition synergy capture, we expect 2021 cash cost to be approximately 30% lower than 2019 levels. Pioneer's unique combination of high oil cut, low controllable cash costs and top-tier NRI drive compelling cash margins that underpin our strong free cash flow generation and return of capital strategies. 
Now I will hand it over to Rich to cover our outlook update."

Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 10, where we show our updated production guidance for 2021. You'll see here that we've narrowed our full year production -- oil production range to 356,000 to 359,000 barrels of oil per da",604,"Thanks, Neal. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 10, where we show our updated production guidance for 2021. You'll see here that we've narrowed our full year production -- oil production range to 356,000 to 359,000 barrels of oil per day and total production to 613,000 to 619,000 BOEs per day. This narrowed guidance reflects the combination of our reported production through September 30, and our Q4 guidance, which includes the impact of the Glasscock divestitures that happened in October. 
Due to the Delaware divestiture not closing until near year-end, our production guidance includes Delaware for a full year. And our capital guidance is unchanged, but also includes Delaware for a full year as well. 
I did see in the notes over the night that there was a couple of comments on our third quarter capital. I just wanted to hit that upfront that our capital in Q3 did include a fair amount of integration work that we did related to the Parsley and Double Point assets where we are upgrading their tank batteries and facilities to our standards. So that's what was driving a little higher capital. 
If you move to the fourth quarter, our capital is expected to come down as we do have less integration activity and will be on average running one less rig and one less frac fleet during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. As Scott mentioned and Neal's talked about, we did announce the Delaware divestiture. As you can see from the slide here, about $3.25 billion of cash consideration. About 92,000 net acres is being sold. And production currently is running about 50,000 BOEs per day. We did have some drilling program there. And so if you -- once those wells are completed, first quarter, that will be about 55,000 BOEs a day of production once those are completed in the first quarter placed on production. As we've mentioned, the transaction is expected to close at year-end. Post this transaction, it does return Pioneer to being 100% focused on our core acreage position in the high-margin, high-return Midland Basin. 
Also, we did announce -- or closed in October, the 20,000 net acres sale of our Glasscock County acreage to Laredo for about $230 million, monetizing our long-dated inventory that we weren't going to get to for a while. At the time of the sale, this acreage had -- was producing about 4,400 BOEs a day, or 2,600 barrels of oil per day. So on a combined basis, we're divesting about $3.5 billion of assets in the fourth quarter this year, which will further strengthen our balance sheet. 
Similar to these transactions, we will continue to pursue strategic acreage trades. And we'll continue to evaluate drill codes and small-scale divestments on long-dated inventory to accelerate value to shareholders. 
So looking forward to 2022, and after adjusting for both Delaware and Glasscock divestitures, we do expect to keep our Midland Basin production relatively flat with Q4 levels. So we're seeing 2022 production adjusted for the divestitures at 355,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil per day, or 630,000 to 640,000 BOEs per day. This is expected to result in a 2022 annual oil growth rate consistent with our long-term investment framework of growing production between 0% and 5%. 
And I might also note that as we look at 2022 capital, we are still in the midst of evaluating that. We were expecting to spend about $250 million to $300 million in the Delaware Basin to grow production there starting in 2022. 
So I'll stop there and turn it over to Joey for more details on operations."

Our 2021 plan remains unchanged and has set average between 22 and 24 rigs for the full year. We did mobilized several rigs to the Delaware in Q3, which I would equate to approximately one rig for the full year. 
Drilling and completions continue their strong track record of efficiency gains with greater than 70% and 80% increases on their respective foot per day metrics when compared to 2017. We are still operating two -- frac fleets, which further increases efficiencies and is reducing cost. Our drilling and completions teams are also successfully executing on 15,000-foot laterals. And at the same time, our land and development planning teams continue adding future 15k laterals across our acreage position. Once again, congrats to the team for great execution in Q3. 
I'm going to move on to Slide 13. Pioneer's been committed to sustainable operations for a long time, and this has resulted in Pioneer having one of the lowest current emissions intensities amongst our peers. 
As you can see, Pioneer's 2019 starting point is lower than the majority of our peers' projected intensities for 2025 and 2030. And Pioneer's 2030 emissions intensity goals represent one of the most aggressive reduction targets in the industry, demonstrating continued progress on our trajectory to net zero. This was only made possible through years of thoughtful planning and investments to minimize emissions at our facilities, coupled with our comprehensive leak detection and repair program, including routine aerial surveys. 
Now moving to Slide 14 and continuing with the same storyline from the previous slide. Pioneer also produces extremely low emission intensity oil on a global scale, which will improve as we progress toward our 2030 reduction targets. This, combined with our low breakeven results and exceptionally resilient production that we expect will compete in the global marketplace for a very long time. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Scott to wrap things up."

We've had significant reduction from our baseline in '19 to '20, as indicated with our progress, 27%, 50 and 50. I think we're one of the only companies that has targets for fresh water -- reducing freshwater and completions in the U.S. 
Our new targets are 50% by 2030 for greenhouse gas emissions for both Scope 1 and 2, and 75% for methane. And previously, it was 40%. Also, 2020 flaring intensity was 0.2%, significantly less than our goal of 1%. Again, we expect to end routine flaring, as defined by the World Bank, by 2030 with aspiration to accomplish it by 2025. And as Neal said, we just recently published our first climate risk report. 
Going to Slide #16. We've been focused on ESG leadership. I think you can see the significant changes we made over the last 2 years in our annual incentive compensation components for all the executives. I'm still the only CEO in the industry that is 100% tied to performance shares. Most of other executives, it's around 60%. 
You can see that we've increased our targets on ESG and HSE up to 20% last year. Goals are 100% aligned with shareholders' interest. 
We expanded the responsibilities of the Board of Directors Sustainability and Climate Oversight Committee, which is led by our Non-Executive Chairman, Ken Thompson. And we recently added a second Director this year, [ Maria Jelescu  Dreyfus ], who has two key focuses: One on ESG; and secondly, was the Managing Director for Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and an expert in asset management over the last several years. Again, we have a picture of our two reports. We encourage everyone to read these reports. 
Going to the last slide. Enhancing shareholder value, Slide #17. Again, focused on returns. And just to remind you, I mentioned that we'll be in the low to mid-20s on both ROCE and also CROCE. Capital discipline, I mentioned that we'll be returning roughly -- or spending about 30% to 40% over the next several years is our reinvestment rate. Return on capital to our shareholders I mentioned that we have about $25 billion to $35 billion in a couple of different price cases, strip and flat price. We'll be returning about 80% of that back to shareholders, plus any buybacks that we do during that time period. 
Preserving a strong balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier. We'll have the best balance sheet in the company's history by the end of this quarter. And secondly, moving to zero debt by the end of 2022. 
Significant inventory. We probably got the largest and longest inventory of any company in the U.S. today. And we continue on ESE leadership to be performing at the highest level. 
I'm going to stop there. We'll open it up for Q&A."

I think as Scott mentioned, the reinvestment rate is in that 30% to 40% of cash flow projections for 2022. When you think about inflation, similar to what I've talked about before, we have seen some upward pressure mainly on materials when you think about tubulars, diesel, cement, sand, chemicals and we're starting to see some in labor as it's gotten a little tighter on the labor side. We've been able to offset that with some efficiency improvements, and our long-term contracts helped dampen that impact. 
But overall, for the year, we're expecting to see mid-single-digit inflation for the year with -- probably as we move towards the end of the year, closer to 10% inflation, which will push us up in our capital guidance range towards probably the higher end of that capital range. 
As you look at 2022, we're looking at probably something in the mid-single digits from an inflationary standpoint. And hopefully, we'll still be able to offset and we still plan to offset some of that with efficiency gains. 
But having said all that, I think with the higher commodity prices, we'll still be able to offset the inflation and really still allow for stronger overall margins, which is driving up -- or allowing us our reinvestment rate to come down from the 50% to 60% to 30% to 40% for 2022."

I stated already on the buybacks, we like to reduce shares significantly. But I'd like to do it at a good price. We think definitely we'll be buying back [ creep ].

So can you talk about how you think buybacks create the most value for Pioneer shareholders, meaning you say that you'll execute opportunistic buybacks during market dislocation. Does that really refer to just crude price dislocations? Or would you consider doing buybacks that are more correlated to keeping leverage, say, at that half a turn?"

And it's -- I'd rather buy a lot more shares when they're dislocated. And if you look at our price, we had several dislocations during 2021. And so you'll see us go into the market when you see those dislocations. So I expect to be several dislocations. And at the end of the day, over a 5-year time period, we hope to reduce the share count by at least 10%. We should be able to, if we see the type of prices that are out there in the strip or in the -- just a flat price case. So that's what our hope happens and that's what should happen."

If you look at the strip, the front month WTI is kind of $83, and you go out 5 years and it's $59. So almost a $25 drop on WTI. 
So really, no plans today. And from talking to shareholders, they agree with that, really no reason to hedge in this environment. And you really just can't hedge out anything long term.

I mean, obviously, we'd love to see that move down as we continue to capture some of these efficiency gains and get better at what we're doing. So overall, I think it's going to be very similar to what we've talked about in the past. 
On the POP side of things, for 2021, what I'd say is there's obviously a lot of noise this year with the two acquisitions. And a lot of it is just timing of whether those wells were popped under prior to us closing the transaction or after. And so we expected a number of the wells that we ended up popping. The Double Point would have popped before we got to closing. And so I wouldn't read too much into that and it's just timing of who's watched where those wells under is why we got to higher pop count.

If you think about from the Delaware perspective, if you look at the book value that we booked, it was [ $4.1 billion ] due to purchase accounting. We had a carryover tax base of $1.9 billion on those assets. 
So if you think about the proceeds of, let's call it, $3.25 billion, you will have adjustments that we make due to the effective date, we would expect to book loss of approximately $1 billion and a taxable gain of approximately $1.2 billion. So a little bit difference there between the book and the tax. 
Now if you're referencing Scott's discussion on debt and debt retirement and use of proceeds, if you look at the debt towers in the appendix, in 2022, we have about $244 million. That's roughly, call it, 4% debt. In 2023, $750 million, that's 55 basis points. And 2024, it's $750 million at 75 basis points. Now that 2024 is callable in 2022. 
So if you think about the free cash flow profile, that Scott's articulated and the return of capital that we've discussed, we actually have it staggered into the model repaying that debt. So really already is a factor into how we talk about return of capital. Any acceleration of free cash flow or increase in free cash flow due to greater commodity prices really would provide that opportunity to get that net debt lower and pay down our gross debt as well, which really then what Scott said, free up more of the balance sheet to be opportunistic with buybacks. 
And Scott articulated 0.5x is kind of that target. I'd say that we kind of look at the long-term target. Well, by the end of the year, due to the divestiture, we'll be at 0.4. So it kind of sets us up in a good position to be opportunistic as we look forward to 2022. And as you and I all know, never on this call, the market is highly volatile. There's always opportunities within the market to buy back stock. And if you look at energy as potentially being higher beta, I'd say that provides even more entry points. 
So it's our shareholders' money. That's how we think about it. We try to be really smart and thoughtful in terms of how we allocate capital and we return capital to shareholders. So I think you'll see that from us as we move forward into 2022."

And whenever you look at that on an individual well basis, it may not be big bucks, but when you multiply that times 500, it turns into huge dollars. 
Another on the drilling side, we have a stuck pipe predictive tool where we've gone back and looked at the events where we've had stuck pipe in the drilling activity.

So I would just say that was normal course. And drilling those wells was on the schedule and planned and we are going to proceed ahead. 
In terms of the asset, it's kind of catch '22 in the sense of that's higher oil cut. And so obviously, you get a higher oil price on a bigger part of those barrels, but it did have higher operating cost. And so margin-wise, in a higher price environment, it was very competitive with what was in the Midland Basin. But in a lower price environment, clearly the margins were better in Midland. 
So that's really from a standpoint of free cash flow generation and cash flow generation of assets stacks up. And in terms of the cash flow basis, I don't have the exact third quarter numbers. So we'd have to get back to you on that."

Good morning.

It's hard to imagine a company li",1038,"Thank you, Neal. Good morning. I think, obviously, you can see from the headlines on Slide 3, that's probably one of the best quarters in Pioneer's 25-year history, which is coming up next year, our 25th year anniversary. It's hard to imagine a company like Pioneer thrown out just in 1 quarter, $1.1 billion in free cash flow, obviously, during the quarter. 
And returning $880 million of that in regard to a dividend, including base plus variable. Our dividend payments from the third quarter is $3.58 a share made up of $3.02 variable and $0.56 on the base. Probably the big headline from the quarter, tremendous transaction for Pioneer divesting of our Delaware assets for $3.25 billion. Expected to close by year-end. And when you add the $250 million recent divestiture from Glasscock County, that makes a total for the quarter of about $3.5 billion. 
We're increasing our base after talking to a lot of our shareholders over the last several weeks. I think it's very important to continue to increase our base. So we're increasing at over 10%. That will commence in January with that base dividend payment. And we continue to look at the significant increases over the next few years as our balance sheet continues to improve and if commodity prices continue to perform like they have been. 
Then lastly, again, Neal talked about it. We released our two reports. We'll talk about it later. But again, increasing our goals to 50% in greenhouse gas intensity reduction and 75% in regard to methane intensity. 
Turning the next on Slide #4. Again, production in the upper half of the third quarter guidance. Rich will give you more detail in a few minutes in regard to the effect of what the Delaware sale does to us. 
I think the most important point here with the -- both divestitures of Glasscock County and the Delaware, obviously, we're now focused on the high-margin, high-return Midland Basin. We'll end up having the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. A debt-to-EBITDA of 0.4 by the end of the year. 
Going to our long-term thesis on Slide #5. Again, our focus to deliver mid-teens total return. When you look at one of the later slides, with a dividend yield of about 11% going to 2022, growing at 5% a year, that gets us to that mid-teens total return. When you look at just return on capital employed and ROCE going into '22 and beyond, we're in that low to mid-20s on both of those numbers. 
That's really unheard of in regard to the change in the strategy to keep production fairly flat, minimal growth and return most of the cash flow back to the investor. 
Reinvestment rate of 50% to 60% when you look at next year. It's really down in the 30% to 40% range. When you look at free cash flow generation, our free cash flow generation next year will be up 88% from 2021. When you look at a 5-year strip, we'll generate over $25 billion of free cash flow. If you just take current oil price today in the low 80s. The mid-80s, and keep it flat for the next 5 years, we're over $35 billion of free cash flow. 
When you just look at the strip pricing by the end of next year, we'll essentially, for the first time, be essentially debt-free by the end of 2022. So Pioneer will end up continuing to have one of the best balance sheets in the industry. 
As I mentioned in regard to our strong and growing annual base dividend, we went up over 10%. And we see, as long as our balance sheet stays in great shape, which we expect, commodity prices continue to stay strong. We'll continue to look at increases over and above our growth rate of 5%. 
Again, the variable dividend, up to 75% of previous quarter's free cash flow of deducting the base dividend. We'll be distributing about 80% of free cash flow back to the shareholders. 
Again, we restated we had a share repurchase program where we had spent about $900 million in 2019 and 2020. We actually are one of the few companies that bought during the pandemic, our stock back in the energy sector. We spent about $900 million and bought the stock back around $130 million. 
If you go back in history, the other time we bought our stock was back in 2005, 2006 after we sold our deepwater assets. We spent $1.1 billion at [ 45% ]. 
We do think it's important over the next 5 years if we do generate $25 billion to $35 billion of free cash flow that we significantly reduce the share count over time. But it is going to be opportunistic during market dislocations. 
I think the last key point here is that the fact our EBITDA will be up about 45% to 50% next year, primarily due to the full year of both acquisitions and secondly, with very minimal hedging in 2022. 
Going to Slide #6. Again, significant increases in our variable dividend and also our base dividend. Basically, a 9x growth from '22 annual dividend over the 2020. Returning $1.6 billion in dividends in 2021, a 3x increase from 2020. So we're estimating something near about $20 per share total payout in 2022. 
When you go to Slide #7 to show Pioneer's dividend yield. It will exceed all peers and majors in the S&P 500. We're already at 8% just based on the one we declared for the fourth quarter of 2021. When you look at next year, we'll be 11%. The other two strong companies below us, obviously, are DeWitt and Cotera with strong variable dividends. 
But then you see a significant drop to the U.S. majors, European majors. Our dividend yield is over 2x versus the U.S. and European majors. And when you look over the rest of the peers, excluding DeWitt and Cotera, we're basically a 10x dividend times or 10 higher over the rest of the peers. When you look at the S&P 500, which is around 1.6%, we're over 6x to 7x the S&P 500. 
I'll now turn it over to Neal to talk about our base."

Slide 8 demonstrates maintaining a strong and growing base dividend is a commitment to our shareholders and a key pillar of our investment thesis. 
As Scott stated earlier, we are further strengthening our base dividend with an increase of greater than 10%, which is an acceleration of our 2022 base dividend increase. Inclusive of this increase, as you can see in the graph, our 5-year base dividend compound annual growth rate of greater than 95% exceeds all peers and U.S. majors. 
Additionally, over the same period, while many peers have cut or suspended their base dividends, Pioneer has consistently maintained and grown its base dividend, demonstrating our steadfast commitment to our shareholders and creating value through dependable through-cycle return of capital. 
Turning to the next page, Slide 9. Even with inflationary pressures surfacing in 2021, we continue to reduce our controllable cash costs, which are comprised of cash interest, cash G&A and Midland horizontal LOE. 
As a result of our high operational efficiencies and acquisition synergy capture, we expect 2021 cash cost to be approximately 30% lower than 2019 levels. Pioneer's unique combination of high oil cut, low controllable cash costs and top-tier NRI drive compelling cash margins that underpin our strong free cash flow generation and return of capital strategies. 
Now I will hand it over to Rich to cover our outlook update."

Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 10, where we show our updated production guidance for 2021. You'll see here that we've narrowed our full year production -- our oil production range to 356,000 to 359,000 barrels of oil pe",605,"Thanks, Neal. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 10, where we show our updated production guidance for 2021. You'll see here that we've narrowed our full year production -- our oil production range to 356,000 to 359,000 barrels of oil per day and total production to 613,000 to 619,000 BOEs per day. This narrowed guidance reflects the combination of our reported production through September 30, and our Q4 guidance, which includes the impact of the Glasscock divestitures that happened in October. 
Due to the Delaware divestiture not closing until near year-end, our production guidance includes Delaware for a full year. And our capital guidance is unchanged, but also includes Delaware for a full year as well. 
I did see in the notes over the night that there was a couple of comments on our third quarter capital. I just wanted to hit that upfront that our capital in Q3 did include a fair amount of integration work that we did related to the Parsley and Double Point assets where we are upgrading their tank batteries and facilities to our standards. So that's what was driving a little higher capital. 
If you move to the fourth quarter, our capital is expected to come down as we do have less integration activity and will be on average running one less rig and one less frac fleet during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 11. As Scott mentioned and Neal's talked about, we did announce the Delaware divestiture. As you can see from the slide here, about $3.25 billion of cash consideration. About 92,000 net acres is being sold. And production currently is running about 50,000 BOEs per day. We did have some drilling program there. And so if you -- once those wells are completed, first quarter, that will be about 55,000 BOEs a day of production once those are completed in the first quarter placed on production. 
As we've mentioned, the transaction is expected to close at year-end. Post this transaction, it does return Pioneer to being 100% focused on our core acreage position in the high-margin, high-return Midland Basin. 
Also, we did announce -- or closed in October, the 20,000 net acres sale of our Glasscock County acreage to Laredo for about $230 million, monetizing our long-dated inventory that we weren't going to get to for a while. At the time of the sale, this acreage had -- was producing about 4,400 BOEs a day, or 2,600 barrels of oil per day. So on a combined basis, we're divesting about $3.5 billion of assets in the fourth quarter this year, which will further strengthen our balance sheet. 
Similar to these transactions, we will continue to pursue strategic acreage trades. And we'll continue to evaluate drill codes and small-scale divestments on long-dated inventory to accelerate value to shareholders. 
So looking forward to 2022, and after adjusting for both Delaware and Glasscock divestitures, we do expect to keep our Midland Basin production relatively flat with Q4 levels. So we're seeing 2022 production adjusted for the divestitures at 355,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil per day, or 630,000 to 640,000 BOEs per day. This is expected to result in a 2022 annual oil growth rate consistent with our long-term investment framework of growing production between 0% and 5%. 
And I might also note that as we look at 2022 capital, we are still in the midst of evaluating that. We were expecting to spend about $250 million to $300 million in the Delaware Basin to grow production there starting in 2022. 
So I'll stop there and turn it over to Joey for more details on operations."

Our 2021 plan remains unchanged and has set average between 22 and 24 rigs for the full year. We did mobilized several rigs to the Delaware in Q3, which I would equate to approximately one rig for the full year. 
Drilling and completions continue their strong track record of efficiency gains with greater than 70% and 80% increases on their respective foot per day metrics when compared to 2017. We are still operating simulfrac fleets, which further increases efficiencies and is reducing cost. 
Our drilling and completions teams are also successfully executing on 15,000-foot laterals. And at the same time, our land and development planning teams continue adding future 15k laterals across our acreage position. Once again, congrats to the team for great execution in Q3. 
I'm going to move on to Slide 13. Pioneer's been committed to sustainable operations for a long time, and this has resulted in Pioneer having one of the lowest current emissions intensities amongst our peers. 
As you can see, Pioneer's 2019 starting point is lower than the majority of our peers' projected intensities for 2025 and 2030. Pioneer's 2030 emissions intensity goals represent one of the most aggressive reduction targets in the industry, demonstrating continued progress on our trajectory to net zero. 
This was only made possible through years of thoughtful planning and investments to minimize emissions at our facilities, coupled with our comprehensive leak detection and repair program, including routine aerial surveys. 
Now moving to Slide 14 and continuing with the same storyline from the previous slide. Pioneer also produces extremely low emission intensity oil on a global scale, which will improve as we progress toward our 2030 reduction targets. This, combined with our low breakeven results and exceptionally resilient production that we expect will compete in the global marketplace for a very long time. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Scott to wrap things up."

Also, 2020 flaring intensity was 0.2%, significantly less than our goal of 1%. Again, we expect to end routine flaring, as defined by the World Bank, by 2030 with aspiration to accomplish it by 2025. And as Neal said, we just recently published our first climate risk report. 
Going to Slide #16. We've been focused on ESG leadership. I think you can see the significant changes we made over the last 2 years in our annual incentive compensation components for all the executives. I'm still the only CEO in the industry that is 100% tied to performance shares. Most of other executives, it's around 60%. 
You can see that we've increased our targets on ESG and HSE up to 20% last year. Goals are 100% aligned with shareholders' interest. 
We expanded the responsibilities of the Board of Directors Sustainability and Climate Oversight Committee, which is led by our Non-Executive Chairman, Ken Thompson. And we recently added a second Director this year, Maria S. Jelescu Dreyfus, who has two key focuses: One on ESG; and secondly, was the Managing Director for Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and an expert in asset management over the last several years. Again, we have a picture of our two reports. We encourage everyone to read these reports. 
Going to the last slide. Enhancing shareholder value, Slide #17. Again, focused on returns. And just to remind you, I mentioned that we'll be in the low to mid-20s on both ROCE and also CROCE. Capital discipline, I mentioned that we'll be returning roughly -- or spending about 30% to 40% over the next several years is our reinvestment rate. 
Return on capital to our shareholders I mentioned that we have about $25 billion to $35 billion in a couple of different price cases, strip and flat price. We'll be returning about 80% of that back to shareholders, plus any buybacks that we do during that time period. 
Preserving a strong balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier. We'll have the best balance sheet in the company's history by the end of this quarter. And secondly, moving to zero debt all by the end of 2022. 
Significant inventory. We probably got the largest and longest inventory of any company in the U.S. today. And we continue on ESG leadership to be performing at the highest level. 
I'm going to stop there. We'll open it up for Q&A."

I think as Scott mentioned, the reinvestment rate is in that 30% to 40% of cash flow projections for 2022. When you think about inflation, similar to what I've talked about before, we have seen some upward pressure mainly on materials when you think about tubulars, diesel, cement, sand, chemicals and we're starting to see some in labor as it's gotten a little tighter on the labor side. 
We've been able to offset that with some efficiency improvements, and our long-term contracts helped dampen that impact. But overall, for the year, we're expecting to see mid-single-digit inflation for the year with -- probably as we move towards the end of the year, closer to 10% inflation, which will push us up in our capital guidance range towards probably the higher end of that capital range. 
As you look at 2022, we're looking at probably something in the mid-single digits from an inflationary standpoint. And hopefully, we'll still be able to offset and we still plan to offset some of that with efficiency gains. 
But having said all that, I think with the higher commodity prices, we'll still be able to offset the inflation and really still allow for stronger overall margins, which is driving up -- or allowing us our reinvestment rate to come down from the 50% to 60% to 30% to 40% for 2022."

It's going to the balance sheet. I think going forward. We stated our new debt targets. They used to run debt-to-EBITDA, 0.75. We lowered to 0.5, and I prefer to have zero debt long term. It gives us a lot of options. 
I stated already on the buybacks, we like to reduce shares significantly. But I'd like to do it at a good price. We think definitely we'll be buying back [ creep ].

So you don't want to get into a situation where you increase your base to a point to where you have to cut it. It impacts the stock price long term significantly. 
So we have to be very careful. I think having a great balance sheet and zero debt, we have lots of choices between buybacks, variable dividends and base dividends. And so our goal is to return most of that to the shareholders in those three forms."

I want to talk about cash taxes and the IBC coverage of sustaining capital as your NOLs roll off because it seems to me that as we transition into this business model that you guys have clearly embraced and are leading the market on, the concern now is that breakevens are going to start to move back up as cash taxes become real.

On the POP side of things, for 2021, what I'd say is there's obviously a lot of noise this year with the two acquisitions. And a lot of it is just timing of whether those wells were popped under prior to us closing the transaction or after. And so we expected a number of the wells that we ended up popping. The Double Point would have popped before we got to closing. And so I wouldn't read too much into that and it's just timing of who's watched where those wells under is why we got to higher pop count.

So we see continuing to add these into our program as time goes on. We see these as being a huge value adder to our program."

If you think about from the Delaware perspective, if you look at the book value that we booked, it was [ $4.1 billion ] due to purchase accounting. We had a carryover tax base of $1.9 billion on those assets. 
So if you think about the proceeds of, let's call it, $3.25 billion, you will have adjustments that we make due to the effective date, we would expect to book loss of approximately $1 billion and a taxable gain of approximately $1.2 billion. So a little bit difference there between the book and the tax. 
Now if you're referencing Scott's discussion on debt and debt retirement and use of proceeds, if you look at the debt towers in the appendix, in 2022, we have about $244 million. That's roughly, call it, 4% debt. In 2023, $750 million, that's 55 basis points. And 2024, it's $750 million at 75 basis points. Now that 2024 is callable in 2022. 
So if you think about the free cash flow profile, that Scott's articulated and the return of capital that we've discussed, we actually have it staggered into the model repaying that debt. So really already is a factor into how we talk about return of capital. Any acceleration of free cash flow or increase in free cash flow due to greater commodity prices really would provide that opportunity to get that net debt lower and pay down our gross debt as well, which really then what Scott said, free up more of the balance sheet to be opportunistic with buybacks. 
And Scott articulated 0.5x is kind of that target. I'd say that we kind of look at the long-term target. Well, by the end of the year, due to the divestiture, we'll be at 0.4. So it kind of sets us up in a good position to be opportunistic as we look forward to 2022. And as you and I all know, never on this call, the market is highly volatile. There's always opportunities within the market to buy back stock. And if you look at energy as potentially being higher beta, I'd say that provides even more entry points. 
So it's our shareholders' money. That's how we think about it. We try to be really smart and thoughtful in terms of how we allocate capital and we return capital to shareholders. So I think you'll see that from us as we move forward into 2022."

I know I get asked to all the time, why don't you just immediately convert all of your fleets to simulfrac. But it just -- it's a significant -- well, number one, some of the pads aren't conducive. If you have an odd a number of wells on a pad, that can play a little bit of a difficult part in simulfrac, but also just the water and sand logistics. In essence, the demand at one point in time is 50% greater. 
So we don't want to over capitalize on our water infrastructure. We do have one of the most vast water infrastructures, and that's why we're able to support two continuous simulfrac fleets. These are going nonstop, not just coming and going. But we will continue to add simulfrac fleets as our water infrastructure grows, and we'll adopt it as it makes sense from a capital perspective."

And one example of where we use predictive analytics was on our chemicals for our -- whenever we're delivering our stimulations on our wells. 
We've gone back and use machine learning to determine based on what the outcome is during the delivery of the frac, how we can throttle back our chemicals on the well and thus, use less chemical. And whenever you look at that on an individual well basis, it may not be big bucks, but when you multiply that times 500, it turns into huge dollars. 
Another on the drilling side, we have a stuck pipe predictive tool where we've gone back and looked at the events where we've had stuck pipe in the drilling activity. And by doing that, we could use machine learning and predictive analytics to know how we can see that coming and thus prevent it. And it's been hugely successful for us. And I could go on and name numerous examples. 
So I would say, from my perspective, that it's a very mature methodology that we have adopted and used continuously, but the opportunities for it are limitless. And we continue to expand it.

In terms of the asset, it's kind of a catch '22 in the sense of that's higher oil cut. And so obviously, you get a higher oil price on a bigger part of those barrels, but it did have higher operating cost. And so margin-wise, in a higher price environment, it was very competitive with what was in the Midland Basin. But in a lower price environment, clearly the margins were better in Midland.
