Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin our discussion of year-end results and other key business matters, I'll start with a few comments on COVID-19 as well as the steps we have taken to deliver safe, reliable electric and natural gas service to our customers during the recent period of extremely cold weather in our region. To begin, I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy. While COVID-19 has driven a great deal of change, I can assure you that 1 thing that remains constant in Ameren is our strong commitment to the safety of our coworkers, customers and communities. So too is our strong focus on delivering safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable electric and natural gas service during this unprecedented time. 
We recognize that millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois are depending on us. I can't express enough appreciation to my coworkers who have shown great agility, innovation, determination and a keen focus on safety while delivering on our mission to power the quality of life. And while we are focused on addressing the challenges associated with the pandemic and achieving our mission each day, we never lose sight of our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future. Despite the significant challenges presented by COVID-19, I look to the future with optimism, not just because vaccines are now being distributed to millions around the world, but also because of how our coworkers stepped up and addressed a multitude of challenges and capitalized on opportunities in 2020 that will clearly help us achieve our vision. 
Speaking of stepping up to challenges to ensure that we continue to deliver on our mission and vision, our team has been tirelessly working over the last week to ensure that we continue to deliver safe and reliable electric and natural gas services to millions of people in our service territory, despite the extremely cold weather that we are experiencing in our region. As you know, the extremely cold weather has created significant challenges to maintain the safety and reliability of the energy grid in several areas of the country. Understandably, the cold weather has driven a significant increase in customer demand for electric and natural gas service. 
At the same time, the extreme weather has resulted in natural gas supply disruptions and limitations, operational issues at power plants and transmission constraints. Combined, these extraordinary circumstances that several regional transmission organizations to implement emergency operations protocols, which include controlled interruptions of service to customers in several states, most notably in Texas. Not surprisingly, the same set of conditions resulted in significant increases in power and natural gas prices in the energy markets. 
To date, we have not experienced any significant reliability issues in our Missouri or Illinois businesses as past investments in energy infrastructure have paid off. In addition, the strong operation of our gas storage fields in Illinois and coal-fired energy centers in Missouri as well as our robust interconnections with gas pipeline suppliers and the power markets have played a major role as well. Rest assured, we will continue to actively manage this challenging situation for our customers. 
Turning now to Page 4. Before I jump into the details of our accomplishments and strategic areas of focus, I want to reiterate the strategy that has been delivering significant long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, our strategy is to invest in a robust pipeline of great regulated energy infrastructure, continuously improve operating performance and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. As always, our customers continue to be at the center of our strategy. 
I'm pleased to say that our actions and performance in 2020 as well as our strategic areas of focus for the future, are strongly aligned with our customers' and shareholders' expectations to lead the way to a sustainable energy future, which brings me to a discussion of our 2020 performance. 
As I said earlier, we delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2020. Yesterday, we announced 2020 earnings of $3.50 per share compared to earnings of $3.35 per share earned in 2019. Excluding the impact from weather, 2020 normalized earnings increased to $3.54 per share or approximately 6.6%, from 2019's weather-normalized earnings of $3.32 per share. With our customers and shareholders' expectations in mind, we made significant investments in energy infrastructure in 2020 that resulted in a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid as well as contributed to strong rate base growth at all of our business segments. 
Consistent with these objectives and despite COVID-19 challenges, we successfully executed on a robust pipeline of investments across all of our businesses. In 2020, as outlined on this page, we also achieved constructive outcomes in several regulatory proceedings that will help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders, while keeping our customers' rates affordable. The bottom line is that we successfully executed our strategy in 2020, which will drive significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to Page 5. Here, we highlight the significant progress we made in an area that has and will continue to be a significant area of focus, sustainability. Last September, we announced a transformation of clean energy transition plan that effectively balances environmental stewardship with reliability and affordability. In particular, we established a clean energy goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. We also established strong interim carbon reduction goals of 50% by 2030 and 85% by 2040 based on 2005 levels. In addition, our plan includes robust investments in new wind and solar generation, while being mindful of reliability. Notably, we are targeting adding 5,400 megawatts of new renewable wind and solar generation resources to our generation portfolio by 2040. 
Our plan also includes advancing the retirement of 2 coal-fired energy centers, extending the life of our carbon-free Callaway Nuclear Energy Center to 80 years and partnering with the Electric Power Research Institute in assessing advanced clean energy technologies for the future. We have already executed key elements of this plan. In particular, a significant milestone toward accomplishing our net zero carbon emissions goal was reached with the acquisition of the 400-megawatt High Prairie Renewable Energy Center in December. This was our first wind generation addition and is the largest wind facility in the state of Missouri. Earlier this year, we also acquired our second wind generation investment, the Atchison Renewable Energy Center, which when completed, is expected to be a 300-megawatt facility. We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. There has never been a more important time than now to be a leader in this area, and we are leading forward. 
In terms of COVID-19 relief, we have been continuously working to help our customers in need, including implementing disconnection moratoriums, providing special bill payment plans, providing over $23 million of critical funds for energy assistance and other basic needs. We held a Virtual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Leadership Summit in June 2020 that included over 600 community leaders and coworkers. During that summit, Ameren made a commitment of $10 million over the next 5 years to nonprofit organizations focused on DE&I., and we spent over $800 million with diverse suppliers in 2020, a 24% increase over 2019. 
From a governance perspective, our Board of Directors oversight our sustainability risks was enhanced. In addition, we named our first Chief Renewable Development Officer to lead our continued efforts to transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio. Further, the Board of Directors strengthened our executive compensation program by adding the 10% long-term incentive based on implementing our clean energy transition plans. And just last week, the Board approved the addition of workforce and supply diversity metrics to our short-term incentive plan for 2021. All of these efforts are consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future in our mission to power the quality of life. 
Turning to Page 6. As you can see on this page, our laser focus on executing our strategy for the last several years has delivered strong results. From a customer standpoint, our investments in infrastructure have driven our liability to top quartile performance, while at the same time, our disciplined cost management has kept our electric rates among the lowest in the country. The combination of these factors has helped drive significantly higher customer satisfaction scores. We have also delivered superior value to our shareholders, as you can see on Page 7. Our other normalized core earnings per share has risen 70% or -- and an approximately 8% compound annual growth rate since we exited our unregulated generation business in 2013. Our dividend rate has increased 25% over the same time period. This has resulted in a significant reduction in our weather-normalized dividend payout ratio from over 77% in 2013 to 56% in 2020, near the bottom of our 55% to 70% targeted dividend payout range, positioning us well for continued strong infrastructure investments and rate base growth, as well as future dividend growth. 
Speaking of dividend growth, I am pleased to report that last week, Ameren's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of approximately 7%, resulting in an annualized dividend rate of $2.20 per share. This increase, coupled with the dividend increase of 4% in October 2020, reflects confidence by Ameren's Board of Directors in the outlook for our businesses and management's ability to execute its strategy for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders. While I'm very pleased with our past performance, we are not sitting back and taking a deep breath. We remain focused on accelerating and enhancing our performance in 2021 and in the years ahead, so we can continue to deliver superior value to our customers, communities and shareholders. 
Which brings me to Page 8. Yesterday afternoon, we also announced that we expect our 2021 earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share.  Michael will provide you with more details on our 2021 guidance a bit later. Building on the strong execution of our strategy and our robust earnings growth over the past several years, we continue to expect to deliver long-term earnings growth that is among the best in the industry. We expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2021 to 2025, using the midpoint of our 2021 guidance, $3.75 per share, as the base. Our long-term earnings growth will be driven by continued execution of our strategy, including investing in infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while keeping rates affordable. Another important element of our strong total shareholder return story is our dividend. 
Looking ahead, Ameren expects future dividend growth to be in line with its long-term earnings per share growth expectations within a payout ratio range of 55% to 70%. In addition to earnings growth considerations, future dividend decisions will be driven by cash flow, investment requirements and other business conditions. 
Turning to Page 9. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong long-term earnings growth I just discussed is primarily driven by our rate base growth plan. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base in an approximately 8% compound annual rate for the 2020 through 2025 period. This growth is driven by our robust capital plan of approximately $17 billion over the next 5 years that will deliver significant value to our customers and the communities we serve. Our plan includes strategically allocating capital to all 4 of our business segments. Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities for Ameren Missouri's integrated resource plan. 
Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file for certificates and convenience and necessity for some renewable generation projects in 2021 with the Missouri PSC. We expect to add these investments to our multiyear rate base outlook as we finalize pending negotiations with renewable energy developers and move further along in the regulatory approval process in Missouri. Finally, we remain focused on disciplined cost management, earn as close to our lab returns as possible in all of our businesses. 
Speaking of disciplined cost management, let's now turn to Page 10. Over the last several years, we have worked hard to enhance the regulatory frameworks in both Missouri and Illinois to help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders. At the same time, we have been very focused on disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable. Our efforts are paying off. As outlined on this page, residential rates have decreased since opting into these enhanced regulatory frameworks for all of our Missouri Electric and Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution businesses. So to be clear, since these constructive frameworks have been put in place, significant investments have been made, reliability has improved, rates have gone down and thousands of jobs have been created. While this is a great win for our customers and communities, we are not done. 
Turning to Page 11. As you can see from this chart, our operating expenses have decreased 14% since 2015. We will remain relentlessly focused on disciplined cost management as we look forward to the next 5 years and beyond. This will not only include the robust cost management initiatives undertaken to manage through COVID-19, but also several other customer affordability initiatives. These initiatives include the automation and optimization of our processes, including leveraging the benefits from significant past and future investments in digital technologies and grid modernization. In addition, as part of the Ameren Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, we will work to responsibly retire our coal-fired energy centers over time, which includes thoughtfully managing workforce changes through attrition, transfers to other facilities and retaining -- retraining for other positions in the company. 
Turning now to Page 12. Next, I want to cover the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. An enhanced version of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed in the past week, which if passed, would apply to both the Ameren Illinois Electric and Natural Gas Distribution businesses. This legislation will allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy, battery storage and gas infrastructure to improve safety, and reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers and the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. This important piece of legislation will also require diverse supplier spend reporting for all-electric renewable energy providers. 
Another key component of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act is that it would allow for performance-based ratemaking for Ameren Illinois' Natural Gas and Electric Distribution businesses to 2032. The proposed performance metric would ensure investments are aligned with and are contributing to reliability of the energy grid as well as to transition to the clean energy vision of the state. Further, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity methodology in each business to align with returns being earned by other gas and electric utilities across the nation. This legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to invest in critical energy infrastructure under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment, improved safety and reliability as well as creating over 1,400 jobs, all while keeping electric rates well below the Midwest and National averages. 
This bill would also move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. By providing for performance-based rate making, both electric and gas distribution businesses, we believe the proposed legislation would further align the energy goals of Ameren Illinois and the State of Illinois for the benefit of our customers, the communities we serve and the environment. With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed this year. 
Moving now to Page 13 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment plan to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. As I mentioned earlier, Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of our first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. Last month, we acquired our second wind generation project the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in Northwest Missouri. Approximately 120 megawatts are already in service. We expect a total of 150 megawatts to be in service by the end of the first quarter, which remain expected later in 2021 upon the replacement of certain turbine blades. We financed these projects through a combination of green first mortgage bonds and common stock issued under our forward equity sale agreement. We do not expect a construction delay on our Atchison wind facility to have a significant economic consequences or reduce the production tax credits for this project because of the rural change made by the U.S. Department of Treasury last year to extend the in-service criteria by 1 year to December 31, 2021. 
Turning now to Page 14 and an update on our Callaway Energy Center. Turning to return to full power as part of its 24th week fueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Illinois Missouri's Callaway Energy center experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted, and the decision was made to replace certain key components of the generator in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service. Work is already underway on this capital project, which we expect will cost approximately $65 million. We are also pursuing the recovery of costs to put global warranties and insurance. Due to the long lead time for the manufacturing, repair and installation of these components, the energy center is expected to return to service in late June or early July. And as announced previously, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results. 
Turning now to Page 15. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results for 2025, but is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We believe that a safe, reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid will be increasingly important and bring even greater value to our customers, our communities and shareholders. With this long-term view in mind, we are making investments that will position Ameren to meet our customers' future energy needs and rising expectations, support our transition to a cleaner energy future and provide safe, reliable natural gas services. 
The right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our electric and natural gas energy delivery investments to be 82% of our rate base by the end of 2025. As a result of Ameren Missouri's investment in 700 megawatts of wind generation, combined with the scheduled retirement of the Meramec Coal-Fired Energy Center in 2022, we expect coal-fired generation to decline to just 7% of rate base and our renewable generation to increase to 6% of rate base by year-end 2025. As noted previously, our current 5-year plan does not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable generation included in Ameren Missouri's integrated resource plan by 2025. These actions are just further examples of the steps we are taking to address our customers and shareholders' focus on ESG matters and achieve our net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to positon Ameren for success in 2021 and beyond. 
Moving to Page 16. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities, over $40 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new regionally beneficial transmission projects that would increase the reliability and resiliency for the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future and responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our countries future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 17. As we have outlined in our presentation today, we are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. Consistent with that focus, yesterday, we issued our updated ESG investor presentation called Leading the Way to a Sustainable Energy Future. This presentation demonstrates how we have been effectively integrating our focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters into our corporate strategy. This slide summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters. Throughout the course of my discussion this morning, I've already covered many of these topics. 
A few other notable points include the fact that we were honored to again be recognized by Diversity Inc. as one of the top utilities in the country for diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as be rated in the top 25 of all companies for ESG in their inaugural list. Finally, our strong corporate governance is led by a very talented and diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight of ESG matters. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our sustainability value proposition. You can find this presentation at amereninvestors.com. 
Moving to Page 18. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth from 2021 to 2025, driven by strong rate base growth, compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today position us well for future dividend growth. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I'll now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,701063968,2216852,"Ameren Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 20 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported 2020 earnings of $3.50 per share compared to earnings of $3.35 per share in 2019. Ameren transmission earnings were up $0.13 per share, which re",1893,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 20 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported 2020 earnings of $3.50 per share compared to earnings of $3.35 per share in 2019. Ameren transmission earnings were up $0.13 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and the impact of the FERC order on the MISO allowed base return on equity. Earnings from Ameren Illinois natural gas were up $0.06 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and lower other operations and main expenses due to disciplined cost management. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, increased $0.03 per share from $1.74 per share in 2019 to $1.77 per share in [ 2020 ]. The comparison reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, which increased earnings by $0.23 per share compared to 2019. Earnings also benefited from lower operations and maintenance expenses, which increased earnings $0.16 per share. This was due in part to the deferral expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage compared to recognizing all of the expenses for the spring 2019 outage at that time. 
The change in timing of expense recognition was approved by the Missouri PSC in early 2020 and better aligns revenue with expenses. In addition, the decline in other O&M expenses were driven by disciplined cost management exercise throughout the year. These favorable factors were mostly offset by lower electric retail sales, driven by the impacts of COVID-19 and weather, which together reduced earnings by approximately $0.18 per share. In 2020, we experienced milder than normal summer and winter temperatures compared to near-normal summer and winter temperatures in 2019. In addition, lower MEEIA performance incentives reduced earnings by $0.09 per share compared to 2019 and higher interest expense due to higher long-term debt outstanding reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. And finally, under terms of the Missouri Rate Review settlement in order, we recognized a onetime charitable contribution, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Moving to Ameren Illinois electric distribution, earnings decreased $0.01 per share, which reflected a lower allowed return on equity under performance-based rate making, mostly offset by increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments. The allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking was 7.4% in 2020 compared to 8.4% in 2019 and was applied to year-end rate base. The 2020 allowed ROE was based on the 2020 average 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.6%, down from the 2019 average of 2.6%. And finally, Ameren parent and other results were lower compared to 2019 due to increased interest expense resulting from higher long-term debt outstanding as well as reduced tax benefits primarily associated with share-based compensation. 
Turning to Page 21. Outlined on this page are our electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for 2020 compared to 2019. Overall, the year-end results for Ameren Missouri are largely consistent with our expectations outlined on our call in May in terms of impact on total sales and earnings per share for 2020 due to COVID-19. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Moving to Page 22 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $17.1 billion of strategically allocated capital plan expenditures for the 2021 through 2025 period by business segment, that [indiscernible] we have approximately 8% projected rate base growth Warner discussed earlier. This plan includes an incremental $1.1 billion compared to the $16 billion 5-year plan for 2020 through 2024 that we laid out last February. 
Turning to Page 23. We outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as the investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. Those tax deferrals are driven primarily by timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated appreciation for tax purposes. In addition to the benefits of the accelerated tax depreciation, as a result of our $1.1 billion investment in 700 megawatts of wind generation, we will generate production tax credits over this period. 
From a financing perspective, while we have no long-term debt maturities in 2021, we do expect to continue to issue long-term debt at the Ameren parent, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to fund a portion of our cash requirements. We also plan to continue to use newly-issued shares from our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the 5-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually. 
Last week, we physically settled the remaining shares under our Ford equity sale agreement to generate approximately $115 million. In order for us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund a robust infrastructure plan, we expect incremental equity issuance of approximately $150 million in 2021 and $300 million each year starting in 2022 through 2025. All of these actions are expected to enable us to maintain a consolidated capitalization target of approximately 45% equity. 
Moving to Page 24 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2021 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers and assumptions behind our 2021 earnings guidance, broken down by segment as compared to our 2020 results. Beginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to rise in 2021. As previously noted, a majority of the 700 megawatts of wind generation investment was placed in service at the end of 2020 and early 2021. As a result, we expect to see significant contributions to earnings from these investments in 2021. The 2021 earnings comparison is also expected to be favorably impacted by the first quarter -- in the first quarter by increased Missouri electric service rates that took effect April 1, 2020. 
We also expect higher weather-normalized electric sales and other margins in 2021 compared 2020, as outlined by customer class on the slide, reflecting the continual improvement in economic activity since the COVID-19 lockdowns that began in the second quarter of last year. While 2021 sales expectations are much improved over 2020, we do not expect total sales to return to pre-COVID-19 levels this year. Further, we expect a return to normal weather in 2021 will increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.04 compared to 2020 results. We expect the amortization expenses associated with the fall 2020 Callaway scheduled refueling a man's outage to reduce earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in 2021. The fall 2020 outage costs of approximately $0.12 per share was deferred pursuant to the Missouri PSC order and is expected to be amortized over approximately 17 months starting January 2021. We also expect higher operations and maintenance expenses to reduce earnings. 
Moving on, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking. This benefit will be partially offset by the absence of the impact of the 2020 FERC order on the MISO base allowed return on equity. 
Turning to Page 25. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2021 compared to 2020 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois performance-based ratemaking. Our guidance incorporates a rate base -- a formula-based allowed ROE of 7.75% using a forecasted 1.9% 2020 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond, which is higher than the allowed ROE of 7.4% in 2020. The allowed ROE is applied to year-end rate base. For Ameren Illinois natural gas, earnings will benefit from higher delivery service rates based on a 2021 future test year, which were effective late last month as well as from infrastructure investments qualifying for the rider investment treatment. 
Moving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect the increased common shares outstanding as a result of the issuance under the Ford equity sale agreement, our dividend reinvestment employee benefit plans and additional equity issuance of approximately $150 million to unfavorably impact earnings per share by $0.12. Of course, in 2021, we will seek to manage all of our businesses during this close to our lot returns as possible, while being mindful of operating and other business needs. 
I'd also like to take a moment to discuss our electric retail sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt hour sales to be in the range of flat to up approximately 0.5%, compounding annually over our 5-year plan. Excluding the effects of our MEEIA energy efficiency plans using 2021 as the base year. Again, we exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Turning to Illinois, we expect our weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales, including energy efficiency, to be relatively flat over the 5-year plan. 
Turning to Page 26 and Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. Last October, we filed a request with the Missouri PSC to track and defer on our regulatory asset certain COVID-19 related costs incurred, net of any COVID-19 realized cost savings. Through December 31, 2020, we have accumulated approximately $6 million of net cost, and we requested additional true-ups. If our requests are approved by the Missouri PSC, the ability to recover and the timing of the recovery of these costs would be determined as part of the next electric and gas rate reviews. We continue to work towards a settlement with key stakeholders. I would also note that PSC is under no deadline to issue orders. Speaking of future rate reviews, we continue to expect to file the next in Missouri electric and gas rate reviews by the end of March 2021. 
Turning to Page 27. In Illinois, Ameren Illinois electric regulatory matters, in December, the ICC approved a $49 million base electric distribution rate decrease in the annual rate update proceeding with new rates effective at the beginning of the year. This marks the third consecutive overall reduction in rates and the seventh overall rate decrease since performance-based ratemaking began in 2011. In Ameren Illinois, natural gas regulatory matters, last month, the ICC approved a $76 million annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year, a 9.67% of return on equity and a 52% equity ratio. The $76 million included $44 million of annual revenues that would otherwise be recovered in 2021 under Ameren Illinois qualifying infrastructure plant and other riders. New rates were effective in late January. 
Finally, turning to Page 28. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue to execute our plan. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2020, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. And as we look ahead, we expect 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth from 2021 to 2025, driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Julien, yes, we talked about in our prepared remarks, during the return to full power after our last refueling and maintenance outage, we experienced an issue with the electric generator. So nonnuclear part of the plant, nonnuclear operating issue. So subsequently, we did open up the generator for inspection and identified issues with both the rotor as well as the stater. So we decided that significant components did need to be replaced. And those are long lead time materials that need to be manufactured, installed, tested, et cetera, so that we can ultimately make sure that we bring the plant back safely and sustainably. And we do estimate that, that will take till, as we said, late June or early July. 
So during this period of time, the plant does remain down. But as we suggested, we're going to be doing everything we can to reduce the ultimate cost, including pursuing recovery of costs through warranties as well as we've made insurance claims and to have insurance, both on the property side as well as for accidental outage impacts as it relates to loss generation."

One, Julien, it addresses the issue that you talked about. Really is no longer that Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act that was filed isn't based on a 30-year treasury. It is doing what legislators really wanted to have done back in 2012 when the modernization action plan was put in place. That was simply to try and have the return on equity, really become very close to the national average. And that's exactly what's reflected in there. 
And so that's why we like that though. And of course, we like to bill that was filed because it not only applies to our electric business, but our gas business because we're firmly convinced that performance-based ratemaking has been terrific things for the state of Illinois in terms of reliability, in terms of affordability and jobs.

Look, we've discussed with you and investors in the past that, look, Ameren's dividend and this dividend policy are a really important matters to our Board of Directors. And so clearly, the Board took careful consideration in terms of thinking, first and foremost, about the dividend policy. And as you know, we announced that dividend policy change that talked about the future dividend growth is really going to be in line with our long-term earnings per share growth and within our payout ratio of 55% to 70%, which is what we talked about in the past. 
So when they did that, we all collectively did that, we also carefully considered the practice that we've been using over the last several years of raising the dividend in the fall or in October. And at the end of the day, the Board of Directors came to the conclusion that it was really just appropriate to align the dividend increase we announced last week with the simultaneous updating of the dividend policy, which I just described, and then also to align it with our discussion about long-term earnings guidance, which, as you know, we typically do right now at the beginning of the year. 
And so I can never tell you exactly what the Board will do in the future. And I would expect the practice that we are pointing this year to continue in the future.

These are important issues. And so we get that. And of course, we're engaged in those conversations because we want to make sure that policy decisions made for the nuclear plants and others don't have negative implications for our customers downstate.

And this Downstate Affordability Act isn't just about grid modernization, let's just be clear, it is in part and certainly around the gas business, but also is driving towards greater electrification, greater solar and battery storage and its own to have policies that support these critical investments. 
So look, at the end of the day, we are -- we believe this is an appropriate approach. Of course, we're still early in the session as Julien and I discussed a little while ago. And so we'll engage with key stakeholders, other utilities on these important manners. But this is the direction that we think is appropriate and certainly, the sponsors of the legislation do as well."

And then, Michael, maybe you can get a little bit into the math in the first part. A couple of things. With regard to the renewables and the transmission, we do see these as meaningful opportunities to continue our rate base growth. Now as we've said in the past, we're not out here given our 5-year plan and whether it would be 100% additive in all respects, that would be premature for me to say that. 
But to be clear, we see the real needs clearly in our integrated resource plan for renewables, and we are taking steps, as we discussed earlier, to begin executing that plan. In fact, we've already started that as you know with regard to the 700 megawatts. But we believe it's absolutely prudent and appropriate to do more as we transition to a cleaner energy future. But that clean energy future, really is not going to be coming forth if we don't have greater levels of investment in transmission. And so as we pointed out in our slides and before that these large regional transmission projects, which have really put our country in a position where it is today in terms of growth in renewables, we're going to need to do more of that. And so we see those as greater opportunities when they come in is a little early to say. We have been actively working with MISO and other key stakeholders to try and put the process in place for those transmission investments to get going on those. 
As I've said before, those take time. They're not going to be done here in a year or 2. If anything, we might see some towards the back end of our '21 to '25 plan, but we certainly see greater levels of investment in transmission in the next decade to enable where this transition to a clean energy future. So stay tuned in terms of how it ultimately gets additive. But we see that as clearly potential upside opportunities. And Michael, I'll let you [indiscernible] the specific rate base question."

It's just a function of, obviously a higher jump-off point here in 2020, but still very robust rate base growth of 8% as is noted on the slide. 
As we think about beyond '25, I mean, obviously, there's a large pipeline of opportunity there, $40-plus billion that we've indicated. And look, we'll have to just continue to assess over time how we continue to phase us into the capital plan. We're mindful to the previous question about customer affordability and just managing an overall rate impact. So that's got to be factored into all of this just overall financing, those types of things. So I think there's lots of opportunity there in terms of the overall runway, and we'll just continue to update as we move through time."

So we -- as I said, we did not have any significant reliability issues, and we're pleased to say that. 
Now when you step back and say what is going to happen as a result of all this, I believe there will be greater levels of oversight or perhaps hearings as we all collectively try to understand how we can continue to improve the grid. I'm not going to speculate where it will be, whether they'll be, I think, likely state or federal matters, but we're just -- we've been very focused on as an industry is making sure that we're taking care of our customers collectively.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin our discussion of year-end results and other key business matters, I will start with a few comments on COVID-19 as well as the steps we have taken to deliver safe, reliable electric and natural gas service to our customers during the recent period of extremely cold weather in our region. 
To begin, I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy. While COVID-19 has driven a great deal of change, I can assure you that one thing that remains constant in Ameren is our strong commitment to the safety of our coworkers, customers and communities. So, too, is our strong focus on delivering safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable electric and natural gas service during this unprecedented time. 
We recognize that millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois are depending on us. I can't express enough appreciation to my coworkers who have shown great agility, innovation, determination and a keen focus on safety while delivering on our mission to power the quality of life. 
And while we are focused on addressing the challenges associated with the pandemic and achieving our mission each day, we never lose sight of our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future. Despite the significant challenges presented by COVID-19, I look to the future with optimism, not just because vaccines are now being distributed to millions around the world, but also because of how our coworkers stepped up and addressed a multitude of challenges and capitalized on opportunities in 2020 that will clearly help us achieve our vision. 
Speaking of stepping up to challenges to ensure that we continue to deliver on our mission and vision, our team has been tirelessly working over the last week to ensure that we continue to deliver safe and reliable electric and natural gas services to millions of people in our service territory despite the extremely cold weather that we are experiencing in our region. 
As you know, the extremely cold weather has created significant challenges to maintain the safety and reliability of the energy grid in several areas of the country. Understandably, the cold weather has driven a significant increase in customer demand for electric and natural gas service. 
At the same time, the extreme weather has resulted in natural gas supply disruptions and limitations, operational issues at power plants and transmission constraints. Combined, these extraordinary circumstances that several regional transmission organizations to implement emergency operations protocols, which include controlled interruptions of service to customers in several states, most notably in Texas. Not surprisingly, these same set of conditions resulted in significant increases in power and natural gas prices in the energy markets.
To date, we have not experienced any significant reliability issues in our Missouri or Illinois businesses as past investments in energy infrastructure have paid off. 
In addition, the strong operation of our gas storage fields in Illinois and coal-fired energy centers in Missouri, as well as our robust interconnections with gas pipeline suppliers and the power markets, have played a major role as well. Rest assured, we will continue to actively manage this challenging situation for our customers.
Turning now to Page 4. Before I jump into the details of our accomplishments and strategic areas of focus, I want to reiterate the strategy that has been delivering significant long-term value to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, our strategy is to invest in a robust pipeline of rate-regulated energy infrastructure. continuously improve operating performance and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. As always, our customers continue to be at the center of our strategy. 
I am pleased to say that our actions and performance in 2020, as well as our strategic areas of focus for the future, are strongly aligned with our customers' and shareholders' expectations to lead the way to a sustainable energy future, which brings me to a discussion of our 2020 performance. 
As I said earlier, we delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2020. Yesterday, we announced 2020 earnings of $3.50 per share compared to earnings of $3.35 per share earned in 2019. Excluding the impact from weather, 2020 normalized earnings increased to $3.54 per share or approximately 6.6%, from 2019's weather-normalized earnings of $3.32 per share. 
With our customers' and shareholders' expectations in mind, we made significant investments in energy infrastructure in 2020 that resulted in a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid as well as contributed to strong rate base growth at all of our business segments. 
Consistent with these objectives and despite COVID-19 challenges, we successfully executed on a robust pipeline of investments across all of our businesses. In 2020, as outlined on this page, we also achieved constructive outcomes in several regulatory proceedings that will help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders while keeping our customers' rates affordable. The bottom line is that we successfully executed our strategy in 2020, which will drive significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Turning to Page 5. Here, we highlight the significant progress we made in an area that has and will continue to be a significant area of focus: sustainability. Last September, we announced a transformation of clean energy transition plan that effectively balances environmental stewardship with reliability and affordability. In particular, we established a clean energy goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. We also established strong interim carbon-reduction goals of 50% by 2030 and 85% by 2040 based on 2005 levels. 
In addition, our plan includes robust investments in new wind and solar generation while being mindful of reliability. Notably, we are targeting adding 5,400 megawatts of new renewable wind and solar-generation resources to our generation portfolio by 2040. Our plan also includes advancing the retirement of 2 coal-fired energy centers, extending the life of our carbon-free Callaway Nuclear Energy Center to 80 years and partnering with the Electric Power Research Institute in assessing advanced clean energy technologies for the future. We have already executed key elements of this plan. 
In particular, a significant milestone toward accomplishing our net zero carbon emissions goal was reached with the acquisition of the 400-megawatt High Prairie Renewable Energy Center in December. This was our first wind generation addition and is the largest wind facility in the state of Missouri. Earlier this year, we also acquired our second wind generation investment, the Atchison Renewable Energy Center, which, when completed, is expected to be a 300-megawatt facility. 
We also have a strong, long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. There has never been a more important time than now to be a leader in this area, and we are leading forward. 
In terms of COVID-19 relief, we have been continuously working to help our customers in need, including implementing disconnection moratoriums, providing special bill payment plans, providing over $23 million of critical funds for energy assistance and other basic needs. 
We held a virtual diversity, equity and inclusion leadership summit in June 2020 that included over 600 community leaders and coworkers. During that summit, Ameren made a commitment of $10 million over the next 5 years to nonprofit organizations focused on DE&I, and we spent over $800 million with diverse suppliers in 2020, a 24% increase over 2019. 
From a governance perspective, our Board of Directors' oversight of sustainability risks was enhanced. In addition, we named our first Chief Renewable Development Officer to lead our continued efforts to transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio. Further, the Board of Directors strengthened our executive compensation program by adding the 10% long-term incentive based on implementing our clean energy transition plans. And just last week, the Board approved the addition of workforce and supply diversity metrics to our short-term incentive plan for 2021. All of these efforts are consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future and our mission to power the quality of life. 
Turning to Page 6. As you can see on this page, our laser focus on executing our strategy for the last several years has delivered strong results. From a customer standpoint, our investments in infrastructure have driven our liability to top quartile performance. While at the same time, our disciplined cost management has kept our electric rates among the lowest in the country. The combination of these factors has helped drive significantly higher customer satisfaction scores. 
We have also delivered superior value to our shareholders, as you can see on Page 7. Our weather-normalized core earnings per share has risen 70% or -- and an approximately 8% compound annual growth rate since we exited our unregulated generation business in 2013. Our dividend rate has increased 25% over the same time period. This has resulted in a significant reduction in our weather-normalized dividend payout ratio from over 77% in 2013 to 56% in 2020, near the bottom of our 55% to 70% targeted dividend payout range, positioning us well for continued strong infrastructure investments and rate base growth as well as future dividend growth. 
Speaking of dividend growth, I am pleased to report that, last week, Ameren's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of approximately 7%, resulting in an annualized dividend rate of $2.20 per share. This increase, coupled with the dividend increase of 4% in October 2020, reflects confidence by Ameren's Board of Directors in the outlook for our businesses and management's ability to execute its strategy for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders. 
While I'm very pleased with our past performance, we are not sitting back and taking a deep breath. We remain focused on accelerating and enhancing our performance in 2021 and in the years ahead, so we can continue to deliver superior value to our customers, communities and shareholders. 
Which brings me to Page 8. Yesterday afternoon, we also announced that we expect our 2021 earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. Mike will provide you with more details on our 2021 guidance a bit later. Building on the strong execution of our strategy and our robust earnings growth over the past several years, we continue to expect to deliver long-term earnings growth that is among the best in the industry. We expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2021 to 2025, using the midpoint of our 2021 guidance, $3.75 per share, as the base. Our long-term earnings growth will be driven by continued execution of our strategy, including investing in infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while keeping rates affordable. 
Another important element of our strong total shareholder return story is our dividend. Looking ahead, Ameren expects future dividend growth to be in line with its long-term earnings per share growth expectations within a payout ratio range of 55% to 70%. In addition to earnings growth considerations, future dividend decisions will be driven by cash flow, investment requirements and other business conditions. 
Turning to Page 9. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong long-term earnings growth I just discussed is primarily driven by our rate base growth plan. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base in an approximately 8% compound annual rate for the 2020 through 2025 period. This growth is driven by our robust capital plan of approximately $17 billion over the next 5 years that will deliver significant value to our customers and the communities we serve. Our plan includes strategically allocating capital to all 4 of our business segments. Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities for Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. 
Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file for certificates of convenience and necessity for some renewable generation projects in 2021 with the Missouri PSC. We expect to add these investments to our multiyear rate base outlook as we finalize pending negotiations with renewable energy developers and move further along in the regulatory approval process in Missouri. Finally, we remain focused on disciplined cost management to earn as close to allowed returns as possible in all of our businesses. 
Speaking of disciplined cost management, let's now turn to Page 10. Over the last several years, we have worked hard to enhance the regulatory frameworks in both Missouri and Illinois to help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders. At the same time, we have been very focused on disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable. Our efforts are paying off. 
As outlined on this page, residential rates have decreased since opting into these enhanced regulatory frameworks for all of our Missouri electric and Illinois electric and natural gas distribution businesses. So to be clear, since these constructive frameworks have been put in place, significant investments have been made, liability has improved, rates have gone down and thousands of jobs have been created. While this is a great win for our customers and communities, we are not done. 
Turning to Page 11. As you can see from this chart, our operating expenses have decreased 14% since 2015. We will remain relentlessly focused on disciplined cost management as we look forward to the next 5 years and beyond. This will not only include the robust cost management initiatives undertaken to manage COVID-19 but also several other customer affordability initiatives. These initiatives include the automation and optimization of our processes, including leveraging the benefits from significant past and future investments in digital technologies and grid modernization. 
In addition, as part of the Ameren Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, we will work to responsibly retire our coal-fired energy centers over time, which includes thoughtfully managing workforce changes through attrition, transfers to other facilities and retaining -- retraining for other positions in the company. 
Turning now to Page 12. Next, I want to cover the second pillar of our strategy: enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. An enhanced version of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed in the past week, which, if passed, would apply to both the Ameren Illinois Electric and natural gas distribution businesses. This legislation will allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy, battery storage and gas infrastructure to improve safety and reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. This important piece of legislation will also require diverse supplier spend reporting for all electric renewable energy providers. 
Another key component of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act is that it would allow for performance-based ratemaking for Ameren Illinois' natural gas and electric distribution businesses to 2032. The proposed performance metric would ensure investments are aligned with and are contributing to reliability of the energy grid as well as to transition to the clean energy vision of the state. Further, this legislation would modify the allowed return on equity methodology in each business to align with returns being earned by other gas and electric utilities across the nation. This legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to invest in critical energy infrastructure under a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment, improved safety and reliability as well as creating over 1,400 jobs, all while keeping electric rates well below the Midwest and national averages. 
This bill will also move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050. By providing for performance-based ratemaking for both electric and gas distribution businesses, we believe the proposed legislation would further align the energy goals of Ameren Illinois and the state of Illinois for the benefit of our customers, the communities we serve and the environment. With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed this year. 
Moving now to Page 13 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment plan to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. As I mentioned earlier, Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of our first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. Last month, we acquired our second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center, located in Northwest Missouri. Approximately 120 megawatts are already in service. We expect a total of 150 megawatts to be in service by the end of the first quarter, which remain expected later in 2021 upon the replacement of certain turbine blades. We financed these projects through a combination of green first mortgage bonds and common stock issued under our forward equity sale agreement. We do not expect a construction delay on our Atchison wind facility to have significant economic consequences or reduce the production tax credits for this project because of the rule change made by the U.S. Department of Treasury last year to extend the in-service criteria by 1 year to December 31, 2021. 
Turning now to Page 14 and an update on our Callaway Energy Center. Turning to return to full power as part of its 24th week fueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Illinois Missouri's Callaway Energy Center experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted, and the decision was made to replace certain key components of the generator in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service. Work is already underway on this capital project, which we expect will cost approximately $65 million. We are also pursuing the recovery of costs to put global warranties and insurance. Due to the long lead time for the manufacturing, repair and installation of these components, the energy center is expected to return to service in late June or early July. And as announced previously, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results. 
Turning now to Page 15. As we look to the future, the successful execution of our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results for 2025 but is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We believe that a safe, reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid will be increasingly important and bring even greater value to our customers, our communities and shareholders. With this long-term view in mind, we are making investments that will position Ameren to meet our customers' future energy needs and rising expectations, support our transition to a cleaner energy future and provide safe, reliable natural gas services. 
The right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our electric and natural gas energy delivery investments to be 82% of our rate base by the end of 2025. As a result of Ameren Missouri's investment in 700 megawatts of wind generation, combined with the scheduled retirement of the Meramec coal-fired energy center in 2022, we expect coal-fired generation to decline to just 7% of rate base and our renewable generation to increase to 6% of rate base by year-end 2025. As noted previously, our current 5-year plan does not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable generation included in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan by 2025. 
These actions are just further examples of the steps we are taking to address our customers and shareholders' focus on ESG matters and achieve our net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to positon Ameren for success in 2021 and beyond. 
Moving to Page 16. Looking ahead through the end of this decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities, over $40 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new regionally beneficial transmission projects that would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 17. As we have outlined in our presentation today, we are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. Consistent with that focus, yesterday, we issued our updated ESG investor presentation called Leading the Way to a Sustainable Energy Future. This presentation demonstrates how we have been effectively integrating our focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters into our corporate strategy. This slide summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters. Throughout the course of my discussion this morning, I've already covered many of these topics. 
A few other notable points include the fact that we were honored to again be recognized by DiversityInc as one of the top utilities in the country for diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as be rated in the top 25 of all companies for ESG in their inaugural list.
Finally, our strong corporate governance is led by a very talented and diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight of ESG matters. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our sustainability value proposition. You can find this presentation at amereninvestors.com. 
Moving to Page 18. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth from 2021 to 2025, driven by strong rate base growth, compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend. Our strong earnings growth expectations outlined today position us well for future dividend growth. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlooks results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Michael."

Turning now to Page 20 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported 2020 earnings of $3.50 per share compared to earnings of $3.35 per share in 2019. Ameren Transmission earnings were up $0.13 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and the impact of the FERC order on the MISO allowed base return on equity. Earnings from Ameren Illinois natural gas were up $0.06 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and lower other operations and main expenses due to disciplined cost management. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, increased $0.03 per share from $1.74 per share in 2019 to $1.77 per share in 2020. The comparison reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, which increased earnings by $0.23 per share compared to 2019. Earnings also benefited from lower operations and maintenance expenses, which increased earnings $0.16 per share. This was due, in part, to the deferral expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage compared to recognizing all of the expenses for the spring 2019 outage at that time. The change in timing of expense recognition was approved by the Missouri PSC in early 2020 and better aligns revenue with expenses. 
In addition, the decline in other O&M expenses were driven by disciplined cost management exercise throughout the year. These favorable factors were mostly offset by lower electric retail sales driven by the impacts of COVID-19 and weather, which, together, reduced earnings by approximately $0.18 per share. In 2020, we experienced milder-than-normal summer and winter temperatures compared to near-normal summer and winter temperatures in 2019. In addition, lower MEEIA performance incentives reduced earnings by $0.09 per share compared to 2019 and higher interest expense due to higher long-term debt outstanding reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. And finally, under terms of the Missouri rate review settlement in order, we recognized a onetime charitable contribution which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. 
Moving to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings decreased $0.01 per share, which reflected a lower allowed return on equity under performance-based ratemaking, mostly offset by increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments. The allowed return on equity under formulaic ratemaking was 7.4% in 2020 compared to 8.4% in 2019 and was applied to year-end rate base. The 2020 allowed ROE was based on the 2020 average 30-year treasury yield of approximately 1.6%, down from the 2019 average of 2.6%. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and Other results were lower compared to 2019 due to increased interest expense, resulting from higher long-term debt outstanding as well as reduced tax benefits, primarily associated with share-based compensation. 
Turning to Page 21. Outlined on this page are our electric sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution for 2020 compared to 2019. Overall, the year-end results for Ameren Missouri are largely consistent with our expectations outlined on our call in May in terms of impact on total sales and earnings per share for 2020 due to COVID-19. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Moving to Page 22 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $17.1 billion of strategically allocated capital plan expenditures for the 2021 through 2025 period. By business segment, [indiscernible] we have approximately 8% projected rate base growth Warner discussed earlier. This plan includes an incremental $1.1 billion compared to the $16 billion 5-year plan for 2020 through 2024 that we laid out last February.
Turning to Page 23. We outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as the investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. Those tax deferrals are driven primarily by timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated appreciation for tax purposes. In addition to the benefits of the accelerated tax depreciation, as a result of our $1.1 billion investment in 700 megawatts of wind generation, we will generate production tax credits over this period. 
From a financing perspective, while we have no long-term debt maturities in 2021, we do expect to continue to issue long-term debt at the Ameren Parent, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to fund a portion of our cash requirements. We also plan to continue to use newly issued shares from our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the 5-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually. 
Last week, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sale agreement to generate approximately $115 million. In order for us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund a robust infrastructure plan, we expect incremental equity issuance of approximately $150 million in 2021 and $300 million each year starting in 2022 through 2025. All of these actions are expected to enable us to maintain a consolidated capitalization target of approximately 45% equity. 
Moving to Page 24 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. As Warner stated, we expect 2021 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers and assumptions behind our 2021 earnings guidance, broken down by segment as compared to our 2020 results. Beginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to rise in 2021. As previously noted, a majority of the 700 megawatts of wind generation investment was placed in service at the end of 2020 and early 2021. As a result, we expect to see significant contributions to earnings from these investments in 2021. The 2021 earnings comparison is also expected to be favorably impacted by the first quarter -- in the first quarter by increased Missouri Electric Service rates that took effect April 1, 2020. 
We also expect higher weather-normalized electric sales and other margins in 2021 compared to 2020, as outlined by customer class on the slide, reflecting the continual improvement in economic activity since the COVID-19 lockdowns that began in the second quarter of last year. 
While 2021 sales expectations are much improved over 2020, we do not expect total sales to return to pre-COVID-19 levels this year. Further, we expect a return to normal weather in 2021 will increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.04 compared to 2020 results. We expect the amortization expenses associated with the fall 2020 Callaway scheduled refueling and maintenance outage to reduce earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in 2021. The fall 2020 outage costs of approximately $0.12 per share was deferred pursuant to the Missouri PSC order and is expected to be amortized over approximately 17 months starting January 2021. We also expect higher operations and maintenance expenses to reduce earnings. 
Moving on, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking. This benefit will be partially offset by the absence of the impact of the 2020 FERC order on the MISO base allowed return on equity. 
Turning to Page 25. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2021 compared to 2020 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois performance-based ratemaking. Our guidance incorporates a rate base -- a formula-based allowed ROE of 7.75% using a forecasted 1.9% 2020 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond, which is higher than the allowed ROE of 7.4% in 2020. The allowed ROE is applied to year-end rate base. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings will benefit from higher delivery service rates based on a 2021 future test year, which were effective late last month, as well as from infrastructure investments qualifying for the rider investment treatment. 
Moving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect the increased common shares outstanding as a result of the issuance under the forward equity sale agreement, our dividend reinvestment employee benefit plans and additional equity issuance of approximately $150 million to unfavorably impact earnings per share by $0.12. Of course, in 2021, we will seek to manage all of our businesses to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible while being mindful of operating and other business needs. 
I'd also like to take a moment to discuss our electric retail sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt hour sales to be in the range of flat to up approximately 0.5% compounding annually over our 5-year plan, excluding the effects of our MEEIA energy efficiency plans using 2021 as the base year. Again, we exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales, resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. 
Turning to Illinois, we expect our weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales, including energy efficiency, to be relatively flat over the 5-year plan. 
Turning to Page 26 and Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. Last October, we filed a request with the Missouri PSC to track and defer on our regulatory asset certain COVID-19-related costs incurred, net of any COVID-19 realized cost savings. Through December 31, 2020, we have accumulated approximately $6 million of net cost, and we requested additional true-ups. If our requests are approved by the Missouri PSC, the ability to recover and the timing of recovery of these costs would be determined as part of the next electric and gas rate reviews. We continue to work towards a settlement with key stakeholders. I would also note that PSC is under no deadline to issue orders. Speaking of future rate reviews, we continue to expect to file the next in Missouri electric and gas rate reviews by the end of March 2021. 
Turning to Page 27. In Illinois -- Ameren Illinois electric regulatory matters. In December, the ICC approved a $49 million base electric distribution rate decrease in the annual rate update proceeding with new rates effective at the beginning of the year. This marks the third consecutive overall reduction in rates and the seventh overall rate decrease since performance-based ratemaking began in 2011. 
In Ameren Illinois natural gas regulatory matters, last month, the ICC approved a $76 million annual increase in gas distribution rates using a 2021 future test year, a 9.67% of return on equity and a 52% equity ratio. The $76 million included $44 million of annual revenues that would otherwise be recovered in 2021 under Ameren Illinois qualifying infrastructure plant and other riders. New rates were effective in late January. 
Finally, turning to Page 28. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue to execute our plan. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2020, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. And as we look ahead, we expect 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth from 2021 to 2025 driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers, and Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

So subsequently, we did open up the generator for inspection and identified issues with both the rotor as well as the stator. So we decided that significant components did need to be replaced, and those are long lead time materials that need to be manufactured, installed, tested, et cetera so that we can ultimately make sure that we bring the plant back safely and sustainably. And we do estimate that, that will take till, as we said, late June or early July. 
So during this period of time, the plant does remain down. But as we suggested, we're going to be doing everything we can to reduce the ultimate cost, including pursuing recovery of costs through warranties as well as we've made insurance claims and to have insurance, both on the property side as well as for accidental outage impacts, as it relates to loss generation."

One, Julien, it addresses the issue that you talked about. Really is no longer that Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act that was filed isn't based on a 30-year treasury. It is doing what legislators really wanted to have done back in 2012 when the modernization action plan was put in place. That was simply to try and have the return on equity really become very close to the national average, and that's exactly what's reflected in there. 
And so that's why we like that though. And of course, we like to bill that was filed because it not only applies to our electric business, but our gas business because we're firmly convinced that performance-based ratemaking has done terrific things for the state of Illinois in terms of reliability, in terms of affordability and jobs.

Look, we've discussed with you and investors in the past that, look, Ameren's dividend and this dividend policy are really important matters to our Board of Directors. And so clearly, the Board took careful consideration in terms of thinking, first and foremost, about the dividend policy. And as you know, we announced that dividend policy change that talked about the future dividend growth is really going to be in line with our long-term earnings per share growth and within our payout ratio of 55% to 70%, which is what we talked about in the past. 
So when they did that, we all collectively did that, we also carefully considered the practice that we've been using over the last several years of raising the dividend in the fall, in October. And at the end of the day, the Board of Directors came to the conclusion that it was really just appropriate to align the dividend increase we announced last week with the simultaneous updating of the dividend policy, which I just described, and then also to align it with our discussion about long-term earnings guidance, which, as you know, we typically do right now at the beginning of the year. 
And so I can never tell you exactly what the Board will do in the future. And I would expect the practice that we are pointing this year to continue in the future. So, of course, all future dividend decisions, as we've said before, are driven by all kinds of things, earnings growth, cash flow, investments, business conditions, those types of things.

Look, really, our message around this, Paul, hasn't really changed. We talked last year, and we'll continue to talk about that. But as we see it as our legislators see it, the downstate needs are different. And keep in mind, when you think about downstate, I mean, we are the major energy supplier downstate, not just on the electric side, but on the gas side as well. And so as our downstate legislators looked at it and they clearly recognize there are some broad policy issues in the state of Illinois, clearly, in the northern portion of the state around the nuclear plants, these are important issues. And so we get that. And of course, we're engaged in those conversations because we want to make sure that policy decisions made for the nuclear plants and others don't have negative implications for our customers downstate. So we're engaged there. 
But similarly, we know the importance of investing in energy infrastructure, on the electric and gas businesses. And we don't want to lose sight of that. And so we have proposed legislation like we did last year that really is affecting the downstate, which is very consistent with what the state of Illinois wants to move towards: a cleaner energy future. And this Downstate Affordability Act isn't just about grid modernization, let's just be clear, it is, in part, and certainly around the gas business but also is driving towards greater electrification, greater solar and battery storage and these all have policies that support these critical investments. 
So look, at the end of the day, we are -- we believe this is an appropriate approach. Of course, we're still early in the session, as Julien and I discussed a little while ago, and so we'll engage with key stakeholders, other utilities on these important manners. But this is the direction that we think is appropriate and certainly the sponsors of the legislation do as well."

And then, Michael, maybe you can get a little bit into the math in the first part. A couple of things. With regard to the renewables and the transmission, we do see these as meaningful opportunities to continue our rate base growth. Now as we've said in the past, we're not out here giving our 5-year plan and whether it would be 100% additive in all respects, that would be premature for me to say that. 
But to be clear, we see the real needs clearly in our Integrated Resource Plan for renewables, and we are taking steps, as we discussed earlier, to begin executing that plan. In fact, we've already started that, as you know, with regard to the 700 megawatts. But we believe it's absolutely prudent and appropriate to do more as we transition to a clean energy future. But that clean energy future,really is not going to be coming forth if we don't have greater levels of investment in transmission. 
And so as we pointed out in our slides and before that these large regional transmission projects, which have really put our country in a position where it is today in terms of growth in renewables, we're going to need to do more of that. And so we see those as greater opportunities. When they come in is a little early to say. We have been actively working with MISO and other key stakeholders to try and put the process in place for those transmission investments to get going on those. 
As I've said before, those take time. They're not going to be done here in a year or 2. If anything, we might see some towards the back end of our '21 to '25 plan, but we certainly see greater levels of investment in transmission in the next decade to enable where this transition to a clean energy future. So stay tuned in terms of how it ultimately gets additive. But we see that as clearly potential upside opportunities. And Michael, I'll let you address the specific rate base question."

It's just a function of, obviously, a higher jump-off point here in 2020 but still very robust rate base growth of 8%, as is noted on the slide. 
As we think about beyond '25, I mean, obviously, there's a large pipeline of opportunity there, $40-plus billion that we've indicated. And look, we'll have to just continue to assess over time how we continue to phase us into the capital plan. We're mindful, to the previous question, about customer affordability and just managing an overall rate impact. So that's got to be factored into all of this just overall financing, those types of things.

I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy. 
Before I begin my discussion of our first quarter results and related business matters, I want to begin with a few comments on COVID-19. It is hard to believe that we have now been addressing the challenges associated with this pandemic for over a year now. Needless to say, much has changed. However, one thing that has not changed is our relentless focus on delivering safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable electric and natural gas service for the millions of people in Missouri and Illinois that are depending on us. 
As I said during our year-end conference call in February, despite the significant challenges presented by COVID-19, I look to the future with optimism. In part, this was due to the aggressive distribution of vaccines throughout our country. I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see the fruits of the incredible efforts by so many in the health care, government, public and private sectors. COVID-19 cases are down significantly from earlier in the year, the restrictions have lessened. As a result, we are clearly seeing signs that the economy is improving in our service territory and across the country. 
My optimism was also driven by how our coworkers have consistently stepped up and addressed a multitude of challenges and capitalized on opportunities and the strong execution of our strategy that is delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders. Together, these factors contributed to our ability to get off to a strong start in 2021, which brings me to a discussion of our first quarter results, starting on Page 4. 
Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to earnings of $0.59 per share in the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase of $0.32 per share reflected increased infrastructure investments across all of our business segments that will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers. The key drivers of first quarter results are outlined on this slide. 
I'm also pleased to report that we continue to effectively execute our strategic plan and remain on track to deliver within our 2021 earnings guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share. Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2021 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later. 
Moving to Page 5. Here, we reiterate our strategic plan. First pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers. As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, including our investment in wind generation. 
Regarding regulatory matters, in late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenue with the Missouri Public Service Commission. In addition, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $9 million increase in annual natural gas revenue with the PSC. While Michael will discuss the details of the requests in a moment, I'd like to briefly touch on some of the key benefits our electric and natural gas customers in Missouri are seeing as a result of the investments reflected in these rate requests. 
We are now in the third year of Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan, which is focused on strengthening the grid through infrastructure upgrades, adding more renewable generation and creating programs to stimulate economic growth for communities across the state. Our grid monetization investments incorporate smart technology, including now a detection and restoration switches as well as smart readers, which allow customers to take advantage of new rate options. These investments are delivering results to improve reliability and resiliency. For example, on circuits with new smart technology upgrades, we have seen up to a 40% improvement in reliability. 
Of course, we also remain committed to a clean energy transition for our customers and state. This is demonstrated through our recent acquisitions of 2 wind generation facilities located in Northern Missouri totaling 700 megawatts. 
In addition, our investments are stimulating economic growth for communities across the state. I'm pleased to say that 57% of Ameren Missouri suppliers in 2020 are Missouri-based and 32% of its sourceable capital spend was with diverse suppliers. And we're doing all of these things while keeping our customers' electric rates approximately 20% below the average than other Midwest states and across the country. At the same time, we remain very disciplined in managing our costs. 
As a result, if approved, the new electric rate request will represent a 5.4% total increase over an almost 5-year period, a yearly average of approximately 1%. We will remain disciplined in managing our costs while we build a stronger, smarter and cleaner energy system for our customers now and in the future. 
Moving now to Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In January, we received a constructive rate order from the ICC that resulted in a $76 million annual increase in gas distribution rates. New rates went into effect in late January. 
In our Illinois electric business, we made our required annual electric distribution link filing, requesting a $64 million base rate increase. This filing is only the second requested increase in delivery service rates in 6 years. While Michael will touch on the details of our filing a bit later, I think it is important to note that for years our Illinois customers have realized the benefits by our significant investments in energy infrastructure. 
Since performance-based ratemaking began in 2012, reliability has improved by 20% and over 1,400 jobs have been created. At the same time, electric rates are among the lowest in the country and Midwest, approximately 3% below 2012 levels. This performance-based framework has been a win-win for our customers and the state of Illinois. That is why we continue to strongly advocate for a performance-based regulatory framework in the Illinois legislature, which brings me to our discussion on the second pillar of our strategy: enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies on Page 6. 
As I discussed in our conference call in February, an enhanced version of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed earlier this year, which the [ past apply ] to both the Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas distribution businesses. This legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy, battery storage and electric and gas infrastructure to continue to enhance safety and reliability as well as [indiscernible] transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across central and southern Illinois. This important piece of legislation also require diverse supplier spend reporting for all electric renewable energy providers. 
Another key component of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act is that it will allow for performance-based ratemaking for Ameren Illinois natural gas and electric distribution businesses through 2032. The proposed performance metrics will ensure investments are aligned with and are contributing to the safety and reliability of the energy grid and natural gas systems as well as the state's vision for the transition to clean energy. 
Further, this legislation will modify the allowed return on equity methodology in each business to align with the average returns being earned by other gas and electric utilities across the nation. And as I noted a moment ago, this legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to invest in critical energy infrastructure into a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment, improved safety and reliability and created significant new jobs, all while keeping electric rates well below the Midwest and national averages. This bill would also move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2015. 
With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. To date, the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act has received strong bipartisan support from members of the Senate and House. Currently, House Bill 1734 has 49 sponsors and Senate Bill 311 has 21 sponsors. As I'm sure you know, there are also several other energy-related bills being considered by the legislature. We will continue to be actively engaged with key stakeholders throughout the legislative session on these important energy policy matters. The spring session is currently set to end May 31. 
Turning to Page 7 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In April, FERC issued a supplemental notice of proposed rule-making on the electric transmission return on equity incentive adder for participation in a Regional Transmission Organization or RTO. In the supplemental notice, the FERC proposes to limit the duration of the 50 basis point ROE incentive adder for companies that join an RTO to 3 years. FERC also proposes to eliminate the adder for utilities that have been part of an RTO for 3 years or more, which would include Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Without this incentive matter, Ameren Illinois and ATX would in the current allowed base ROE of 10.02%. For perspective, every 50 basis point change in our FERC ROE impacts annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04. Needless to say, we are disappointed with the direction the FERC has taken in the supplemental notice and strongly oppose the removal of the adder. From our perspective, RTO participation adder is needed to compensate companies assuming risks associated with turning over operational control of assets to the RTO. The proposal is also inconsistent with the first stated policy goals and the intent of existing model to encourage RTO participation. We will continue to advocate for the RTO incentive adder and other project incentive adders proposed in the March 2020 [indiscernible]. We will file comments on the supplemental [indiscernible] by the May 26 deadline. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this matter as the focus is under no timeline to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 8. Both policy [indiscernible] are important because transmission investment is going to play a critical role in our country's clean energy transition. As we have discussed before, MISO and other key stakeholders, including Ameren, have been carefully assessing the transmission needs in the MISO footprint to ensure the overall reliability and resiliency of the energy grid is maintained while companies execute their clean energy transition plans. 
Recently, MISO published several reports that outline some of the preliminary thoughts on MISO's transmission needs in the future. This page summarizes a recent study that outlines a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant levels of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy and/or carbon emission reductions, among other things. 
I would also note that MISO and the southwest power pool are also working together to develop a similar evaluation of transmission needed to support the transition across both regions. The bottom line is that significant regional and local transmission investments will be needed for the clean energy transition over the next 10 to 20 years. 
For example, under MISO's future 1 scenario, which is a scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates future transmission investment can amount to an estimated $30 billion in the MISO footprint. 
Further, future 3 resulted in an approximate 80% reduction in carbon emission levels below 2005 levels by 2039. MISO's estimated future 3 could result in an estimated $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint. 
To provide some context to this, during MISO's last regional transmission planning process, approximately $6.5 billion of multivalue project investments were made over the last 10 years or so. 
In light of the continued focus on the clean energy transition in our country, we are actively working with MISO and other key stakeholders to move the assessment and project approval process along with an appropriate sense of urgency to ensure we maintain a safe, reliable and resilient energy grid and do so in an affordable fashion. 
Given our past success in executing large regional transmission projects, we believe we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. 
We believe certain projects outlined in future 1 will be included in this year's MISO transmission planning process, which is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. We look forward to working with MISO and key stakeholders on this important planning process. 
Speaking of clean energy transitions, let's move now to Page 9 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment planned to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of its first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. In January, Ameren Missouri acquired its second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in northwest Missouri. Approximately 0.5 megawatts of the Atchison Renewable Energy Center are in service. We expect the remaining megawatts to be placed in service by September 30. 
Turning now to Page 10 and an update on Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. During its return to full power as part of its 24th refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Callaway experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted, and the decision was made to rewind the generator stator and rotor in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service. The project is going well, and we continue to expect the capital project to cost approximately $65 million. 
I'm also pleased to report that the insurance claims within capital project and replacement power have been accepted by insurance carrier, which will mitigate the impacts of this outage for our customers. We expect the Callaway Energy Center to return to service in July. As we have said previously, we do not expect this [ matter ] to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results. 
Turning to Page 11. We are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future. 
I've discussed several elements of our strong sustainability and value proposition with you in the past. And so in the interest of time,  I'll not go through all of these points again this morning. 
Having said that, and moving to Page 12, you should know that we have already made significant progress in our sustainability efforts in 2021. Here, we highlight several key achievements to date this year. 
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes strong [ interim ] carbon emission reduction targets at 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively. This plan is also at the heart of our updated Climate Risk Report, which is based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures which we issued last week. 
I am pleased to report our plan is consistent with the objectives of the Paris agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
In terms of social impact, I am very excited to say that our efforts in this area continue to be recognized by leading organizations. Last week, DiversityInc announced Ameren is once again named #1 on the Top Utilities list for diversity and inclusion, a list we have been probably a part of since 2009. 
DiversityInc also ranked Ameren second on the top 10 regional companies and as a top company for ESG among all industries. 
In addition, for the fifth year in a row, we've been certified by a Great Place to Work. 
And finally, we were recognized as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ by the Human Rights Campaign. 
Moving to governance. Our Board and management have established covenant structures that enable a focus on the ESG matters that drive Ameren's strategy, mission and vision, including the addition of ESG metrics into our executive compensation programs. 
In particular, our Board of Directors refined our executive compensation program by adding workforce and supplier diversity metrics to our short-term incentive plan for 2021. 
In addition, we recently issued several social impact policies. 
Since our call in February, we have also issued several reports, reflecting our sustainability efforts and advances. 
Just last week, we posted our 2021 Sustainability Report, which [ explains ] many ESG and sustainability topics and post the 2020 ESG Sustainability Template. 
And for the first time, we published information using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board reporting framework and mapped our business activities to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports  at amereninvestors.com. 
Turning now to Page 13. Environmental stewardship, social impact and governance are 3 pillars of our strong sustainability value proposition. Our final pillar is sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we have a strong, sustainable growth proposition, which will be driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. 
Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new regionally beneficial transmission projects that I described earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
In addition, we expect to see greater focus from a policy perspective and infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector. 
Our outlook through 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time either. 
Of course, our investment opportunities not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. 
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner, future in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 14. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In February, we issued our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. 
Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file this year with the Missouri PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of these planned renewable investments. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I will now turn the call over to Michael."

Turning now to Page 16 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to $0.59 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our larges",1655,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 16 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to $0.59 per share for the year ago quarter. 
Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, increased $0.22 per share due to several favorable factors. The earnings comparison reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, 2020, which increased earnings by $0.10 per share. In addition, earnings benefited from lower operations and maintenance expenses, which increased earnings $0.07 per share. This was primarily driven by the absence of unfavorable market returns that occurred in 2020 on the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance, as well as disciplined cost management. Earnings also benefited by approximately $0.04 per share from higher electric retail sales, driven by near-normal winter temperatures compared to milder-than-normal winter temperatures in the year ago period. 
We have included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter that showed total sales to be comparable with Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by COVID-19. 
We continue to see improvements in sales as schools and businesses reopen and begin to increase their levels of operation. 
Earnings were positively impacted by the timing of income tax expense, which we do not expect to impact full year results as well as the absence of charitable donations that were made pursuant to the Missouri rate review settlement in March 2020. 
And finally, these favorable factors were partially offset by the amortization of [ deferred exist ] related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. 
Moving to other segments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.08, reflecting higher delivery service rates that were effective January 25, 2021, incorporating a change in rate design, as well as the increased infrastructure investments and a lower allowed ROE. The first quarter 2021 benefit from the change in rate design is not expected to impact full year results. 
Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.03 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking of approximately 8.15% compared to 7.45% for the year ago quarter. 
Ameren Transmission earnings were comparable year-over-year, which reflected increased infrastructure investments that were offset by an unfavorable $0.03 impact of a March 2021 FERC order. This order related to an intervenor challenge regarding the historical recoveries of material and supplies inventories and rates and will have no impact on the current [indiscernible] calculation prospectively. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and other results were down $0.01 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to increased interest expense resulting from higher long-term debt outstanding, offset by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year results. 
Finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding. 
Before moving on, I'll touch on sales transfer in Illinois Electric Distribution in the quarter Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased 1.5%. And weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Turning to Page 17. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong start in 2021. And as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. 
Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. I'll note that our second quarter earnings comparison will be negatively impacted due to a seasonal rate design change effective for 2021 in Ameren Missouri as part of the March 2020 electric rate order. This order called for winter rates in May and summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020. 
The second quarter results were also being negatively impacted by the absence of the impact of the 2020 FERC order approving the MISO allowed base ROE at Ameren Transmission. 
Together, these 2 items are expected to reduce second quarter earnings by approximately $0.25 year-over-year. I encourage you to take this into consideration as you develop your expectations for our second quarter earnings results. 
Turning now to Page 18. Here, we outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate review that Warner mentioned earlier. This reflects many benefits, including major upgrades to the electric system reliability and resiliency for customers as well as investments to support the transition to cleaner energy for the benefit of customers and local communities. 
Now let me take a moment to go through the details of this filing. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021 estimated rate base of $10 billion. This includes the test year ended December 31, 2020, with certain pro forma adjustments through September 30, 2021. The request includes a continuation of the existing FAC and other regulatory mechanisms, along with our request to recover certain costs associated with the Meramec Energy Center, which is expected to retire in 2022, over a 5-year period from the date that the new rates become effective. 
As outlined on this page, the key drivers of our $299 million annual rate increase include: increased infrastructure investments made under Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy plan; impact of the transition to a cleaner generation portfolio; decreased weather-normalized customer sales volumes; and a higher pension OPEB and tax amortization expenses, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expenses. 
Moving to Page 19 for an update on other Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In March 2021, we also filed a natural gas rate review. The details for the $9 million annual revenue increase request are outlined on this page. We expect the Missouri PSC decision in both our electric and natural gas rate reviews by February 2022, with new rates expected to be effective by March. 
Further, last October, we filed a request with the Missouri PSC to track and defer on a regulatory asset certain COVID-related costs incurred net of any COVID-related cost savings. In March 2021, the Missouri PSC approved this request. $9 million of net costs were incurred through March 31, 2021. We recognized $5 million in the first quarter of this year and expect the remaining portion relating to late fees to be recognized when realized in rates beginning in early 2022. The timing of recovery of these costs will be determined as part of our pending electric and gas rate reviews. 
Moving now to Page 20 for an update on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Last month, we made our required annual electric distribution performance-based rate update filing, requesting a $64 million base rate increase. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to make annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over or under-recovery of such costs. Since this constructive framework began, Ameren Illinois has made prudent investments to strengthen the grid and reduce outages and continues to do so. Major investments, including the request of the installation of outage avoidance and detection technology, integration of storm hardening equipment, adoption of clean energy technologies and the implementation of new energy efficiency measures, including mobile-enhanced communications and assessment capabilities for electric field workers. The ICC will review our request in the months ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in January of next year. 
Turning to Page 21 for a financing and liquidity update. We continue to feel very good about our liquidity and financial position. In February, Ameren Corporation issued $450 million of 1.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2028. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including that we will repay short-term of debt. 
We also expect both Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt in 2021. 
In addition, as we mentioned on the call in February, during the quarter, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sales agreement to generate approximately $115 million. 
In order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $150 million of additional common equity during the balance of 2021, which is consistent with the guidance we provided in February. 
To that end, in May, we expect to establish an at-the-market or ATM equity program to support equity needs through 2023. These future equity issues will enable us to maintain a consolidated capital structure consisting of approximately 45% equity over time. 
The incremental natural gas and power purchases incurred due to the extreme cold mid-February this year did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or our ability to fund our future operations and investment. 
Ameren's available liquidity as of April 30 was approximately $1.3 billion, which includes $2.3 billion of combined credit facility capacity, net of approximately $1 billion of commercial paper borrowings at the end of the month. 
Finally, turning to Page 22. We're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We're off to a solid start, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. 
As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

I think just by the fact that you see so many bills that are being discussed out there, and rightfully so, right? The clean energy transition is obviously very important, not just for Illinois, but across the country. 
Certainly, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's no doubt that there are several bills that are being considered. Whether there's a grand bargain, if you will, or whether these bills are put together, look, it's just too early to say. 
The only thing I can say is this, is that we are at the table with key stakeholders trying to find a solution and to advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act because, as you heard me say many times, that Act, those provisions, that performance-based ratemaking approach has really delivered significant benefits for our customers in the entire state of Illinois. So we have it until the end of the month to try and get something across the finish line. Richard Mark and his team have been working tirelessly at that. Now I will say their tireless work and the work that we've been doing for many years has already elicited strong bipartisan support. So we're hopeful to get the proper provisions and a final piece of legislation."

Maybe pivoting over to transmission, it seems like an exciting time for transmission, if you will. And do you have any sense of the magnitude of specific projects that could be identified by MISO before year-end or in the not-too-distant future? And what do you see separately as the potential for large-scale HV DC transmission opportunities outside or beyond the MISO process? 
And then finally, I guess, with transmission trying to scale the opportunity set here, so wondering if you could help us think through roughly how much CapEx did Ameren deploy over the years where MISO brought renewable penetration from very little to the higher levels it is today? Are there any rules -- any kind of measures we can think of like $10 billion to accommodate 10%? Just trying to scale the opportunity set here."

And Michael and Andrew will help me if I haven't hit a point, but certainly come back on. 
Let me answer your first question -- your last question perhaps first. As I said in my prepared remarks, we -- there's about $6.5 billion of regional transmission projects that really were deployed across the MISO footprint over the last decade, if you will. We did about $2 billion of that. Now that doesn't mean that was a different time, different place. Obviously, we did 25%, 30% almost of those, and it's because of our location in the MISO footprint. And so that's just number one. 
Two, what you said at the outset, I agree with. It is a very exciting time to be in the transmission business and especially one in the MISO footprint. When you're sitting in the center of the country, right, what MISO does with its transmission is integral to the clean energy transition for our country. 
And so what you're seeing today is obviously a preliminary list of projects. We're informed certainly by stakeholder conversations as well as integrated resource plans and state energy policies, among many other things. It's hard to say just exactly what will ultimately come out of, let's just call, the transmission plan that will be filed later this year. 
But the way we look at it, we look at that future 1, which we showed on that slide, we think that there are a lot of projects contained in that, that we think are really kind of [indiscernible] types of projects. It's premature to put a number on it and which projects to go, because what MISO does now is not they put out this road map, they are basically looking for input from stakeholders. And so you can expect throughout 2021, stakeholders will be providing input into that road map. And with that input, MISO will ultimately prepare their long-range plan, [ NTAP ] is what they call it, and we expect that to be filed in the fourth quarter. 
Ultimately, a process from there, Jeremy, has been to some more input. But ultimately, the NTAP is put before the MISO Board of Directors for vote and hopefully approval by the end of the year. 
So it's not too far away, but that future 1 is, I would say, the first step. But then as you look beyond that, as we said in future 3, obviously, those investments continue to grow over time. And as we said, they range from $30 billion to $100 billion. Those are MISO's preliminary estimates that will continue to be refined. 
So hopefully, that gives you some of the sense. I'm not sure if I missed -- if I addressed all of your questions in there, but I think I got them all there."

Maybe the other thing that you're seeing is Sentator [ Widen ] put out a bill that really has some -- I think some very good incentives to invest in clean energy technologies. And those incentives range from tax credits, they range from tax normalization policies to give opt out provisions. They include tax credits also for transmission. And so when we look at the provisions they have done, I won't go through all the details here, that bill will really have a direct impact on the overall cost to our customers. And so we're obviously very encouraged and enthused about that.

So to be clear, I'll say this first, we are very focused on trying to get something across the finish line for the benefit of our customers in the state of Illinois and energy policy here by May 31. 
But your question is, what -- what if it doesn't happen in the next several weeks? Well, then it could be brought up in the veto session. And our approach would be very much what we've been doing. We will continue to strongly advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy affordability Act. And the reason why we'll continue to strongly advocate for it is because it has strong bipartisan support. We have house bills and Senate bills with strong bipartisan support as well as support from north and the south part of the state. So we're going to continue to push for that because we strongly believe it's the best policy going forward for the state of Illinois. It isn't just because we believe it, it's because it's been delivering results for almost a decade now. And so that's what we're going to continue to advocate for. 
So I do think, people say whether it's a priority, I will tell you there are a lot of conversations going on in the state of Illinois around energy policy. I know they have other priorities that they have to balance, but I do believe energy policy is one of them."

Last night, actually, the Senate passed the House Securitization Bill, which is HB 734. And they did make some slight modifications to that. So now that goes back to the house, to the fiscal review committee. And we'll see whether that can be then voted on in the house. We may see actually some action as early as today. 
But in any event, what has to happen over the remainder of the week is that the language needs to get conformed between the 2, the Senate Bill and the House Bill.

As Warner indicated, the legislative session ends on May 14, this Friday, this Friday afternoon.

So it just is too premature, but I will say this. That we as well as MISO and other stakeholders, there's a sense of urgency to address these matters, because we see the clean energy transition coming and we know that transmission is critical to its success. And so consequently, there is a significant amount of interest, a significant amount of work being done. And so we're not too far away from really hearing what that's going to be. The fourth quarter is really, for all practical purposes, right around the corner. And as you know, some of these projects, as you said, they take time to plan, get approval and ultimately execute. 
So again, as we see -- and I've said this in the past, it's really just -- the study really is consistent with what we've been talking about really for the last several years. We see significant transmission opportunities. And should they come in the form of this NTAP or otherwise, we think they're probably -- if there are any, would come towards the back end of our 5-year current capital expenditure plan.

Look, as we said before, we're very fortunate that we have a strong baseload coal fleet that runs. It runs a lot. And it's because of some of the actions and things we've done really over the past several years, decades, frankly. 
And so we laid out our Integrated Resource Plan, and you see that systematically, we are retiring our coal-fired energy centers over time. And it's because, number one, we think it's in the best interest of our customers from a reliability and affordability perspective. 
And so as Marty said, we don't see that changing, but conditions could change, right, whether it's at a state level or federal level. And so securitization is not going to drive us to do anything different, other than absent changes that may happen, as I said, from a policy perspective or otherwise. But it is a good tool to have in our toolbox should those changes occur. 
So we -- our coal plants are valuable assets to us today. Over time, we will retire them. But we don't see any near-term changes to how we plan on operating or certainly risks to those assets. 
Marty, would you have anything to add to that?"

We've got a very efficient coal plants, they operate very well. 
But with that said, in our Integrated Resource Plan, we did lay out that we're retiring our Meramec facility here in 2022. We expect that, that will be fully recovered at that point in time. We did propose the accelerated closure of both the [ Su ] and the Rush Island plants, Su by about 5 years and Rush Island by about 6 years. So Su would close in 2028, Rush Island in 2039. And then Labadie which is our largest plant and most efficient plant would close in 2 stages in 2036 and 2042. 
So again, we've accelerated the expected closure of 2 of our plants, and those accelerations and the recovery of those are actually reflected in the rate review filing that we made here in March. So we're looking to accelerate the recovery of those plants. And then, of course, the rates are also positively impacted by the expectation of Meramec closing. 
So those things are reflected there. That's historically the way we've handled things in Missouri. And again, as Warner said, when we filed the IRP, we made a host of assumptions. Conditions can change and vary from the assumptions that we made through time for a variety of reasons. And as I said before, securitization is not going to change the Integrated Resource Plan, preferred plan that we have today. But if conditions change versus the assumptions we've made through time, again, securitization will be a good tool to have in the toolbox."

One we talked quite a bit about already today, and that's transmission. So as you know, we present investment opportunities through 2030 of $40 billion plus of investment opportunities. And one of the reasons we put that plus there is because transmission. So that $40 billion number that we have of investment opportunity does not include any of the regional transmission projects that we spent quite a bit of time talking about already. So Stephen, that would be certainly one meaningful upside to our investment profile that we have prospectively. 
A second one and another one that we talked about, and again I mentioned this a little bit earlier, is electrification and the infrastructure that has to go for the greater electrification, especially of the transportation sector in our country. Our long-term plan has really no meaningful investments associated with the electrification of the transportation sector. And as you listen to the policymakers discuss the needs for a cleaner energy transition in this country and lower carbon emissions, well, the transportation sector is the greatest carbon emitter in our country today. And so you've heard certainly the automakers and others continuing to lean further in. Well, we're going to lean further into, and we have been. So I think that, too, is a significant opportunity. 
But I'll tell you, just to be clear, what I've done with all of our investments in grid modernization, we need to continue to make investments in the grid, both Missouri and Illinois, to make sure that the grid continues to be reliable and resilient. 
So as we look at those investment opportunities, which could also then include renewal -- greater levels of renewable energy over time, we have quite a bit [indiscernible] but times, as we said, could change, if policies change, those [ 2 ] could be investment opportunities. 
I didn't put a specific number on those, but they're sizable. They're sizable. And so we see our robust infrastructure plan that we have already today continuing for some time."

I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy. 
Before I begin my discussion of our first quarter results and related business matters, I want to begin with a few comments on COVID-19. It is hard to believe that we have now been addressing the challenges associated with this pandemic for over a year now. 
Needless to say, much has changed. However, one thing that has not changed is our relentless focus on delivering safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable electric and natural gas service for the millions of people in Missouri and Illinois that are depending on us. 
As I said during our year-end conference call in February, despite the significant challenges presented by COVID-19, I look to the future with optimism. In part, this was due to the aggressive distribution of vaccines throughout our country. I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see the fruits of the incredible efforts by so many in the health care, government, public and private sectors. 
COVID-19 cases are down significantly from earlier in the year, the restrictions have lessened. As a result, we are clearly seeing signs that the economy is improving in our service territory and across the country. 
My optimism was also driven by how our coworkers have consistently stepped up and addressed a multitude of challenges and capitalized on opportunities and the strong execution of our strategy that is delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders. Together, these factors contributed to our ability to get off to a strong start in 2021, which brings me to a discussion of our first quarter results Starting on Page 4. 
Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to earnings of $0.59 per share in the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase of $0.32 per share reflected increased infrastructure investments across all of our business segments that will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers. The key drivers of first quarter results are outlined on this slide. 
I'm also pleased to report that we continue to effectively execute our strategic plan and remain on track to deliver within our 2021 earnings guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share. Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2021 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later. 
Moving to Page 5. Here we reiterate our strategic plan. First pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers. As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, including our investment in wind generation. 
Regarding regulatory matters, in late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenue with the Missouri Public Service Commission. In addition, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $9 million increase in annual natural gas revenue with the PSC. While Michael will discuss the details of the requests in a moment, I'd like to briefly touch on some of the key benefits our electric and natural gas customers in Missouri are seeing as a result of the investments reflected in these rate requests. 
We are now in the third year of Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan, which is focused on strengthening the grid through infrastructure upgrades, adding more renewable generation and creating programs to stimulate economic growth for communities across the state. Our grid monetization investments incorporate smart technology, including now a detection and restoration switches as well as smart readers, which allow customers to take advantage of new rate options. 
These investments are delivering results to improve reliability and resiliency. For example, on circuits with new smart technology upgrades, we have seen up to a 40% improvement in reliability. Of course, we also remain committed to a clean energy transition for our customers and state. This is demonstrated through our recent acquisitions of 2 wind generation facilities located in Northern Missouri totaling 700 megawatts. 
In addition, our investments are stimulating economic growth for communities across the state. I'm pleased to say that 57% of Ameren Missouri suppliers in 2020 are Missouri-based, and 32% of its sourceable capital spend was with diverse suppliers. And we're doing all of these things while keeping our customers' electric rates approximately 20% below the average than other Midwest states and across the country. 
At the same time, we remain very disciplined in managing our costs. As a result, if approved, the new electric rate request will represent a 5.4% total increase over an almost 5-year period, a yearly average of approximately 1%. We will remain disciplined in managing our costs, while we build a stronger, smarter and cleaner energy system for our customers now and in the future. 
Moving now to Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In January, we received a constructive rate order from the ICC that resulted in a $76 million annual increase in gas distribution rates. New rates went into effect in late January. 
In our Illinois electric business, we made our required annual electric distribution link filing, requesting a $64 million base rate increase. This filing is only the second requested increase in delivery service rates in 6 years. While Michael will touch on the details of our filing a bit later, I think it is important to note that for years, our Illinois customers have realized the benefits by our significant investments in energy infrastructure. 
Since performance-based ratemaking began in 2012, reliability has improved by 20% and over 1,400 jobs have been created. At the same time, electric rates are among the lowest in the country and Midwest, and are approximately 3% below 2012 levels. 
This performance-based framework has been a win-win for our customers and the state of Illinois. That is why we continue to strongly advocate for a performance-based regulatory framework in the Illinois legislature, which brings me to our discussion on the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies on Page 6. 
As I discussed in our conference call in February, an enhanced version of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed earlier this year, which, if passed, would apply to both the Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas distribution businesses. This legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy, battery storage and electric and gas infrastructure to continue to enhance safety and reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers in the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. This important piece of legislation would also require diverse supplier spend reporting for all electric renewable energy providers. 
Another key component of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act is that it will allow for performance-based ratemaking for Ameren Illinois natural gas and electric distribution businesses through 2032. The proposed performance metrics will ensure investments are aligned with and are contributing to the safety and reliability of the energy grid and natural gas systems as well as the state's vision for the transition to clean energy. 
Further, this legislation will modify the allowed return on equity methodology in each business to align with the average returns being earned by other gas and electric utilities across the nation. And as I noted a moment ago, this legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to invest in critical energy infrastructure into a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment, improved safety and reliability and created significant new jobs, all while keeping electric rates well below the Midwest and national averages. This bill would also move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050.
With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. To date, the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act has received strong bipartisan support from members of the Senate and House. Currently, House Bill 1734 has 49 sponsors, and Senate Bill 311 has 21 sponsors. 
As I'm sure you know, there are also several other energy-related bills being considered by the legislature. We will continue to be actively engaged with key stakeholders throughout the legislative session on these important energy policy matters. The spring session is currently set to end May 31. 
Turning to Page 7 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In April, FERC issued a supplemental notice of proposed rule-making on the electric transmission return on equity incentive adder for participation in a Regional Transmission Organization, or RTO. In the supplemental notice, the FERC proposes to limit the duration up to 50 basis point ROE incentive adder for companies that join an RTO to 3 years. 
FERC also proposes to eliminate the adder for utilities that have been part of an RTO for 3 years or more, which would include Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Without this incentive adder, Ameren Illinois and ATXI would have in the current allowed base ROE of 10.02%. 
For perspective, every 50 basis point change in our FERC ROE impacts annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04. Needless to say, we are disappointed with the direction the FERC has taken in the supplemental notice and strongly oppose the removal of the adder. 
From our perspective, RTO participation adder is needed to compensate companies, assuming risks associated with turning over operational control of assets to the RTO. The proposal is also inconsistent with the first stated policy goals and the intent of existing model to encourage RTO participation. 
We will continue to advocate for the RTO incentive adder and other project incentive adders proposed in the March 2020 NOPR. We will file comments on the supplemental NOPR by the May 26 deadline. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this matter as the FERC is under no time line to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 8. Both policy matters are important because transmission investment is going to play a critical role in our country's clean energy transition. As we have discussed before, MISO and other key stakeholders, including Ameren, have been carefully assessing the transmission needs in the MISO footprint to ensure the overall reliability and resiliency of the energy grid is maintained, while companies execute their clean energy transition plans. 
Recently, MISO published several reports that outline some of the preliminary thoughts on MISO's transmission needs in the future. This page summarizes a recent study that outlines a potential roadmap of transmission projects through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant levels of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy and/or carbon emission reductions, among other things. 
I would also note that MISO and the Southwest Power Pool are also working together to develop a similar evaluation of transmission needed to support the transition across both regions. The bottom line is that significant regional and local transmission investments will be needed for the clean energy transition over the next 10 to 20 years. 
For example, under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is a scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates future transmission investment can amount to an estimated $30 billion in the MISO footprint. 
Further, Future 3 resulted in an approximate 80% reduction in carbon emission levels below 2005 levels by 2039. MISO's estimated Future 3 could result in an estimated $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint. 
To provide some context to this, during MISO's last regional transmission planning process, approximately $6.5 billion of multivalue project investments were made over the last 10 years or so. In light of the continued focus on the clean energy transition in our country, we are actively working with MISO and other key stakeholders to move the assessment and project approval process along with an appropriate sense of urgency to ensure we maintain a safe, reliable and resilient energy grid and do so in an affordable fashion. 
Given our past success in executing large regional transmission projects, we believe we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. We believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 will be included in this year's MISO transmission planning process, which is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. We look forward to working with MISO and key stakeholders on this important planning process. 
Speaking of clean energy transitions, let's move now to Page 9 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment planned to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of its first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. In January, Ameren Missouri acquired its second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in Northwest Missouri. Approximately half the megawatts of the Atchison Renewable Energy Center are in service. We expect the remaining megawatts to be placed in service by September 30. 
Turning now to Page 10 and an update on Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. During its return to full power as part of its 24th refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Callaway experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted, and the decision was made to rewind the generator stator and rotor in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service. The project is going well, and we continue to expect the capital project to cost approximately $65 million. 
I'm also pleased to report that the insurance claims within the capital project and replacement power have been accepted by insurance carrier, which will mitigate the impacts of this outage for our customers. We expect the Callaway Energy Center to return to service in July. As we have said previously, we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results. 
Turning to Page 11. We are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future. I've discussed several elements of our strong sustainability value proposition with you in the past, and so in the interest of time,  I'll not go through all of these points again this morning. 
Having said that, and moving to Page 12, you should know that we have already made significant progress in our sustainability efforts in 2021. Here we highlight several key achievements to date this year. 
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes strong interim carbon emission reduction targets at 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively. This plan is also at the heart of our updated climate risk report, which is based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which we issued last week. I am pleased to report our plan is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
In terms of social impact, I am very excited to say that our efforts in this area continue to be recognized by leading organizations. Last week, DiversityInc announced Ameren is once again named #1 on the top utilities list for diversity and inclusion, a list we have been proudly a part of since 2009. DiversityInc also ranked Ameren second on the top 10 regional companies and as a top company for ESG among all industries. 
In addition, for the fifth year in a row, we've been certified by Great Place to Work. 
And finally, we were recognized as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ by the Human Rights Campaign. 
Moving to governance. Our Board and management have established covenant structures that enable a focus on the ESG matters that drive Ameren's strategy, mission and vision, including the addition of ESG metrics into our executive compensation programs. In particular, our Board of Directors refined our executive compensation program by adding workforce and supplier diversity metrics to our short-term incentive plan for 2021. 
In addition, we recently issued several social impact policies. Since our call in February, we have also issued several reports reflecting our sustainability efforts and advances. Just last week, we posted our 2021 Sustainability Report, which expands on many ESG and sustainability topics and posted a 2020 ESG Sustainability Template. 
And for the first time, we published information using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board reporting framework and mapped our business activities to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com. 
Turning now to Page 13. Environmental stewardship, social impact and governance are 3 pillars of our strong sustainability value proposition. Our final pillar is sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we have a strong, sustainable growth proposition, which will be driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. 
Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new regionally beneficial transmission projects that I described earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
In addition, we expect to see greater focus from a policy perspective and infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector. Our outlook through 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time either. Of course, our investment opportunities not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. 
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner, future in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 14. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In February, we issued our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. 
Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file this year with the Missouri PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of these planned renewable investments. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I will now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,711335441,2280589,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 11, 2021",2021-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 16 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to $0.59 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest",1653,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 16 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to $0.59 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, increased $0.22 per share due to several favorable factors. 
The earnings comparison reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, 2020, which increased earnings by $0.10 per share. In addition, earnings benefited from lower operations and maintenance expenses, which increased earnings $0.07 per share. 
This was primarily driven by the absence of unfavorable market returns that occurred in 2020 on the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance,as well as disciplined cost management. Earnings also benefited by approximately $0.04 per share from higher electric retail sales driven by near-normal winter temperatures compared to milder-than-normal winter temperatures in the year ago period. 
We have included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter that showed total sales to be comparable with Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by COVID-19. We continue to see improvements in sales as schools and businesses reopen and begin to increase their levels of operation. 
Earnings were positively impacted by the timing of income tax expense, which we do not expect to impact full year results, as well as the absence of charitable donations that were made pursuant to the Missouri rate review settlement in March 2020. 
And finally, these favorable factors were partially offset by the amortization of deferred expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. 
Moving to other segments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.08, reflecting higher delivery service rates that were effective January 25, 2021, incorporating a change in rate design, as well as the increased infrastructure investments and a lower allowed ROE. The first quarter 2021 benefit from the change in rate design is not expected to impact full year results. 
Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.03 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking of approximately 8.15% compared to 7.45% for the year ago quarter. 
Ameren Transmission earnings were comparable year-over-year, which reflected increased infrastructure investments that were offset by an unfavorable $0.03 impact of a March 2021 FERC order. This order related to an intervenor challenge regarding the historical recoveries of material and supplies inventories and rates will have no impact on the current formular rate calculation prospectively. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and other results were down $0.01 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to increased interest expense resulting from higher long-term debt outstanding, offset by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year results. 
Finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding. 
Before moving on, I'll touch on sales transfer in Illinois Electric Distribution in the quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased 1.5%, and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. Recall that changes on electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Turning to Page 17. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong start in 2021. And as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. 
Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. I'll note that our second quarter earnings comparison will be negatively impacted due to a seasonal rate design change effective for 2021 in Ameren Missouri as part of the March 2020 electric rate order. This order called for winter rates in May and summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020. The second quarter results were also being negatively impacted by the absence of the impact of the 2020 FERC order, approving the MISO allowed base ROE at Ameren Transmission. 
Together, these 2 items are expected to reduce second quarter earnings by approximately $0.25 year-over-year. I encourage you to take this into consideration as you develop your expectations for our second quarter earnings results. 
Turning now to Page 18. Here we outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate review that Warner mentioned earlier. This reflects many benefits, including major upgrades to the electric system reliability and resiliency for customers as well as investments to support the transition to a cleaner energy for the benefit of customers and local communities. 
Now let me take a moment to go through the details of this filing. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $10 billion. This includes the test year ended December 31, 2020, with certain pro forma adjustments through September 30, 2021. 
The request includes a continuation of the existing FAC and other regulatory mechanisms, along with our request to recover certain costs associated with the Meramec Energy Center, which is expected to retire in 2022, over a 5-year period from the date that the new rates become effective. 
As outlined on this page, the key drivers of our $299 million annual rate increase include: increased infrastructure investments made under Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy plan; impact of the transition to a cleaner generation portfolio; decreased weather-normalized customer sales volumes; and a higher pension OPEB and tax amortization expenses, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expenses. 
Moving to Page 19 for an update on other Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In March 2021, we also filed a natural gas rate review. The details for the $9 million annual revenue increase request are outlined on this page. We expect the Missouri PSC decision in both our electric and natural gas rate reviews by February 2022, with new rates expected to be effective by March. 
Further, last October, we filed a request with the Missouri PSC to track and defer on a regulatory asset certain COVID-related costs incurred, net of any COVID-related cost savings. In March 2021, the Missouri PSC approved this request. $9 million of net costs were incurred through March 31, 2021. We recognized $5 million in the first quarter of this year and expect the remaining portion relating to late fees to be recognized when realized in rates beginning in early 2022. The timing of recovery of these costs will be determined as part of our pending electric and gas rate reviews. 
Moving now to Page 20 for an update on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Last month, we made our required annual electric distribution performance-based rate update filing, requesting a $64 million base rate increase. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to make annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. Since this constructive framework began, Ameren Illinois has made prudent investments to strengthen the grid and reduce outages and continues to do so. 
Major investments, including the request of the installation of outage avoidance and detection technology, integration of storm hardening equipment, adoption of clean energy technologies and the implementation of new energy efficiency measures, including mobile-enhanced communications and assessment capabilities for electric field workers. The ICC will review our request in the months ahead, with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in January of next year. 
Turning to Page 21 for a financing and liquidity update. We continue to feel very good about our liquidity and financial position. In February, Ameren Corporation issued $450 million of 1.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2028. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including that will repay short-term of debt. We also expect both Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt in 2021. 
In addition, as we mentioned on the call in February, during the quarter, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sales agreement to generate approximately $115 million. 
In order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $150 million of additional common equity during the balance of 2021, which is consistent with the guidance we provided in February. 
To that end, in May, we expect to establish an at-the-market or ATM equity program to support equity needs through 2023. These future equity issues will enable us to maintain a consolidated capital structure consisting of approximately 45% equity over time. The incremental natural gas and power purchases incurred due to the extreme cold mid-February this year did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or our ability to fund our future operations and investment. 
Ameren's available liquidity as of April 30 was approximately $1.3 billion, which includes $2.3 billion of combined credit facility capacity, net of approximately $1 billion of commercial paper borrowings at the end of the month. 
Finally, turning to Page 22. We're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We're off to a solid start, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. 
Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

One, I do think clean energy legislation is a focus for the legislature. I think, just by the fact that you see so many bills that are being discussed out there, and rightfully so, right, the clean energy transition is obviously very important, not just for Illinois, but across the country. 
Certainly, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's no doubt that there are several bills that are being considered. Whether there's a grand bargain, if you will, or whether these bills are put together, look, it's just too early to say. 
The only thing I can say is this,is that we are at the table with key stakeholders trying to find a solution and to advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act because, as you heard me say many times, that act, those provisions, that performance-based ratemaking approach has really delivered significant benefits for our customers in the entire state of Illinois. 
So we have it until the end of the month to try and get something across the finish line. Richard Mark and his team have been working tirelessly at that. Now I will say their tireless work and the work that we've been doing for many years has already elicited strong bipartisan support, so we're hopeful to get the proper provisions and a final piece of legislation."

And what do you see separately as the potential for large-scale HVDC transmission opportunities outside or beyond the MISO process? 
And then finally, I guess, with transmission trying to scale the opportunity set here, was wondering if you could help us think through roughly how much CapEx did Ameren deploy over the years, where MISO brought renewable penetration from very little to the higher levels as it is today. Are there any rules -- any kind of measures we can think of like $10 billion to accommodate 10%? Just trying to scale the opportunity set here."
373264,711335441,2280589,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 11, 2021",2021-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Jeremy, a lot to unpack. Let me see if I'll try to respond to those things, and Michael and Andrew will help me if I haven't hit a point, but certainly come back on. Let me answer your first question -- your last question perhaps first. As I said in my",483,"Jeremy, a lot to unpack. Let me see if I'll try to respond to those things, and Michael and Andrew will help me if I haven't hit a point, but certainly come back on. 
Let me answer your first question -- your last question perhaps first. As I said in my prepared remarks, we -- there's about $6.5 billion of regional transmission projects that really were deployed across the MISO footprint over the last decade, if you will. We did about $2 billion of that. Now that doesn't mean that was a different time, different place. Obviously, we did 25%, 30% almost of those, and it's because of our location in the MISO footprint. And so that's just number one. 
Two, what you said at the outset, I agree with. It is a very exciting time to be in the transmission business and especially one in the MISO footprint. When you're sitting in the center of the country, right, what MISO does with its transmission is integral to the clean energy transition for our country. 
And so what you're seeing today is obviously a preliminary list of projects. They were informed certainly by stakeholder conversations as well as integrated resource plans and state energy policies, among many other things. It's hard to say just exactly what will ultimately come out of, let's just call, the transmission plan that will be filed later this year. 
But the way we look at it, we look at that Future 1, which we showed on that slide, we think that there are a lot of projects contained in that, that we think are really kind of no regrets types of projects. It's premature to put a number on it and which projects to go because what MISO does now is now they put out this roadmap, they are basically looking for input from stakeholders. 
And so you can expect throughout 2021, stakeholders will be providing input into that roadmap. And with that input, MISO will ultimately prepare their long-range plan, their MTEP is what they call it, and we expect that to be filed in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, a process from there, Jeremy, has been there some more input. But ultimately, the MTEP is put before the MISO Board of Directors for vote and hopefully approval by the end of the year. 
So it's not too far away, but that Future 1 is, I would say, the first step. But then as you look beyond that, as we said in Future 3, obviously, those investments continue to grow over time. And as we said, they range from $30 billion to $100 billion. Those are MISO's preliminary estimates that will continue to be refined. 
So hopefully, that gives you some of the sense. I'm not sure if I missed -- if I addressed all of your questions in there, but I think I got them all there."

Number one, they're very focused on providing significant funding for new clean energy technologies, which we think is going to be so important for our industry, for our country to get to a net 0 carbon future by 2050, which is certainly our goal. 
Maybe the other thing that you're seeing is Senator Wyden put out a bill that really has some -- I think some very good incentives to invest in clean energy technologies. And those incentives range from tax credits. They range from tax normalization policies to give opt-out provisions. They include tax credits also for transmission. And so we look at the provisions they have done, I won't go through all the details here. That bill will really have a direct impact on the overall cost to our customers. And so we're obviously very encouraged and enthused about that. 
So a lot going on in Washington, D.C. We are at the table working with stakeholders, and we are hopeful that we'll continue to see progress and incentives for clean energy technologies here in the next several months."

So to be clear, I'll say this first, we are very focused on trying to get something across the finish line for the benefit of our customers in the state of Illinois and energy policy here by May 31. 
But your question is what if it doesn't happen in the next several weeks. Well, then, it could be brought up in the veto session, and our approach would be very much what we've been doing. We will continue to strongly advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy affordability Act. And the reason why we'll continue to strongly advocate for it is because it has strong bipartisan support. 
We have House bills and Senate bills with strong bipartisan support as well as support from North and the South part of the state. And so we're going to continue to push for that because we strongly believe it's the best policy going forward for the state of Illinois. It isn't just because we believe it. It's because it's been delivering results for almost a decade now. And that's what we're going to continue to advocate for. 
So I do think, people say whether it's a priority, I will tell you there are a lot of conversations going on in the state of Illinois around energy policy, so I know they have other priorities that they have to balance. But I do believe energy policy is one of them."

Securitization isn't something that we see as required to be able to carry out our integrated resource plan, but we do think it would be a good tool to have in the toolbox of the commission, especially as crafted in Missouri. So you're right, there have been versions going through the House and the Senate. They're very, very similar at this point. 
Last night, actually, the Senate passed the House securitization bill, which is HB 734, and they did make some slight modifications to that. So now that goes back to the House to the Fiscal Review Committee. And we'll see whether that can be then voted on in the House. We may see actually some action as early as today. 
But in any event, what has to happen over the remainder of the week is that the language needs to get conformed between the 2, the Senate Bill and the House Bill. Like I said, they're very, very similar at this point, and ultimately needs to be passed by the end of the week. As Warner indicated, the legislative session ends on May 14, this Friday afternoon.

It is really premature to really say exactly which of those projects will ultimately show up in the MTEP. I think MISO did a fine job of putting together this long-range plan, which gives us collectively an opportunity to weigh in on it and to try and keep really our finger on the pulse of all the things that are going on around the country, not just in the states, but around the country. 
So it just is too premature. But I will say this, that we as well as MISO and other stakeholders, there's a sense of urgency to address these matters because we see the clean energy transition coming, and we know that transmission is critical to its success. And so consequently, there is a significant amount of interest, a significant amount of work being done. 
And so we're not too far away from really hearing what that's going to be. The fourth quarter is, really, for all practical purposes, right around the corner. And as you know, some of these projects, as you said, they take time to plan, get approval and ultimately execute. 
So again, as we see -- and I've said this in the past, it's really just -- the study really is consistent with what we've been talking about really for the last several years. We see significant transmission opportunities. And should they come in the form of this MTEP or otherwise, we think they're probably, if there are any, would come towards the back end of our 5-year current capital expenditure plan. 
But especially in the second half of this decade, you see some of these transmission projects really come to fruition. And as I said before, we're well positioned. We're well positioned to execute on many of those projects. So we're looking forward to it."

And so we laid out our Integrated Resource Plan, and you see that, systematically, we are retiring our coal-fired energy centers over time. And it's because, number one, we think it's in the best interest of our customers from a reliability and affordability perspective. 
And so as Marty said, we don't see that changing, but conditions could change, right, whether it's at a state level or federal level. And so securitization is not going to drive us to do anything different, other than, absent changes that may happen, as I said, from a policy perspective or otherwise. But it is a good tool to have in our toolbox should those changes occur. 
So we -- our coal plants are valuable assets to us today. Over time, we will retire them, but we don't see any near-term changes to how we plan on operating or certainly risks to those assets.

We've got very efficient coal plants. They operate very well. 
But with that said, in our Integrated Resource Plan, we did lay out that we're retiring our Meramec facility here in 2022. We expect that, that will be fully recovered at that point in time. We did propose the accelerated closure of both the Sioux and the Rush Island plants, Sioux by about 5 years and Rush Island by about 6 years. So Sioux would close in 2028, Rush Island in 2039. And then Labadie which is our largest plant and most efficient plant, would close in 2 stages in 2036 and 2042. 
So again, we've accelerated the expected closure of 2 of our plants, and those accelerations and the recovery of those are actually reflected in the rate review filing that we made here in March. So we're looking to accelerate the recovery of those plants. And then, of course, the rates are also positively impacted by the expectation of Meramec closing. 
So those things are reflected there. That's historically the way we've handled things in Missouri. And again, as Warner said, when we filed the IRP, we made a host of assumptions. Conditions can change and vary from the assumptions that we made through time for a variety of reasons. And as I said before, securitization is not going to change the Integrated Resource Plan, preferred plan that we have today.

So as you know, we present investment opportunities",360,"You bet, you bet. Well, I think there are a couple of them. One, we've -- filed more than a couple. Frankly, there are several. One we've talked quite a bit about already today, and that's transmission. So as you know, we present investment opportunities through 2030 of $40 billion plus of investment opportunities. And one of the reasons we put that plus there is because transmission. 
So that $40 billion number that we have of investment opportunity does not include any of the regional transmission projects that we spent quite a bit of time talking about already. So Stephen, that would be certainly one meaningful upside to our investment profile that we have prospectively. 
A second one and another one that we talked about, and again I mentioned this a little bit earlier, is electrification and the infrastructure that has to go for the greater electrification, especially the transportation sector in our country. Our long-term plan has really no meaningful investments associated with the electrification of the transportation sector. And as you listen to the policymakers discuss the need for a cleaner energy transition in this country and lower carbon emissions, well, the transportation sector is the greatest carbon emitter in our country today. 
And so you've heard certainly the automakers and others continuing to lean further in. Well, we're going to lean further into, and we have been. So I think that, too, is a significant opportunity. 
But I'll tell you, just to be clear, what I've done with all of our investments in grid modernization, we need to continue to make investments in the grid, both in Missouri and Illinois, to make sure that the grid continues to be reliable and resilient. 
So as we look at those investment opportunities, which could also then include renewal -- greater levels of renewable energy over time, we have quite a bit in there. But times, as we've said, could change if policies change. Those, too, could be investment opportunities. 
I didn't put a specific number on those, but they're sizable. They're sizable, and so we see our robust infrastructure plan that we have already today continuing for some time."

What I will say is that, certainly, the clean energy transition and the importance of policies to support that clean energy transition are important issues for we, certainly as transmission owners, but also for FERC. And I think Chairman Glick and the commissioners, they recognize that. I think you're going to continue to see greater levels of attention and focus at FERC on things that they can do to accelerate safe, reliable and affordable transmission build around the country."

I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy. 
Before I begin my discussion of our first quarter results and related business matters, I want to begin with a few comments on COVID-19. It is hard to believe that we have now been addressing the challenges associated with this pandemic for over a year now. 
Needless to say, much has changed. However, one thing that has not changed is our relentless focus on delivering safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable electric and natural gas service for the millions of people in Missouri and Illinois that are depending on us. 
As I said during our year-end conference call in February, despite the significant challenges presented by COVID-19, I look to the future with optimism. In part, this was due to the aggressive distribution of vaccines throughout our country. I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see the fruits of the incredible efforts by so many in the health care, government, public and private sectors. 
COVID-19 cases are down significantly from earlier in the year, the restrictions have lessened. As a result, we are clearly seeing signs that the economy is improving in our service territory and across the country. 
My optimism was also driven by how our coworkers have consistently stepped up and addressed a multitude of challenges and capitalized on opportunities and the strong execution of our strategy that is delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders. Together, these factors contributed to our ability to get off to a strong start in 2021, which brings me to a discussion of our first quarter results Starting on Page 4. 
Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to earnings of $0.59 per share in the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase of $0.32 per share reflected increased infrastructure investments across all of our business segments that will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers. The key drivers of first quarter results are outlined on this slide. 
I'm also pleased to report that we continue to effectively execute our strategic plan and remain on track to deliver within our 2021 earnings guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share. Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2021 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later. 
Moving to Page 5. Here we reiterate our strategic plan. First pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers. As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, including our investment in wind generation. 
Regarding regulatory matters, in late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenue with the Missouri Public Service Commission. In addition, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $9 million increase in annual natural gas revenue with the PSC. While Michael will discuss the details of the requests in a moment, I'd like to briefly touch on some of the key benefits our electric and natural gas customers in Missouri are seeing as a result of the investments reflected in these rate requests. 
We are now in the third year of Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan, which is focused on strengthening the grid through infrastructure upgrades, adding more renewable generation and creating programs to stimulate economic growth for communities across the state. Our grid monetization investments incorporate smart technology, including outage detection and restoration switches as well as smart readers, which allow customers to take advantage of new rate options. 
These investments are delivering results to improve reliability and resiliency. For example, on circuits with new smart technology upgrades, we have seen up to a 40% improvement in reliability. Of course, we also remain committed to a clean energy transition for our customers and state. This is demonstrated through our recent acquisitions of 2 wind generation facilities located in Northern Missouri totaling 700 megawatts. 
In addition, our investments are stimulating economic growth for communities across the state. I'm pleased to say that 57% of Ameren Missouri suppliers in 2020 are Missouri-based, and 32% of its sourceable capital spend was with diverse suppliers. And we're doing all of these things while keeping our customers' electric rates approximately 20% below the average in other Midwest states and across the country. 
At the same time, we remain very disciplined in managing our costs. As a result, if approved, the new electric rate request will represent a 5.4% total increase over an almost 5-year period, a yearly average of approximately 1%. We will remain disciplined in managing our costs, while we build a stronger, smarter and cleaner energy system for our customers now and in the future. 
Moving now to Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In January, we received a constructive rate order from the ICC that resulted in a $76 million annual increase in gas distribution rates. New rates went into effect in late January. 
In our Illinois electric business, we made our required annual electric distribution link filing, requesting a $64 million base rate increase. This filing is only the second requested increase in delivery service rates in 6 years. While Michael will touch on the details of our filing a bit later, I think it is important to note that for years, our Illinois customers have realized the benefits by our significant investments in energy infrastructure. 
Since performance-based ratemaking began in 2012, reliability has improved by 20% and over 1,400 jobs have been created. At the same time, electric rates are among the lowest in the country and Midwest and are approximately 3% below 2012 levels. 
This performance-based framework has been a win-win for our customers and the state of Illinois. That is why we continue to strongly advocate for a performance-based regulatory framework in the Illinois legislature, which brings me to our discussion on the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies on Page 6. 
As I discussed in our conference call in February, an enhanced version of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed earlier this year, which, if passed, would apply to both the Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas distribution businesses. This legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy, battery storage and electric and gas infrastructure to continue to enhance safety and reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers and the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. This important piece of legislation would also require diverse supplier spend reporting for all-electric renewable energy providers. 
Another key component of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act is that it will allow for performance-based ratemaking for Ameren Illinois natural gas and electric distribution businesses through 2032. The proposed performance metrics will ensure investments are aligned with and are contributing to the safety and reliability of the energy grid and natural gas systems as well as the state's vision for the transition to clean energy. 
Further, this legislation will modify the allowed return on equity methodology in each business to align with the average returns being earned by other gas and electric utilities across the nation. And as I noted a moment ago, this legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to invest in critical energy infrastructure into a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment, improved safety and reliability and created significant new jobs, all while keeping electric rates well below the Midwest and national averages. This bill would also move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050.
With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. To date, the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act has received strong bipartisan support from members of the Senate and House. Currently, House Bill 1734 has 49 sponsors, and Senate Bill 311 has 21 sponsors. 
As I'm sure you know, there are also several other energy-related bills being considered by the legislature. We will continue to be actively engaged with key stakeholders throughout the legislative session on these important energy policy matters. The spring session is currently set to end May 31. 
Turning to Page 7 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In April, FERC issued a supplemental notice of proposed rule-making on the electric transmission return on equity incentive adder for participation in a Regional Transmission Organization, or RTO. In the supplemental notice, the FERC proposes to limit the duration up to 50 basis point ROE incentive adder for companies that join an RTO to 3 years. 
FERC also proposes to eliminate the adder for utilities that have been part of an RTO for 3 years or more, which would include Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Without this incentive adder, Ameren Illinois and ATXI would have earned the current allowed base ROE of 10.02%. 
For perspective, every 50 basis point change in our FERC ROE impacts annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04. Needless to say, we are disappointed with the direction the FERC has taken in the supplemental notice and strongly oppose the removal of the adder. 
From our perspective, the RTO participation adder is needed to compensate companies who are assuming risks associated with turning over operational control of assets to the RTO. The proposal is also inconsistent with the first stated policy goals and the intent of existing model to encourage RTO participation. 
We will continue to advocate for the RTO incentive adder and other project incentive adders proposed in the March 2020 NOPR. We will file comments on the supplemental NOPR by the May 26 deadline. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this matter as the FERC is under no time line to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 8. FERC policy matters are important because transmission investment is going to play a critical role in our country's clean energy transition. As we have discussed before, MISO and other key stakeholders, including Ameren, have been carefully assessing the transmission needs in the MISO footprint to ensure the overall reliability and resiliency of the energy grid is maintained, while companies execute their clean energy transition plans. 
Recently, MISO published several reports that outline some of the preliminary thoughts on MISO's transmission needs in the future. This page summarizes a recent study that outlines a potential roadmap of transmission projects through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant levels of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy and/or carbon emission reductions, among other things. 
I would also note that MISO and the Southwest Power Pool are also working together to develop a similar evaluation of transmission needed to support the transition across both regions. The bottom line is that significant regional and local transmission investments will be needed for the clean energy transition over the next 10 to 20 years. 
For example, under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is a scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates future transmission investment can amount to an estimated $30 billion in the MISO footprint. 
Further, Future 3 resulted in an approximate 80% reduction in carbon emission levels below 2005 levels by 2039. MISO's estimated Future 3 could result in an estimated $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint. 
To provide some context to this, during MISO's last regional transmission planning process, approximately $6.5 billion of multivalue project investments were made over the last 10 years or so. In light of the continued focus on the clean energy transition in our country, we are actively working with MISO and other key stakeholders to move the assessment and project approval process along with an appropriate sense of urgency to ensure we maintain a safe, reliable and resilient energy grid and do so in an affordable fashion. 
Given our past success in executing large regional transmission projects, we believe we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. We believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 will be included in this year's MISO transmission planning process, which is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. We look forward to working with MISO and key stakeholders on this important plan process. 
Speaking of clean energy transitions, let's move now to Page 9 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment planned to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of its first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. In January, Ameren Missouri acquired its second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in Northwest Missouri. Approximately half the megawatts of the Atchison Renewable Energy Center are in service. We expect the remaining megawatts to be placed in service by September 30. 
Turning now to Page 10 and an update on Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. During its return to full power as part of its 24th refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Callaway experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted, and the decision was made to rewind the generator stator and rotor in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service. The project is going well, and we continue to expect the capital project to cost approximately $65 million. 
I'm also pleased to report that the insurance claims within the capital project and replacement power have been accepted by insurance carrier, which will mitigate the impacts of this outage for our customers. We expect the Callaway Energy Center to return to service in July. As we have said previously, we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results. 
Turning to Page 11. We are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future. I've discussed several elements of our strong sustainability value proposition with you in the past, so in the interest of time,  I'll not go through all of these points again this morning. 
Having said that, and moving to Page 12, you should know that we have already made significant progress in our sustainability efforts in 2021. Here we highlight several key achievements to date this year. 
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes strong interim carbon emission reduction targets at 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively. This plan is also at the heart of our updated climate risk report, which is based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which we issued last week. I am pleased to report our plan is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
In terms of social impact, I am very excited to say that our efforts in this area continue to be recognized by leading organizations. Last week, DiversityInc announced Ameren is once again named #1 on the top utilities list for diversity and inclusion, a list we have been proudly a part of since 2009. DiversityInc also ranked Ameren second on the top 10 regional companies and as a top company for ESG among all industries. 
In addition, for the fifth year in a row, we've been certified by Great Place to Work. 
And finally, we were recognized as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ by the Human Rights Campaign. 
Moving to governance. Our Board and management have established covenant structures that enable a focus on the ESG matters that drive Ameren's strategy, mission and vision, including the addition of ESG metrics into our executive compensation programs. In particular, our Board of Directors refined our executive compensation program by adding workforce and supplier diversity metrics to our short-term incentive plan for 2021. 
In addition, we recently issued several social impact policies. Since our call in February, we have also issued several reports reflecting our sustainability efforts and advances. Just last week, we posted our 2021 Sustainability Report, which expands on many ESG and sustainability topics and posted a 2020 ESG Sustainability Template. 
And for the first time, we published information using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board reporting framework and mapped our business activities to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com. 
Turning now to Page 13. Environmental stewardship, social impact and governance are 3 pillars of our strong sustainability value proposition. Our final pillar is sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we have a strong, sustainable growth proposition, which will be driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. 
Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new regionally beneficial transmission projects that I described earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
In addition, we expect to see greater focus from a policy perspective on infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector. Our outlook through 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time either. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they would also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. 
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 14. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In February, we issued our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. 
Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file this year with the Missouri PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of these planned renewable investments. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I will now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,711335441,2345381,"Ameren Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 11, 2021",2021-05-11,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 16 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to $0.59 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest",1652,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 16 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to $0.59 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, increased $0.22 per share due to several favorable factors. 
The earnings comparison reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, 2020, which increased earnings by $0.10 per share. In addition, earnings benefited from lower operations and maintenance expenses, which increased earnings $0.07 per share. 
This was primarily driven by the absence of unfavorable market returns that occurred in 2020 on the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance,as well as disciplined cost management. Earnings also benefited by approximately $0.04 per share from higher electric retail sales driven by near-normal winter temperatures compared to milder-than-normal winter temperatures in the year ago period. 
We have included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter that show total sales to be comparable with Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by COVID-19. We continue to see improvements in sales as schools and businesses reopen and begin to increase their levels of operation. 
Earnings were positively impacted by the timing of income tax expense, which we do not expect to impact full year results, as well as the absence of charitable donations that were made pursuant to the Missouri rate review settlement in March 2020. 
And finally, these favorable factors were partially offset by the amortization of deferred expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. 
Moving to other segments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.08, reflecting higher delivery service rates that were effective January 25, 2021, incorporating a change in rate design, as well as the increased infrastructure investments and a lower allowed ROE. The first quarter 2021 benefit from the change in rate design is not expected to impact full year results. 
Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.03 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking of approximately 8.15% compared to 7.45% for the year ago quarter. 
Ameren Transmission earnings were comparable year-over-year, which reflected increased infrastructure investments that were offset by an unfavorable $0.03 impact of a March 2021 FERC order. This order related to an intervenor challenge regarding the historical recoveries of material and supplies inventories and rates and will have no impact on the current formula rate calculation prospectively. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and other results were down $0.01 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to increased interest expense resulting from higher long-term debt outstanding, offset by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year results. 
Finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding. 
Before moving on, I'll touch on sales transfer in Illinois Electric Distribution in the quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased 1.5%, and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. Recall that changes on electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Turning to Page 17. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong start in 2021. And as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. 
Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. I'll note that our second quarter earnings comparison will be negatively impacted due to a seasonal rate design change effective for 2021 in Ameren Missouri as part of the March 2020 electric rate order. This order called for winter rates in May and summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020. The second quarter results were also being negatively impacted by the absence of the impact of the 2020 FERC order, approving the MISO allowed base ROE at Ameren Transmission. 
Together, these 2 items are expected to reduce second quarter earnings by approximately $0.25 year-over-year. I encourage you to take this into consideration as you develop your expectations for our second quarter earnings results. 
Turning now to Page 18. Here we outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate review that Warner mentioned earlier. This reflects many benefits, including major upgrades to the electric system reliability and resiliency for customers as well as investments to support the transition to a cleaner energy for the benefit of customers and local communities. 
Now let me take a moment to go through the details of this filing. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $10 billion. This includes the test year ended December 31, 2020, with certain pro forma adjustments through September 30, 2021. 
The request includes a continuation of the existing FAC and other regulatory mechanisms, along with a request to recover certain costs associated with the Meramec Energy Center, which is expected to retire in 2022, over a 5-year period from the date that the new rates become effective. 
As outlined on this page, the key drivers of our $299 million annual rate increase include: increased infrastructure investments made under Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy plan; impact of the transition to a cleaner generation portfolio; decreased weather-normalized customer sales volumes; and a higher pension OPEB and tax amortization expenses, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expenses. 
Moving to Page 19 for an update on other Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In March 2021, we also filed a natural gas rate review. The details for the $9 million annual revenue increase request are outlined on this page. We expect the Missouri PSC decision in both our electric and natural gas rate reviews by February 2022, with new rates expected to be effective by March. 
Further, last October, we filed a request with the Missouri PSC to track and defer on a regulatory asset certain COVID-related costs incurred, net of any COVID-related cost savings. In March 2021, the Missouri PSC approved this request. $9 million of net costs were incurred through March 31, 2021. We recognized $5 million in the first quarter of this year and expect the remaining portion relating to late fees to be recognized when realized in rates beginning in early 2022. The timing of recovery of these costs will be determined as part of our pending electric and gas rate reviews. 
Moving now to Page 20 for an update on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Last month, we made our required annual electric distribution performance-based rate update filing, requesting a $64 million base rate increase. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to make annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over- or under-recovery of such costs. Since this constructive framework began, Ameren Illinois has made prudent investments to strengthen the grid and reduce outages and continues to do so. 
Major investments, including the request of the installation of outage avoidance and detection technology, integration of storm hardening equipment, adoption of clean energy technologies and the implementation of new energy efficiency measures, including mobile-enhanced communications and assessment capabilities for electric field workers. The ICC will review our request in the months ahead, with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in January of next year. 
Turning to Page 21 for a financing and liquidity update. We continue to feel very good about our liquidity and financial position. In February, Ameren Corporation issued $450 million of 1.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2028. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including that will repay short-term debt. We also expect both Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt in 2021. 
In addition, as we mentioned on the call in February, during the quarter, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sales agreement to generate approximately $115 million. 
In order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $150 million of additional common equity during the balance of 2021, which is consistent with the guidance we provided in February. 
To that end, in May, we expect to establish an at-the-market or ATM equity program to support equity needs through 2023. These future equity [ issuance ] will enable us to maintain a consolidated capital structure consisting of approximately 45% equity over time. The incremental natural gas and power purchases incurred due to the extreme cold mid-February this year did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or our ability to fund our future operations and investment. 
Ameren's available liquidity as of April 30 was approximately $1.3 billion, which includes $2.3 billion of combined credit facility capacity, net of approximately $1 billion of commercial paper borrowings at the end of the month. 
Finally, turning to Page 22. We're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We're off to a solid start, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. 
Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

One, I do think clean energy legislation is a focus for the legislature. I think, just by the fact that you see so many bills that are being discussed out there, and rightfully so, right, the clean energy transition is obviously very important, not just for Illinois, but across the country. 
Certainly, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's no doubt that there are several bills that are being considered. Whether there's a grand bargain, if you will, or whether these bills are put together, look, it's just too early to say. 
The only thing I can say is this, is that we are at the table with key stakeholders trying to find a solution and to advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act because, as you heard me say many times, that act, those provisions, that performance-based ratemaking approach has really delivered significant benefits for our customers in the entire state of Illinois. 
So we have it until the end of the month to try and get something across the finish line. Richard Mark and his team have been working tirelessly at that. And I will say their tireless work and the work that we've been doing for many years has already elicited strong bipartisan support, so we're hopeful to get the proper provisions and a final piece of legislation."

Maybe pivoting over to transmission, it seems like an exciting time for transmission, if you will. And do you have any sense of the magnitude of specific projects that could be identified by MISO before year-end or in the not-too-distant future? And what do you see separately as the potential for large-scale HVDC transmission opportunities outside or beyond the MISO process? 
And then finally, I guess, with transmission trying to scale the opportunity set here, was wondering if you could help us think through roughly how much CapEx did Ameren deploy over the years, where MISO brought renewable penetration from very little to the high levels that it is today. Are there any rules -- any kind of measures we can think of like $10 billion to accommodate 10%? Just trying to scale the opportunity set here."

Let me see if -- I'll try to respond to those things, and Michael and Andrew will help me if I haven't hit a point, but certainly come back on. Let me answer your first question -- your last question perhaps first. As I said in",485,"Jeremy, a lot to unpack. Let me see if -- I'll try to respond to those things, and Michael and Andrew will help me if I haven't hit a point, but certainly come back on. 
Let me answer your first question -- your last question perhaps first. As I said in my prepared remarks, we -- there's about $6.5 billion of regional transmission projects that really were deployed across the MISO footprint over the last decade, if you will. We did about $2 billion of that. Now that doesn't mean -- that was a different time, different place. Obviously, we did 25%, 30% almost of those, and it's because of our location in the MISO footprint. And so that's just number one. 
Two, what you said at the outset, I agree with. It is a very exciting time to be in the transmission business and especially one in the MISO footprint. When you're sitting in the center of the country, right, what MISO does with its transmission is integral to the clean energy transition for our country. 
And so what you're seeing today is obviously a preliminary list of projects. They were informed certainly by stakeholder conversations as well as integrated resource plans and state energy policies, among many other things. It's hard to say just exactly what will ultimately come out of, let's just call, the transmission plan that will be filed later this year. 
But the way we look at it, we look at that Future 1, which we showed on that slide, we think that there are a lot of projects contained in that, that we think are really kind of no regrets types of projects. It's premature to put a number on it and which projects should go because what MISO does now is, now they put out this roadmap, they are basically looking for input from stakeholders. 
And so you can expect throughout 2021, stakeholders will be providing input into that roadmap. And with that input, MISO will ultimately prepare their long-range plan, their MTEP is what they call it, and we expect that to be filed in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, a process from there, Jeremy, is then there's some more input. But ultimately, the MTEP is put before the MISO Board of Directors for vote and hopefully approval by the end of the year. 
So it's not too far away, but that Future 1 is, I would say, the first step. But then as you look beyond that, as we said in Future 3, obviously, those investments continue to grow over time. And as we said, they range from $30 billion to $100 billion. Those are MISO's preliminary estimates that will continue to be refined. 
So hopefully, that gives you some of the sense. I'm not sure if I missed -- if that addressed all of your questions in there, but I think I got them all there."

Maybe the other thing that you're seeing is Senator Wyden put out a bill that really has some -- I think some very good incentives to invest in clean energy technologies. And those incentives range from tax credits. They range from tax normalization policies that give opt-out provisions. They include tax credits also for transmission. And so we look at the provisions they have done, I won't go through all the details here. That bill will really have a direct impact on the overall cost to our customers.

So to be clear, I'll say this first, we are very focused on trying to get something across the finish line for the benefit of our customers in the state of Illinois an energy policy here by May 31. 
But your question is what if it doesn't happen in the next several weeks. Well, then, it could be brought up in the veto session, and our approach would be very much what we've been doing. We will continue to strongly advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy affordability Act. And the reason why we'll continue to strongly advocate for it is because it has strong bipartisan support. 
We have House bills and Senate bills with strong bipartisan support as well as supporters from the North and the South part of the state. And so we're going to continue to push for that because we strongly believe it's the best policy going forward for the state of Illinois. It isn't just because we believe it. It's because it's been delivering results for almost a decade now. And that's what we're going to continue to advocate for. 
So I do think, people say whether it's a priority, I will tell you there are a lot of conversations going on in the state of Illinois around energy policy, so I know they have other priorities that they have to balance. But I do believe energy policy is one of them."

Yes, you're absolutely right. Securitization isn't something that we see as required to be able to carry out our integrated resource plan, but we do think it would be a good tool to have in the toolbox of the commission, especially as crafted in Missouri. So you're right, there have been versions going through the House and the Senate. They're very, very similar at this point. 
Last night, actually, the Senate passed the House securitization bill, which is HB 734, and they did make some slight modifications to that. So now that goes back to the House to the Fiscal Review Committee. And we'll see whether that can be then voted on in the House. We may see actually some action as early as today. 
But in any event, what has to happen over the remainder of the week is that the language needs to get conformed between the 2, the Senate Bill and the House Bill. Like I said, they're very, very similar at this point, and ultimately, it needs to be passed by the end of the week. As Warner indicated, the legislative session ends on May 14, this Friday afternoon. 
So in any event, we're very close. I can't predict whether it will actually get done, but it's really positioned pretty well for success. So we'll keep our fingers crossed for the remainder of this week."

It is really premature to really say exactly which of those projects will ultimately show up in the MTEP. I think MISO did a fine job of putting together this long-range plan, which gives us collectively an opportunity to weigh in on it and to try and keep really our finger on the pulse of all the things that are going on around the country, not just in the states, but around the country. 
So it just is too premature. But I will say this, that we as well as MISO and other stakeholders, there's a sense of urgency to address these matters because we see the clean energy transition coming, and we know that transmission is critical to its success. And so consequently, there is a significant amount of interest, a significant amount of work being done. 
And so we're not too far away from really hearing what that's going to be. The fourth quarter is, really, for all practical purposes, right around the corner. And as you know, some of these projects, as you said, they take time to plan, get approval and ultimately execute. 
So again, as we see -- and I've said this in the past, it's really just -- the study really is consistent with what we've been talking about really for the last several years. We see significant transmission opportunities. And should they come in the form of this MTEP or otherwise, we think they're probably, if there are any, would come towards the back end of our 5-year current capital expenditure plan. 
But especially in the second half of this decade, you see some of these transmission projects really come to fruition. And as I said before, we're well positioned. We're well positioned to execute on many of those projects. So we're looking forward to it."

We have a strong baseload coal fleet that runs -- it runs a lot. And it's because of some of the actions and things we've done really over the past several years, decades, frankly. 
And so we laid out our Integrated Resource Plan, and you see that, systematically, we are retiring our coal-fired energy centers over time. And it's because, number one, we think it's in the best interest of our customers from a reliability and affordability perspective. 
And so as Marty said, we don't see that changing, but conditions could change, right, whether it's at a state level or federal level. And so securitization is not going to drive us to do anything different, other than, absent changes that may happen, as I said, from a policy perspective or otherwise. But it is a good tool to have in our toolbox should those changes occur. 
So we -- our coal plants are valuable assets to us today. Over time, we will retire them, but we don't see any near-term changes to how we plan on operating or certainly risks to those assets.

We've got very efficient coal plants. They operate very well. 
But with that said, in our Integrated Resource Plan, we did lay out that we're retiring our Meramec facility here in 2022. We expect that, that will be fully recovered at that point in time. We did propose the accelerated closure of both the Sioux and the Rush Island plants, Sioux by about 5 years and Rush Island by about 6 years. So Sioux would close in 2028, Rush Island in 2039. And then Labadie, which is our largest plant and most efficient plant, would close in 2 stages in 2036 and 2042. 
So again, we've accelerated the expected closure of 2 of our plants, and those accelerations and the recovery of those are actually reflected in the rate review filing that we made here in March. So we're looking to accelerate the recovery of those plants. And then, of course, the rates are also positively impacted by the expectation of Meramec closing. 
So those things are reflected there. That's historically the way we've handled things in Missouri. And again, as Warner said, when we filed the IRP, we made a host of assumptions. Conditions can change and vary from the assumptions that we made through time for a variety of reasons. And as I said before, securitization is not going to change the Integrated Resource Plan, preferred plan that we have today. But if conditions change versus the assumptions we've made through time, again, securitization will be a good tool to have in the toolbox."

One we've talked quite a bit about already today, and that's transmission. So as you know, we present investment opportunities through 2030 of $40 billion plus of investment opportunities. And one of the reasons we put that plus there is because transmission. 
So that $40 billion number that we have of investment opportunity does not include any of the regional transmission projects that we spent quite a bit of time talking about already. So Stephen, that would be certainly one meaningful upside to our investment profile that we have prospectively. 
A second one and another one that we talked about, and again I mentioned this a little bit earlier, is electrification and the infrastructure that has to go for the greater electrification, especially the transportation sector in our country. Our long-term plan has really no meaningful investments associated with the electrification of the transportation sector. And as you listen to the policymakers discuss the need for a cleaner energy transition in this country and lower carbon emissions, well, the transportation sector is the greatest carbon emitter in our country today. 
And so you've heard certainly the automakers and others continuing to lean further in. Well, we're going to lean further into, and we have been. So I think that, too, is a significant opportunity. 
But I'll tell you, just to be clear, what I've done with all of our investments in grid modernization, we need to continue to make investments in the grid, both in Missouri and Illinois, to make sure that the grid continues to be reliable and resilient. 
So as we look at those investment opportunities, which could also then include renewal -- greater levels of renewable energy over time, we have quite a bit in there. But times, as we've said, could change if policies change. Those, too, could be investment opportunities. 
I didn't put a specific number on those, but they're sizable. They're sizable, and so we see our robust infrastructure plan that we have already today continuing for some time."

So I think that's in the first instance. We're not trying to be any more specific than that. And we are going to work very hard here between now and the end of the month and put together our comments, like others in the industry, to state our position very clearly to FERC."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy. Before I begin my discussion of our first quarter results and related business matters, I want to begin with a few comme",3373,"Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and healthy. 
Before I begin my discussion of our first quarter results and related business matters, I want to begin with a few comments on COVID-19. It is hard to believe that we have now been addressing the challenges associated with this pandemic for over a year now. 
Needless to say, much has changed. However, one thing that has not changed is our relentless focus on delivering safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable electric and natural gas service for the millions of people in Missouri and Illinois that are depending on us. 
As I said during our year-end conference call in February, despite the significant challenges presented by COVID-19, I look to the future with optimism. In part, this was due to the aggressive distribution of vaccines throughout our country. I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see the fruits of the incredible efforts by so many in the health care, government, public and private sectors. 
COVID-19 cases are down significantly from earlier in the year, the restrictions have lessened. As a result, we are clearly seeing signs that the economy is improving in our service territory and across the country. 
My optimism was also driven by how our coworkers have consistently stepped up and addressed a multitude of challenges and capitalized on opportunities and the strong execution of our strategy that is delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders. Together, these factors contributed to our ability to get off to a strong start in 2021, which brings me to a discussion of our first quarter results Starting on Page 4. 
Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to earnings of $0.59 per share in the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase of $0.32 per share reflected increased infrastructure investments across all of our business segments that will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers. The key drivers of first quarter results are outlined on this slide. 
I'm also pleased to report that we continue to effectively execute our strategic plan and remain on track to deliver within our 2021 earnings guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share. Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2021 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later. 
Moving to Page 5. Here we reiterate our strategic plan. First pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of customers. As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 3 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, including our investment in wind generation. 
Regarding regulatory matters, in late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenue with the Missouri Public Service Commission. In addition, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $9 million increase in annual natural gas revenue with the PSC. While Michael will discuss the details of the requests in a moment, I'd like to briefly touch on some of the key benefits our electric and natural gas customers in Missouri are seeing as a result of the investments reflected in these rate requests. 
We are now in the third year of Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan, which is focused on strengthening the grid through infrastructure upgrades, adding more renewable generation and creating programs to stimulate economic growth for communities across the state. Our grid monetization investments incorporate smart technology, including outage detection and restoration switches as well as smart readers, which allow customers to take advantage of new rate options. 
These investments are delivering results to improve reliability and resiliency. For example, on circuits with new smart technology upgrades, we have seen up to a 40% improvement in reliability. Of course, we also remain committed to a clean energy transition for our customers and state. This is demonstrated through our recent acquisitions of 2 wind generation facilities located in Northern Missouri totaling 700 megawatts. 
In addition, our investments are stimulating economic growth for communities across the state. I'm pleased to say that 57% of Ameren Missouri suppliers in 2020 are Missouri-based, and 32% of its sourceable capital spend was with diverse suppliers. And we're doing all of these things while keeping our customers' electric rates approximately 20% below the average in other Midwest states and across the country. 
At the same time, we remain very disciplined in managing our costs. As a result, if approved, the new electric rate request will represent a 5.4% total increase over an almost 5-year period, a yearly average of approximately 1%. We will remain disciplined in managing our costs, while we build a stronger, smarter and cleaner energy system for our customers now and in the future. 
Moving now to Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In January, we received a constructive rate order from the ICC that resulted in a $76 million annual increase in gas distribution rates. New rates went into effect in late January. 
In our Illinois electric business, we made our required annual electric distribution link filing, requesting a $64 million base rate increase. This filing is only the second requested increase in delivery service rates in 6 years. While Michael will touch on the details of our filing a bit later, I think it is important to note that for years, our Illinois customers have realized the benefits by our significant investments in energy infrastructure. 
Since performance-based ratemaking began in 2012, reliability has improved by 20% and over 1,400 jobs have been created. At the same time, electric rates are among the lowest in the country and Midwest and are approximately 3% below 2012 levels. 
This performance-based framework has been a win-win for our customers and the state of Illinois. That is why we continue to strongly advocate for a performance-based regulatory framework in the Illinois legislature, which brings me to our discussion on the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies on Page 6. 
As I discussed in our conference call in February, an enhanced version of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act legislation was filed earlier this year, which, if passed, would apply to both the Ameren Illinois electric and natural gas distribution businesses. This legislation would allow Ameren Illinois to make significant investments in solar energy, battery storage and electric and gas infrastructure to continue to enhance safety and reliability as well as in transportation electrification in order to benefit customers and the economy across Central and Southern Illinois. This important piece of legislation would also require diverse supplier spend reporting for all-electric renewable energy providers. 
Another key component of the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act is that it will allow for performance-based ratemaking for Ameren Illinois natural gas and electric distribution businesses through 2032. The proposed performance metrics will ensure investments are aligned with and are contributing to the safety and reliability of the energy grid and natural gas systems as well as the state's vision for the transition to clean energy. 
Further, this legislation will modify the allowed return on equity methodology in each business to align with the average returns being earned by other gas and electric utilities across the nation. And as I noted a moment ago, this legislation builds on Ameren Illinois' efforts to invest in critical energy infrastructure into a transparent and stable regulatory framework that has supported significant investment, improved safety and reliability and created significant new jobs, all while keeping electric rates well below the Midwest and national averages. This bill would also move the state of Illinois closer to reaching its goal of 100% clean energy by 2050.
With all these benefits in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed. To date, the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act has received strong bipartisan support from members of the Senate and House. Currently, House Bill 1734 has 49 sponsors, and Senate Bill 311 has 21 sponsors. 
As I'm sure you know, there are also several other energy-related bills being considered by the legislature. We will continue to be actively engaged with key stakeholders throughout the legislative session on these important energy policy matters. The spring session is currently set to end May 31. 
Turning to Page 7 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In April, FERC issued a supplemental notice of proposed rule-making on the electric transmission return on equity incentive adder for participation in a Regional Transmission Organization, or RTO. In the supplemental notice, the FERC proposes to limit the duration up to 50 basis point ROE incentive adder for companies that join an RTO to 3 years. 
FERC also proposes to eliminate the adder for utilities that have been part of an RTO for 3 years or more, which would include Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Without this incentive adder, Ameren Illinois and ATXI would have earned the current allowed base ROE of 10.02%. 
For perspective, every 50 basis point change in our FERC ROE impacts annual earnings per share by approximately $0.04. Needless to say, we are disappointed with the direction the FERC has taken in the supplemental notice and strongly oppose the removal of the adder. 
From our perspective, the RTO participation adder is needed to compensate companies who are assuming risks associated with turning over operational control of assets to the RTO. The proposal is also inconsistent with the first stated policy goals and the intent of existing model to encourage RTO participation. 
We will continue to advocate for the RTO incentive adder and other project incentive adders proposed in the March 2020 NOPR. We will file comments on the supplemental NOPR by the May 26 deadline. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this matter as the FERC is under no time line to issue a decision. 
Moving now to Page 8. FERC policy matters are important because transmission investment is going to play a critical role in our country's clean energy transition. As we have discussed before, MISO and other key stakeholders, including Ameren, have been carefully assessing the transmission needs in the MISO footprint to ensure the overall reliability and resiliency of the energy grid is maintained, while companies execute their clean energy transition plans. 
Recently, MISO published several reports that outline some of the preliminary thoughts on MISO's transmission needs in the future. This page summarizes a recent study that outlines a potential roadmap of transmission projects through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant levels of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy and/or carbon emission reductions, among other things. 
I would also note that MISO and the Southwest Power Pool are also working together to develop a similar evaluation of transmission needed to support the transition across both regions. The bottom line is that significant regional and local transmission investments will be needed for the clean energy transition over the next 10 to 20 years. 
For example, under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is a scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates future transmission investment can amount to an estimated $30 billion in the MISO footprint. 
Further, Future 3 resulted in an approximate 80% reduction in carbon emission levels below 2005 levels by 2039. MISO's estimated Future 3 could result in an estimated $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint. 
To provide some context to this, during MISO's last regional transmission planning process, approximately $6.5 billion of multivalue project investments were made over the last 10 years or so. In light of the continued focus on the clean energy transition in our country, we are actively working with MISO and other key stakeholders to move the assessment and project approval process along with an appropriate sense of urgency to ensure we maintain a safe, reliable and resilient energy grid and do so in an affordable fashion. 
Given our past success in executing large regional transmission projects, we believe we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. We believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 will be included in this year's MISO transmission planning process, which is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. We look forward to working with MISO and key stakeholders on this important plan process. 
Speaking of clean energy transitions, let's move now to Page 9 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment planned to achieve compliance with Missouri's renewable energy standard through the acquisition of 700 megawatts new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. 
Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of its first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. In January, Ameren Missouri acquired its second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in Northwest Missouri. Approximately half the megawatts of the Atchison Renewable Energy Center are in service. We expect the remaining megawatts to be placed in service by September 30. 
Turning now to Page 10 and an update on Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. During its return to full power as part of its 24th refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Callaway experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted, and the decision was made to rewind the generator stator and rotor in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service. The project is going well, and we continue to expect the capital project to cost approximately $65 million. 
I'm also pleased to report that the insurance claims within the capital project and replacement power have been accepted by insurance carrier, which will mitigate the impacts of this outage for our customers. We expect the Callaway Energy Center to return to service in July. As we have said previously, we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results. 
Turning to Page 11. We are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future. I've discussed several elements of our strong sustainability value proposition with you in the past, so in the interest of time,  I'll not go through all of these points again this morning. 
Having said that, and moving to Page 12, you should know that we have already made significant progress in our sustainability efforts in 2021. Here we highlight several key achievements to date this year. 
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes strong interim carbon emission reduction targets at 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively. This plan is also at the heart of our updated climate risk report, which is based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which we issued last week. I am pleased to report our plan is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
In terms of social impact, I am very excited to say that our efforts in this area continue to be recognized by leading organizations. Last week, DiversityInc announced Ameren is once again named #1 on the top utilities list for diversity and inclusion, a list we have been proudly a part of since 2009. DiversityInc also ranked Ameren second on the top 10 regional companies and as a top company for ESG among all industries. 
In addition, for the fifth year in a row, we've been certified by Great Place to Work. 
And finally, we were recognized as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ by the Human Rights Campaign. 
Moving to governance. Our Board and management have established covenant structures that enable a focus on the ESG matters that drive Ameren's strategy, mission and vision, including the addition of ESG metrics into our executive compensation programs. In particular, our Board of Directors refined our executive compensation program by adding workforce and supplier diversity metrics to our short-term incentive plan for 2021. 
In addition, we recently issued several social impact policies. Since our call in February, we have also issued several reports reflecting our sustainability efforts and advances. Just last week, we posted our 2021 Sustainability Report, which expands on many ESG and sustainability topics and posted a 2020 ESG Sustainability Template. 
And for the first time, we published information using the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board reporting framework and mapped our business activities to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com. 
Turning now to Page 13. Environmental stewardship, social impact and governance are 3 pillars of our strong sustainability value proposition. Our final pillar is sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we have a strong, sustainable growth proposition, which will be driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. 
Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new regionally beneficial transmission projects that I described earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable additional renewable generation projects. 
In addition, we expect to see greater focus from a policy perspective on infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector. Our outlook through 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time either. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they would also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. 
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 14. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In February, we issued our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. 
Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file this year with the Missouri PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of these planned renewable investments. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. 
Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I will now turn the call over to Michael."

Turning now to Page 16 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to $0.59 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest",1652,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. 
Turning now to Page 16 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 earnings of $0.91 per share compared to $0.59 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, increased $0.22 per share due to several favorable factors. 
The earnings comparison reflected new electric service rates effective April 1, 2020, which increased earnings by $0.10 per share. In addition, earnings benefited from lower operations and maintenance expenses, which increased earnings $0.07 per share. 
This was primarily driven by the absence of unfavorable market returns that occurred in 2020 on the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance,as well as disciplined cost management. Earnings also benefited by approximately $0.04 per share from higher electric retail sales driven by near-normal winter temperatures compared to milder-than-normal winter temperatures in the year ago period. 
We have included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter that show total sales to be comparable with Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by COVID-19. We continue to see improvements in sales as schools and businesses reopen and begin to increase their levels of operation. 
Earnings were positively impacted by the timing of income tax expense, which we do not expect to impact full year results, as well as the absence of charitable donations that were made pursuant to the Missouri rate review settlement in March 2020. 
And finally, these favorable factors were partially offset by the amortization of deferred expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. 
Moving to other segments. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.08, reflecting higher delivery service rates that were effective January 25, 2021, incorporating a change in rate design, as well as the increased infrastructure investments and a lower allowed ROE. The first quarter 2021 benefit from the change in rate design is not expected to impact full year results. 
Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.03 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking of approximately 8.15% compared to 7.45% for the year ago quarter. 
Ameren Transmission earnings were comparable year-over-year, which reflected increased infrastructure investments that were offset by an unfavorable $0.03 impact of a March 2021 FERC order. This order related to an intervenor challenge regarding the historical recoveries of material and supplies inventories and rates and will have no impact on the current formula rate calculation prospectively. 
And finally, Ameren Parent and other results were down $0.01 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to increased interest expense resulting from higher long-term debt outstanding, offset by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year results. 
Finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding. 
Before moving on, I'll touch on sales transfer in Illinois Electric Distribution in the quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential customers increased 1.5%, and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers decreased 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. Recall that changes on electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Turning to Page 17. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong start in 2021. And as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. 
Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. I'll note that our second quarter earnings comparison will be negatively impacted due to a seasonal rate design change effective for 2021 in Ameren Missouri as part of the March 2020 electric rate order. This order called for winter rates in May and summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020. The second quarter results were also being negatively impacted by the absence of the impact of the 2020 FERC order, approving the MISO allowed base ROE at Ameren Transmission. 
Together, these 2 items are expected to reduce second quarter earnings by approximately $0.25 year-over-year. I encourage you to take this into consideration as you develop your expectations for our second quarter earnings results. 
Turning now to Page 18. Here we outline in more detail our recently filed Missouri electric rate review that Warner mentioned earlier. This reflects many benefits, including major upgrades to the electric system reliability and resiliency for customers as well as investments to support the transition to a cleaner energy for the benefit of customers and local communities. 
Now let me take a moment to go through the details of this filing. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $10 billion. This includes the test year ended December 31, 2020, with certain pro forma adjustments through September 30, 2021. 
The request includes a continuation of the existing FAC and other regulatory mechanisms, along with a request to recover certain costs associated with the Meramec Energy Center, which is expected to retire in 2022, over a 5-year period from the date that the new rates become effective. 
As outlined on this page, the key drivers of our $299 million annual rate increase include: increased infrastructure investments made under Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy plan; impact of the transition to a cleaner generation portfolio; decreased weather-normalized customer sales volumes; and a higher pension OPEB and tax amortization expenses, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expenses. 
Moving to Page 19 for an update on other Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In March 2021, we also filed a natural gas rate review. The details for the $9 million annual revenue increase request are outlined on this page. We expect the Missouri PSC decision in both our electric and natural gas rate reviews by February 2022, with new rates expected to be effective by March. 
Further, last October, we filed a request with the Missouri PSC to track and defer on a regulatory asset certain COVID-related costs incurred, net of any COVID-related cost savings. In March 2021, the Missouri PSC approved this request. $9 million of net costs were incurred through March 31, 2021. We recognized $5 million in the first quarter of this year and expect the remaining portion relating to late fees to be recognized when realized in rates beginning in early 2022. The timing of recovery of these costs will be determined as part of our pending electric and gas rate reviews. 
Moving now to Page 20 for an update on Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Last month, we made our required annual electric distribution performance-based rate update filing, requesting a $64 million base rate increase. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, Ameren Illinois is required to make annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true up any prior period over- or under-recovery of such costs. Since this constructive framework began, Ameren Illinois has made prudent investments to strengthen the grid and reduce outages and continues to do so. 
Major investments, including the request of the installation of outage avoidance and detection technology, integration of storm hardening equipment, adoption of clean energy technologies and the implementation of new energy efficiency measures, including mobile-enhanced communications and assessment capabilities for electric field workers. The ICC will review our request in the months ahead, with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in January of next year. 
Turning to Page 21 for a financing and liquidity update. We continue to feel very good about our liquidity and financial position. In February, Ameren Corporation issued $450 million of 1.75% senior unsecured notes due in 2028. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including that will repay short-term debt. We also expect both Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to issue long-term debt in 2021. 
In addition, as we mentioned on the call in February, during the quarter, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sales agreement to generate approximately $115 million. 
In order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $150 million of additional common equity during the balance of 2021, which is consistent with the guidance we provided in February. 
To that end, in May, we expect to establish an at-the-market or ATM equity program to support equity needs through 2023. These future equity [ issuance ] will enable us to maintain a consolidated capital structure consisting of approximately 45% equity over time. The incremental natural gas and power purchases incurred due to the extreme cold mid-February this year did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or our ability to fund our future operations and investment. 
Ameren's available liquidity as of April 30 was approximately $1.3 billion, which includes $2.3 billion of combined credit facility capacity, net of approximately $1 billion of commercial paper borrowings at the end of the month. 
Finally, turning to Page 22. We're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We're off to a solid start, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. 
Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

One, I do think clean energy legislation is a focus for the legislature. I think, just by the fact that you see so many bills that are being discussed out there, and rightfully so, right, the clean energy transition is obviously very important, not just for Illinois, but across the country. 
Certainly, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's no doubt that there are several bills that are being considered. Whether there's a grand bargain, if you will, or whether these bills are put together, look, it's just too early to say. 
The only thing I can say is this, is that we are at the table with key stakeholders trying to find a solution and to advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act because, as you heard me say many times, that act, those provisions, that performance-based ratemaking approach has really delivered significant benefits for our customers in the entire state of Illinois. 
So we have it until the end of the month to try and get something across the finish line. Richard Mark and his team have been working tirelessly at that. And I will say their tireless work and the work that we've been doing for many years has already elicited strong bipartisan support, so we're hopeful to get the proper provisions and a final piece of legislation."

Maybe pivoting over to transmission, it seems like an exciting time for transmission, if you will. And do you have any sense of the magnitude of specific projects that could be identified by MISO before year-end or in the not-too-distant future? And what do you see separately as the potential for large-scale HVDC transmission opportunities outside or beyond the MISO process? 
And then finally, I guess, with transmission trying to scale the opportunity set here, was wondering if you could help us think through roughly how much CapEx did Ameren deploy over the years, where MISO brought renewable penetration from very little to the high levels that it is today. Are there any rules -- any kind of measures we can think of like $10 billion to accommodate 10%? Just trying to scale the opportunity set here."

Let me see if -- I'll try to respond to those things, and Michael and Andrew will help me if I haven't hit a point, but certainly come back on. Let me answer your first question -- your last question perhaps first. As I said in",485,"Jeremy, a lot to unpack. Let me see if -- I'll try to respond to those things, and Michael and Andrew will help me if I haven't hit a point, but certainly come back on. 
Let me answer your first question -- your last question perhaps first. As I said in my prepared remarks, we -- there's about $6.5 billion of regional transmission projects that really were deployed across the MISO footprint over the last decade, if you will. We did about $2 billion of that. Now that doesn't mean -- that was a different time, different place. Obviously, we did 25%, 30% almost of those, and it's because of our location in the MISO footprint. And so that's just number one. 
Two, what you said at the outset, I agree with. It is a very exciting time to be in the transmission business and especially one in the MISO footprint. When you're sitting in the center of the country, right, what MISO does with its transmission is integral to the clean energy transition for our country. 
And so what you're seeing today is obviously a preliminary list of projects. They were informed certainly by stakeholder conversations as well as integrated resource plans and state energy policies, among many other things. It's hard to say just exactly what will ultimately come out of, let's just call, the transmission plan that will be filed later this year. 
But the way we look at it, we look at that Future 1, which we showed on that slide, we think that there are a lot of projects contained in that, that we think are really kind of no regrets types of projects. It's premature to put a number on it and which projects should go because what MISO does now is, now they put out this roadmap, they are basically looking for input from stakeholders. 
And so you can expect throughout 2021, stakeholders will be providing input into that roadmap. And with that input, MISO will ultimately prepare their long-range plan, their MTEP is what they call it, and we expect that to be filed in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, a process from there, Jeremy, is then there's some more input. But ultimately, the MTEP is put before the MISO Board of Directors for vote and hopefully approval by the end of the year. 
So it's not too far away, but that Future 1 is, I would say, the first step. But then as you look beyond that, as we said in Future 3, obviously, those investments continue to grow over time. And as we said, they range from $30 billion to $100 billion. Those are MISO's preliminary estimates that will continue to be refined. 
So hopefully, that gives you some of the sense. I'm not sure if I missed -- if that addressed all of your questions in there, but I think I got them all there."

Maybe the other thing that you're seeing is Senator Wyden put out a bill that really has some -- I think some very good incentives to invest in clean energy technologies. And those incentives range from tax credits. They range from tax normalization policies that give opt-out provisions. They include tax credits also for transmission. And so we look at the provisions they have done, I won't go through all the details here. That bill will really have a direct impact on the overall cost to our customers. And so we're obviously very encouraged and enthused about that.

So to be clear, I'll say this first, we are very focused on trying to get something across the finish line for the benefit of our customers in the state of Illinois an energy policy here by May 31. 
But your question is what if it doesn't happen in the next several weeks. Well, then, it could be brought up in the veto session, and our approach would be very much what we've been doing. We will continue to strongly advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy affordability Act. And the reason why we'll continue to strongly advocate for it is because it has strong bipartisan support. 
We have House bills and Senate bills with strong bipartisan support as well as supporters from the North and the South part of the state. And so we're going to continue to push for that because we strongly believe it's the best policy going forward for the state of Illinois. It isn't just because we believe it. It's because it's been delivering results for almost a decade now. And that's what we're going to continue to advocate for. 
So I do think, people say whether it's a priority, I will tell you there are a lot of conversations going on in the state of Illinois around energy policy, so I know they have other priorities that they have to balance. But I do believe energy policy is one of them."

Last night, actually, the Senate passed the House securitization bill, which is HB 734, and they did make some slight modifications to that. So now that goes back to the House to the Fiscal Review Committee. And we'll see whether that can be then voted on in the House. We may see actually some action as early as today. 
But in any event, what has to happen over the remainder of the week is that the language needs to get conformed between the 2, the Senate Bill and the House Bill. Like I said, they're very, very similar at this point, and ultimately, it needs to be passed by the end of the week. As Warner indicated, the legislative session ends on May 14, this Friday afternoon.

I think MISO did a fine job of putting together this long-range plan, which gives us collectively an opportunity to weigh in on it and to try and keep really our finger on the pulse of all the things that are going on around the country, not just in the states, but around the country. 
So it just is too premature. But I will say this, that we as well as MISO and other stakeholders, there's a sense of urgency to address these matters because we see the clean energy transition coming, and we know that transmission is critical to its success. And so consequently, there is a significant amount of interest, a significant amount of work being done. 
And so we're not too far away from really hearing what that's going to be. The fourth quarter is, really, for all practical purposes, right around the corner. And as you know, some of these projects, as you said, they take time to plan, get approval and ultimately execute. 
So again, as we see -- and I've said this in the past, it's really just -- the study really is consistent with what we've been talking about really for the last several years. We see significant transmission opportunities. And should they come in the form of this MTEP or otherwise, we think they're probably, if there are any, would come towards the back end of our 5-year current capital expenditure plan. 
But especially in the second half of this decade, you see some of these transmission projects really come to fruition. And as I said before, we're well positioned. We're well positioned to execute on many of those projects. So we're looking forward to it."

We strongly believe that the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act and all the provisions in there are clearly in the best interest of our customers in the state of Illinois.

We have a strong baseload coal fleet that runs -- it runs a lot. And it's because of some of the actions and things we've done really over the past several years, decades, frankly. 
And so we laid out our Integrated Resource Plan, and you see that, systematically, we are retiring our coal-fired energy centers over time. And it's because, number one, we think it's in the best interest of our customers from a reliability and affordability perspective. 
And so as Marty said, we don't see that changing, but conditions could change, right, whether it's at a state level or federal level. And so securitization is not going to drive us to do anything different, other than, absent changes that may happen, as I said, from a policy perspective or otherwise. But it is a good tool to have in our toolbox should those changes occur. 
So we -- our coal plants are valuable assets to us today. Over time, we will retire them, but we don't see any near-term changes to how we plan on operating or certainly risks to those assets. 
Marty, would you have anything to add to that?"

We've got very efficient coal plants. They operate very well. 
But with that said, in our Integrated Resource Plan, we did lay out that we're retiring our Meramec facility here in 2022. We expect that, that will be fully recovered at that point in time. We did propose the accelerated closure of both the Sioux and the Rush Island plants, Sioux by about 5 years and Rush Island by about 6 years. So Sioux would close in 2028, Rush Island in 2039. And then Labadie, which is our largest plant and most efficient plant, would close in 2 stages in 2036 and 2042. 
So again, we've accelerated the expected closure of 2 of our plants, and those accelerations and the recovery of those are actually reflected in the rate review filing that we made here in March. So we're looking to accelerate the recovery of those plants. And then, of course, the rates are also positively impacted by the expectation of Meramec closing. 
So those things are reflected there. That's historically the way we've handled things in Missouri. And again, as Warner said, when we filed the IRP, we made a host of assumptions. Conditions can change and vary from the assumptions that we made through time for a variety of reasons. And as I said before, securitization is not going to change the Integrated Resource Plan, preferred plan that we have today. But if conditions change versus the assumptions we've made through time, again, securitization will be a good tool to have in the toolbox."

One we've talked quite a bit about already today, and that's transmission. So as you know, we present investment opportunities through 2030 of $40 billion plus of investment opportunities. And one of the reasons we put that plus there is because transmission. 
So that $40 billion number that we have of investment opportunity does not include any of the regional transmission projects that we spent quite a bit of time talking about already. So Stephen, that would be certainly one meaningful upside to our investment profile that we have prospectively. 
A second one and another one that we talked about, and again I mentioned this a little bit earlier, is electrification and the infrastructure that has to go for the greater electrification, especially the transportation sector in our country. Our long-term plan has really no meaningful investments associated with the electrification of the transportation sector. And as you listen to the policymakers discuss the need for a cleaner energy transition in this country and lower carbon emissions, well, the transportation sector is the greatest carbon emitter in our country today. 
And so you've heard certainly the automakers and others continuing to lean further in. Well, we're going to lean further into, and we have been. So I think that, too, is a significant opportunity. 
But I'll tell you, just to be clear, what I've done with all of our investments in grid modernization, we need to continue to make investments in the grid, both in Missouri and Illinois, to make sure that the grid continues to be reliable and resilient. 
So as we look at those investment opportunities, which could also then include renewal -- greater levels of renewable energy over time, we have quite a bit in there. But times, as we've said, could change if policies change. Those, too, could be investment opportunities. 
I didn't put a specific number on those, but they're sizable. They're sizable, and so we see our robust infrastructure plan that we have already today continuing for some time."

This morning, I'll begin with the statement that I've been making for quite some time now. Simply put, our team continues to effectively execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses, which includes making significant investments within our energy infrastructure to enhance the reliability and resilience 
[Audio Gap] 
the energy grid as well as transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion. These investments, coupled with our continued focus on disciplined cost management, and delivering significant value to our customers. 
Now to our second quarter earnings results. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share. Our earnings were down $0.18 per share from the same time period in 2020, primarily due to a change in the seasonal electric link design at Ameren Missouri that reduced earnings $0.19 per share. The impact of this change in make design will reverse in the third quarter of 2021 and is not expected to impact full year results. Michael [indiscernible] due to the continued strong execution report that we remain on track to deliver within our [ 2021] [indiscernible]of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share. 
Speaking of the execution of our strategy. Let's move to Page 5, where we'll reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure with a long-term benefit of our customers. 
As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 6 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, including wind generation at Ameren Missouri, which I'll discuss later. These investments are delivering value to our customers. As I said before [indiscernible] [  business 4 ]segments. 
Consistent with the Missouri Smart Energy Plan, we have made significant investments to harden Image Grid, which has reduced outages and installed nearly 300,000 electric smart meters for customers. These smart meters will help customers better manage their usage and control their overall energy costs. 
In Illinois, we continue to execute on our electric distribution and gas monetization action plans. The plans include investments to strengthen electric power poles. We placed gas transmission pipelines and compression coupled these improvements along with our investments in outage detection technology, resulting in improvements in system reliability and millions of dollars in savings for customers. 
Moving now to regulatory matters. In late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenues and a $9 million increase in annual natural gas revenues with the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
In our Illinois Electric business, we requested a $60 million base rate increase in our required annual electric distribution rate filing. These proceedings are all moving along on schedule. We will be able to provide you information on these proceedings as they develop later the summer and into the fall. 
Finally, we have remained relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, including retaining the cost savings that we realized in 2020 due to the actions we took to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
Moving to Page 6 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Starting in Missouri, in May, the Missouri legislator passed the bill, allowing for secured 
[Audio Gap] 
another important regulatory tool to facilitate a transition to a cleaner energy future and a cost-effective manner for our customers. However, as we have stated in the past, a robust integrated resource plan does not rely on securitization to be successful. Our flexible and responsible plan, which includes approximately [ $8 billion ] of investments in renewable energy through 2040, the retirement of all of our coal-fired energy centers and extending the life of our Carbon Creek Callaway Nuclear Energy Center focuses on getting the energy we provide to our customers as clean as we can, as fast as we can without compromising [ energies ] 
[Audio Gap] 
And as I will touch on later, I am pleased to say that we are already taking steps to implement this important plan for our customers, the State of Missouri and our country. 
Moving now to Illinois. 
[Audio Gap] 
in this program, we're able to support the development of a network of charging infrastructure in Central and Southern Illinois as well as implement specialty and other incentives to help encourage the use of electric vehicles. We are excited about this new program because it will drive greater electrification of the transportation sector as well as help the state of Illinois move towards its clean energy goals.
Moving to legislative efforts. As many of you know, we have been working to enhance the regulatory framework for our Illinois Electric business. The performance-based regulatory framework in place today has delivered strong value for customers and shareholders over the years. However, the framework has scheduled to sunset in 2022. As a result, we have been working with key stakeholders to develop constructive long-term regulatory policies that support important investments in energy infrastructure while enabling us to earn fair returns on those investments. As you know, throughout the regulatory registry extended, the existing framework until 2032, while putting in place provisions that would set the Ameren Illinois electric distribution ROE at the national average. At the same time, many other energy-related legislative proposals from other stakeholders were proposed during the legislative session, including proposals from Governor Pritzker, labor and environmental groups, to address the planned-up closure of nuclear plants in the states, Illinois clean energy transition and the electric distribution framework going forward. For month, stakeholders have been in discussion seeking to find an appropriate compromise to all these proposals. While progress is made in these issues, the regulatory legislative session ended on May 31, with no energy legislation being put before the Senate or House of Representatives for a vote. 
A special session was called in mid-June to further discuss graft energy legislation, but no bill was filed nor action taken. Needless to say, we will continue to work with key stakeholders to find a constructive solution to this important matter. 
Turning to Page 7 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In April, FERC issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, or NOPR, on electric transmission return on equity incentive adder for participation in the Region Transmission Organization, or RGO. As you may recall, under the NOPR, the RGO incentive banner would be removed from utilities that have been members of an [ RCO ] for 3 years or more, like Cameron Illinois and ATXI. We have been very clear for a number of reasons and recently filed comments strongly posing the removal of the adder. 
Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this matter as the FERC is under no time line to issue a decision. 
In addition, in June, the FERC issued an order establishing a joint federal state task force and electric transmission  
[Audio Gap] 
facilities, recognizing that federal and state regulators share authority over different aspects of these transmission-related issues. The task force will be comprised of the FERC commissioners and representatives nominated by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners from 10 state commissions. The first public meeting is expected to be held this as fall. 
Also last month, the FERC issued an advanced notice of proposed rule-making processes, including critical future generation needs. We continue to asses the management and file comments with the FERC this fall. Again, we are unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of this matter as FERC is under no time line to issue a decision. 
Speaking to plan for future transmissions, please turn to Page 8. As I discussed on the call in May, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean imaging or carbon emission reductions, among other things. 
Under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $30 billion of future transmission investment in the MISO footprint. Further, MISO's Future 3 scenario resulted in an 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039. Under this scenario, MISO estimates approximately $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint would be needed. 
It is clear that investment in transmission is going to play a critical role in the clean energy transition, and we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. We continue to work with MISO and other key stakeholders and believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 are likely to be included in this year's MISO's transmission planning process, which is currently scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, it is possible the process could go into the first quarter of 2022. 
Moving now to Page 9 for an update on our [ 1.1 ] of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of its first wind energy center 
[Audio Gap] 
In January, Ameren Missouri acquired a second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt [ Acheson ] Renewable Energy Center located in Northwest Missouri. I am pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, the Atchison Renewable Energy Center is now in service. With both facilities now operating, it marks a key milestone as we continue to transition our energy portfolio towards a cleaner energy future, Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. 
As we have previously discussed, during its return to full power, as part of its 24th refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Callaway experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough was made to rewind the generator stator and rotor in order to safely and sustainably return to the energy center to service. I am pleased to report that the generator project was executed very well and that the energy center returned to service on August 4. The completion of this project positions Callaway for a sustainable long-term future. The cost of the capital project was approximately $60 million. As we have said previously, the insurance claims for the capital project and replacement power have been accepted by our insurance carrier, which will mitigate the impacts of this outage for our customers. In addition, we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results. 
Turning to Page 11. We remain focused on delivering a 
[Audio Gap] 
in our pantry. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future. 
Beginning with environmental stewardship. Last September, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes interim carbon-emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively, and is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. 
Finally, our strong corporate covenants is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters. And our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long-term performance, diversity, equity and inclusion and progress towards a cleaner, sustainable energy [ position ]. You can find all ESG-related reports at [ ameren.investor.com ]. 
Turning now to Page 12. Looking ahead, we have a strong sustainable growth proposition, which will be driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $40 [ billion ] over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all our stakeholders in making the energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new vehemently better special transmission projects, including the potential road map of MISO transmission projects I discussed earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable our country's transition 
[Audio Gap] 
the electrification of the transportation sector. Our outlook through 2030 does not include significant event structure investments for electrification at this time. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they would also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner energy future and is safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 13. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. 
In February, we issued our 5-year growth outlook, which included a [ 6% to 8% ] 
[Audio Gap] 
strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 
[Audio Gap] 
1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's and greater resource plan. Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file this year with the Missouri PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of these planned renewable investments. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business teams to get it done. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution and our strategy on many fronts has positioned us well for future success. Further, our shares continue to offer the investors a solid dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Again, thank you all for joining us today. I will now turn 
[Audio Gap] 
yesterday, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share compared to $0.98 per share for the year-ago quarter. 
[Audio Gap] 
earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, decreased $0.18 per share, driven primarily by a change in seasonal electric rate design, resulting from the March 2020 rate order, which provided for winter rates in May and summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020. 
[Audio Gap] 
expected to impact full year results. Earnings were also impacted by the timing of income tax expense, which decreased earnings $0.03 per share and is not expected to impact full year results. As Warner mentioned, during the quarter, we remain relentlessly focused on continuous [indiscernible] and have been able to largely maintain maintained the level of operations and maintenance savings this quarter that we experienced during the year-ago period, which was significantly affected COVID-19. The increase in other operations and maintenance expenses, which decreased earnings $0.02 per share, was primarily due to more favorable market returns on the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance in the year-ago period. 
As you can see, we have worked hard this year to control costs where we can. The amortization of deferred expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage and higher interest expense, these factors were partially offset by an increase in earnings of $0.05 per share due to increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation, eligible for plant and service accounting and the Renewable Energy Standard Rate Adjustment Mechanism, or RESRAM. 
Higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately $0.04 per share, largely due to continued economic recovery in this year's second quarter compared to the unfavorable impacts of COVID-19 in the year-ago period. We've included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter. 
Overall weather-normalized sales are largely consistent with our expectations outlined in our call in February as we still expect total sales to be up approximately 2% in 2021 compared to 2020. 
Moving to other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings declined $0.03 per share over year, which reflected the absence of the prior year benefit from the May 2020 FERC order addressing the allowed base return on equity, which more than offset earnings on increased infrastructure investment. Earnings for Ameren oil natural gas decreased $0.01 per share. Increased delivery service rates that became effective in late January 2021 were offset by a change in rate design, which is not expected to impact full year results. Ameren Illinois electric distribution earnings increased $0.02 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based rate making. 
Ameren parent and other results were also up $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year results. And finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding. 
Before moving on, I'll touch on year-to-date sales trends for [ renewal ] electric distribution. Kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers increased 2.5% and 2%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Ilninois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Turning to Page 16. Now I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong first half in 2021. And as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. 
I will note that our third quarter earnings comparison will be positively impacted by approximately $0.19 per share due to the seasonal electric rate design change effective in 2021 at Ameren Missouri that we discussed earlier. 
Moving now to Page 17 for an update on our regulatory matters. Starting with Ameren Missouri. As you recall, on March 31, we filed for a $299 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $10 billion. [ Intervenor ] customer will be filed in early September with the bottle testing [indiscernible] October 15. Evidence hearings are scheduled to begin in late November. In addition, on March 31, we filed for a $9 million natural gas revenue increase with the Missouri PSC. The request includes a 9.8% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $310 million. A Missouri PSC decision in both rate reviews is expected by early February, with new rates expected to be effective by late February. 
Moving down renewal -- Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. 
In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $54 million base rate increase compared to our request of a $60 million base rate increase. An ICC decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2022. 
Moving to Page 18. In early June, Ameren published a sustainability financing framework, becoming one of the first utilities in the nation to do so. Under this framework, Ameren and its issuing subsidiaries may elect to finance or refinance new and existing projects that have an environmental or social benefit through green bonds, social bonds, sustainability bonds, green loans or other financial instruments. Given the amount of investment activity at Ameren and the utility subsidiaries are pursuing, that have environmental or social benefits, we expect to be a relatively frequent issuer under our sustainability financing framework. In June, both Ameren Missouri and Ameren Ilinois issued green bonds consistent with this new financing framework. More information about this framework is available at amereninvestors.com. 
Turning to Page 19 for a financing and liquidity update. We continue to feel very good about our liquidity and financial position. As I just mentioned in June, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois issued green bonds with the net proceeds to be allocated to sustainable projects, meeting certain eligibility requirements under the sustainability financing framework. Additional debt issuance are outlined on this page. 
Further, earlier this year, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sale agree for proceeds of approximately $115 million. In order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expected to issue a total of approximately $150 million of common equity in 2021 under the at-the-market or ATM program established in May. This is consistent with prior guidance provided in February and May. And to date, approximately $122 million of equity has been issued through this program. Our $750 million ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs through 2023. 
Finally, Ameren's available liquidity as of July 30 was approximately $1.8 billion. 
Lastly, turning to Page 20. We're well positioned to continue to execute on our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we successfully execute our strategy. And as we look to the longer term, we expect strong earnings per share growth driven by a robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have a strong total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

But right now, we're very comfortable and like our integrated resource plan and complement Marty Lyons and his team really did a nice job working with stakeholders to get that across the finish line. And so Marty, why don't you come on in and see if you have any additional comments on the securitization tool that we have available to us."

Really, what you see there is our plan as it stands today as to use our low-cost, reliable coal fleet as a foundation to bring in more renewables over time and provide reliable power to our customers. 
But as Warner said, to the extent situations change and require adjustments to this plan, it could be that securitization would be a very good tool to have in our toolbox to perhaps make this transition more swiftly and do it in a way that provides affordable rates to our customers. So I think a really good tool to have in the toolbox, but again, not needed today as we look at this integrated resource plan."

And certainly, MISO being right in the middle of the country is going to play an integral role. And obviously, we have a big footprint in MISO. 
And so as we've looked at it, MISO has really done a fine job from our perspective. And we're really looking out to see what some of those long-range transmission projects might be. No, they're not definitive yet, but they laid out a real nice plan for us to really think about and work with key stakeholders. And that's exactly what we have been doing working without the key stakeholders and say, okay, what are these projects that we need to move forward with. I would say MISO is still in the middle of that process with us and so many others. 
And as you know, they'll take that long-range plan that we outlined in our slides. And they're going to put that and include aspects of that thinking in MISO's transmission expansion plan, which is a process that we'll, hopefully, see move forward by the end of this year. 
So beyond that, I would say the conversations and analysis continues. The only thing I will say is that we believe we're well positioned to execute many of those projects. And we believe if you look at that Future 1, that some of those projects are going to likely be in this intent that comes out here at the end of this year or perhaps some maybe into early next year. because those are some no regrets projects that are in there that we need to move forward on, not just in the Midwest but for our country, so we can move forward on this clean energy transition. So nothing specific yet. But needless to say, there is a lot of work going around with the teams to try and move forward on this important aspect of the clean energy transition. So stay tuned. More to come."

And then Marty, you can talk about how the Greenbelt project has been incorporated, in some respects, at least commented upon in our integrated resource plan. But just big picture, whether it's the grain belt or any transmission, obviously, permitting and siding is an important aspect of transmission. I think this is why you're seeing FERC and others, state commissions and others and legislators, take a very careful look at this because we recognize that that's an important aspect of getting any of these major transmission projects done. And some significant transmission projects are going to have to be done to -- for us to affect the clean energy transition. 
And so one of the things I will tell you, we work very hard as a company at this, and that is being very thoughtful and reaching out with stakeholders in the communities early and often to talk about the needs for the transmission line, but also how we can work with those stakeholders in those communities so we can get the permitting and signing done in a timely fashion. Sean Schucker and his team have done that for years and years now. And this is why you've seen the success that we had in the last multi-valued projects that MISO did almost a decade ago. Now those projects were so successful is because a lot of work was done on the front end, so we could execute on the back end. As we look forward to any future transmission project, that's exactly what we will continue to do. 
Now Green Belt, obviously, as you rightfully said, that is not our project. But certainly it's something that has received a lot of attention in Missouri and otherwise. And so Marty, I want you to comment a little bit about some of the things that we've been looking at in terms of Green Belt as part of our integrated resource planning process."

So I mentioned our integrated resource plan we filed last fall. And again, back on that Slide 25, where we depict our plan, that's really our preferred plan out from the Integrated Resource Plan as we move forward. 
But as we develop that plan, we looked at a number of scenarios in terms of the path forward to get to what we believe to be the most reliable and affordable path forward. And in these scenarios, certainly, we evaluated utilization of Green Belt as well as many other kinds of scenarios. And where we stand right now in terms of our integrated resource plan, as you all know, we did put out a request for proposals last year on various resources that might be available to fulfill our needs. Obviously, our ambition is to acquire 1,200 megawatts of renewables, wind, solar, through 2025. And we do still expect to file later this year with the PSC for certificates of convenience [indiscernible] to access for a portion of those planned projects. 
But as we go through broadly, looking at just the next 5 years but even beyond, certainly, we'll continue to consider all options, including utilization of Grain Belt as we think about fulfilling those needs. 
In terms of your question, Paul, I think you were asking about large-scale transmission, smaller-scale transmission. As we go about looking at the various resources that might fulfill our needs, certainly, we work closely with Sean and his team and think very much about the transmission investments that will be required to facilitate investment in any of those projects, whether wind or solar. And it's an important part of our consideration as we think about the resources that will be most affordable for our customers."

Look, we're encouraged that the federal regulators and state regulators are not only talking, but trying to find a path forward. Because as I've said now several times on this call, the transmission is going to be a critical component of getting these major transmission projects done for our country. And so as we all know, the federal regulators, FERC and the state regulators, their jurisdictions or lose the issues can sometimes overlap. And so things that are really important all the time is how we can sort through permitting and sighting. 
And clearly, another issue around transmission projects, especially these regional projects, which we're talking about in large part with these MISO projects, how you allocate the costs fairly inappropriately? 
And so what I think, Julian, what will happen with some of these conversations and what we hope to have happened is that there's a better understanding of the issues, perhaps a bit of a meeting of the minds, and so we can start moving forward in a more timely fashion than we might have otherwise had. 
And of course, we're making the types of investments that we are making that we want to have, let's say, greater levels of regulatory certainty. And so these things, I think, will be helpful. I'm not suggesting that this task force will solve it all. But I think what it will do will provide a great forum for stakeholders, not just regulators, companies like ours and others to come to the table and say, ""Okay, here are things that really matter, and here's how we can lean further forward in the transmission space,"" which we, needless to say, strongly support the need to lean forward, further, faster in the transmission space."

How are you thinking about transmission interconnect delays, costs, et cetera, just as you think about your own efforts? And then what are you observing regionally? Again, clearly, the need for transmission is principally evidenced by the elevated cost of interconnection costs and that translating to a relatively stagnant trajectory of processing this queue. Are you seeing issues with your own projects? And then more broadly, are you seeing these elevated costs with other developers in and around insurance sectors? If you can elaborate on it."

So number one, [indiscernible] a moment ago was talking about how we proceed to the integrated resource planning process. And he also said, a key element of the projects that we look at and select really look very hard at transmission, interconnections, where developers may be in the queue, to try and move things forward. And that's frankly how we were successful in moving in a very thoughtful and timely fashion with our 700 megawatts of wind generation. 
So what we're seeing there, this is all part of our due diligence. Are you seeing sort of a backup? Yes. Are you seeing now that organizations like MISO are looking beyond just today, looking to the future with this long-term resource planning effort? The answer to that is yes, and that's why we support it. It will, we believe, help alleviate, in the future, if you look sort of a decade out, which is really when you think about transmission projects, look just for tomorrow, you look, say, a decade out, what are the things that we need to be doing today to position ourselves for success in the future? So we're encouraged by that. 
Are we seeing the increases in prices or challenges? Well, it's premature to say that. We're still going through the process, still talking to developers, working with MISO and others. But the only thing I do know is that we have, I would say, unique expertise to provide the analysis, but also unique expertise to execute these important transmission projects, not just for our projects, but frankly, the projects that I'll have regional and frankly, countrywide, positive implications to move forward to clean energy transition. 
So I don't know if, Julian, that answered your specific question. This is certainly an important aspect of what we're seeing, but this is not new to us. And I'll finish with this, too. The other encouraging thing that we are seeing is that, in particular, in this instance, MISO is working with the other regional transmission organizations, in this particular instance, SPP, to try and coordinate even better some of these transmission projects and needs. So you don't have surprises when it comes time to try and move forward with a particular renewal energy project. That, too, is encouraging. And we look forward to the results of that collaborative effort from those 2 organizations. And I'm sure [ PJ ] and MISO will be having similar conversations sometime done ago."

So what's the next thing to look at? Look, I think that the MTAP, the MISO transmission expansion planning process, that will be really sort of your next visible sign. You'll probably see -- there may be some information out there towards the end of the third quarter into the fourth. But the process itself, which ultimately goes before the Board of Directors of MISO, will be really in the fourth quarter at the earliest, as I said in my prepared remarks, that could go into the first quarter of next year.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'll begin with the statement that I've been making for quite some time now.

This morning, I'll begin with the statement that I've been making for quite some time now. Simply put, our team continues to effectively execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses, which includes making significant investments in our energy infrastructure to enhance the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion. These investments, coupled with our continued focus on disciplined cost management, are delivering significant value to our customers communities and shareholders.
Moving now to our second quarter earnings results. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share. Our earnings were down $0.18 per share from the same time period in 2020, primarily due to a change in the seasonal electric link design at Ameren Missouri that reduced earnings $0.19 per share. The impact of this change in rate design will reverse in the third quarter of 2021 and is not expected to impact full year results. Michael will discuss the other key drivers of our second quarter earnings results a bit later.
Due to the continued strong execution of our strategy, I am pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver within our 2021 earnings guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share.
Speaking of the execution of our strategy, let's move to Page 5, where we reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure with a long-term benefit of our customers.
As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 6 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, including wind generation at Ameren Missouri, which I'll discuss later. These investments are delivering value to our customers. As I said before, our energy grade is stronger, more resilient and more secure because of the investments we are making in all 4 business segments.
Consistent with the Missouri Smart Energy Plan, we have made significant investments to harden the energy grid, which has reduced outages and installed nearly 300,000 electric smart meters for customers. These smart meters will help customers better manage their usage and control their overall energy costs.
In Illinois, we continue to execute on our electric distribution and gas monetization action plans. The plans include investments to strengthen electric power poles. We placed gas transmission pipelines and compression coupled steel mains as well as to implement new efficiency measures, including mobile-enhanced communications and assessment capabilities for our crews. These improvements, along with our investments in outage detection technology, resulted in an improvements in system reliability and millions of dollars in savings for customers.
Moving now to regulatory matters. In late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenues and a $9 million increase in annual natural gas revenues with the Missouri Public Service Commission.
In our Illinois Electric business, we requested a $60 million base rate increase in our required annual electric distribution rate filing. These proceedings are all moving along on schedule. We will be able to provide you information on these proceedings as they develop later this summer and into the fall.
Finally, we have remained relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, including retaining many of cost savings that we realized in 2020 due to the actions we took to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19.
Moving to Page 6 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Starting in Missouri, in May, the Missouri legislator passed the bill, allowing for securitization in the state. This constructive legislation, which is signed by Governor Parson in July, gives us another important regulatory tool to facilitate our transition to a cleaner energy future in a cost-effective manner for our customers.
However, as we have stated in the past, a robust Integrated Resource Plan does not rely on securitization to be successful. Our flexible and responsible plan, which includes approximately $8 billion of investments in renewable energy through 2040, the retirement of all of our coal-fired energy centers and extending the life of our carbon-free Callaway Nuclear Energy Center focuses on getting the energy we provide to our customers as clean as we can, as fast as we can without compromising on reliability, customer affordability and the evolution of new clean energy technologies. And as I will touch on later, I am pleased to say that we are already taking steps to implement this important plan for our customers, the State of Missouri and our country.
Moving now to Illinois. Last month, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved Ameren Illinois electric vehicle charging program. Under this program, we're able to support the development of a network of charging infrastructure in Central and Southern Illinois as well as implement special time-based delivery service rates and other incentives to help encourage the use of electric vehicles. We are excited about this new program because it will drive greater electrification of the transportation sector as well as help the state of Illinois move towards its clean energy goals.
Moving to Illinois legislative efforts, as many of you know, we have been working to enhance the regulatory framework for our Illinois Electric business. The performance-based regulatory framework in place today has delivered strong value for customers and shareholders over the years. However, the framework is scheduled to sunset in 2022. As a result, we have been working with key stakeholders to develop constructive long-term regulatory policies that support important investments in energy infrastructure, while enabling us to earn fair returns from those investments.
As you know, throughout the regular legislative session, which ended late May, we advocated for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act, which would have largely extended the existing framework until 2032, while putting in place provisions that would set the Ameren Illinois electric distribution ROE at the national average.
At the same time, many other energy-related legislative proposals from other stakeholders were proposed during the legislative session, including proposals from Governor Pritzker, labor and environmental groups, to address the potential closure of nuclear plants in the states, Illinois Clean Energy Transition and the electric distribution framework going forward. For months, stakeholders have been in discussion seeking to find an appropriate compromise to all these proposals.
While progress is made in these issues, the regular legislative session ended on May 31, with no energy legislation being put before the Senate or House of Representatives for a vote. A special session was called in mid-June to further discuss draft energy legislation, but no bill was filed nor action taken. Needless to say, we will continue to work with key stakeholders to find a constructive solution to this important matter.
Turning to Page 7 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In April, FERC issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, or NPR, on electric transmission return on equity incentive adder for participation in a Regional Transmission Organization, or RGO. As you may recall, under the NPR, the RGO incentive adder would be removed for utilities that have been members of an RGO for 3 years or more, like Ameren Illinois and ATXI.
We have been very clear that we disagree with FERC's proposed recommendation in this matter for a number of reasons and recently filed comments strongly posing the removal of the adder. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this matter as the FERC is under no time line to issue decision.
In addition, in June, the FERC issued an order establishing a joint federal state task force on electric transmission. This order establishes a first of its kind task force to explore with state commissions transmission-related issues, building how to plan and safer transmission facilities, recognizing that federal and state regulators share authority over different aspects of these transmission-related issues. The task force will be comprised of the FERC commissioners and representatives nominated by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners from 10 state commissions. The first public meeting is expected to be held this fall.
Also last month, the FERC issued an advanced notice of proposed rule-making related to regional transmission planning and cost allocation processes, including critical long-term planning for anticipated future generation needs. We continue to assess the matters raised in the advanced NPR and expect to file comments with the FERC this fall. Again, we are unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of this matter as FERC is under no time line to issue a decision.
Speaking to plan for future transmission needs, please turn to Page 8. As I discussed on the call in May, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy, our carbon emission reductions, among other things.
Under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $30 billion of future transmission investment in the MISO footprint. Further, MISO's Future 3 scenario resulted in an 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039. Under this scenario, MISO estimates approximately $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint would be needed.
It is clear that investment in transmission is going to play a critical role in the clean energy transition, and we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. We continue to work with MISO and other key stakeholders and believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 are likely to be included in this year's MISO's transmission planning process, which is currently scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, it is possible the process could go into the first quarter of 2022.
Moving now to Page 9 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment related to the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of its first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. In January, Ameren Missouri acquired a second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in Northwestern Missouri. I am pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, the Atchison Renewable Energy Center is now in service. With both facilities now operating, it marks a key milestone as we continue to transition our energy portfolio towards a cleaner energy future.
Turning now to Page 10 and an update on Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. As we've previously discussed, during its return to full power as part of its 24th refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Callaway experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted and the decision was made to rewind the generator stator and rotor in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service.
I am pleased to report that the generator project was executed very well and that the energy center returned to service on August 4. The completion of this project positions Callaway for a sustainable long-term future. The cost of the capital project was approximately $60 million. As we have said previously, the insurance claims for the capital project and replacement power have been accepted by our insurance carrier, which will mitigate the impact of this outage for our customers. In addition, we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results.
Turning to Page 11. We remain focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision leading the way to a sustainable energy future.
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively, and is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement in limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful.
Finally, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters. And our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long-term performance, diversity, equity and inclusion and progress towards a cleaner, sustainable energy future. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com.
Turning now to Page 12. Looking ahead, we have a strong sustainable growth proposition, which will be driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders in making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new reasonably beneficial transmission projects, including the potential road map of MISO transmission projects I discussed earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable our country's transition to a clean energy future.
In addition, we expect to see greater focus from a policy perspective on infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector. Our outlook for 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they would also create thousands of jobs for our local economies.
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner energy future in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.
Moving to Page 13. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. In February, we issued our 5-year growth outlook, which included a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth was primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers.
Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file this year with the Missouri PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of these planned renewable investments. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.
That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us today.
I will now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,1673949996,2367918,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2021",2021-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share compared to $0.98 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest s",1361,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share compared to $0.98 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, decreased $0.18 per share, driven primarily by a change in seasonal electric rate design, resulting from the March 2020 rate order, which provided for winter rates in May and summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020. The rate design change decreased earnings $0.19 per share and is not expected to impact full year results.
Earnings were also impacted by the timing of income tax expense, which decreased earnings $0.03 per share and is not expected to impact full year results. As Warner mentioned, during the quarter, we remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management and have been able to largely maintain the level of operations and maintenance savings this quarter that we experienced during the year-ago period, which was significantly affected by COVID-19.
The increase in other operations and maintenance expenses, which decreased earnings $0.02 per share, was primarily due to more favorable market returns on the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance in the year-ago period.
As you can see, we have worked hard this year to control costs where we can. The amortization of deferred expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage and higher interest expense primarily due to higher long-term debt balance outstanding also decreased earnings $0.02 per share. These factors were partially offset by an increase in earnings of $0.05 per share due to increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation, eligible for plant and service accounting and the Renewable Energy Standard Rate Adjustment Mechanism, or RESRAM.
Higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately $0.04 per share, largely due to continued economic recovery in this year's second quarter compared to the unfavorable impacts of COVID-19 in the year-ago period. We've included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter. Overall weather-normalized sales are largely consistent with our expectations outlined in our call in February, as we still expect total sales to be up approximately 2% in 2021 compared to 2020.
Moving to other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings declined $0.03 per share over year, which reflected the absence of the prior year benefit from the May 2020 FERC order addressing the allowed base return on equity, which more than offset earnings on increased infrastructure investment. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas decreased $0.01 per share. Increased delivery service rates that became effective in late January 2021 were offset by a change in rate design, which is not expected to impact full year results. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.02 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking.
Ameren parent and other results were also up $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year results. And finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding.
Before moving on, I'll touch on year-to-date sales trends for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to the Illinois residential customers decreased 1%. And weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers increased 2.5% and 2%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.
Turning to Page 16. Now I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong first half in 2021 and as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February.
I will note that our third quarter earnings comparison will be positively impacted by approximately $0.19 per share due to the seasonal electric rate design change effective in 2021 at Ameren Missouri that we discussed earlier.
Moving now to Page 17 for an update on regulatory matters. Starting with Ameren Missouri, as you recall, on March 31st, we filed for a $299 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $10 billion. In a recent testimony we filed in early September with rebuttal testimony on October 15. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late November.
In addition, on March 31, we filed for a $9 million natural gas revenue increase with the Missouri PSC. The request includes a 9.8% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $310 million. A Missouri PSC decision in both rate reviews is expected by early February with new rates expected to be effective by late February.
Moving to Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $54 million base rate increase compared to our request of a $60 million base rate increase. An ICC decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2022.
Moving to Page 18. In early June, Ameren published a sustainability financing framework becoming one of the first utilities in the nation to do so. Under this framework, Ameren and its issuing subsidiaries may elect to finance or refinance new and existing projects that have environmental or social benefits through green bonds, social bonds, sustainability bonds, green loans or other financial instruments.
Given the amount of investment activity at Ameren and its utility subsidiaries are pursuing that have environmental or social benefits, we expect to be a relatively frequent issuer under our sustainability financing framework. In June, both Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois issued green bonds consistent with this new financing framework. More information about this framework is available at amereninvestors.com.
Turning to Page 19 for a financing and liquidity update. We continue to feel very good about our liquidity and financial position. As I just mentioned in June, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois issued green bonds with the net proceeds to be allocated to sustainable projects, meeting certain eligibility requirements under the sustainability financing framework. Additional debt issuance are outlined on this page.
Further, earlier this year, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sale agreement for proceeds of approximately $115 million. In order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expected to issue a total of approximately $150 million of common equity in 2021 under the aftermarket or ATM program established in May. This is consistent with prior guidance provided in February and May and to date approximately $122 million of equity has been issued through this program. Our $750 million ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs through 2023. Finally, Ameren's available liquidity as of July 30 was approximately $1.8 billion.
Lastly, turning to Page 20. We're well positioned to continue to execute on our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have a strong total share return story that compares very favorably to our peers.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

But right now, we're very comfortable and like our Integrated Resource Plan, and I'll compliment Marty Lyons and his team really did a nice job working with stakeholders to get that across the finish line. And so Marty, why don't you come on in and see if you have any additional comments on the securitization tool that we have available to us."

Really, what you see there is our plan as it stands today as to use our low-cost, reliable coal fleet as a foundation to bring in more renewables over time and provide reliable power to our customers.
But as Warner said, to the extent situations change and require adjustments to this plan, it could be that securitization would be a very good tool to have in our toolbox to perhaps make this transition more swiftly and do it in a way that provides affordable rates to our customers. So I think a really good tool to have in the toolbox, but again, not needed today as we look at this Integrated Resource Plan."

Look, as we discussed really on our last quarter call and as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we really see transmission investment as being critical for our country's transition to a clean energy future. And certainly, MISO being right in the middle of the country is going to play an integral role. And obviously, we have a big footprint in MISO.
And so as we've looked at it, MISO has really done a fine job from our perspective. And we're really looking out to see what some of those long-range transmission projects might be. No, they're not definitive yet, but they laid out a real nice plan for us to really think about and work with key stakeholders. And that's exactly what we have been doing working with all key stakeholders and say, ""Okay, what are these projects that we need to move forward with."" I would say MISO is still in the middle of that process with us and so many others.
And as you know, they'll take that long-range plan that we outlined in our slides, and they're going to put that and include aspects of that, of that thinking in MISO's transmission expansion plan, which is a process that we'll, hopefully, see move forward by the end of this year. So beyond that, I would say the conversations and analysis continues.
The only thing I will say is that we believe we're well positioned to execute many of those projects. And we believe if you look at that Future 1, that some of those projects are going to likely be in this MTAP that comes out here at the end of this year or perhaps maybe into early next year because those are some no regrets projects that are in there that we need to move forward on, not just in the Midwest but for our country, so we can move forward on this clean energy transition. So nothing specific yet. But needless to say, there is a lot of work going around with the teams to try and move forward on this important aspect of the clean energy transition. So stay tuned. More to come."

One of the questions, I guess, that sort of comes up here is as you are aware that in Missouri there is this clean energy line. I forgot the exact name, but you're familiar with it. It's the one that's been held up by challenges to it. It seems like forever. It's not your line. It's more like a merchant line.
But in general, how should we think about once MISO is sort of identified, et cetera, the -- bringing those -- assuming that you guys get a good line of sight on opportunities for yourselves, how should we think about sighting or permitting, et cetera, with respect to some of these projects in the context of the example that I've mentioned versus some of the add-ons and stuff that don't seem to have as much in the way of hurdles? Do you follow what I'm saying?"

And then Marty, you can talk about how the Greenbelt project has been incorporated, in some respects, or at least comment upon in our Integrated Resource Plan. But just big picture, whether it's the Green Belt or any transmission, obviously, permitting and sighting is an important aspect of transmission. I think this is why you're seeing FERC and others, state commissions and others and legislators, take a very careful look at this because we recognize that that's an important aspect of getting any of these major transmission projects done. And some significant transmission projects are going to have to be done to -- for us to affect the clean energy transition.
And so one of the things I will tell you, we work very hard as a company at this, and that is being very thoughtful and reaching out with stakeholders in the communities early and often to talk about the needs for the transmission line, but also how we can work with those stakeholders in those communities so we can get the permitting and sighting done in a timely fashion. Shawn Schukar and his team have done that for years and years now. And this is why you've seen the success that we had in the last multi-valued projects that MISO did almost a decade ago. Now how those projects were so successful is because a lot of work was done on the front end, so we could execute on the back end. As we look forward to any future transmission project, that's exactly what we will continue to do.
Now Green Belt, obviously, as you rightfully said, that is not our project. But certainly it's something that has received a lot of attention in Missouri and otherwise. And so Marty, I want you to comment a little bit about some of the things that we've been looking at in terms of Green Belt as part of our integrated resource planning process."

So I mentioned our Integrated Resource Plan we filed last fall. And again, back on that Slide 25, where we depict our plan, that's really our preferred plan out from the Integrated Resource Plan as we move forward.
But as we develop that plan, we looked at a number of scenarios in terms of the path forward to get to what we believe to be the most reliable and affordable path forward. And in these scenarios, certainly, we evaluated utilization of Green Belt as well as many other kinds of scenarios. And where we stand right now in terms of our Integrated Resource Plan, as you all know, we did put out a request for proposals last year on various resources that might be available to fulfill our needs.
Obviously, our ambition is to acquire 1,200 megawatts of renewables, wind, solar, through 2025. And we do still expect to file later this year with the PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of those planned projects. But as we go through broadly, looking at just the next 5 years but even beyond, certainly, we'll continue to consider all options, including utilization of Green Belt as we think about fulfilling those needs.
In terms of your question, Paul, I think you were asking about large-scale transmission, smaller-scale transmission. As we go about looking at the various resources that might fulfill our needs, certainly, we work closely with Shawn and his team and think very much about the transmission investments that will be required to facilitate investment in any of those projects, whether wind or solar.

You mentioned FERC and NARUC joining forces here that seems like a fairly potent combination to drive real change, right? So I'd be curious, what do you -- what is the focus here? And specifically, what key issues are you asking them to address, right? When it comes to utilities, not HVDC lines with their own challenges and prospects. But from your perspective, tangibly, how can they step in and help you all?"

Look, we're encouraged that the federal regulators and state regulators are not only talking, but trying to find a path forward. Because as I've said now several times on this call, the transmission is going to be a critical component of getting these major transmission projects done for our country. And so as we all know, the federal regulators, FERC and the state regulators, their jurisdictions or at least the issues can sometimes overlap.
And so things that are really important all the time is how we can sort through permitting and sighting. And clearly, another issue around transmission projects, especially these regional projects, which we're talking about in large part with these MISO projects, how you allocate the costs fairly inappropriately?
And so what I think, Julien, what will happen with some of these conversations and what we hope to have happened is that there's a better understanding of the issues perhaps a bit of a meeting of the minds, and so we can start moving forward in a more timely fashion than we might have otherwise had.
And of course, we're making the types of investments that we are making that we want to have, let's say, greater levels of regulatory certainty. And so these things, I think, will be helpful. I'm not suggesting that this task force will solve it all. But I think what it will do will provide a great forum for stakeholders, not just regulators, companies like ours and others to come to the table and say, ""Okay, here are things that really matter, and here's how we can lean further forward in the transmission space,"" which we, needless to say, strongly support the need to lean forward, further, faster in the transmission space."

How are you thinking about transmission interconnect delays, costs, et cetera, just as you think about your own efforts? And then what are you observing regionally? Again, clearly, the need for transmission is principally evidenced by the elevated cost, the interconnection costs and that translating to a relatively stagnant trajectory of processing this queue. Are you seeing issues with your own projects? And then more broadly, are you seeing these elevated costs with other developers in and around your service territories? If you can elaborate on that."

So number one, Martin a moment ago was talking about how we proceed to the integrated resource planning process. And he also said, a key element of the projects that we look at and select really look very hard at transmission, interconnections, where developers may be in the queue, to try and move things forward. And that's frankly how we were successful in moving in a very thoughtful and timely fashion with our 700 megawatts of wind generation.
So what we're seeing there, this is all part of our due diligence. Are you seeing sort of a backup? Yes. Are you seeing now that organizations like MISO are looking beyond just today, looking to the future with this long-term resource planning effort? The answer to that is yes, and that's why we support it. It will, we believe, help alleviate, in the future, if you look sort of a decade out, which is really when you think about transmission projects, look just for tomorrow, you look, say, a decade out, what are the things that we need to be doing today to position ourselves for success in the future? So we're encouraged by that.
Are we seeing increases in prices or challenges? Well, it's premature to say that. We're still going through the process, still talking to developers, working with MISO and others. But the only thing I do know is that we have, I would say, unique expertise to provide the analysis, but also unique expertise to execute these important transmission projects, not just for our projects, but frankly, the projects that I'll have regional and frankly, countrywide, positive implications to move forward to clean energy transition.
So I don't know if, Julien, that answered your specific question. This is certainly an important aspect of what we're seeing, but this is not new to us. And I'll finish with this, too. The other encouraging thing that we are seeing is that, in particular, in this instance, MISO is working with the other regional transmission organizations, in this particular instance, SPP, to try and coordinate even better some of these transmission projects and needs. So you don't have surprises when it comes time to try and move forward with a particular renewal energy project. That, too, is encouraging. And we look forward to the results of that collaborative effort from those 2 organizations. And I'm sure PJM and MISO will be having similar conversations sometime on those."

So we're excited about that opportunity to be able to execute some of those.
So what's the next thing to look at? Look, I think that the MTAP, the MISO transmission expansion planning process, that will be really sort of your next visible sign. You'll probably see -- there may be some information out there towards the end of the third quarter into the fourth. But the process itself, which ultimately goes before the Board of Directors of MISO, will be really in the fourth quarter at the earliest, as I said in my prepared remarks, that could go into the first quarter of next year. But that would be probably, I would say, part of the next data point, if you will.

This morning, I'll begin with the statement that I've been making for quite some time now. Simply put, our team continues to effectively execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses, which includes making significant investments in our energy infrastructure to enhance the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion. These investments, coupled with our continued focus on disciplined cost management, are delivering significant value to our customers communities and shareholders.
Moving now to our second quarter earnings results. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share. Our earnings were down $0.18 per share from the same time period in 2020, primarily due to a change in the seasonal electric link design at Ameren Missouri that reduced earnings $0.19 per share. The impact of this change in rate design will reverse in the third quarter of 2021 and is not expected to impact full year results. Michael will discuss the other key drivers of our second quarter earnings results a bit later.
Due to the continued strong execution of our strategy, I am pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver within our 2021 earnings guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share.
Speaking of the execution of our strategy, let's move to Page 5, where we reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure with a long-term benefit of our customers.
As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 6 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, including wind generation at Ameren Missouri, which I'll discuss later. These investments are delivering value to our customers. As I said before, our energy grid is stronger, more resilient, and more secure because of the investments we are making in all 4 business segments. 
Consistent with the Missouri Smart Energy Plan, we have made significant investments to harden the energy grid, which has reduced outages and installed nearly 300,000 electric smart meters for customers. These smart meters will help customers better manage their usage and control their overall energy costs. 
In Illinois, we continue to execute on our electric distribution and gas monetization action plans. The plans include investments to strengthen electric power poles, replace gas transmission pipelines and compression coupled steel mains as well as to implement new efficiency measures, including mobile-enhanced communications and assessment capabilities for our crews. These improvements, along with our investments in outage detection technology, are resulting in improvements in system reliability and millions of dollars in savings for customers. 
Moving now to regulatory matters. In late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenues and a $9 million increase in annual natural gas revenues with the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
In our Illinois Electric business, we requested a $60 million base rate increase in our required annual electric distribution rate filing. These proceedings are all moving along on schedule. We will be able to provide you information on these proceedings as they develop later this summer and into the fall.
Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, including retaining many of the cost savings that we realized in 2020 due to the actions we took to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
Moving to Page 6 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Starting in Missouri, in May, the Missouri Legislature passed a bill, allowing for securitization in the state. This constructive legislation, which was signed by Governor Parson in July, gives us another important regulatory tool to facilitate our transition to a cleaner energy future in a cost-effective manner for our customers. 
However, as we have stated in the past, our robust Integrated Resource Plan does not rely on securitization to be successful. Our flexible and responsible plan, which includes approximately $8 billion of investments in renewable energy through 2040, the retirement of all of our coal-fired energy centers, and extending the life of our carbon-free Callaway Nuclear Energy Center focuses on getting the energy we provide to our customers as clean as we can, as fast as we can without compromising on reliability, customer affordability, and the evolution of new clean energy technologies. And as I will touch on later, I am pleased to say that we are already taking steps to implement this important plan for our customers, the State of Missouri, and our country. 
Moving now to Illinois. Last month, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved Ameren Illinois’ electric vehicle charging program. Under this program, we're able to support the development of a network of charging infrastructure in Central and Southern Illinois as well as implement special time-based delivery service rates and other incentives to help encourage the use of electric vehicles. We are excited about this new program because it will drive greater electrification of the transportation sector as well as help the state of Illinois move towards its clean energy goals. 
Moving to Illinois legislative efforts, as many of you know, we have been working to enhance the regulatory framework for our Illinois Electric business. The performance-based regulatory framework in place today has delivered strong value for customers and shareholders over the years. However, the framework is scheduled to sunset in 2022. As a result, we have been working with key stakeholders to develop constructive long-term regulatory policies that support important investments in energy infrastructure, while enabling us to earn fair returns from those investments.
As you know, throughout the regular legislative session, which ended late May, we advocated for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act, which would have largely extended the existing framework until 2032, while putting in place provisions that would set the Ameren Illinois electric distribution ROE at the national average.
At the same time, many other energy-related legislative proposals from other stakeholders were proposed during the legislative session, including proposals from Governor Pritzker, labor and environmental groups, to address the potential closure of nuclear plants in the states, Illinois Clean Energy Transition and the electric distribution framework going forward. For months, stakeholders have been in discussion seeking to find an appropriate compromise to all these proposals.
While progress is made in these issues, the regular legislative session ended on May 31, with no energy legislation being put before the Senate or House of Representatives for a vote. A special session was called in mid-June to further discuss draft energy legislation, but no bill was filed nor action taken. Needless to say, we will continue to work with key stakeholders to find a constructive solution to this important matter.
Turning to Page 7 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In April, FERC issued a supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPR, on electric transmission return on equity incentive adder for participation in a Regional Transmission Organization, or RTO. As you may recall, under the NPR, the RTO incentive adder would be removed for utilities that have been members of an RTO for 3 years or more, like Ameren Illinois and ATXI. 
We have been very clear that we disagree with FERC's proposed recommendation in this matter for a number of reasons and recently filed comments strongly posing the removal of the adder. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this matter as the FERC is under no time line to issue decision. 
In addition, in June, the FERC issued an order establishing a joint federal state task force on electric transmission. This order establishes a first-of-its-kind task force to explore with state commissions transmission-related issues, including how to plan and pay for transmission facilities, recognizing that federal and state regulators share authority over different aspects of these transmission-related issues. The task force will be comprised of the FERC commissioners and representatives nominated by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners from 10 state commissions. The first public meeting is expected to be held this fall. 
Also last month, the FERC issued an advanced notice of proposed rule-making related to regional transmission planning and cost allocation processes, including critical long-term planning for anticipated future generation needs. We continue to assess the matters raised in the advanced NPR and expect to file comments with the FERC this fall. Again, we are unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of this matter as FERC is under no time line to issue a decision. 
Speaking of planning for future transmission needs, please turn to Page 8. As I discussed on the call in May, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates, and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions, among other things. 
Under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $30 billion of future transmission investment in the MISO footprint. Further, MISO's Future 3 scenario resulted in an 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039. Under this scenario, MISO estimates approximately $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint would be needed.
It is clear that investment in transmission is going to play a critical role in the clean energy transition, and we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. We continue to work with MISO and other key stakeholders and believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 are likely to be included in this year's MISO's transmission planning process, which is currently scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, it is possible the process could go into the first quarter of 2022.
Moving now to Page 9 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment related to the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of its first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. In January, Ameren Missouri acquired a second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in Northwestern Missouri. I am pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, the Atchison Renewable Energy Center is now in service. With both facilities now operating, it marks a key milestone as we continue to transition our energy portfolio towards a cleaner energy future.
Turning now to Page 10 and an update on Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. As we've previously discussed, during its return to full power as part of its 24th refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Callaway experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted and the decision was made to rewind the generator stator and rotor in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service.
I am pleased to report that the generator project was executed very well and that the energy center returned to service on August 4. The completion of this project positions Callaway for a sustainable long-term future. The cost of the capital project was approximately $60 million. As we have said previously, the insurance claims for the capital project and replacement power have been accepted by our insurance carrier, which will mitigate the impact of this outage for our customers. In addition, we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results.
Turning to Page 11. We remain focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision leading the way to a sustainable energy future.
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively, and is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement in limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful.
Finally, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters. And our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long-term performance, diversity, equity and inclusion and progress towards a cleaner, sustainable energy future. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com.
Turning now to Page 12. Looking ahead, we have a strong sustainable growth proposition, which will be driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders and making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new reasonably beneficial transmission projects, including the potential road map of MISO transmission projects I discussed earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable our country's transition to a cleaner energy future. 
In addition, we expect to see greater focus from a policy perspective on infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector. Our outlook for 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they would also create thousands of jobs for our local economies.
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner energy future in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.
Moving to Page 13. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. In February, we issued our 5-year growth outlook, which included a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth was primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers.
Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file this year with the Missouri PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of these planned renewable investments. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.
That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us today.
I will now turn the call over to Michael."

Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest s",1360,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share compared to $0.98 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, decreased $0.18 per share, driven primarily by a change in seasonal electric rate design, resulting from the March 2020 rate order, which provided for winter rates in May and summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020. The rate design change decreased earnings $0.19 per share and is not expected to impact full year results.
Earnings were also impacted by the timing of income tax expense, which decreased earnings $0.03 per share and is not expected to impact full year results. As Warner mentioned, during the quarter, we remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management and have been able to largely maintain the level of operations and maintenance savings this quarter that we experienced during the year-ago period, which was significantly affected by COVID-19.
The increase in other operations and maintenance expenses, which decreased earnings $0.02 per share, was primarily due to more favorable market returns on the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance in the year ago period.
As you can see, we have worked hard this year to control costs where we can. The amortization of deferred expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage and higher interest expense primarily due to higher long-term debt balances outstanding also decreased earnings $0.02 per share. These factors were partially offset by an increase in earnings of $0.05 per share due to increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation, eligible for plant-in-service accounting and the Renewable Energy Standard Rate Adjustment Mechanism, or RESRAM. 
Higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately $0.04 per share, largely due to continued economic recovery in this year's second quarter compared to the unfavorable impacts of COVID-19 in the year ago period. We've included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter. Overall weather-normalized sales are largely consistent with our expectations outlined in our call in February, as we still expect total sales to be up approximately 2% in 2021 compared to 2020.
Moving to other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings declined $0.03 per share over year, which reflected the absence of the prior year benefit from the May 2020 FERC order addressing the allowed base return on equity, which more than offset earnings on increased infrastructure investment. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas decreased $0.01 per share. Increased delivery service rates that became effective in late January 2021 were offset by a change in rate design, which is not expected to impact full year results. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.02 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking.
Ameren Parent and Other results were also up $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year results. And finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding.
Before moving on, I'll touch on year-to-date sales trends for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to the Illinois residential customers decreased 1%. And weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers increased 2.5% and 2%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.
Turning to Page 16. Now I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong first half in 2021 and as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February.
I will note that our third quarter earnings comparison will be positively impacted by approximately $0.19 per share due to the seasonal electric rate design change effective in 2021 at Ameren Missouri that we discussed earlier.
Moving now to Page 17 for an update on regulatory matters. Starting with Ameren Missouri, as you recall, on March 31st, we filed for a $299 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio, and a September 30, 2021 estimated rate base of $10 billion. Intervenor testimony will be filed in early September with rebuttal testimony on October 15. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late November. 
In addition, on March 31, we filed for a $9 million natural gas revenue increase with the Missouri PSC. The request includes a 9.8% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $310 million. A Missouri PSC decision in both rate reviews is expected by early February with new rates expected to be effective by late February.
Moving to Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $54 million base rate increase compared to our request of a $60 million base rate increase. An ICC decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2022.
Moving to Page 18. In early June, Ameren published a Sustainability Financing Framework, becoming one of the first utilities in the nation to do so. Under this framework, Ameren and its issuing subsidiaries may elect to finance or refinance new and existing projects that have environmental or social benefits through green bonds, social bonds, sustainability bonds, green loans or other financial instruments. 
Given the amount of investment activity at Ameren and its utility subsidiaries are pursuing that have environmental or social benefits, we expect to be a relatively frequent issuer under our Sustainability Financing Framework. In June, both Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois issued green bonds consistent with this new financing framework. More information about this framework is available at amereninvestors.com. 
Turning to Page 19 for a financing and liquidity update. We continue to feel very good about our liquidity and financial position. As I just mentioned in June, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois issued green bonds with the net proceeds to be allocated to sustainable projects, meeting certain eligibility requirements under the Sustainability Financing Framework. Additional debt issuances are outlined on this page. 
Further, earlier this year, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sale agreement for proceeds of approximately $115 million. In order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expected to issue a total of approximately $150 million of common equity in 2021 under the at-the-market or ATM program established in May. This is consistent with prior guidance provided in February and May. And to date, approximately $122 million of equity has been issued through this program. Our $750 million ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs through 2023. Finally, Ameren's available liquidity as of July 30 was approximately $1.8 billion.
Lastly, turning to Page 20. We're well positioned to continue to execute on our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have a strong total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Really, what you see there is our plan as it stands today is to use our low-cost, reliable coal fleet as a foundation to bring in more renewables over time and provide reliable power to our customers. 
But as Warner said, to the extent situations change and require adjustments to this plan, it could be that securitization would be a very good tool to have in our toolbox to perhaps make this transition more swiftly and do it in a way that provides affordable rates to our customers. So I think a real good tool to have in the toolbox, but again, not needed today as we look at this Integrated Resource Plan."

And certainly, MISO being right in the middle of the country is going to play an integral role. And obviously, we have a big footprint in MISO. 
And so as we've looked at it, MISO has really done a fine job, from our perspective, of really looking out to see what some of those long-range transmission projects might be. No, they're not definitive yet, but they laid out a real nice plan for us to really think about and work with key stakeholders. And that's exactly what we have been doing, working with the other key stakeholders and say, ""Okay, what are these projects that we need to move forward with."" I would say MISO is still in the middle of that process with us and so many others. 
And as you know, they'll take that long-range plan that we outlined in our slides, and they're going to put that and include aspects of that, of that thinking, in MISO's transmission expansion plan, which is a process that we'll, hopefully, see move forward by the end of this year. So beyond that, I would say the conversations and analysis continues. 
The only thing I will say is that we believe we're well positioned to execute many of those projects. And we believe if you look at that Future 1, that some of those projects are going to likely be in this MTEP that comes out here at the end of this year or perhaps maybe into early next year because those are some no regrets projects that are in there that we need to move forward on, not just in the Midwest but for our country, so we can move forward on this clean energy transition. So nothing specific yet. But needless to say, there is a lot of work going around with the teams to try and move forward on this important aspect of the clean energy transition. So stay tuned. More to come."

One of the questions, I guess, that sort of comes up here is as you are aware that in Missouri there is this clean energy line. I forgot the exact name, but you're familiar with it. It's the one that's been held up by challenges to it. It seems like forever. It's not your line. It's more like a merchant line. 
But in general, how should we think about once MISO sort of identifies these, et cetera, the -- bringing those -- assuming that you guys get a good line of sight on opportunities for yourselves, how should we think about siting or permitting, et cetera, with respect to some of these projects in the context of that example that I've mentioned versus some of the add-ons and stuff that don't seem to have as much in the way of hurdles? Do you follow what I'm saying?"

And then Marty, you can talk about how the Grain Belt project has been incorporated, in some respects, or at least comment upon in our Integrated Resource Plan. But just big picture, whether it's the Grain Belt or any transmission, obviously, permitting and siting is an important aspect of transmission. I think this is why you're seeing FERC and others, state commissions and others and legislators, take a very careful look at this because we recognize that that's an important aspect of getting any of these major transmission projects done. And some significant transmission projects are going to have to be done to -- for us to affect the clean energy transition. 
And so one of the things I will tell you, we work very hard as a company at this, and that is being very thoughtful and reaching out with stakeholders and the communities early and often to talk about the needs for the transmission line, but also how we can work with those stakeholders and those communities so we can get the permitting and siting done in a timely fashion. Shawn Schukar and his team have done that for years and years now. And this is why you've seen the success that we had in the last multi-value projects that MISO did almost a decade ago. Now why those projects were so successful is because a lot of work was done on the front end, so we could execute on the back end. As we look forward to any future transmission project, that's exactly what we will continue to do. 
Now Grain Belt, obviously, as you rightfully said, that is not our project. But certainly, it's something that has received a lot of attention in Missouri and otherwise. And so Marty, I want you to comment a little bit about some of the things that we've been looking at in terms of Grain Belt as part of our integrated resource planning process."

So I mentioned our Integrated Resource Plan we filed last fall. And again, back on that Slide 25 where we depict our plan, that's really our preferred plan from the Integrated Resource Plan as we move forward. 
But as we develop that plan, we looked at a number of scenarios in terms of the path forward to get to what we believe to be the most reliable and affordable path forward. And in these scenarios, certainly, we evaluated utilization of Grain Belt as well as many other kinds of scenarios. And where we stand right now in terms of our Integrated Resource Plan, as you all know, we did put out a request for proposals last year on various resources that might be available to fulfill our needs. 
Obviously, our ambition is to acquire 1,200 megawatts of renewables, wind, solar, through 2025. And we do still expect to file later this year with the PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of those planned projects. But as we go through broadly, looking at just the next 5 years but even beyond, certainly, we'll continue to consider all options, including utilization of Grain Belt as we think about fulfilling those needs. 
In terms of your question, Paul, I think you were asking about large-scale transmission, smaller-scale transmission. As we go about looking at the various resources that might fulfill our needs, certainly, we work closely with Shawn and his team and think very much about the transmission investments that will be required to facilitate investment in any of those projects, whether wind or solar. And it's an important part of our consideration as we think about the resources that will be most affordable for our customers."

Look, we're encouraged that the federal regulators and state regulators are not only talking, but trying to find a path forward. Because as I've said now several times on this call, the transmission is going to be a critical component of getting these major transmission projects done for our country. And so as we all know, the federal regulators, FERC, and the state regulators, their jurisdictions or at least the issues can sometimes overlap. 
And so things that are really important all the time is how we can sort through permitting and siting. And clearly, another issue around transmission projects, especially these regional projects, which we're talking about in large part with these MISO projects, how you allocate the costs fairly inappropriately. 
And so what I think, Julien, what will happen with some of these conversations and what we hope to have happen is that there's a better understanding of the issues, perhaps a bit of a meeting of the minds, and so we can start moving forward in a more timely fashion than we might have otherwise had. 
And of course, when we're making the types of investments that we are making, then we want to have, let's say, greater levels of regulatory certainty. And so these things, I think, will be helpful. I'm not suggesting that this task force will solve it all. But I think what it will do will provide a great forum for stakeholders, not just regulators, companies like ours and others, to come to the table and say, ""Okay, here are things that really matter, and here's how we can lean further forward in the transmission space,"" which we, needless to say, strongly support -- the need to lean forward further, faster in the transmission space."

So number one, Martin a moment ago was talking about how we proceed to the integrated resource planning process. And he also said, a key element of the projects that we look at and select really look very hard at transmission, interconnections, where developers may be in the queue, to try and move things forward. And that's frankly how we were successful in moving in a very thoughtful and timely fashion with our 700 megawatts of wind generation.
So what we're seeing there, this is all part of our due diligence. Are you seeing sort of a backup? Yes. Are you seeing now that organizations like MISO are looking beyond just today, looking to the future with this long-term resource planning effort? The answer to that is yes, and that's why we support it. It will, we believe, help alleviate, in the future, if you look sort of a decade out, which is really when you think about transmission projects, look just for tomorrow, you look, say, a decade out, what are the things that we need to be doing today to position ourselves for success in the future? So we're encouraged by that.
Are we seeing increases in prices or challenges? Well, it's premature to say that. We're still going through the process, still talking to developers, working with MISO and others. But the only thing I do know is that we have, I would say, unique expertise to provide the analysis, but also unique expertise to execute these important transmission projects, not just for our projects, but frankly, the projects that will have regional and, frankly, countrywide positive implications to move forward to clean energy transition. 
So I don't know if, Julien, that answered your specific question. This is certainly an important aspect of what we're seeing, but this is not new to us. And I'll finish with this, too. The other encouraging thing that we are seeing is that, in particular, in this instance, MISO is working with the other regional transmission organizations, in this particular instance, SPP, to try and coordinate even better some of these transmission projects and needs. So you don't have surprises when it comes time to try and move forward with a particular renewal energy project. That, too, is encouraging. And we look forward to the results of that collaborative effort from those 2 organizations. And I'm sure PJM and MISO will be having similar conversations sometime on those."

But the process itself, which ultimately goes before the Board of Directors of MISO, will be really in the fourth quarter at the earliest, as I said in my prepared remarks. That could go into the first quarter of next year. But that would be probably, I would say, part of the next data point, if you will. But not -- but to be clear, as I said before, a lot of work is going on today to try and make sure that that is going as smoothly as possible. But that's what I would be looking for a little bit later. Michael, do you have a point there?"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'll begin with the statement that I've been making for quite some time now.

This morning, I'll begin with the statement that I've been making for quite some time now. Simply put, our team continues to effectively execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses, which includes making significant investments in our energy infrastructure to enhance the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion. These investments, coupled with our continued focus on disciplined cost management, are delivering significant value to our customers communities and shareholders.
Moving now to our second quarter earnings results. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share. Our earnings were down $0.18 per share from the same time period in 2020, primarily due to a change in the seasonal electric link design at Ameren Missouri that reduced earnings $0.19 per share. The impact of this change in rate design will reverse in the third quarter of 2021 and is not expected to impact full year results. Michael will discuss the other key drivers of our second quarter earnings results a bit later.
Due to the continued strong execution of our strategy, I am pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver within our 2021 earnings guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share.
Speaking of the execution of our strategy, let's move to Page 5, where we reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure with a long-term benefit of our customers.
As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 6 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments, including wind generation at Ameren Missouri, which I'll discuss later. These investments are delivering value to our customers. As I said before, our energy grid is stronger, more resilient, and more secure because of the investments we are making in all 4 business segments. 
Consistent with the Missouri Smart Energy Plan, we have made significant investments to harden the energy grid, which has reduced outages and installed nearly 300,000 electric smart meters for customers. These smart meters will help customers better manage their usage and control their overall energy costs. 
In Illinois, we continue to execute on our electric distribution and gas monetization action plans. The plans include investments to strengthen electric power poles, replace gas transmission pipelines and compression coupled steel mains as well as to implement new efficiency measures, including mobile-enhanced communications and assessment capabilities for our crews. These improvements, along with our investments in outage detection technology, are resulting in improvements in system reliability and millions of dollars in savings for customers. 
Moving now to regulatory matters. In late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenues and a $9 million increase in annual natural gas revenues with the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
In our Illinois Electric business, we requested a $60 million base rate increase in our required annual electric distribution rate filing. These proceedings are all moving along on schedule. We will be able to provide you information on these proceedings as they develop later this summer and into the fall.
Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management, including retaining many of the cost savings that we realized in 2020 due to the actions we took to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
Moving to Page 6 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Starting in Missouri, in May, the Missouri Legislature passed a bill, allowing for securitization in the state. This constructive legislation, which was signed by Governor Parson in July, gives us another important regulatory tool to facilitate our transition to a cleaner energy future in a cost-effective manner for our customers. 
However, as we have stated in the past, our robust Integrated Resource Plan does not rely on securitization to be successful. Our flexible and responsible plan, which includes approximately $8 billion of investments in renewable energy through 2040, the retirement of all of our coal-fired energy centers, and extending the life of our carbon-free Callaway Nuclear Energy Center focuses on getting the energy we provide to our customers as clean as we can, as fast as we can without compromising on reliability, customer affordability, and the evolution of new clean energy technologies. And as I will touch on later, I am pleased to say that we are already taking steps to implement this important plan for our customers, the State of Missouri, and our country. 
Moving now to Illinois. Last month, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved Ameren Illinois’ electric vehicle charging program. Under this program, we're able to support the development of a network of charging infrastructure in Central and Southern Illinois as well as implement special time-based delivery service rates and other incentives to help encourage the use of electric vehicles. We are excited about this new program because it will drive greater electrification of the transportation sector as well as help the state of Illinois move towards its clean energy goals. 
Moving to Illinois legislative efforts, as many of you know, we have been working to enhance the regulatory framework for our Illinois Electric business. The performance-based regulatory framework in place today has delivered strong value for customers and shareholders over the years. However, the framework is scheduled to sunset in 2022. As a result, we have been working with key stakeholders to develop constructive long-term regulatory policies that support important investments in energy infrastructure, while enabling us to earn fair returns from those investments.
As you know, throughout the regular legislative session, which ended late May, we advocated for the Downstate Clean Energy Affordability Act, which would have largely extended the existing framework until 2032, while putting in place provisions that would set the Ameren Illinois electric distribution ROE at the national average.
At the same time, many other energy-related legislative proposals from other stakeholders were proposed during the legislative session, including proposals from Governor Pritzker, labor and environmental groups, to address the potential closure of nuclear plants in the states, Illinois Clean Energy Transition and the electric distribution framework going forward. For months, stakeholders have been in discussion seeking to find an appropriate compromise to all these proposals.
While progress is made in these issues, the regular legislative session ended on May 31, with no energy legislation being put before the Senate or House of Representatives for a vote. A special session was called in mid-June to further discuss draft energy legislation, but no bill was filed nor action taken. Needless to say, we will continue to work with key stakeholders to find a constructive solution to this important matter.
Turning to Page 7 for an update on FERC regulatory matters. In April, FERC issued a supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPR, on electric transmission return on equity incentive adder for participation in a Regional Transmission Organization, or RTO. As you may recall, under the NPR, the RTO incentive adder would be removed for utilities that have been members of an RTO for 3 years or more, like Ameren Illinois and ATXI. 
We have been very clear that we disagree with FERC's proposed recommendation in this matter for a number of reasons and recently filed comments strongly posing the removal of the adder. Of course, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or timing of this matter as the FERC is under no time line to issue decision. 
In addition, in June, the FERC issued an order establishing a joint federal state task force on electric transmission. This order establishes a first-of-its-kind task force to explore with state commissions transmission-related issues, including how to plan and pay for transmission facilities, recognizing that federal and state regulators share authority over different aspects of these transmission-related issues. The task force will be comprised of the FERC commissioners and representatives nominated by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners from 10 state commissions. The first public meeting is expected to be held this fall. 
Also last month, the FERC issued an advanced notice of proposed rule-making related to regional transmission planning and cost allocation processes, including critical long-term planning for anticipated future generation needs. We continue to assess the matters raised in the advanced NPR and expect to file comments with the FERC this fall. Again, we are unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of this matter as FERC is under no time line to issue a decision. 
Speaking of planning for future transmission needs, please turn to Page 8. As I discussed on the call in May, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates, and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions, among other things. 
Under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $30 billion of future transmission investment in the MISO footprint. Further, MISO's Future 3 scenario resulted in an 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039. Under this scenario, MISO estimates approximately $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint would be needed.
It is clear that investment in transmission is going to play a critical role in the clean energy transition, and we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. We continue to work with MISO and other key stakeholders and believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 are likely to be included in this year's MISO's transmission planning process, which is currently scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. However, it is possible the process could go into the first quarter of 2022.
Moving now to Page 9 for an update on our $1.1 billion wind generation investment related to the acquisition of 700 megawatts of new wind generation at 2 sites in Missouri. Ameren Missouri closed on the acquisition of its first wind energy center, a 400-megawatt project in Northeast Missouri in December. In January, Ameren Missouri acquired a second wind generation project, the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in Northwestern Missouri. I am pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, the Atchison Renewable Energy Center is now in service. With both facilities now operating, it marks a key milestone as we continue to transition our energy portfolio towards a cleaner energy future.
Turning now to Page 10 and an update on Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. As we've previously discussed, during its return to full power as part of its 24th refueling and maintenance outage in late December 2020, Callaway experienced a nonnuclear operating issue related to its generator. A thorough investigation of this matter was conducted and the decision was made to rewind the generator stator and rotor in order to safely and sustainably return the energy center to service.
I am pleased to report that the generator project was executed very well and that the energy center returned to service on August 4. The completion of this project positions Callaway for a sustainable long-term future. The cost of the capital project was approximately $60 million. As we have said previously, the insurance claims for the capital project and replacement power have been accepted by our insurance carrier, which will mitigate the impact of this outage for our customers. In addition, we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on Ameren's financial results.
Turning to Page 11. We remain focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision leading the way to a sustainable energy future.
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively, and is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement in limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful.
Finally, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters. And our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long-term performance, diversity, equity and inclusion and progress towards a cleaner, sustainable energy future. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com.
Turning now to Page 12. Looking ahead, we have a strong sustainable growth proposition, which will be driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders and making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new reasonably beneficial transmission projects, including the potential road map of MISO transmission projects I discussed earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable our country's transition to a cleaner energy future. 
In addition, we expect to see greater focus from a policy perspective on infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector. Our outlook for 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they would also create thousands of jobs for our local economies.
Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner energy future in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.
Moving to Page 13. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2021 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. In February, we issued our 5-year growth outlook, which included a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth was primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers.
Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file this year with the Missouri PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of these planned renewable investments. I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.
That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a solid dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us today.
I will now turn the call over to Michael."
373264,1673949996,2392265,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2021",2021-08-06,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share compared to $0.98 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest s",1360,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2021 earnings of $0.80 per share compared to $0.98 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, decreased $0.18 per share, driven primarily by a change in seasonal electric rate design, resulting from the March 2020 rate order, which provided for winter rates in May and summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020. The rate design change decreased earnings $0.19 per share and is not expected to impact full year results.
Earnings were also impacted by the timing of income tax expense, which decreased earnings $0.03 per share and is not expected to impact full year results. As Warner mentioned, during the quarter, we remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management and have been able to largely maintain the level of operations and maintenance savings this quarter that we experienced during the year-ago period, which was significantly affected by COVID-19.
The increase in other operations and maintenance expenses, which decreased earnings $0.02 per share, was primarily due to more favorable market returns on the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance in the year ago period.
As you can see, we have worked hard this year to control costs where we can. The amortization of deferred expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage and higher interest expense primarily due to higher long-term debt balances outstanding also decreased earnings $0.02 per share. These factors were partially offset by an increase in earnings of $0.05 per share due to increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation, eligible for plant-in-service accounting and the Renewable Energy Standard Rate Adjustment Mechanism, or RESRAM. 
Higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately $0.04 per share, largely due to continued economic recovery in this year's second quarter compared to the unfavorable impacts of COVID-19 in the year ago period. We've included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter. Overall weather-normalized sales are largely consistent with our expectations outlined in our call in February, as we still expect total sales to be up approximately 2% in 2021 compared to 2020.
Moving to other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings declined $0.03 per share over year, which reflected the absence of the prior year benefit from the May 2020 FERC order addressing the allowed base return on equity, which more than offset earnings on increased infrastructure investment. Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas decreased $0.01 per share. Increased delivery service rates that became effective in late January 2021 were offset by a change in rate design, which is not expected to impact full year results. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased $0.02 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking.
Ameren Parent and Other results were also up $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year results. And finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding.
Before moving on, I'll touch on year-to-date sales trends for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to the Illinois residential customers decreased 1%. And weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers increased 2.5% and 2%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.
Turning to Page 16. Now I'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong first half in 2021 and as Warner stated, we continue to expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February.
I will note that our third quarter earnings comparison will be positively impacted by approximately $0.19 per share due to the seasonal electric rate design change effective in 2021 at Ameren Missouri that we discussed earlier.
Moving now to Page 17 for an update on regulatory matters. Starting with Ameren Missouri, as you recall, on March 31st, we filed for a $299 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio, and a September 30, 2021 estimated rate base of $10 billion. Intervenor testimony will be filed in early September with rebuttal testimony on October 15. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late November. 
In addition, on March 31, we filed for a $9 million natural gas revenue increase with the Missouri PSC. The request includes a 9.8% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021, estimated rate base of $310 million. A Missouri PSC decision in both rate reviews is expected by early February with new rates expected to be effective by late February.
Moving to Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $54 million base rate increase compared to our request of a $60 million base rate increase. An ICC decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2022.
Moving to Page 18. In early June, Ameren published a Sustainability Financing Framework, becoming one of the first utilities in the nation to do so. Under this framework, Ameren and its issuing subsidiaries may elect to finance or refinance new and existing projects that have environmental or social benefits through green bonds, social bonds, sustainability bonds, green loans or other financial instruments. 
Given the amount of investment activity at Ameren and its utility subsidiaries are pursuing that have environmental or social benefits, we expect to be a relatively frequent issuer under our Sustainability Financing Framework. In June, both Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois issued green bonds consistent with this new financing framework. More information about this framework is available at amereninvestors.com. 
Turning to Page 19 for a financing and liquidity update. We continue to feel very good about our liquidity and financial position. As I just mentioned in June, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois issued green bonds with the net proceeds to be allocated to sustainable projects, meeting certain eligibility requirements under the Sustainability Financing Framework. Additional debt issuances are outlined on this page. 
Further, earlier this year, we physically settled the remaining shares under our forward equity sale agreement for proceeds of approximately $115 million. In order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expected to issue a total of approximately $150 million of common equity in 2021 under the at-the-market or ATM program established in May. This is consistent with prior guidance provided in February and May. And to date, approximately $122 million of equity has been issued through this program. Our $750 million ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs through 2023. Finally, Ameren's available liquidity as of July 30 was approximately $1.8 billion.
Lastly, turning to Page 20. We're well positioned to continue to execute on our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have a strong total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We outlined on Slide 25 our transition over time. It's the Integrated Resource Plan that we filed last fall. And as Warner mentioned, that plan and the execution of that plan were not dependent upon utilization of securitization. Really, what you see there is our plan as it stands today is to use our low-cost, reliable coal fleet as a foundation to bring in more renewables over time and provide reliable power to our customers. 
But as Warner said, to the extent situations change and require adjustments to this plan, it could be that securitization would be a very good tool to have in our toolbox to perhaps make this transition more swiftly and do it in a way that provides affordable rates to our customers. So I think a real good tool to have in the toolbox, but again, not needed today as we look at this Integrated Resource Plan."

Look, as we discussed really on our last quarter call and as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we really see transmission investment as being critical for our country's transition to a cleaner energy future. And certainly, MISO being right in the middle of the country is going to play an integral role. And obviously, we have a big footprint in MISO. 
And so as we've looked at it, MISO has really done a fine job, from our perspective, of really looking out to see what some of those long-range transmission projects might be. No, they're not definitive yet, but they laid out a real nice plan for us to really think about and work with key stakeholders. And that's exactly what we have been doing, working with the other key stakeholders and say, ""Okay, what are these projects that we need to move forward with."" I would say MISO is still in the middle of that process with us and so many others. 
And as you know, they'll take that long-range plan that we outlined in our slides, and they're going to put that and include aspects of that, of that thinking, in MISO's transmission expansion plan, which is a process that we'll, hopefully, see move forward by the end of this year. So beyond that, I would say the conversations and analysis continues. 
The only thing I will say is that we believe we're well positioned to execute many of those projects. And we believe if you look at that Future 1, that some of those projects are going to likely be in this MTEP that comes out here at the end of this year or perhaps maybe into early next year because those are some no regrets projects that are in there that we need to move forward on, not just in the Midwest but for our country, so we can move forward on this clean energy transition. So nothing specific yet. But needless to say, there is a lot of work going around with the teams to try and move forward on this important aspect of the clean energy transition. So stay tuned. More to come."

One of the questions, I guess, that sort of comes up here is as you are aware that in Missouri there is this clean energy line. I forgot the exact name, but you're familiar with it. It's the one that's been held up by challenges to it. It seems like forever. It's not your line. It's more like a merchant line. 
But in general, how should we think about once MISO sort of identifies these, et cetera, the -- bringing those -- assuming that you guys get a good line of sight on opportunities for yourselves, how should we think about siting or permitting, et cetera, with respect to some of these projects in the context of that example that I've mentioned versus some of the add-ons and stuff that don't seem to have as much in the way of hurdles? Do you follow what I'm saying?"

And then Marty, you can talk about how the Grain Belt project has been incorporated, in some respects, or at least comment upon in our Integrated Resource Plan. But just big picture, whether it's the Grain Belt or any transmission, obviously, permitting and siting is an important aspect of transmission. I think this is why you're seeing FERC and others, state commissions and others and legislators, take a very careful look at this because we recognize that that's an important aspect of getting any of these major transmission projects done. And some significant transmission projects are going to have to be done to -- for us to affect the clean energy transition. 
And so one of the things I will tell you, we work very hard as a company at this, and that is being very thoughtful and reaching out with stakeholders and the communities early and often to talk about the needs for the transmission line, but also how we can work with those stakeholders and those communities so we can get the permitting and siting done in a timely fashion. Shawn Schukar and his team have done that for years and years now. And this is why you've seen the success that we had in the last multi-value projects that MISO did almost a decade ago. Now why those projects were so successful is because a lot of work was done on the front end, so we could execute on the back end. As we look forward to any future transmission project, that's exactly what we will continue to do. 
Now Grain Belt, obviously, as you rightfully said, that is not our project. But certainly, it's something that has received a lot of attention in Missouri and otherwise. And so Marty, I want you to comment a little bit about some of the things that we've been looking at in terms of Grain Belt as part of our integrated resource planning process."

So I mentioned our Integrated Resource Plan we filed last fall. And again, back on that Slide 25 where we depict our plan, that's really our preferred plan from the Integrated Resource Plan as we move forward. 
But as we develop that plan, we looked at a number of scenarios in terms of the path forward to get to what we believe to be the most reliable and affordable path forward. And in these scenarios, certainly, we evaluated utilization of Grain Belt as well as many other kinds of scenarios. And where we stand right now in terms of our Integrated Resource Plan, as you all know, we did put out a request for proposals last year on various resources that might be available to fulfill our needs. 
Obviously, our ambition is to acquire 1,200 megawatts of renewables, wind, solar, through 2025. And we do still expect to file later this year with the PSC for certificates of convenience and necessity for a portion of those planned projects. But as we go through broadly, looking at just the next 5 years but even beyond, certainly, we'll continue to consider all options, including utilization of Grain Belt as we think about fulfilling those needs. 
In terms of your question, Paul, I think you were asking about large-scale transmission, smaller-scale transmission. As we go about looking at the various resources that might fulfill our needs, certainly, we work closely with Shawn and his team and think very much about the transmission investments that will be required to facilitate investment in any of those projects, whether wind or solar. And it's an important part of our consideration as we think about the resources that will be most affordable for our customers."

Look, we're encouraged that the federal regulators and state regulators are not only talking, but trying to find a path forward. Because as I've said now several times on this call, the transmission is going to be a critical component of getting these major transmission projects done for our country. And so as we all know, the federal regulators, FERC, and the state regulators, their jurisdictions or at least the issues can sometimes overlap. 
And so things that are really important all the time is how we can sort through permitting and siting. And clearly, another issue around transmission projects, especially these regional projects, which we're talking about in large part with these MISO projects, how you allocate the costs fairly inappropriately. 
And so what I think, Julien, what will happen with some of these conversations and what we hope to have happen is that there's a better understanding of the issues, perhaps a bit of a meeting of the minds, and so we can start moving forward in a more timely fashion than we might have otherwise had. 
And of course, when we're making the types of investments that we are making, then we want to have, let's say, greater levels of regulatory certainty. And so these things, I think, will be helpful. I'm not suggesting that this task force will solve it all. But I think what it will do will provide a great forum for stakeholders, not just regulators, companies like ours and others, to come to the table and say, ""Okay, here are things that really matter, and here's how we can lean further forward in the transmission space,"" which we, needless to say, strongly support -- the need to lean forward further, faster in the transmission space."

How are you thinking about transmission interconnect delays, costs, et cetera, just as you think about your own efforts? And then what are you observing regionally? Again, clearly, the need for transmission is principally evidenced by the elevated cost, the interconnection costs and that translating to a relatively stagnant trajectory of processing this queue. Are you seeing issues with your own projects? And then more broadly, are you seeing these elevated costs with other developers in and around your service territories? If you can elaborate a little bit."

So number one, Martin a moment ago was talking about how we proceed to the integrated resource planning process. And he also said, a key element of the projects that we look at and select really look very hard at transmission, interconnections, where developers may be in the queue, to try and move things forward. And that's frankly how we were successful in moving in a very thoughtful and timely fashion with our 700 megawatts of wind generation.
So what we're seeing there, this is all part of our due diligence. Are you seeing sort of a backup? Yes. Are you seeing now that organizations like MISO are looking beyond just today, looking to the future with this long-term resource planning effort? The answer to that is yes, and that's why we support it. It will, we believe, help alleviate, in the future, if you look sort of a decade out, which is really when you think about transmission projects, look just for tomorrow, you look, say, a decade out, what are the things that we need to be doing today to position ourselves for success in the future? So we're encouraged by that.
Are we seeing increases in prices or challenges? Well, it's premature to say that. We're still going through the process, still talking to developers, working with MISO and others. But the only thing I do know is that we have, I would say, unique expertise to provide the analysis, but also unique expertise to execute these important transmission projects, not just for our projects, but frankly, the projects that will have regional and, frankly, countrywide positive implications to move forward to clean energy transition. 
So I don't know if, Julien, that answered your specific question. This is certainly an important aspect of what we're seeing, but this is not new to us. And I'll finish with this, too. The other encouraging thing that we are seeing is that, in particular, in this instance, MISO is working with the other regional transmission organizations, in this particular instance, SPP, to try and coordinate even better some of these transmission projects and needs. So you don't have surprises when it comes time to try and move forward with a particular renewal energy project. That, too, is encouraging. And we look forward to the results of that collaborative effort from those 2 organizations. And I'm sure PJM and MISO will be having similar conversations sometime on those."

So we're excited about that opportunity to be able to execute some of those. 
So what's the next thing to look at? Look, I think that the MTEP, the MISO Transmission Expansion Planning process, that will be really sort of your next visible sign. You'll probably see -- there may be some information out there towards the end of the third quarter into the fourth. But the process itself, which ultimately goes before the Board of Directors of MISO, will be really in the fourth quarter at the earliest, as I said in my prepared remarks.

The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of our customers. 
As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments. These investments are delivering value to our customers. As I said before, our energy grade is stronger, more resilient and more secure because of the investments we are making in all 4 business segments. 
As we head into the winter months, I'd like to highlight some of the value these investments have created in Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri natural gas businesses. Our natural gas transmission and distribution investments are focused on upgrading and modernizing gas main and equipment infrastructure, all the strength in safety and reliability of our system for our customers. 
Being mindful of the gas distribution issues experienced in the industry in the past, I will note that our Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri natural gas distribution systems are comprised almost entirely a plastic and protected coated steel pipelines. There is no cast iron pipe in our systems, and we expect to eliminate all unprotected steel pipe by the end of this year. 
These investments are just another example of how we are putting our customers at the center of our strategy. Moving now to regulatory matters. In late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase and annual electric service revenues and a $9 million increase in annual natural gas service revenues with the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
In our Illinois Electric business, we have requested a $59 million base rate increase our required annual electric distribution rate filing. These proceedings are moving along on schedule. Michael will provide more information on these proceedings a bit later. 
Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on consumers improvement and disciplined cost management, including maintaining many of the cost savings that we realized in 2020 due to the actions we took to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. 
Moving to Page 6 and the second pillar of our strategy: enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Over the years, we have been successful in executing this element of our strategy by delivering value to our customers for our investments in energy infrastructure and through extensive collaboration with key stakeholders in all of our regulatory jurisdictions. 
I am very pleased to report that these efforts paid off again in the third quarter when the Illinois legislature passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA, which is later signed by Governor. CEJA is a constructive piece of legislation that addresses the key objectives that we felt were important for our customers and the communities we serve. It will enable us to continue to make important infrastructure investments to enhance the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid for a new forward-thinking regulatory framework. 
It will also give us the ability to earn fair returns on those investments as well as enable us to invest in 2 solar and/or battery storage pilot projects. CEJA allows for an electric utility to opt in to a multiyear rate plan effective for 4 years beginning in 2024. 
We are currently working with key stockholders and will continue to over the course of 2022, to establish specific procedures, including performance metrics to implement this legislation, subject to finalizing key aspects of this rate-making framework, we anticipate filing a multiyear rate plan by mid-January 2023. 
Michael will discuss this constructive piece of legislation in more in a moment. Shifting now to the federal level, where important energy legislation continues to be discussed. Needless to say, the situation around federal legislation remains fluid and ever changing. One thing that remains constant is our strong support for clean energy transition tax incentives between wind and solar production tax credits, transmission and storage investment tax credits as well as direct pay and normalization opt-out provisions. 
We also continue to strongly support significant funding for research, design and development for new clean energy technologies, electrification transportation sector and grid resiliency. We support these important legislative initiatives because we strongly believe they will deliver significant long-term benefits to our customers, communities and country. 
We will continue to work with key stakeholders, along with our industry colleagues to advance constructive federal energy and economic policies that will help us transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion. 
Speaking of our transition to our cleaner energy future, please turn to Page 7 in the discussion of future transmission investment needs. As we have discussed with you in the past, MISO completed a study outlining the potential road map of transmission projects through 2039. Taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions, among other things. 
On MISO's future 1 scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2039 and MISO estimates approximately $30 billion, the future transmission investment would be necessary in the MISO footprint. 
Under its future tree scenario, which resulted in an 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $100 million of transmission investment and the MISO footprint would be needed. 
It is clear that investment in transmission is going to play a critical role in the clean energy transition, and we are well positioned to plan and execute the potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country. 
We continue to work with MISO and other key stakeholders and believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 are likely going to be included in this year's MISO transmission planning process, which is expected to be completed in early 2022. 
Moving now to Page 8 and an update on litigation regarding Ameren Missouri's past compliance with the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. As you may recall, this litigation dates back to 2011 and the Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA bought a complaint against Ameren Missouri, alleging that and performing certain projects at the Energy Center, we have violated the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. 
In 2017, the District Court issued a liability ruling and in September 2019, or the installation of push control equipment at the Rush Island Energy Center as well as at the Labadie Energy Center. September of this year, U.S. Court of Appeals preferred the District Court's 2019 order requires us to install a scrubber at our Rush Island Energy Center but denied the order to install additional pollution control equipment at labadie. 
Last month, we thought a request for rehearing with U.S. Court of Appeals. While we wait for a final decision from the courts, we continue to assess several alternatives to effectively address the court appeal's decision, including legal, operational and regulatory measures. 
In reviewing these options, we are also carefully assessing the impact on customer costs as well as generation or transmission investments needed to maintain system reliability. And we are certainly mindful of the policies that are being considered at the federal level to help address climate change. Should our decision results in a material change to our integrated resource plan, we will file an updated plan with the Missouri PSC. 
Turning to Page 9. We remain focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future. 
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformation plan to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels, 2030 and 2040, respectively, and is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. This slide highlights the many things we are doing for our customers and communities including being an industry leader in diversity, equity and inclusion. Further, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters and our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long-term performance, diversity equity inclusion and progress towards a cleaner sustained energy future. 
Finally, this slide highlights our very strong sustainable growth proposition, which is among the best in the industry. Turning to Page 10, you will go down further on this key element. Our strong sustainable growth proposition is driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders and making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. 
Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new reasonably beneficial transmission projects, including the potential road map of MISO transmission projects I discussed earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as help to enable our country's transition to a cleaner energy future. 
In addition, we expect to see greater focus on infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector in the future. Our outlook through 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner energy future and a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations. 
Moving to Page 11. Another key element of our sustainable growth proposition is the 5-year earnings per share growth guidance we issued in February, which included a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. 
Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. Our team continues to assess several global generation proposals from developers. We expect to file with the Missouri PSC for approval of a portion of these planned renewable investments this year. 
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a strong dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance. 
Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. Finally, turning to Page 12. I will wrap up with a few comments about the organizational changes we announced a few weeks ago. Over the past 8 years, I have had the great privilege to serve as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ameren. During this time, I've been very fortunate to lead the team that has done an excellent job in executing our strategy and delivering strong value to our customers, communities and shareholders. 
Last month, I was humbled and honored that the Board of Directors elected me to serve as Executive Chairman effective January 1, 2022. At the same time, and consistent with our robust succession planning process, I was very pleased that the Board of Directors also elected Marty Lyons to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer as well as to join the Board of Directors on January 1. Marty is an outstanding leader and is exceptionally qualified to lead our company as CEO during this transformation and time in our industry. 
Of course, many of you know Marty very well as he spent a decade as the company's Chief Financial Officer. And during the past 20 years, Marty has demonstrated strong operational, financial, regulatory and strategic acumen. I must say that I'm very excited about our new forward-thinking leadership structure. 
Working closely with Marty and our strong leadership team, I will remain actively engaged in overseeing important strategic matters impacting the company, including our transition to a cleaner energy future and will also remain focused on key energy and economic policy matters, especially in my leadership roles at the Edison Electric Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute as well as engaging with key stakeholders. 
Marty will take on significant duties of the CEO, which includes leading all aspects of Ameren strategy development and execution as well as the day-to-day operational, financial, regulatory, legal and workforce matters impacting the company. I, along with our Board of Directors, are very confident that Marty is clearly ready to lead Ameren as its new CEO. 
With that, I'll congratulate Marty once again for his promotion to CEO and turn it over to him to say a few words."

Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 earnings of $1.65 per share compared to $1.47 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings Ameren Missouri, our largest segme",1843,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 earnings of $1.65 per share compared to $1.47 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings Ameren Missouri, our largest segment increased $0.27 per share, driven primarily by a change in seasonal electric rate design, resulting from the March 2020, which provided for lower winter rates in May and higher summer rates in September rather than the blended rates us in both months in 2020. 
Higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately $0.10 per share largely due to continued economic recovery in this year's third quarter compared to the unfavorable impacts of COVID-19 in the year ago period as well as higher electric retail sales driven by warmer-than-normal summer temperatures in the period compared to near-normal summer temperatures in the year-ago period. 
We've included on this page, the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter. Total weather normalized sales year-to-date, shown on Page 27 of the presentation are largely consistent with our expectations outlined on our call in February, as we still expect total sales to be up approximately 2% in 2021 compared to 2020. 
That said, we've seen a net benefit in margins due to residential and commercial sales coming in higher than expected and industrial sales slightly lower than expected.  Increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation eligible for plant and service accounting and the renewable energy standard rate adjustment mechanism, or RESRAM, positively impacted earnings by $0.07 per share. The timing of tax expense, which is not expected to materially impact full year results increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Higher operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020, which was affected by COVID-19 and remained flat year-to-date driven by disciplined cost management. 
Finally, the amortization of deferred income taxes related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage also decreased earnings $0.02 per share. Moving to other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings increased $0.03 per share year-over-year, reflecting increased infrastructure investment. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings per share were comparable, which reflected increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking, partially offset by dilution.
Earnings for Illinois and natural gas decreased $0.04 per share. Increased delivery service rates that became effective in late January 2021 were more than offset by a change in rate design during the quarter, which is not expected to impact full year results. Ameren parent and other results decreased $0.08 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to materially impact full year results. 
Finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding. Before moving on, I'll touch on year-to-date sales trends for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers decreased 0.5%. And weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers increased 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. 
Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. Turning to Page 15. Now we'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We have remained very focused on maintaining disciplined cost management and we'll continue that focus. 
As Warner noted, due to the solid execution of our strategy, we now expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.75 per share to $3.95 per share, an increase from our original guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share. 
Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. Moving to Page 16 for an update on regulatory matters. On March 31, we filed for a $299 million electric revenue increase within Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021 estimated rate base of $10 billion. 
In October, Missouri Public Service Commission staff and other interveners filed a bottle testimony. Missouri PSC staff recommended a $108 million revenue increase including a return on equity range of 9.25% to 9.75% and an equity ratio of 50% based on Ameren Missouri's capital structure at June 30, 2021, which will be updated to use the capital structure as of September 30, 2021. 
The October staff recognition was lower primarily due to lower recommended depreciation expense, which would not be expected to impact earnings. Turning to Page 17. In addition to the electric filing on March 31, we filed for a $9 million natural gas revenue increase within Missouri PSC. The request includes a 9.8% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021 estimated rate base of $310 million. 
Missouri PSC staff recommended a $4 million revenue increase, including a return on equity range of 9.25% to 9.75% and an equity ratio of 50.32% based on Ameren Missouri's capital structure at June 30, 2021, which will be updated to use of the cash flow structure as of September 30, 2021. 
Other parties, including the Missouri Office of Public Counsel have also made recommended adjustments to our Missouri electric and gas rate request. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late November, and the Missouri PSC decisions from both rate reviews are expected by early February with new rates expected to be effective by late February. 
Moving to Page 18, Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based rate making these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. 
In August, the ICC staff recommended a $58 million base rate increase compared to our request of $59 million base rate increase. An ICC decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2022. Turning now to Page 19. As Warner mentioned, in September, constructive energy legislation was enacted in the State of Illinois. This allows Ameren Illinois the option to file a 4-year rate plan in January 2023 for rates effective beginning in 2024.  The return on equity, which will be determined by the Illinois Commerce Commission, may impacted by plus or minus 20 to 60 basis points based on the utility's ability to meet certain performance metrics related to items such as reliability, customer service and supplier diversity year-end rate base and an equity ratio up to 50% with entire equity ratio subject to approval by the ICC. 
In addition, it calls revenue decoupling and an annual reconciliation of cost and revenues for each annual period approved in the multiyear rate plan. There's a cap on the true-up, which may not exceed 105% of the revenue requirement and excludes variation from certain forecasted costs. The exclusions include cross associated with major storms, changing in timing of expenditure and investment that moved the expenditure investment into or out of the applicable calendar year and changes in income taxes, among other things. 
The true-up cap also excludes cost recovered through riders such as purchase power, transmission and bad debts. Rate impact to customers may also be mitigated through the ability to phase in rates. The legislation also allows for 2 utility-owned solar and/or battery storage pilot projects to be located near Peoria and East St. Louis at a cost not to exceed $20 million each. 
It also provides for programs that encourage transportation electrification in the state. We believe this framework will improve our ability to make significant investments in the State of Illinois and earn a fair return on equity. 
Looking ahead, we have the ability to opt into the multiyear rate plan or use the future test year traditional rate-making framework, both of which include a return on equity determined by the ICC and revenue decoupling. Should we choose to opt into the new multiyear plan, our 4-year plan must be filed by January 20, 2023. 
We anticipate continuing to use the performance-based ratemaking until we proceed with a multiyear replan filing or choose to move ahead with using the traditional framework. Moving to page -- equity through our or ATM program that was established in May. Further, approximately $30 million of equity outlined for 2022 have been sold year-to-date under the forward sales agreement. Together with the issuance under our 401(k) and DRIP+ program, our $750 million ATM equity program is expected to support equity needs through 2023. 
Moving now to Page 21. I'd like to briefly touch on the recent increase in natural gas prices around the country and the potential impact it may have on customer bills this coming winter. Beginning with our natural gas business, heading into the winter season, Ameren is approximately 75% hedged, and Ameren Missouri is approximately 85% hedged based on normal seasonal sales. 
Approximately 60% of Illinois and winter supply of natural gas was bought this summer at lower prices and is being stored in the company's 12 underground storage fields. Both companies are 100% volumetrically hedged based on maximum seasonal sales. 
Regarding the electric business in Missouri, we are currently long generation and any margin made through sales flow back to customers as a benefit on their bills through the fuel adjustment clause. Given our low cost of generation, rising natural gas and power prices have the potential to benefit our electric customers in Missouri. 
Turning to Page 22. We plan to provide 2022 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February next year. Using our 2021 guidance of the reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you earnings. Next, I would note, we expect to recognize earnings related to energy efficiency performance from both 2021 and 2022 plan years and 2022. 
As a result, we expect energy efficiency performance incentives to be approximately $0.04 per share higher than 2021. Further, our return to normal weather in 2022 would decrease Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.04 compared to 2021 results to date, assuming warm weather in the last quarter of the year. 
Next, earnings from our FERC-related electric transition entities are expected to benefit from additional investments in the Ameren Illinois projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2022 compared to 2021 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula ratemaking. 
The allowed ROE under the will be the average 2022 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings are expected to benefit from new delivery service rates effective late January 2021 as well as an increase in infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment that were in the current allowed ROE of 9.67%. 
And Lastly, turning to Page 23, we're well positioned to continue executing our plan. [Audio Gap]
for Ameren CapEx, yes?"

We're very excited about the opportunity that we have for the transmission investment. Number one, we're absolutely convinced that transmission is going to play an integral role. And that's a fair company, for our country and really executing this clean energy transition. 
And we're right in the middle of it. We have been before, and we are going to continue to be. And so look, it's premature to put I would say, a specific number. As you heard us in our prepared remarks, MISO has identified $30 billion to $100 billion of investment opportunities of potential projects. And I will tell you, where the country is going is closer to that scenario 3, which is closer to the $100 billion number. 
So what we're doing -- what MISO is doing, what stakeholders are doing. Look, we're working together to try and make sure that we put together a good set of projects coming out of this first NTAP that will start us on this path toward just clean energy transition. 
And as we look at it, if you look at that scenario 1 that's highlighted out there, we really think the focus will be on more no regrets types of projects as we start putting our toes in the water, if you will, maybe getting up to our knees. 
And then from there, I think we'll see it continue to get progressively bigger over time. We think there'll be some no regrets projects. And in terms of timing, look, I think the group -- our group and many stakeholders are working collaboratively to try and figure out the best projects as well as cost allocation things. 
These things are all things that you typically go through in this process. And so at the end of the day, we think that MISO will propose early in 2022, these projects to their Board of Directors, it will be well informed. And then what we believe will be hopefully will be an approval process that will get them in early 2022. 
So when you look at them in our overall plans, as we've said before, you might see some of these projects in our current 5-year plan start coming into play towards the back end of our 5-year plan. But certainly, in the second half of this decade, I think you're going to see a significant emphasis and need for transmission projects. 
So that's really what I can tell you today. But as I'll finish the way I started there, we're excited about the opportunity because we think it's significant and important."

Appreciate the question. Yes, as it relates to the Integrated Resource Plan, obviously, we filed last fall and as Warner said earlier in the prepared remarks, we continue to work with multiple developers with respect to several projects that would fit within that 1,200 megawatts of clean energy that we plan to deliver over the next several years. 
Consistent with that integrated resource plan. So we're continuing to work on those, and we still expect to file with the commission still this year for approval of a portion of the project. So that work is going on. And then you mentioned the Rush Island Energy Center. And so as you saw in our slides today, in August, the court of appeals affirmed the District Court's September 19 order. As we said in our slides and prepared remarks, we did file for a rehearing of that decision on October 18. 
So we do expect to hear back from the court and quite likely by the end of this year, we expect in terms of that rehearing. So it's really premature to say what action we will take with respect to Rush Island at this point. We'll wait to see whether there's a rehearing. But that rehearing is denied and ultimately, we're faced with that decision. Obviously, it may entail scrubbers in Rush Island or the accelerated retirement of that plant, which might also include the utilization legislation was passed earlier this year. 
So those are some of the things we're looking at. considerations as we think about those alternatives or things like customer rate impacts, replacement generation needs and importantly, reliability and investments that may be required in terms of transmission to the extent that Rush Island were to be prematurely retired. So those are some of the considerations. I'll tell you this, if ultimately a decision is made to retire Rush Island prematurely versus the day we had in our prior integrated resource plan that will require them that we file an updated integrated resource plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
So stay tuned on that. Like I said, it's premature to say how all of that will turn out, but that gives you a little bit of color on the potential path forward."

So I'm not sure that there's an exact time line. Obviously, the acquisition design, construction would take some time to get that put in place. 
And then with respect to the other route that you described, the retirement route, I think there, we'd be looking at how long Rush Island would continue to operate, obviously, given the things I talked about before, replacement generation needs, importantly, reliability issues around the system in the event of premature retirement, which again may necessitate some transmission investments in order to maintain reliability. 
So all of those things would be taken into consideration. And ultimately, to the extent that incremental generation was required or some acceleration of the clean energy transition that we've got laid out in our IRP, that would all be laid out in that updated integrated resource plan. So again, if we don't move forward with the scrubber, if we do decide that the Rush Island needs to be shut down earlier than the day in our IRP, which was 2039, then we would move forward with an update to the Integrated Resource Plan. And again, and so that would assess all of the potential adjustments to generation need and timing that were laid out in that prior September Integrated Resource Plan filing."

So we -- the plan remains on track with respect to that sales piece, that 2%, we see that sort of guiding in at the same point towards the end of the year. As we talked about at the beginning of the year, that will get us close being back to 2019, but not quite. So I think the recovery continues, and we're optimistic about we continue to see things open up here in both of our service territories in Missouri and Illinois. 
With respect to the guidance itself, I just remind you again, we -- in February last year, that 6% to 8% guidance was off of that midpoint. Obviously, at $375 million, that original midpoint of $375 million. We certainly have given you some select items to think about here in '22.

And to your point, do not believe it's an active issue in terms of a quantified difference between our position and the positions of others in the case. So hopefully, we have resolved that issue fully. But like you said, it's not manifesting itself today in any kind of difference between the parties."

373264,1685141368,2425523,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andrew.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. To begin, I am pleased to report that our team continues to effectively execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses, which includes making significant investments in our energy infrastructure to enhance the reliability and resiliency with the energy grid as well as transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion.  
These investments, coupled with our continued focus on disciplined cost management and delivering significant value to our customers, communities and shareholders. We'll now do our third quarter earnings results. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2021 earnings of $1.65 per share. Our earnings were up $0.18 per share from the same time period in 2020.  
This slide highlights the key drivers of our strong performance. Michael will discuss the key drivers of our third quarter earnings results a bit later. Due to the continued strong execution of our strategy, I am also pleased to report that we raised our 2021 earnings guidance. Our 2021 earnings guidance range is now $3.75 per share to $3.95 per share compared to our original guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share.  
Turning now to Page 5, where we reiterate our strategic plan. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. This has driven our multiyear focus on investing in energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of our customers.  As a result, and as you can see on the right side of this page, during the first 9 months of this year, we invested significant capital in each of our business segments. These investments are delivering value to our customers. As I said before, our energy grid is stronger, more resilient and more secure because of the investments we are making in all 4 business segments.  
As we head into the winter months, I'd like to highlight some of the value these investments have created in our Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri natural gas businesses. Our natural gas transmission and distribution investments are focused on upgrading and modernizing gas main and equipment infrastructure, all the strength in safety and reliability of our system for our customers.  
Being mindful of the gas distribution issues experienced in the industry in the past, I will note that our Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri natural gas distribution systems are comprised almost entirely of plastic and protected coated steel pipelines. There is no cast iron pipe in our systems, and we expect to eliminate all unprotected steel pipe by the end of this year.  These investments are just another example of how we are putting our customers at the center of our strategy. 
Moving now to regulatory matters. In late March, Ameren Missouri filed a request for a $299 million increase in annual electric service revenues and a $9 million increase in annual natural gas service revenues with the Missouri Public Service Commission.  In our Illinois Electric business, we have requested a $59 million base rate increase in our required annual electric distribution rate filing. These proceedings are moving along on schedule. Michael will provide more information on these proceedings a bit later.  Finally, we remain relentlessly focused on continuos improvement and disciplined cost management, including maintaining many of the cost savings that we realized in 2020 due to the actions we took to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19.  
Moving to Page 6 and the second pillar of our strategy: enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Over the years, we have been successful in executing this element of our strategy by delivering value to our customers for our investments in energy infrastructure and through extensive collaboration with key stakeholders in all of our regulatory jurisdictions.  
I am very pleased to report that these efforts paid off again in the third quarter when the Illinois legislature passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA, which is later signed by Governor Pritzker. CEJA is a constructive piece of legislation that addresses the key objectives that we felt were important for our customers and the communities we serve. It will enable us to continue to make important infrastructure investments to enhance the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid for a new forward-thinking regulatory framework.  It will also give us the ability to earn fair returns on those investments as well as enable us to invest in 2 solar and/or battery storage pilot projects. CEJA allows for an electric utility to opt in to a multiyear rate plan effective for 4 years beginning in 2024.  
We are currently working with key stockholders and will continue to over the course of 2022, to establish specific procedures, including performance metrics to implement this legislation. Subject to finalizing key aspects of this rate-making framework, we anticipate filing a multiyear rate plan by mid-January 2023. Michael will discuss this constructive piece of legislation in more in a moment. 
Shifting now to the federal level, where important energy legislation continues to be discussed. Needless to say, the situation around federal legislation remains fluid and ever changing. One thing that remains constant is our strong support for clean energy transition tax incentives including wind and solar production tax credits, transmission and storage investment tax credits as well as direct pay and normalization opt-out provisions.  We also continue to strongly support significant funding for research, design and development for new clean energy technologies, electrification of the transportation sector and grid resiliency. We support these important legislative initiatives because we strongly believe they will deliver significant long-term benefits to our customers, communities and country.  We will continue to work with key stakeholders, along with our industry colleagues to advance constructive federal energy and economic policies that will help us transition to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion.  
Speaking of our transition to our cleaner energy future, please turn to Page 7 in the discussion of future transmission investment needs. As we have discussed with you in the past, MISO completed a study outlining the potential road map of transmission projects through 2039. Taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions, among other things.  
Under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2039 and MISO estimates approximately $30 billion of future transmission investment would be necessary in the MISO footprint.  Under its Future 3 scenario, which resulted in an 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $100 million of transmission investment in the MISO footprint would be needed. It is clear that investment in transmission is going to play a critical role in the clean energy transition, and we are well positioned to plan and execute the potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country.  We continue to work with MISO and other key stakeholders and believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 are likely going to be included in this year's MISO transmission planning process, which is expected to be completed in early 2022.  
Moving now to Page 8 and an update on litigation regarding Ameren Missouri's past compliance with the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act. As you may recall, this litigation dates back to 2011 and the Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA filed a complaint against Ameren Missouri, alleging that in performing certain projects at the Rush Island Energy Center, we have violated the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act.  In 2017, the District Court issued a liability ruling and in September 2019, ordered the installation of pollution control equipment at the Rush Island Energy Center as well as at the Labadie Energy Center. In September of this year, U.S. Court of Appeals preferring the District Court's 2019 order requires us to install a scrubber at our Rush Island Energy Center but denied the order to install additional pollution control equipment at Labadie.  Last month, we filed a request for rehearing with U.S. Court of Appeals. While we wait for a final decision from the courts, we continue to assess several alternatives to effectively address the court of appeal's decision, including legal, operational and regulatory measures.  
In reviewing these options, we are also carefully assessing the impact on customer costs as well as generation or transmission investments needed to maintain system reliability. And we are certainly mindful of the policies that are being considered at the federal level to help address climate change. Should our decision result in a material change to our integrated resource plan, we will file an updated plan with the Missouri PSC.  
Turning to Page 9. We remain focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition for environmental, social and governance matters and is consistent with our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future.  Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformation plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively, and is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  
We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. This slide highlights the many things we are doing for our customers and communities including being an industry leader in diversity, equity and inclusion. Further, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters and our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to sustainable long-term performance, diversity equity inclusion and progress towards a cleaner sustained energy future.  Finally, this slide highlights our very strong sustainable growth proposition, which is among the best in the industry. 
Turning to Page 10, you will go down further on this key element. Our strong sustainable growth proposition is driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders and making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner.  Importantly, these investment opportunities exclude any new reasonably beneficial transmission projects, including the potential road map of MISO transmission projects I discussed earlier, all of which would increase the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as help to enable our country's transition to a cleaner energy future.  
In addition, we expect to see greater focus on infrastructure investments to support the electrification of the transportation sector in the future. Our outlook through 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner energy future in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion will be critical to meeting our country's future energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.  
Moving to Page 11. Another key element of our sustainable growth proposition is the 5-year earnings per share growth guidance we issued in February, which included a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth rate from 2021 to 2025. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth and compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers.  Importantly, our 5-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. Our team continues to assess several renewable generation proposals from developers. We expect to file with the Missouri PSC for approval of a portion of these planned renewable investments this year.  
I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments. That fact, coupled with our sustained past execution of our strategy on many fronts, has positioned us well for future success. Further, our shares continue to offer investors a strong dividend, which we expect to grow in line with our long-term earnings per share growth guidance.  Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. 
Finally, turning to Page 12. I will wrap up with a few comments about the organizational changes we announced a few weeks ago. Over the past 8 years, I have had the great privilege to serve as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ameren. During this time, I've been very fortunate to lead the team that has done an excellent job in executing our strategy and delivering strong value to our customers, communities and shareholders. Last month, I was humbled and honored that the Board of Directors elected me to serve as Executive Chairman effective January 1, 2022. At the same time, and consistent with our robust succession planning process, I was very pleased that the Board of Directors also elected Marty Lyons to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer as well as to join the Board of Directors on January 1. Marty is an outstanding leader and is exceptionally qualified to lead our company as CEO during this transformation time in our industry.  Of course, many of you know Marty very well as he spent a decade as the company's Chief Financial Officer. And during the past 20 years, Marty has demonstrated strong operational, financial, regulatory and strategic acumen. I must say that I'm very excited about our new forward-thinking leadership structure.  
Working closely with Marty and our strong leadership team, I will remain actively engaged in overseeing important strategic matters impacting the company, including our transition to a cleaner energy future and will also remain focused on key energy and economic policy matters, especially in my leadership roles at the Edison Electric Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute as well as engaging with key stakeholders.  
Marty will take on significant duties as a CEO, which includes leading all aspects of Ameren strategy development and execution as well as the day-to-day operational, financial, regulatory, legal and workforce matters impacting the company. I, along with our Board of Directors, are very confident that Marty is clearly ready to lead Ameren as its new CEO.  
With that, I'll congratulate Marty once again for his promotion to CEO and turn it over to him to say a few words."

Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 earnings of $1.65 per share compared to $1.47 per share for the year ago quarter. Turning to Ameren Missouri, our largest seg",2114,"Thanks, Warner, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2021 earnings of $1.65 per share compared to $1.47 per share for the year ago quarter. Turning to Ameren Missouri, our largest segment increased $0.27 per share, driven primarily by a change in seasonal electric rate design, resulting from the March 2020 rate order, which provided for lower winter rates in May and higher summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020.  
Higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately $0.10 per share largely due to continued economic recovery in this year's third quarter compared to the unfavorable impacts of COVID-19 in the year ago period as well as higher electric retail sales driven by warmer-than-normal summer temperatures in the period compared to near-normal summer temperatures in the year-ago period.  
We've included on this page, the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances for the quarter. Total weather normalized sales year-to-date, shown on Page 27 of the presentation are largely consistent with our expectations outlined on our call in February, as we still expect total sales to be up approximately 2% in 2021 compared to 2020.  
That said, we've seen a net benefit in margins due to residential and commercial sales coming in higher than expected and industrial sales slightly lower than expected.  Increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation eligible for plant and service accounting and the renewable energy standard rate adjustment mechanism, or RESRAM, positively impacted earnings by $0.07 per share. The timing of tax expense, which is not expected to materially impact full year results increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Higher operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020, which was affected by COVID-19 and remained flat year-to-date driven by disciplined cost management.  Finally, the amortization of deferred income taxes related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage also decreased earnings $0.02 per share. 
Moving to other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings increased $0.03 per share year-over-year, reflecting increased infrastructure investment. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings per share were comparable, which reflected increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking, partially offset by dilution. 
Earnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas decreased $0.04 per share. Increased delivery service rates that became effective in late January 2021 were more than offset by a change in rate design during the quarter, which is not expected to impact full year results. Ameren parent and other results decreased $0.08 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to materially impact full year results.  
Finally, 2021 earnings per share reflected higher weighted average shares outstanding. Before moving on, I'll touch on year-to-date sales trends for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers decreased 0.5%. And weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers increased 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively.  Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. 
Turning to Page 15. Now we'd like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2021 earnings guidance. We have remained very focused on maintaining disciplined cost management and we'll continue that focus.  As Warner noted, due to the solid execution of our strategy, we now expect 2021 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.75 per share to $3.95 per share, an increase from our original guidance range of $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share.  Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. 
Moving to Page 16 for an update on regulatory matters. On March 31, we filed for a $299 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 9.9% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021 estimated rate base of $10 billion.  In October, Missouri Public Service Commission staff and other intervenors filed a rebuttal testimony. Missouri PSC staff recommended a $188 million revenue increase including a return on equity range of 9.25% to 9.75% and an equity ratio of 50% based on Ameren Missouri's capital structure at June 30, 2021, which will be updated to use the capital structure as of September 30, 2021.  The October staff recommendation was lower primarily due to lower recommended depreciation expense, which would not be expected to impact earnings. 
Turning to Page 17. In addition to the electric filing on March 31, we filed for a $9 million natural gas revenue increase within the Missouri PSC. The request includes a 9.8% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a September 30, 2021 estimated rate base of $310 million.  Missouri PSC staff recommended a $4 million revenue increase, including a return on equity range of 9.25% to 9.75% and an equity ratio of 50.32% based on Ameren Missouri's capital structure at June 30, 2021, which will be updated to use of the cash flow structure as of September 30, 2021.  Other parties, including the Missouri Office of Public Counsel have also made recommended adjustments to our Missouri electric and gas rate request. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late November, and the Missouri PSC decisions from both rate reviews are expected by early February with new rates expected to be effective by late February.  
Moving to Page 18, Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based rate making these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. In August, the ICC staff recommended a $58 million base rate increase compared to our request of $59 million base rate increase. An ICC decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2022. 
Turning now to Page 19. As Warner mentioned, in September, constructive energy legislation was enacted in the State of Illinois. This allows Ameren Illinois the option to file a 4-year rate plan in January 2023 for rates effective beginning in 2024.  The return on equity, which will be determined by the Illinois Commerce Commission, may impacted by plus or minus 20 to 60 basis points based on the utility's ability to meet certain performance metrics related to items such as reliability, customer service and supplier diversity. The plan also allows for the use of year-end rate base and an equity ratio up to 50% with an higher equity ratio subject to approval by the ICC.  
In addition, it calls revenue decoupling and an annual reconciliation of cost and revenues for each annual period approved in the multiyear rate plan. There's a cap on the true-up, which may not exceed 105% of the revenue requirement and excludes variation from certain forecasted costs. The exclusions include cross associated with major storms, changing in timing of expenditure and investment that moved the expenditure investment into or out of the applicable calendar year and changes in income taxes, among other things. 
The true-up cap also excludes cost recovered through riders such as purchase power, transmission and bad debts. Rate impact to customers may also be mitigated through the ability to phase in rates. The legislation also allows for 2 utility-owned solar and/or battery storage pilot projects to be located near Peoria and East St. Louis at a cost not to exceed $20 million each. It also provides for programs that encourage transportation electrification in the state. We believe this framework will improve our ability to make significant investments in the State of Illinois and earn a fair return on equity. 
Looking ahead, we have the ability to opt-in to the multiyear rate plan or use the future test year traditional rate-making framework, both of which include a return on equity determined by the ICC and revenue decoupling. Should we choose to opt into the new multiyear rate plan, our 4-year plan must be filed by January 20, 2023. We anticipate continuing to use the performance-based ratemaking until we proceed with a multiyear rate plan filing or choose to move ahead with using the traditional framework. 
Moving to page 20 for a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. We're able to successfully actually on several debt issuances earlier this year, which we have outlined on this page. In order for us to maintain our credit earnings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan and consistent with prior guidance as of August 15, we have completed the issuance of approximately $150 million of common equity through our at-the-market or ATM program that was established in May. Further, approximately $30 million of equity outlined for 2022 have been sold year-to-date under the programs forward sales agreement. Together with the issuance under our 401(k) and DRPlus program, our $750 million ATM equity program is expected to support equity needs through 2023. 
Moving now to Page 21. I'd like to briefly touch on the recent increase in natural gas prices around the country and the potential impact it may have on customer bills this coming winter. Beginning with our natural gas business, heading into the winter season, Ameren is approximately 75% hedged, and Ameren Missouri is approximately 85% hedged based on normal seasonal sales. Approximately 60% of Illinois winter supply of natural gas was bought this summer at lower prices and is being stored in the company's 12 underground storage fields. Both companies are 100% volumetrically hedged based on maximum seasonal sales. 
Regarding the electric business in Missouri, we are currently long generation and any margin made through off-systems sales flow back to customers as a benefit on their bills through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. Given our low cost of generation, rising natural gas and power prices have the potential to benefit our electric customers in Missouri. 
Turning to Page 22. We plan to provide 2022 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February next year. Using our 2021 guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with Missouri, we expect the new electric service rates to be effective in 2022 as a result of our pending rate review. These rates are expected to reflect recovery of and return on new infrastructure and wind generation investments, which are expected to increase earnings when compared to 2021. Prior to new electric service rates taking effect in late February, we expect increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation eligible for plant and service accounting and a RESRAM that positively impact earnings. Next, I would note, we expect to recognize earnings related to energy efficiency performance incentives from both 2021 and 2022 plan years in 2022. 
As a result, we expect energy efficiency performance incentives to be approximately $0.04 per share higher than 2021. Further, our return to normal weather in 2022 would decrease Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.04 compared to 2021 results to date, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of the year. 
Next, earnings from our FERC-related electric transition entities are expected to benefit from additional investments in the Ameren Illinois projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2022 compared to 2021 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois formula ratemaking. 
The allowed ROE under the formula will be the average 2022 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings are expected to benefit from new delivery service rates effective late January 2021 as well as an increase in infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment that were in the current allowed ROE of 9.67%. 
And Lastly, turning to Page 23, we're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2021 as we successfully execute our strategy. And as we look to the longer term, we expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In summary, we have a total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

We're very excited about the opportunity that we have for the transmission investment. Number one, we're absolutely convinced that transmission is going to play an integral role. And that's a fair company, for our country and really executing this clean energy transition. 
And we're right in the middle of it. We have been before, and we are going to continue to be. And so look, it's premature to put I would say, a specific number. As you heard us in our prepared remarks, MISO has identified $30 billion to $100 billion of investment opportunities of potential projects. And I will tell you, where the country is going is closer to that scenario 3, which is closer to the $100 billion number. 
So what we're doing -- what MISO is doing, what stakeholders are doing. Look, we're working together to try and make sure that we put together a good set of projects coming out of this first NTAP that will start us on this path towards this clean energy transition. 
And as we look at it, if you look at that scenario 1 that's highlighted out there, we really think the focus will be on more no regrets types of projects as we start putting our toes in the water, if you will, maybe getting up to our knees. 
And then from there, I think we'll see it continue to get progressively bigger over time. We think there'll be some no regrets projects. And in terms of timing, look, I think the group -- our group and many stakeholders are working collaboratively to try and figure out the best projects as well as cost allocation things. 
These things are all things that you typically go through in this process. And so at the end of the day, we think that MISO will propose early in 2022, these projects to their Board of Directors, it will be well informed. And then what we believe will be hopefully will be an approval process that will get them in early 2022. 
So when you look at them in our overall plans, as we've said before, you might see some of these projects in our current 5-year plan start coming into play towards the back end of our 5-year plan. But certainly, in the second half of this decade, I think you're going to see a significant emphasis and need for transmission projects. 
So that's really what I can tell you today. But as I'll finish the way I started there, we're excited about the opportunity because we think it's significant and important."

Appreciate the question. Yes, as it relates to the Integrated Resource Plan, obviously, we filed last fall and as Warner said earlier in the prepared remarks, we continue to work with multiple developers with respect to several projects that would fit within that 1,200 megawatts of clean energy that we plan to deliver over the next several years consistent with that integrated resource plan. 
So we're continuing to work on those, and we still expect to file with the commission still this year for approval of a portion of the project. So that work is going on. And then you mentioned the Rush Island Energy Center. And so as you saw in our slides today, in August, the court of appeals affirmed the District Court's September 19 order. As we said in our slides and prepared remarks, we did file for a rehearing of that decision on October 18. 
So we do expect to hear back from the court and quite likely by the end of this year, we expect in terms of that rehearing. So it's really premature to say what action we will take with respect to Rush Island at this point. We'll wait to see whether there's a rehearing. But if that rehearing is denied and ultimately, we're faced with that decision, obviously, it may entail scrubbers in Rush Island or the accelerated retirement of that plant, which might also include the utilization -- the securitization legislation was passed earlier this year. 
So those are some of the things we're looking at, considerations as we think about those alternatives or things like customer rate impacts, replacement generation needs and importantly, reliability and investments that may be required in terms of transmission to the extent that Rush Island were to be prematurely retired. So those are some of the considerations. I'll tell you this, if ultimately a decision is made to retire Rush Island prematurely versus the date we had in our prior integrated resource plan that will require them that we file an updated integrated resource plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission. 
So stay tuned on that. Like I said, it's premature to say how all of that will turn out, but that gives you a little bit of color on the potential path forward."

And then with respect to the other route that you described, the retirement route, I think there, we'd be looking at how long Rush Island would continue to operate, obviously, given the things I talked about before, replacement generation needs, importantly, reliability issues around the system in the event of premature retirement, which again may necessitate some transmission investments in order to maintain reliability.

So again, if we don't move forward with the scrubber, if we do decide that the Rush Island needs to be shut down earlier than the day in our IRP, which was 2039, then we would move forward with an update to the Integrated Resource Plan. And again, and so that would assess all of the potential adjustments to generation need and timing that were laid out in that prior September Integrated Resource Plan filing."

I mean year-to-date, we've put in there from a residential standpoint, we're up 1.5%, commercial 3.5% and industrial 1%. So about 2%, and that's really what we guided to at the beginning of the year in February. Now the mix is a little bit different. So we're seeing some improvement in margin there, which is a driver of that increase in the midpoint that you talked about in addition to weather. 
So we -- the plan remains on track with respect to that sales piece, that 2%, we see that sort of guiding in at the same point towards the end of the year. As we talked about at the beginning of the year, that will get us close to being back to 2019, but not quite. So I think the recovery continues, and we're optimistic about how we continue to see things open up here in both of our service territories in Missouri and Illinois. 
With respect to the guidance itself, I just remind you again, we released -- in February last year, that 6% to 8% guidance was off of that midpoint. Obviously, at $375 million, that original midpoint of $375 million, we certainly have given you some select items to think about here in '22.  And then obviously, in February, we'll roll all this forward to give you another look at capital as well as give you just more specifics about obviously, where our range will be in our earnings guidance for '22 at that point in time. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color you're looking for."

There's again, multiple developers we're working with really to get the best deals we can for our customers ultimately, and there are multiple contracts that need to be negotiated with each one of the developers. 
So we continue to work, again, with multiple of them on multiple projects. And -- at this point, I'd say again, I'd say we're expecting to file for approval for a portion of that 1,200 megawatts.
