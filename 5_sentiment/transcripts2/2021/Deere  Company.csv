Ag fundamentals improved significantly throughout the first quarter, and the improved sentiment is reflected in the most recent status of our order books and early order programs. Meanwhile, markets for our Construction & Forestry division also improved in the first quarter, leading to improved levels of profitability and a heightened outlook for the rest of the year. 
Slide 3 shows the results for the first quarter. Net sales and revenue were up 19% to $9.1 billion while net sales for the equipment operations were up 23% to just over $8 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.224 billion or $3.87 per diluted share. During the first quarter of 2021, the company recorded impairments totaling $50 million pretax to certain long-lived assets. These impairments were more than offset by a favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil of $58 million pretax. In comparison to last year, the quarter also benefited from minimal employee separation costs, which represented $127 million pretax in the first quarter of 2020. 
Before transitioning to a review of our business divisions, I'd like to highlight a few changes to our segment reporting, as shown on Slide 4. As you probably already noticed in our press release, the company implemented a new segment reporting structure beginning in fiscal year 2021 to align with the most -- to align with the recent implementation of the new strategy and operating model which was announced last summer. 
As a result, the company's Agriculture & Turf operation was bifurcated into 2 new segments: the Production & Precision Agriculture segment is responsible for developing and delivering global equipment and technology solutions for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton and sugar. Main products include large and certain midsized tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters, seeding and application equipment. 
The Small Agriculture & Turf segment is responsible for developing and delivering market-driven products to support midsized and small growers as well as turf customers. The operations are principally organized to support production systems for dairy and livestock, high-value crops and turf and utility operators. Primary products include certain midsized and small tractors as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial line equipment, golf course equipment and utility vehicles. There were no reporting changes for the Construction & Forestry and Financial Services segments. As a result, the company will now report across these 4 segments. 
Now let's turn to a review of our Production & Precision Ag business, starting on Slide 5. Net sales of $3.069 billion were up 22% compared to the first quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 8 points while currency translation was negative by 1 point. Operating profit was $643 million, resulting in a 21% operating margin for the division compared to an 8.7% margin for the same period last year. 
The year-over-year increase was driven by positive price realization, higher shipment volumes and sales mix and a $53 million favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil. These items were partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange. Excluding the impact of onetime items such as the favorable tax ruling, first quarter margins were around 19.5%. Also, when comparing to last year, keep in mind that the results in the prior period included employee separation costs of $42 million. 
With respect to price realization, the above-average results for the quarter were primarily driven by a few different factors. While North American list prices were up slightly above average, the primary drivers of price came from significant midyear price adjustments made in 2020 for select foreign markets to offset unfavorable currency movements. Additionally, certain U.S. and Canada products also had midyear adjustments in 2020 as a result of product launches, such as the new ADR in May of last year. 
Lastly, the current low inventory levels across the industry have led to lower overall incentive spending, thus boosting net price realization. We do anticipate net price realization to moderate closer to normal levels towards the second half of the year. 
Shifting focus to Small Ag & Turf on Slide 6. Net sales were up 27%, totaling $2.515 billion in the first quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 6 points while currency translation was positive by 2 points. For the quarter, operating profit was $469 million, resulting in an 18.6% operating margin for the division compared to a 7.9% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was due to higher shipment volumes, positive sales mix and price realization, while results for the prior period were affected by voluntary employee separation expenses of about $36 million. 
Slide 7 shows our industry outlooks for Ag & Turf markets globally. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up between 15% and 20% for the year, reflecting improved fundamentals in the ag sector. Our outlook is guided in part by the results of our early order programs and tractor order book. Our crop care early order program, which ended in October, finished with unit orders up double digits compared to the prior year. In addition, we completed our combine early order program in January, with results also up double digits and outpacing the results of our crop care program. 
Furthermore, our large tractor order book now extends into the fourth quarter and has an increased production schedule relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect industry sales of Small Ag & Turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up about 5%. Deere's forecasted production will be higher than the industry, reflecting our plans to increase inventory levels in small ag, which ended the year at historic lows. 
Moving on to Europe. The industry outlook is forecast to be up about 5% as higher commodity prices strengthened business conditions in the arable segment, offsetting some weakness in dairy and livestock. Importantly, our tractor order book in Monheim now extends into the fourth quarter, providing good visibility through much of fiscal year '21. Furthermore, we've seen continued progress executing our regional strategy focused on large and precision ag. 
In South America, we expect an industry sales increase of about 10%. The confluence of higher commodity prices, strong production and a favorable currency environment have boosted profitability of farmers, driving equipment demand for the year. Despite limited government financing programs, private debt is more widely available this year, supporting continued strength in equipment demand. Industry sales in Asia are forecast to be down slightly, though key markets for Deere are performing slightly better. 
Moving on to our segment forecast on Slide 8. For Production & Precision Ag, net sales are forecast to be between $15.5 billion and $16.5 billion in fiscal year '21. The the forecast includes a currency tailwind of about 1 point and expectations of just under 6 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranged between 19.5% and 20.5%, with solid performance across the various geographical regions. 
Slide 9 shows our forecast for the Small Ag & Turf segment. Net sales in fiscal year '21 are forecast to be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. The guidance includes expectations for 2 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency impact of about 3 points. The segment's operating margin is forecast to range between 14.5% and 15.5%. 
Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 10. For the quarter, net sales of $2.467 billion were up 21%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Additionally, ended its practice of reporting on a 1-month lag, resulting in 4 months of activity in the quarter. The quarter's results were boosted by 3 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of 1 -- of about 1 point. 
Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $268 million due to higher shipment volumes and sales mix and price realization. The increase in profit was partially offset by higher production costs and impairments of long-lived assets related to an asphalt plant factory in Germany. Also keep in mind that last year's results included voluntary employee separation costs of about $24 million. 
Let's turn to our 2021 Construction & Forestry industry outlook on Slide 11. North American construction equipment industry sales are now forecast to be up about 5%, while sales of compact construction equipment are expected to be up about 10%. End markets for earthmoving and compact equipment have benefited primarily from the strength in the housing market as well as a modest recovery from trough conditions in the oil and gas sector. Furthermore, current demand levels reflect the benefit from the industry's collective response managing inventory levels tightly during the early days of the pandemic. In forestry, we now expect the industry to be up between 5% to 10% as a recovery in lumber demand, particularly in North America, is leading to increased production throughout the year. 
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 12. Deere's Construction & Forestry 2021 net sales are now forecast to be between $10.5 billion and $11 billion. Our net sales guidance for the year includes expectations of 2 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of about 2 points. We expect the segment's operating margin to be ranged between 10.5% and 11.5% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and nonrecurring expenses from 2020. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services operations on Slide 13. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the first quarter was $204 million, benefiting from favorable financing spreads, lower losses on operating leases and a lower provision for credit losses. For fiscal year 2021, the net income forecast is now $730 million. The provision for credit losses -- the provision for credit loss forecast for 2021 is 23 basis points when compared to the average portfolio managed. 
Slide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '21, our full year outlook for net income is now forecast to be between $4.6 billion to $5 billion. The guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 24% to 26%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $5 billion and contemplates a $700 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plan. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell for closing comments. Ryan?"

With respect to our outlook, we've seen underlying fundamentals continue to improve since the last quarter. Higher commodity prices and improved market access have boosted sentiment in ag markets and are reflected in the results of our early order programs and order books. In addition, we see further strength in demand for compact utility tractors and turf equipment as consumers continue to focus on home and landscape projects. Furthermore, those businesses are also benefiting from our channel partners' desire to boost inventory levels from historic lows. 
Meanwhile, our C&F business has benefited from a very strong housing market, a modest recovery in the oil and gas sector and the industry's proactive inventory management. While we are encouraged by some of the end market tailwinds, it is also important to point out some key risks. Dynamics in our supply base remain tight globally. While trends for COVID rates are improving, many areas are still impacted by high levels of absenteeism and are also facing growing constraints for some electronic components. To date, we've been largely successful keeping our production rates on schedule. However, we acknowledge the situation is very fluid and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 
Furthermore, prices for key raw materials such as steel have risen significantly over the last quarter, while freight and logistics costs have also experienced upward pressure. Our current forecast contemplates the impact of rising input costs and includes an additional $500 million related to material and freight. Despite these challenges, we are encouraged by the strength in our end markets as well as the execution our employees have delivered so far this year. Our first quarter results demonstrated the highest net income and equipment operations margins in the history of the company. While we are still in the early phases of executing our new operating model, we are encouraged by the progress made so far. Importantly, we are seeing the benefits of our new agile structure, allowing us to make decisions quickly and operate more efficiently. 
I'd like to close with some perspective on our recent efforts driving sustainability. Our vision is that John Deere customers will lead their industry by becoming the world's most profitable and sustainable businesses. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver this for our customers. Our continued technology advancements allow our customers to make every seed, every drop and every hour count. This makes their operations more sustainable and have less impact on the environment while also saving them time and money. 
Earlier this month, we released our 2020 Sustainability Report. In it, we highlighted how our precision technologies are already making our customers more sustainable and productive. Using technologies like AutoTrac, Section Control, ExactApply, ExactEmerge, TruSet and Combine Advisor, our corn and soybean customers use less fuel, save time, apply less herbicides and fertilizers and emit less greenhouse gases throughout their production cycles. 
A John Deere customer farming 6,500 acres in the Midwest can lower their greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis by the equivalent of nearly 1 million passenger vehicle miles driven just by incorporating these technologies into their operations. At the same time, these 6 technologies are improving the economics of our customers' businesses. Less inputs translates into lower costs. 
In addition to reducing inputs, our approach also translates into higher yields. Taken together, this suite of technologies available today can conservatively deliver savings of $40 per acre to our customers. These outcomes scaled across our platform of global engaged acres provides an opportunity unlike any other for us to impact the sustainability and productivity of our customers' operation. 
On the earthmoving and roadbuilding side of the business, we are also making progress in delivering our customers the tools to operate in a more sustainable manner. For example, our control technology delivers significant time and material savings through automating control of the edge of the bulldozer. This ultimately translates into cost savings for our customers through reduced labor costs, reduced fuel usage and reduced asphalt costs. These same reductions translate into lower greenhouse gases emitted and less natural resources utilized on each job. 
Our roadbuilding business is leading the industry in both efficiency and sustainability and repaving technology with its cold recycler. Cold recycling reuses the existing materials of a roadway, significantly minimizing the cost and environmental impact of repaving. While the traditional process of repaving involves milling up the old pavement, hauling the old materials away and hauling new materials to the work site, the Cold Recycler enables the old asphalt from the existing roadway to be mixed with additives on site to be reused. This technology can increase the life of the roadway while utilizing 90% less material and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 12 million passenger miles driven per job. 
These are just a few examples of technologies that are already making an impact on sustainability. And what we're most excited about is that despite the multi-decade investment we've already made, we are still just getting started on this journey. As we look to our future technology road map, we will enable our customers to do more with even less as well as adapt to the dynamic future -- dynamic nature of weather patterns, consumer trends and the global regulatory environment. 
In addition to our industry-leading equipment and technology stack, we have one of the most collaborative data platforms in the industry. And we're exploring ways that data can help our customers participate in new markets and programs that reward our customers for incorporating sustainable practices into their operations. Our tools will allow customers to demonstrate the impact of their sustainable outcomes, enabling them to tap into new markets for revenue and financing. The key will be giving growers the ability to seamlessly document the appropriate data and provide them with the digital tools to confidently evaluate agronomic and business trade-offs. 
As we look ahead, our biggest opportunity lies in delivering solutions that make our customers more productive and sustainable. But we also remain committed to running our own operations in a sustainable and socially responsible manner. In that regard, we continue making progress toward our 2022 sustainability goals. We have steadily reduced the greenhouse gas emissions from our own facilities, and we have leveraged important partnerships to convert a significant portion of our electricity footprint to renewable sources. 
We are improving our water practices around the world, exploring new and innovative ways for recycling waste at our facilities, and through our new strategic focus on our aftermarket business, we'll continue to grow and expand our portfolio of remanufactured products. And we can only deliver on this opportunity if we have a diverse and highly engaged workforce. Employee safety is and always has been of the highest important to us. And throughout 2020, we took action to ensure that our employees were protected and had the proper tools to do their jobs effectively and safely. We also launched new strategic initiatives that are focused on leading and lagging indicators that are designed to enable continuous measurement of safety performance and drive continuous improvement. 
We know that diverse teams working together result in better ideas and better solutions. Therefore, we are committed to improving diversity at our company. To do this, we are partnering with key universities and professional organizations in order to recruit diverse talent, and we are providing employees the opportunity to connect with others that have common experiences through our employee resource groups. Moving forward, we will continue to attract, retain and develop employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences as it will be critical to delivering sustainable outcomes for all of our stakeholders."

I would say, I mean, when you think about the -- what we've seen from Production & Precision Ag, when you think about mix, it's as titled, that's essentially large ag and you're seeing the continued integration of precision ag in that. So I think that's one of the things that -- as we separated these and we think about how we're segmenting, is we're seeing a much probably cleaner view of pure -- what is precision ag and production ag, so the integration of machinery and technology. 
I think as it relates to the performance, I mean, certainly, we saw volume pick up. Price, as Brent noted, was a significant driver in the quarter. And that was on a number of different variables. But we saw the benefits of above-average, just normal price increases. Pretty significant adjustments we've made over the last year in overseas markets as it related to currency and some new products that came in middle of the year. So you're seeing that impact. 
And then as noted, the benefit of low inventory and strong demand driving lower incentive spending. So as I think about it, I think those would be the biggest drivers, particularly in the quarter. As it relates to things like R&D, we're -- timing-wise, we're probably skewed a little bit to the later part of the year. That's just timing on programs. 
And probably worth noting, when you think about that performance ex the Brazil tax item, Production & Precision Ag did about 19.5%. And we'll continue to see, as a percent of sales, higher R&D in that segment compared to the rest of the business."

I'm just wondering how much more opportunity there is to take up production, assuming markets continue to be favorable."

We've seen sales move up as a result of that. And we've done things. We've added production. We've added some shifts in some of our large facilities, places like Waterloo, for example, and in some of our facilities in South America as well. So we have made those adjustments. 
The real challenge, and Ryan mentioned this, is on the supply side, there are components and parts that continue to be tight from a supply point of view. So we're managing those really tightly. Supply management group is working really hard with suppliers day-to-day. Some components are week-to-week in terms of what we're seeing from an availability point of view. So those are tight. So to the extent we continue to see demand, we'll try to work to react to that to the upside but acknowledge it's a tight environment as it relates to some key components. 
Relative to price, and I think what we're seeing on the price side, certainly, we see -- we're seeing strong price this year, about 6 points for the year for Production & Precision Ag. I think what is happening there, when you think about not just price but what's happening with price and mix, is we're continuing to see average selling prices of our large ag machinery growing, and that's through the continued integration of technology and solutions into that business. So that pattern and trend has continued. And as we continue to be able to deliver those outcomes, and we talked a little bit about it from both a sustainability and economic point of view, that is driving real value to customers. And we're seeing that as it relates to adoption and continuing to see the trends across most of our large ag machinery in terms of adoption of the latest tools."

And as that continues to adopt and our customers continue to adopt that, you get a higher software mix in our margin profile. So that's another factor. To Josh's point on average selling prices going up, that's true, but also those selling prices include a richer mix of software."

As it relates to kind of the incremental benefit we see, I think that couple of points, 2, 3 points of range is still very, very fair in terms of what we've been experiencing. The opportunities as we go forward to continue to see that or to see that move, I think, are there, as you think about increasing, seeing more sensing and acting in the field. 
So you think about things like seed and spray that we've talked a lot about, but we see opportunities to go beyond that, beyond herbicides into things like fungicides, pesticides, other fertilizers and into other jobs, other machine forms, planting, for example. And as we've talked about in the past, we were also -- as we continue down the automation journey, we're getting closer and closer to full autonomy. 
So I say all those things to point out, as we do those things, those create more opportunity to drive revenue as well as a more recurring base of revenue that we can add value job to job, pass to pass. As it relates to kind of where we're at cycle-wise and what does this mean for Production & Precision Ag margins, today, what we'd say is we're just above, call it, 105% of mid-cycle for Production & Precision Ag and middle of the range margins around 20%. 
So context-wise, when we compare that back to 2013, that's when we were at, from a large ag perspective, well above peak with roughly 16% margins at that time. So we're doing higher margins on lower sales and I think feel really good about the opportunity. And the things I mentioned earlier in terms of what drives opportunities for us, those continue to be strong tailwinds with lots of runway."

I think the lessons learned from the past cycle certainly play into that. How do we make sure we're not pulling additional customers in, pulling ahead demand potentially that would have occurred later on? And I think as we look at 2021 right now, with the demand that we're seeing, our order books, large tractors, for example, are into the fourth quarter. And with the early order programs, they account for nearly the entire full year production. 
So I think we've got really good visibility. I think that it's a good indicator of the replacement demand that we've been expecting and have thought we would see over the last couple of years coming to fruition here. But I think we're definitely working very closely with the dealers in terms of how do we manage the cycle but acknowledge, right now, we're early, early days in terms of seeing some of this demand pick up."

I think this year, particularly Small Ag & Turf, we're seeing a pretty strong benefit of what was, as you look at small tractors in particular, really significant underproduction last year of retail, and we intend to build a little bit of inventory this year, so you're seeing a little bit of swing there, so that swing from underproducing to overproducing definitely benefits the margin profile as well."

I think we're seeing really strong execution. Again, the benefit of moving from underproducing to slightly overproducing on small tractors helps. The pricing point of view is solid as well.

And we've done a couple of things over the last couple of years, most recently, an agreement with Claro to provide access, better connectivity and bandwidth. We think that unlocks even more potential for the use of those tools. 
Europe, there's historically been a lot of guidance. And I think we're starting to see some of that turn and shift towards more connectivity. Engaged acres grew there last year significantly, like triple digits. And as you think about the potential impact of regulatory environments coming in Europe first but probably other parts of the world, the appetite for precision agriculture and some of our tools, when you think about and others, will be particularly important as we go forward there. So continuing to grow, feel really good about the position we're in and I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity."

And are you willing to open up your early order programs for other products earlier this year than normal? And the other question is, we don't have the baseline for the new segments within Ag & Turf. Of the revenue increase that you put into A&T, I thought it was impressive that on those incremental sales, the incremental margin is 44% so it's pretty impressive. But of that revenue increase, just so we have a sense of the mix what changed, how much of the increase was the Production & Precision Ag versus how much was Small Ag & Turf?"

So first, on the order side, I think we're -- we haven't opened anything up into '22 -- fiscal '22 at this point.

So we're pushing out into the end of the fiscal year for large tractors in particular. So we'll -- and we haven't adjusted anything at this point as far as timing of the early order programs. But you bring up a really good point in that when we -- by the time we close our crop care early order programs, that was we were just beginning to see the inflection. So if you think about kind of the low double-digit increases we saw in planters and sprayers, that was mostly well ahead of kind of the inflection we saw here in the fall. So I think obviously a lot to play out, but that bodes well there. But we haven't adjusted timing at this point. 
As it relates to the sales increase from former A&T and the Production & Precision Ag and Small Ag & Turf, really, the percentage increases are pretty similar. So if we look at those businesses year-over-year, they're both up, call it, roughly 20%. So pretty balanced between the 2 in terms of the increase we saw compared to a quarter ago."

And we're coming out of a period with 2020 where we ended with kind of historically low inventory. So we're pushing there to try to not only meet demand but if we can, we'll try to build a little bit of inventory because we finished quite low. 
So I think overall, South American demand, Brazil in particular, really strong. Customers are feeling good. Dealers are very much engaged and the -- I think from a -- as we step back and not just think about South America, but I think the performance that we've seen this year, first quarter and as we look at our forecast, we're benefiting from just really strong profitability from a global perspective of our business as well.

It was pretty much the extra month was kind of in line with where they were running for the quarter, so no significant change there. Didn't necessarily impact their overall guidance or the division's total guidance. 
I mean, I think when you think about our roadbuilding business, I think we feel really good about what we're seeing there. Overall, we expect that to be up about 20% in this fiscal year. About half of that is the extra month. So say, underlying business up about 10%. And when we look at the core roadbuilding business, we feel like the margins that they're delivering are where we'd expect them to be. So as we talked about, feel like that business is a mid-teens business. We're executing along those lines and feel really good about how that's progressing. 
I think when you step back overall C&F, certainly, we think there's an opportunity as continues to perform that, that will pull up margins. Technology opportunity for us as well in Construction & Forestry, we're very early on and think about how do we integrate that. We think that will drive performance there as well. We highlighted just an example on control and what that can do from a customer economic and sustainable impacts as well. So those are types of things we're looking at, obstacle detection. There's a few things that we feel like we can nearly copy-paste into that division to drive better performance and continuing to be very focused on operations and executing very, very tightly in what is a volatile, somewhat cyclical business."

As it relates to price, historically, we've not taken price solely based on commodities. We try to do that and be disciplined in our approach to price and pricing for value and those sorts of things. So at this point, we haven't contemplated that. I mean, if we step back and look overall, the price we're getting is offsetting -- more than offsetting the material but does certainly have a drag on incrementals as we go through the remainder of the year.

Ag fundamentals improved significantly throughout the first quarter, and the improved sentiment is reflected in the most recent status of our order books and early order programs. Meanwhile, markets for our construction and forestry division also improved in the first quarter, leading to improved levels of profitability and a heightened outlook for the rest of the year.  
Slide 3 shows the results for the first quarter. Net sales and revenue were up 19% to $9.1 billion while net sales for the equipment operations were up 23% to just over $8 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.224 billion or $3.87 per diluted share. During the first quarter of 2021, the company recorded impairments totaling $50 million pretax to certain long-lived assets. These impairments were more than offset by a favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil of $58 million pretax. In comparison to last year, the quarter also benefited from minimal employee separation costs, which represented $127 million pretax in the first quarter of 2020.  
Before transitioning to a review of our business divisions, I'd like to highlight a few changes to our segment reporting, as shown on Slide 4. As you probably already noticed in our press release, the company implemented a new segment reporting structure beginning in fiscal year 2021 to align with the most -- to align with the recent implementation of the new strategy and operating model which was announced last summer. As a result, the company's Agriculture & Turf operation was bifurcated into 2 new segments. The production and precision agriculture segment is responsible for developing and delivering global equipment and technology solutions for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton and sugar. Main products include large and certain midsized tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters, seeding and application equipment.  
The small agriculture and turf segment is responsible for developing and delivering market-driven products to support midsized and small growers as well as turf customers. The operations are principally organized to support production systems for dairy and livestock, high-value crops and turf and utility operators. Primary products include certain midsized and small tractors as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment and utility vehicles. There were no reporting changes for the construction and forestry and financial services segments. As a result, the company will now report across these 4 segments.  
Now let's turn to a review of our production and precision ag business, starting on Slide 5. Net sales of $3.069 billion were up 22% compared to the first quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 8 points while currency translation was negative by 1 point. Operating profit was $643 million, resulting in a 21% operating margin for the division compared to an 8.7% margin for the same period last year.
The year-over-year increase was driven by positive price realization, higher shipment volumes and sales mix and a $53 million favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil. These items were partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange. Excluding the impact of onetime items such as the favorable tax ruling, first quarter margins were around 19.5%. Also, when comparing to last year, keep in mind that the results in the prior period included employee separation costs of $42 million.  
With respect to price realization, the above-average results for the quarter were primarily driven by a few different factors. While North American list prices were up slightly above average, the primary drivers of price came from significant midyear price adjustments made in 2020 for select foreign markets to offset unfavorable currency movements. Additionally, certain U.S. and Canada products also had midyear adjustments in 2020 as a result of product launches, such as the new [ radar ] in May of last year. 
Lastly, the current low inventory levels across the industry have led to lower overall incentive spending, thus boosting net price realization. We do anticipate net price realization to moderate closer to normal levels towards the second half of the year.  
Shifting focus to small ag and turf on Slide 6. Net sales were up 27%, totaling $2.515 billion in the first quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 6 points while currency translation was positive by 2 points. For the quarter, operating profit was $469 million, resulting in an 18.6% operating margin for the division compared to a 7.9% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was due to higher shipment volumes, positive sales mix and price realization, while results for the prior period were affected by voluntary employee separation expenses of about $36 million.  
Slide 7 shows our industry outlooks for Ag & Turf markets globally. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up between 15% and 20% for the year, reflecting improved fundamentals in the ag sector. Our outlook is guided in part by the results of our early order programs and tractor order book. Our crop care early order program, which ended in October, finished with unit orders up double digits compared to the prior year. In addition, we completed our combine early order program in January, with results also up double digits and outpacing the results of our crop care program.  
Furthermore, our large tractor order book now extends into the fourth quarter and has an increased production schedule relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect industry sales of small ag and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up about 5%. Deere's forecasted production will be higher than the industry, reflecting our plans to increase inventory levels in small ag, which ended the year at historic lows.  
Moving on to Europe. The industry outlook is forecast to be up about 5% as higher commodity prices strengthened business conditions in the arable segment, offsetting some weakness in dairy and livestock. Importantly, our tractor order book in [ Monheim ] now extends into the fourth quarter, providing good visibility through much of fiscal year '21. Furthermore, we've seen continued progress executing our regional strategy focused on large and precision ag.  
In South America, we expect an industry sales increase of about 10%. The confluence of higher commodity prices, strong production and a favorable currency environment have boosted profitability of farmers, driving equipment demand for the year. Despite limited government financing programs, private debt is more widely available this year, supporting continued strength in equipment demand. Industry sales in Asia are forecast to be down slightly, though key markets for Deere are performing slightly better.  
Moving on to our segment forecast on Slide 8. For production and precision ag, net sales are forecast to be between $15.5 billion and $16.5 billion in fiscal year '21. The forecast includes a currency tailwind of about 1 point and expectations of just under 6 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranged between 19.5% and 20.5%, with solid performance across the various geographical regions.  
Slide 9 shows our forecast for the small ag and turf segment. Net sales in fiscal year '21 are forecast to be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. The guidance includes expectations for 2 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency impact of about 3 points. The segment's operating margin is forecast to range between 14.5% and 15.5%.  
Now let's focus on construction and forestry on Slide 10. For the quarter, net sales of $2.467 billion were up 21%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Additionally, Wirtgen ended its practice of reporting on a 1-month lag, resulting in 4 months of Wirtgen activity in the quarter. The quarter's results were boosted by 3 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of 1 -- of about 1 point.  
Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $268 million due to higher shipment volumes and sales mix and price realization. The increase in profit was partially offset by higher production costs and impairments of long-lived assets related to an asphalt plant factory in Germany. Also keep in mind that last year's results included voluntary employee separation costs of about $24 million.  
Let's turn to our 2021 construction and forestry industry outlook on Slide 11. North American construction equipment industry sales are now forecast to be up about 5%, while sales of compact construction equipment are expected to be up about 10%. End markets for earthmoving and compact equipment have benefited primarily from the strength in the housing market as well as a modest recovery from trough conditions in the oil and gas sector. 
Furthermore, current demand levels reflect the benefit from the industry's collective response managing inventory levels tightly during the early days of the pandemic. In forestry, we now expect the industry to be up between 5% to 10% as a recovery in lumber demand, particularly in North America, is leading to increased production throughout the year.  
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 12. Deere's construction and forestry 2021 net sales are now forecast to be between $10.5 billion and $11 billion. Our net sales guidance for the year includes expectations of 2 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of about 2 points. We expect the segment's operating margin to be ranged between 10.5% and 11.5% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and nonrecurring expenses from 2020.  
Let's move now to our financial services operations on Slide 13. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the first quarter was $204 million, benefiting from favorable financing spreads, lower losses on operating leases and a lower provision for credit losses. For fiscal year 2021, the net income forecast is now $730 million. The provision for credit losses -- the provision for credit loss forecast for 2021 is 23 basis points when compared to the average portfolio managed.  
Slide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '21, our full year outlook for net income is now forecast to be between $4.6 billion to $5 billion. The guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 24% to 26%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $5 billion and contemplates a $700 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell for closing comments. Ryan?"

With respect to our outlook, we've seen underlying fundamentals continue to improve since the last quarter. Higher commodity prices and improved market access have boosted sentiment in ag markets and are reflected in the results of our early order programs and order books. In addition, we've seen further strength in demand for compact utility tractors and turf equipment as consumers continue to focus on home and landscape projects. Furthermore, those businesses are also benefiting from our channel partners' desire to boost inventory levels from historic lows. 
Meanwhile, our C&F business has benefited from a very strong housing market, a modest recovery in the oil and gas sector and the industry's proactive inventory management. While we are encouraged by some of the end market tailwinds, it is also important to point out some key risks. Dynamics in our supply base remain tight globally. While trends for COVID rates are improving, many areas are still impacted by high levels of absenteeism and are also facing growing constraints for some electronic components. To date, we've been largely successful keeping our production rates on schedule. However, we acknowledge the situation is very fluid and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 
Furthermore, prices for key raw materials such as steel have risen significantly over the last quarter, while freight and logistics costs have also experienced upward pressure. Our current forecast contemplates the impact of rising input costs and includes an additional $500 million related to material and freight. Despite these challenges, we're encouraged by the strength in our end markets, as well as the execution our employees have delivered so far this year. Our first quarter results demonstrated the highest net income and equipment operations margins in the history of the company. While we are still in the early phases of executing our new operating model, we are encouraged by the progress made so far. Importantly, we are seeing the benefits of our new agile structure, allowing us to make decisions quickly and operate more efficiently.  
I'd like to close with some perspective on our recent efforts driving sustainability. Our vision is that John Deere customers will lead their industry by becoming the world's most profitable and sustainable businesses. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver this for our customers. Our continued technology advancements allow our customers to make every seed, every drop and every hour count. This makes their operations more sustainable and have less impact on the environment while also saving them time and money.  
Earlier this month, we released our 2020 Sustainability Report. In it, we highlighted how our precision technologies are already making our customers more sustainable and productive. Using technologies like AutoTrac, Section Control, ExactApply, ExactEmerge, TruSet and Combine Advisor, our corn and soybean customers use less fuel, save time, apply less herbicides and fertilizers and emit less greenhouse gases throughout their production cycles.  
A John Deere customer farming 6,500 acres in the Midwest can lower their greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis by the equivalent of nearly 1 million passenger vehicle miles driven just by incorporating these technologies into their operations. At the same time, these 6 technologies are improving the economics of our customers' businesses. Less inputs translates into lower costs. In addition to reducing inputs, our approach also translates into higher yields. 
Taken together, this suite of technologies available today can conservatively deliver savings of $40 per acre to our customers. These outcomes scaled across our platform of global engaged acres provides an opportunity unlike any other for us to impact the sustainability and productivity of our customers' operation.  
On the earthmoving and roadbuilding side of the business, we are also making progress in delivering our customers the tools to operate in a more sustainable manner. For example, our grade control technology delivers significant time and material savings through automating control of the edge of the bulldozer. This ultimately translates into cost savings for our customers through reduced labor costs, reduced fuel usage and reduced asphalt costs. These same reductions translate into lower greenhouse gases emitted and less natural resources utilized on each job.  
Our roadbuilding business is leading the industry in both efficiency and sustainability in repaving technology with its cold recycler. Cold recycling reuses the existing materials of a roadway, significantly minimizing the cost and environmental impact of repaving. While the traditional process of repaving involves milling up the old pavement, hauling the old materials away and hauling new materials to the work site, the Wirtgen cold recycler enables the old asphalt from the existing roadway to be mixed with additives on site to be reused. This technology can increase the life of the roadway while utilizing 90% less material and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 12 million passenger miles driven per job.  
These are just a few examples of technologies that are already making an impact on sustainability. And what we're most excited about is that despite the multi-decade investment we've already made, we are still just getting started on this journey. As we look to our future technology road map, we will enable our customers to do more with even less as well as adapt to the dynamic future -- dynamic nature of weather patterns, consumer trends and the global regulatory environment.  
In addition to our industry-leading equipment and technology stack, we have one of the most collaborative data platforms in the industry. And we're exploring ways that data can help our customers participate in new markets and programs that reward our customers for incorporating sustainable practices into their operations. Our tools will allow customers to demonstrate the impact of their sustainable outcomes, enabling them to tap into new markets for revenue and financing. The key will be giving growers the ability to seamlessly document the appropriate data and provide them with the digital tools to confidently evaluate agronomic and business trade-offs.  
As we look ahead, our biggest opportunity lies in delivering solutions that make our customers more productive and sustainable. But we also remain committed to running our own operations in a sustainable and socially responsible manner. In that regard, we continue making progress toward our 2022 sustainability goals. We have steadily reduced the greenhouse gas emissions from our own facilities, and we have leveraged important partnerships to convert a significant portion of our electricity footprint to renewable sources.  
We are improving our water practices around the world, exploring new and innovative ways for recycling waste at our facilities and through our new strategic focus on our aftermarket business, we'll continue to grow and expand our portfolio of remanufactured products. And we can only deliver on this opportunity if we have a diverse and highly engaged workforce. Employee safety is and always has been of the highest important to us. And throughout 2020, we took action to ensure that our employees were protected and had the proper tools to do their jobs effectively and safely. We also launched new strategic initiatives that are focused on leading and lagging indicators that are designed to enable continuous measurement of safety performance and drive continuous improvement. 
We know that diverse teams working together result in better ideas and better solutions. Therefore, we are committed to improving diversity at our company. To do this, we are partnering with key universities and professional organizations in order to recruit diverse talent, and we are providing employees the opportunity to connect with others that have common experiences through our employee resource groups. Moving forward, we will continue to attract, retain and develop employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences as it will be critical to delivering sustainable outcomes for all of our stakeholders."

I would say, I mean, when you think about the -- what we've seen from production and precision ag, when you think about mix, it's -- as titled, that's essentially large ag and you're seeing the continued integration of precision ag in that. So I think that's one of the things that -- as we separated these and we think about how we're segmenting, is we're seeing a much probably cleaner view of pure -- what is precision ag and production ag, so the integration of machinery and technology. 
I think as it relates to the performance, I mean, certainly, we saw volume pick up. Price, as Brent noted, was a significant driver in the quarter. And that was on a number of different variables. But we saw the benefits of above average, just normal price increases. Pretty significant adjustments we've made over the last year in overseas markets as it related to currency and some new products that came in middle of the year. So you're seeing that impact. 
And then as noted, the benefit of low inventory and strong demand driving lower incentive spending. So as I think about it, I think those would be the biggest drivers, particularly in the quarter. As it relates to things like R&D, we're -- timing-wise, we're probably skewed a little bit to the later part of the year. That's just timing on programs.  
And probably worth noting, when you think about that performance ex the Brazil tax item, production and precision ag did about 19.5%. And we'll continue to see, as a percent of sales, higher R&D in that segment compared to the rest of the business. So thanks, Brett."

We've seen sales move up as a result of that. And we've done things. We've added production. We've added some shifts in some of our large facilities, places like Waterloo, for example, and in some of our facilities in South America as well. So we have made those adjustments.
The real challenge, and Ryan mentioned this, is on the supply side. There are components and parts that continue to be tight from a supply point of view. So we're managing those really tightly. Supply management group is working really hard with suppliers day-to-day. Some components are week-to-week in terms of what we're seeing from an availability point of view. So those are tight. So to the extent we continue to see demand, we'll try to work to react to that to the upside, but acknowledge it's a tight environment as it relates to some key components. 
Relative to price, and I think what we're seeing on the price side, certainly, we see -- we're seeing strong price this year, about 6 points for the year for production and precision ag. I think what is happening there, when you think about not just price but what's happening with price and mix, is we're continuing to see average selling prices of our large ag machinery growing, and that's through the continued integration of technology and solutions into that business. So that pattern and trend has continued. And as we continue to be able to deliver those outcomes, and we talked a little bit about it from both a sustainability and economic point of view, that is driving real value to customers. And we're seeing that as it relates to adoption and continuing to see the trends across most of our large ag machinery in terms of adoption of the latest tools."

And as that continues to adopt and our customers continue to adopt that, you get a higher software mix in our margin profile. So that's another factor. To Josh's point on average selling prices going up, that's true, but also those selling prices include a richer mix of software."

I'm wondering if you could just comment on that specifically. And then can you touch on, as we think about cycle over cycle margin performance for production and precision ag, how much of a tailwind are you folks thinking about in your long-term margin targets from the rising adoption rates of software and precision ag that you outlined?"

As it relates to kind of the incremental benefit we see, I think that couple of points, 2, 3 points of range is still very, very fair in terms of what we've been experiencing. The opportunities as we go forward to continue to see that or to see that move, I think, are there, as you think about increasing, seeing more sensing and acting in the field. 
So you think about things like See & Spray that we've talked a lot about, but we see opportunities to go beyond that, beyond herbicides into things like fungicides, pesticides, other fertilizers and into other jobs, other machine forms, planting, for example. And as we've talked about in the past, we were also -- as we continue down the automation journey, we're getting closer and closer to full autonomy. So I say all those things to point out, as we do those things, those create more opportunity to drive revenue as well as a more recurring base of revenue that we can add value job to job, pass to pass. 
As it relates to kind of where we're at cycle-wise and what does this mean for production and precision ag margins, today, what we'd say is we're just above, call it, 105% of mid-cycle for production and precision ag and middle of the range margins around 20%.
So context-wise, we compare that back to 2013, that's when we were at, from a large ag perspective, well above peak with roughly 16% margins at that time. So we're doing higher margins on lower sales and, I think, feel really good about the opportunity. And the things I mentioned earlier in terms of what drives opportunities for us, those continue to be strong tailwinds with lots of runway. Thanks, Jerry."

I think when we think about the cycle, we're certainly coming into this where we've seen demand inflect here over, call it, the last 3, 4 months, coming into in a position of very low new inventories, very low used inventories. So that dynamic has certainly helped in terms of the starting point and the tightness we're seeing in overall inventory levels. 
I think the lessons learned from the past cycle certainly play into that. How do we make sure we're not pulling additional customers in, pulling ahead demand potentially that would have occurred later on? And I think as we look at 2021 right now, with the demand that we're seeing, our order books, large tractors, for example, are into the fourth quarter. And with the early order programs, they account for nearly the entire full year production. 
So I think we've got really good visibility. But I think that it's a good indicator of the replacement demand that we've been expecting and have thought we would see over the last couple of years coming to fruition here.

And I think a starting point is some of the actions we've taken from executing the new strategy, I think we're seeing the benefits in small ag and turf. A number of the exits or closures that we did in fiscal '20 are benefiting us there. And those were mostly in the small ag and turf part of the business. So that focus is definitely helping. 
I think we're seeing really strong execution. Again, the benefit of moving from underproducing to slightly overproducing on small tractors helps. The pricing point of view is solid as well. I mean when you think about small tractors and turf, those are going to be pushing much higher than, call it, that kind of between 105% and 110% of mid-cycle so there's benefit there as well. 
Also embedded in that is a large portion of small ag and turf is in Europe, which tended to be a more stable market. So we see a little bit less volatility there, and we've seen some strength in that market, which have been beneficial as well."

And then maybe on the lower end, something like ExactEmerge, which is in the low 40s percent. So varying degrees in terms of how deeply engaged our farmers are across all of those jobs. But we think that's increasingly where we see the opportunity to drive that value. 
And particularly, when you start to think about additional opportunities, Ryan mentioned this a little bit, as you start to think about the combination of carbon markets or differentiating crops because of the practices that are utilized, and then our position of, one, executing the jobs, but two, having the operations center that documents those and can provide that information very, very seamlessly, we think that creates a pretty significant opportunity for our customers. 
So when you think about not only the technology that we have in place today, those that are coming and then what feels like just a burgeoning opportunity for some additional revenue, I think, well positions our customers, and we feel like we're in a really good spot to be able to unlock and enable that.

So that's just a bit of a caveat to say there's still a big opportunity in North America. 
I think we're seeing it grow -- the adoption grow in places like South America. Brazil, in particular, we've seen pretty significant growth in engaged acres. Last year, I think we were up something like 60% in Latin America. So continuing to grow there. And I think when you think about some of the challenges based there, double crops, as well as the opportunity to get more efficient there, that will continue to grow. 
And we're seeing our dealers embrace that as well. When you think about -- they've got now over 40 digital operation centers that are supporting their customer fleets. As we unlock the challenge of connectivity, that's a huge opportunity for us. And we've done a couple of things over the last couple of years, most recently, an agreement with Claro to provide access, better connectivity and bandwidth. We think that unlocks even more potential for the use of those tools. 
Europe, there's historically been a lot of guidance. And I think we're starting to see some of that turn and shift towards more connectivity. Engaged acres grew there last year significantly, like triple digits. And as you think about the potential impact of regulatory environments coming in Europe first but probably other parts of the world, the appetite for precision agriculture and some of our tools, when you think about spray and others, will be particularly important as we go forward there. So continuing to grow, feel really good about the position we're in and I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity. Thanks, Chad."

So if you think about kind of the low double-digit increases we saw in planters and sprayers, that was mostly well ahead of kind of the inflection we saw here in the fall. So I think obviously a lot to play out, but that bodes well there. But we haven't adjusted timing at this point. 
As it relates to the sales increase from former A&T in the production and precision ag and small ag and turf, really, the percentage increases are pretty similar. So if we look at those businesses year-over-year, they're both up, call it, roughly 20%. So pretty balanced between the 2 in terms of the increase we saw compared to a quarter ago.

But of the $500 million, the majority are well more than half of that is PPA, production and precision ag. Where we see that on the low end, it's small ag and turf where we have the smallest portion of that impacting those businesses.
As it relates to price, historically, we've not taken price solely based on commodities. We try to do that and be disciplined in our approach to price and pricing for value and those sorts of things. So at this point, we haven't contemplated that. I mean if we step back and look overall, the price we're getting is offsetting -- more than offsetting the material but does certainly have a drag on incrementals as we go through the remainder of the year. And timing-wise, I'd say it's pretty balanced over the course of the remaining 3 quarters. 
So with that, I think we'll wrap up. We appreciate everyone's time and look forward to catching up with everyone. Thank you."

Ag fundamentals improved significantly throughout the first quarter, and the improved sentiment is reflected in the most recent status of our order books and early order programs. Meanwhile, markets for our construction and forestry division also improved in the first quarter, leading to improved levels of profitability and a heightened outlook for the rest of the year.  
Slide 3 shows the results for the first quarter. Net sales and revenue were up 19% to $9.1 billion while net sales for the equipment operations were up 23% to just over $8 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.224 billion or $3.87 per diluted share. During the first quarter of 2021, the company recorded impairments totaling $50 million pretax to certain long-lived assets. These impairments were more than offset by a favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil of $58 million pretax. In comparison to last year, the quarter also benefited from minimal employee separation costs, which represented $127 million pretax in the first quarter of 2020.  
Before transitioning to a review of our business divisions, I'd like to highlight a few changes to our segment reporting, as shown on Slide 4. As you probably already noticed in our press release, the company implemented a new segment reporting structure beginning in fiscal year 2021 to align with the most -- to align with the recent implementation of the new strategy and operating model which was announced last summer. As a result, the company's Agriculture & Turf operation was bifurcated into 2 new segments. The production and precision agriculture segment is responsible for developing and delivering global equipment and technology solutions for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton and sugar. Main products include large and certain midsized tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters, seeding and application equipment.  
The small agriculture and turf segment is responsible for developing and delivering market-driven products to support midsized and small growers as well as turf customers. The operations are principally organized to support production systems for dairy and livestock, high-value crops and turf and utility operators. Primary products include certain midsized and small tractors as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment and utility vehicles. There were no reporting changes for the construction and forestry and financial services segments. As a result, the company will now report across these 4 segments.  
Now let's turn to a review of our production and precision ag business, starting on Slide 5. Net sales of $3.069 billion were up 22% compared to the first quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 8 points while currency translation was negative by 1 point. Operating profit was $643 million, resulting in a 21% operating margin for the division compared to an 8.7% margin for the same period last year.
The year-over-year increase was driven by positive price realization, higher shipment volumes and sales mix and a $53 million favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil. These items were partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange. Excluding the impact of onetime items such as the favorable tax ruling, first quarter margins were around 19.5%. Also, when comparing to last year, keep in mind that the results in the prior period included employee separation costs of $42 million.  
With respect to price realization, the above-average results for the quarter were primarily driven by a few different factors. While North American list prices were up slightly above average, the primary drivers of price came from significant midyear price adjustments made in 2020 for select foreign markets to offset unfavorable currency movements. Additionally, certain U.S. and Canada products also had midyear adjustments in 2020 as a result of product launches, such as the new 8R in May of last year. 
Lastly, the current low inventory levels across the industry have led to lower overall incentive spending, thus boosting net price realization. We do anticipate net price realization to moderate closer to normal levels towards the second half of the year.  
Shifting focus to small ag and turf on Slide 6. Net sales were up 27%, totaling $2.515 billion in the first quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 6 points while currency translation was positive by 2 points. For the quarter, operating profit was $469 million, resulting in an 18.6% operating margin for the division compared to a 7.9% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was due to higher shipment volumes, positive sales mix and price realization, while results for the prior period were affected by voluntary employee separation expenses of about $36 million.  
Slide 7 shows our industry outlooks for Ag & Turf markets globally. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up between 15% and 20% for the year, reflecting improved fundamentals in the ag sector. Our outlook is guided in part by the results of our early order programs and tractor order book. Our crop care early order program, which ended in October, finished with unit orders up double digits compared to the prior year. In addition, we completed our combine early order program in January, with results also up double digits and outpacing the results of our crop care program.  
Furthermore, our large tractor order book now extends into the fourth quarter and has an increased production schedule relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect industry sales of small ag and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up about 5%. Deere's forecasted production will be higher than the industry, reflecting our plans to increase inventory levels in small ag, which ended the year at historic lows.  
Moving on to Europe. The industry outlook is forecast to be up about 5% as higher commodity prices strengthened business conditions in the arable segment, offsetting some weakness in dairy and livestock. Importantly, our tractor order book in Mannheim now extends into the fourth quarter, providing good visibility through much of fiscal year '21. Furthermore, we've seen continued progress executing our regional strategy focused on large and precision ag.  
In South America, we expect an industry sales increase of about 10%. The confluence of higher commodity prices, strong production and a favorable currency environment have boosted profitability of farmers, driving equipment demand for the year. Despite limited government financing programs, private debt is more widely available this year, supporting continued strength in equipment demand. Industry sales in Asia are forecast to be down slightly, though key markets for Deere are performing slightly better.  
Moving on to our segment forecast on Slide 8. For production and precision ag, net sales are forecast to be between $15.5 billion and $16.5 billion in fiscal year '21. The forecast includes a currency tailwind of about 1 point and expectations of just under 6 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranged between 19.5% and 20.5%, with solid performance across the various geographical regions.  
Slide 9 shows our forecast for the small ag and turf segment. Net sales in fiscal year '21 are forecast to be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion. The guidance includes expectations for 2 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency impact of about 3 points. The segment's operating margin is forecast to range between 14.5% and 15.5%.  
Now let's focus on construction and forestry on Slide 10. For the quarter, net sales of $2.467 billion were up 21%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Additionally, Wirtgen ended its practice of reporting on a 1-month lag, resulting in 4 months of Wirtgen activity in the quarter. The quarter's results were boosted by 3 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of 1 -- of about 1 point.  
Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $268 million due to higher shipment volumes and sales mix and price realization. The increase in profit was partially offset by higher production costs and impairments of long-lived assets related to an asphalt plant factory in Germany. Also keep in mind that last year's results included voluntary employee separation costs of about $24 million.  
Let's turn to our 2021 construction and forestry industry outlook on Slide 11. North American construction equipment industry sales are now forecast to be up about 5%, while sales of compact construction equipment are expected to be up about 10%. End markets for earthmoving and compact equipment have benefited primarily from the strength in the housing market as well as a modest recovery from trough conditions in the oil and gas sector. 
Furthermore, current demand levels reflect the benefit from the industry's collective response managing inventory levels tightly during the early days of the pandemic. In forestry, we now expect the industry to be up between 5% to 10% as a recovery in lumber demand, particularly in North America, is leading to increased production throughout the year.  
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 12. Deere's construction and forestry 2021 net sales are now forecast to be between $10.5 billion and $11 billion. Our net sales guidance for the year includes expectations of 2 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of about 2 points. We expect the segment's operating margin to be ranged between 10.5% and 11.5% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and nonrecurring expenses from 2020.  
Let's move now to our financial services operations on Slide 13. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the first quarter was $204 million, benefiting from favorable financing spreads, lower losses on operating leases and a lower provision for credit losses. For fiscal year 2021, the net income forecast is now $730 million. The provision for credit losses -- the provision for credit loss forecast for 2021 is 23 basis points when compared to the average portfolio managed.  
Slide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '21, our full year outlook for net income is now forecast to be between $4.6 billion to $5 billion. The guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 24% to 26%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $5 billion and contemplates a $700 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell for closing comments. Ryan?"

With respect to our outlook, we've seen underlying fundamentals continue to improve since the last quarter. Higher commodity prices and improved market access have boosted sentiment in ag markets and are reflected in the results of our early order programs and order books. In addition, we've seen further strength in demand for compact utility tractors and turf equipment as consumers continue to focus on home and landscape projects. Furthermore, those businesses are also benefiting from our channel partners' desire to boost inventory levels from historic lows. 
Meanwhile, our C&F business has benefited from a very strong housing market, a modest recovery in the oil and gas sector and the industry's proactive inventory management. While we are encouraged by some of the end market tailwinds, it is also important to point out some key risks. Dynamics in our supply base remain tight globally. While trends for COVID rates are improving, many areas are still impacted by high levels of absenteeism and are also facing growing constraints for some electronic components. To date, we've been largely successful keeping our production rates on schedule. However, we acknowledge the situation is very fluid and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 
Furthermore, prices for key raw materials such as steel have risen significantly over the last quarter, while freight and logistics costs have also experienced upward pressure. Our current forecast contemplates the impact of rising input costs and includes an additional $500 million related to material and freight. Despite these challenges, we're encouraged by the strength in our end markets, as well as the execution our employees have delivered so far this year. Our first quarter results demonstrated the highest net income and equipment operations margins in the history of the company. While we are still in the early phases of executing our new operating model, we are encouraged by the progress made so far. Importantly, we are seeing the benefits of our new agile structure, allowing us to make decisions quickly and operate more efficiently.  
I'd like to close with some perspective on our recent efforts driving sustainability. Our vision is that John Deere customers will lead their industry by becoming the world's most profitable and sustainable businesses. We believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver this for our customers. Our continued technology advancements allow our customers to make every seed, every drop and every hour count. This makes their operations more sustainable and have less impact on the environment while also saving them time and money.  
Earlier this month, we released our 2020 Sustainability Report. In it, we highlighted how our precision technologies are already making our customers more sustainable and productive. Using technologies like AutoTrac, Section Control, ExactApply, ExactEmerge, TruSet and Combine Advisor, our corn and soybean customers use less fuel, save time, apply less herbicides and fertilizers and emit less greenhouse gases throughout their production cycles.  
A John Deere customer farming 6,500 acres in the Midwest can lower their greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis by the equivalent of nearly 1 million passenger vehicle miles driven just by incorporating these technologies into their operations. At the same time, these 6 technologies are improving the economics of our customers' businesses. Less inputs translates into lower costs. In addition to reducing inputs, our approach also translates into higher yields. 
Taken together, this suite of technologies available today can conservatively deliver savings of $40 per acre to our customers. These outcomes scaled across our platform of global engaged acres provides an opportunity unlike any other for us to impact the sustainability and productivity of our customers' operation.  
On the earthmoving and roadbuilding side of the business, we are also making progress in delivering our customers the tools to operate in a more sustainable manner. For example, our grade control technology delivers significant time and material savings through automating control of the edge of the bulldozer. This ultimately translates into cost savings for our customers through reduced labor costs, reduced fuel usage and reduced asphalt costs. These same reductions translate into lower greenhouse gases emitted and less natural resources utilized on each job.  
Our roadbuilding business is leading the industry in both efficiency and sustainability in repaving technology with its cold recycler. Cold recycling reuses the existing materials of a roadway, significantly minimizing the cost and environmental impact of repaving. While the traditional process of repaving involves milling up the old pavement, hauling the old materials away and hauling new materials to the work site, the Wirtgen cold recycler enables the old asphalt from the existing roadway to be mixed with additives on site to be reused. This technology can increase the life of the roadway while utilizing 90% less material and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 12 million passenger miles driven per job.  
These are just a few examples of technologies that are already making an impact on sustainability. And what we're most excited about is that despite the multi-decade investment we've already made, we are still just getting started on this journey. As we look to our future technology road map, we will enable our customers to do more with even less as well as adapt to the dynamic future -- dynamic nature of weather patterns, consumer trends and the global regulatory environment.  
In addition to our industry-leading equipment and technology stack, we have one of the most collaborative data platforms in the industry. And we're exploring ways that data can help our customers participate in new markets and programs that reward our customers for incorporating sustainable practices into their operations. Our tools will allow customers to demonstrate the impact of their sustainable outcomes, enabling them to tap into new markets for revenue and financing. The key will be giving growers the ability to seamlessly document the appropriate data and provide them with the digital tools to confidently evaluate agronomic and business trade-offs.  
As we look ahead, our biggest opportunity lies in delivering solutions that make our customers more productive and sustainable. But we also remain committed to running our own operations in a sustainable and socially responsible manner. In that regard, we continue making progress toward our 2022 sustainability goals. We have steadily reduced the greenhouse gas emissions from our own facilities, and we have leveraged important partnerships to convert a significant portion of our electricity footprint to renewable sources.  
We are improving our water practices around the world, exploring new and innovative ways for recycling waste at our facilities and through our new strategic focus on our aftermarket business, we'll continue to grow and expand our portfolio of remanufactured products. And we can only deliver on this opportunity if we have a diverse and highly engaged workforce. Employee safety is and always has been of the highest important to us. And throughout 2020, we took action to ensure that our employees were protected and had the proper tools to do their jobs effectively and safely. We also launched new strategic initiatives that are focused on leading and lagging indicators that are designed to enable continuous measurement of safety performance and drive continuous improvement. 
We know that diverse teams working together result in better ideas and better solutions. Therefore, we are committed to improving diversity at our company. To do this, we are partnering with key universities and professional organizations in order to recruit diverse talent, and we are providing employees the opportunity to connect with others that have common experiences through our employee resource groups. Moving forward, we will continue to attract, retain and develop employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences as it will be critical to delivering sustainable outcomes for all of our stakeholders."

I would say, I mean, when you think about the -- what we've seen from production and precision ag, when you think about mix, it's -- as titled, that's essentially large ag and you're seeing the continued integration of precision ag in that. So I think that's one of the things that -- as we separated these and we think about how we're segmenting, is we're seeing a much probably cleaner view of pure -- what is precision ag and production ag, so the integration of machinery and technology. 
I think as it relates to the performance, I mean, certainly, we saw volume pick up. Price, as Brent noted, was a significant driver in the quarter. And that was on a number of different variables. But we saw the benefits of above average, just normal price increases. Pretty significant adjustments we've made over the last year in overseas markets as it related to currency and some new products that came in middle of the year. So you're seeing that impact. 
And then as noted, the benefit of low inventory and strong demand driving lower incentive spending. So as I think about it, I think those would be the biggest drivers, particularly in the quarter. As it relates to things like R&D, we're -- timing-wise, we're probably skewed a little bit to the later part of the year. That's just timing on programs.  
And probably worth noting, when you think about that performance ex the Brazil tax item, production and precision ag did about 19.5%. And we'll continue to see, as a percent of sales, higher R&D in that segment compared to the rest of the business. So thanks, Brett."

I'm just wondering how much more opportunity there is to take up production, assuming markets continue to be favorable."

We've seen sales move up as a result of that. And we've done things. We've added production. We've added some shifts in some of our large facilities, places like Waterloo, for example, and in some of our facilities in South America as well. So we have made those adjustments.
The real challenge, and Ryan mentioned this, is on the supply side. There are components and parts that continue to be tight from a supply point of view. So we're managing those really tightly. Supply management group is working really hard with suppliers day-to-day. Some components are week-to-week in terms of what we're seeing from an availability point of view. So those are tight. So to the extent we continue to see demand, we'll try to work to react to that to the upside, but acknowledge it's a tight environment as it relates to some key components. 
Relative to price, and I think what we're seeing on the price side, certainly, we see -- we're seeing strong price this year, about 6 points for the year for production and precision ag. I think what is happening there, when you think about not just price but what's happening with price and mix, is we're continuing to see average selling prices of our large ag machinery growing, and that's through the continued integration of technology and solutions into that business. So that pattern and trend has continued. And as we continue to be able to deliver those outcomes, and we talked a little bit about it from both a sustainability and economic point of view, that is driving real value to customers. And we're seeing that as it relates to adoption and continuing to see the trends across most of our large ag machinery in terms of adoption of the latest tools."

And as that continues to adopt and our customers continue to adopt that, you get a higher software mix in our margin profile. So that's another factor. To Josh's point on average selling prices going up, that's true, but also those selling prices include a richer mix of software."

I'm wondering if you could just comment on that specifically. And then can you touch on, as we think about cycle over cycle margin performance for production and precision ag, how much of a tailwind are you folks thinking about in your long-term margin targets from the rising adoption rates of software and precision ag that you outlined?"

As it relates to kind of the incremental benefit we see, I think that couple of points, 2, 3 points of range is still very, very fair in terms of what we've been experiencing. The opportunities as we go forward to continue to see that or to see that move, I think, are there, as you think about increasing, seeing more sensing and acting in the field. 
So you think about things like See & Spray that we've talked a lot about, but we see opportunities to go beyond that, beyond herbicides into things like fungicides, pesticides, other fertilizers and into other jobs, other machine forms, planting, for example. And as we've talked about in the past, we were also -- as we continue down the automation journey, we're getting closer and closer to full autonomy. So I say all those things to point out, as we do those things, those create more opportunity to drive revenue as well as a more recurring base of revenue that we can add value job to job, pass to pass. 
As it relates to kind of where we're at cycle-wise and what does this mean for production and precision ag margins, today, what we'd say is we're just above, call it, 105% of mid-cycle for production and precision ag and middle of the range margins around 20%.
So context-wise, we compare that back to 2013, that's when we were at, from a large ag perspective, well above peak with roughly 16% margins at that time. So we're doing higher margins on lower sales and, I think, feel really good about the opportunity. And the things I mentioned earlier in terms of what drives opportunities for us, those continue to be strong tailwinds with lots of runway. Thanks, Jerry."

I think the lessons learned from the past cycle certainly play into that. How do we make sure we're not pulling additional customers in, pulling ahead demand potentially that would have occurred later on? And I think as we look at 2021 right now, with the demand that we're seeing, our order books, large tractors, for example, are into the fourth quarter. And with the early order programs, they account for nearly the entire full year production. 
So I think we've got really good visibility. But I think that it's a good indicator of the replacement demand that we've been expecting and have thought we would see over the last couple of years coming to fruition here.

As it relates to incremental margins, historically, we've talked about in the past, Ag & Turf being 30 to 35 kind of depending on how our mix fell.

I think this year, particularly small ag and turf, we're seeing a pretty strong benefit of what was, as you look at small tractors in particular, really significant underproduction last year of retail, and we intend to build a little bit of inventory this year, so you're seeing a little bit of swing there, so that swing from underproducing to overproducing definitely benefits the margin profile as well.

I think we're seeing really strong execution. Again, the benefit of moving from underproducing to slightly overproducing on small tractors helps. The pricing point of view is solid as well. I mean when you think about small tractors and turf, those are going to be pushing much higher than, call it, that kind of between 105% and 110% of mid-cycle so there's benefit there as well.

Thanks, Kristen. It's a great point. I mean I think as we look across those different technologies, there's a varying range of adoption individually, where at the highest end, you'd think about something like guidance, which would be very, very highly adopted. And then maybe on the lower end, something like ExactEmerge, which is in the low 40s percent. So varying degrees in terms of how deeply engaged our farmers are across all of those jobs. But we think that's increasingly where we see the opportunity to drive that value. 
And particularly, when you start to think about additional opportunities, Ryan mentioned this a little bit, as you start to think about the combination of carbon markets or differentiating crops because of the practices that are utilized, and then our position of, one, executing the jobs, but two, having the operations center that documents those and can provide that information very, very seamlessly, we think that creates a pretty significant opportunity for our customers. 
So when you think about not only the technology that we have in place today, those that are coming and then what feels like just a burgeoning opportunity for some additional revenue, I think, well positions our customers, and we feel like we're in a really good spot to be able to unlock and enable that. Thanks, Kristen."

So that's just a bit of a caveat to say there's still a big opportunity in North America. 
I think we're seeing it grow -- the adoption grow in places like South America. Brazil, in particular, we've seen pretty significant growth in engaged acres. Last year, I think we were up something like 60% in Latin America. So continuing to grow there. And I think when you think about some of the challenges based there, double crops, as well as the opportunity to get more efficient there, that will continue to grow. 
And we're seeing our dealers embrace that as well. When you think about -- they've got now over 40 digital operation centers that are supporting their customer fleets. As we unlock the challenge of connectivity, that's a huge opportunity for us. And we've done a couple of things over the last couple of years, most recently, an agreement with Claro to provide access, better connectivity and bandwidth. We think that unlocks even more potential for the use of those tools. 
Europe, there's historically been a lot of guidance. And I think we're starting to see some of that turn and shift towards more connectivity. Engaged acres grew there last year significantly, like triple digits. And as you think about the potential impact of regulatory environments coming in Europe first but probably other parts of the world, the appetite for precision agriculture and some of our tools, when you think about spray and others, will be particularly important as we go forward there. So continuing to grow, feel really good about the position we're in and I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity. Thanks, Chad."

And the other question is, we don't have the baseline for the new segments within Ag & Turf. Of the revenue increase that you put into A&T -- I thought it was impressive that on those incremental sales, the incremental margin is 44% so it's pretty impressive.

But you bring up a really good point in that when we -- by the time we close our crop care early order programs, that was we were just beginning to see the inflection. So if you think about kind of the low double-digit increases we saw in planters and sprayers, that was mostly well ahead of kind of the inflection we saw here in the fall. So I think obviously a lot to play out, but that bodes well there. But we haven't adjusted timing at this point. 
As it relates to the sales increase from former A&T in the production and precision ag and small ag and turf, really, the percentage increases are pretty similar. So if we look at those businesses year-over-year, they're both up, call it, roughly 20%. So pretty balanced between the 2 in terms of the increase we saw compared to a quarter ago.

It was pretty much the extra month was kind of in line with where they were running for the quarter, so no significant change there. Didn't necessarily impact their overall guidance or the division's total guidance. 
I mean I think when you think about our roadbuilding business, I think we feel really good about what we're seeing there. Overall, we expect that to be up about 20% in this fiscal year. About half of that is the extra month. So say, underlying business up about 10%. And when we look at the core roadbuilding business, we feel like the margins that they're delivering are where we'd expect them to be. So as we talked about, feel like that business is a mid-teens business. We're executing along those lines and feel really good about how that's progressing. 
I think when you step back overall C&F, certainly, we think there's an opportunity as Wirtgen continues to perform that, that will pull up margins. Technology opportunity for us as well in Construction & Forestry, we're very early on and think about how do we integrate that. We think that will drive performance there as well. We highlighted just an example on grade control and what that can do from a customer economic and sustainable impacts as well. So those are types of things we're looking at, obstacle detection. There's a few things that we feel like we can nearly copy-paste into that division to drive better performance and continuing to be very focused on operations and executing very, very tightly in what is a volatile, somewhat cyclical business."

So at this point, we haven't contemplated that.

Let's start with second quarter results for Production & Precision Ag on Slide 4. Net sales of $4.529 billion were up 35% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realiz",1368,"Thanks, Brent. Let's start with second quarter results for Production & Precision Ag on Slide 4. Net sales of $4.529 billion were up 35% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 9 points, while currency translation was positive by 2 points. Operating profit was just over $1 billion, resulting in a 22% operating margin for the segment compared to a 17% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by price realization and higher shipment volumes and sales mix. These items were partially offset by higher production costs. 
With respect to price realization, the above-average results for the quarter were primarily driven by a few different factors. The primary driver of price came from significant midyear adjustments made last year and this year for select foreign markets to offset unfavorable currency movements, which resulted in low double-digit price realization for markets outside of North America. North American list prices were up slightly above average and benefited from prices for new product launches during 2020. Lastly, the current low inventory levels across the industry have led to lower overall incentive spending, thus boosting net price realization. We do anticipate net price realization to moderate some in the second half of the year. 
Shifting focus to small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 30%, totaling $3.39 billion in the second quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 6 points, while currency translation was positive by 4 points. For the quarter, operating profit was $648 million, resulting in a 19% operating margin for the segment compared to an 8.7% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was due to higher shipment volumes and sales mix, price realization and the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange. These items were partially offset by higher production costs. 
Before moving on to our industry forecast for regional ag markets, I'd like to first offer some perspective on the current global ag environment beginning on Slide 6. Over the course of the last 9 months, fundamentals for large ag production systems have steadily improved, driving stronger economic results for our customers and enhanced visibility for our equipment order books. Global stocks of grain have tightened significantly this year on account of multiple factors such as increased Chinese grain imports and recovery in ethanol usage and weather-related production losses in South America. For a second consecutive year, we expect grain and oilseed consumption to outpace supply, supporting fundamentals in the next marketing year. 
While government support is expected to decrease this year, principal crop cash receipts in the U.S. are forecast to increase 30%, with improvements in commodity prices more than offsetting the decline in government aid. In addition to higher cash receipts, U.S. customer sentiment has benefited from better market access over the last few quarters with elevated exports to China. Given the positive environmental backdrop, order activity is up significantly. and all of our large ag order banks are now complete through the end of the fiscal year. For select product lines such as [ forward lines ] and [ ADAR ] tractors, we're now taking orders for fiscal year '22 and have visibility through the first half of the year. Furthermore, we'll open our early order program for planters and sprayers in June, which will yield some additional data points on demand for 2022. 
The current market dynamics, coupled with production constraints for the industry, point to a multiyear cycle for ag equipment. Current global inventory levels for both new and used equipment remain at historic lows. While the average age of the North American fleet is at its highest level in 2 decades, even with double-digit growth expected for the industry in '21, shipments of North American large ag equipment remain 40% less on average than the previous cycle. At this point in 2021, it's clear that demand will carry over into subsequent years due partially to limitation on the industry's production capabilities. Suppliers and logistics providers are currently stretched thin as economies begin recovering from the lows of the pandemic. Furthermore, labor markets are extremely tight, delaying efforts to ramp up. 
To date, we have experienced frequent disruptions. However, our factory managers and supply management teams have done an extraordinary job, keeping our production schedules mostly intact without yet resorting to material work stoppages. While many of these spot disruptions are on account of various supplies, procurement of semiconductor chips remains a significant risk to our production schedule for the remainder of the year. To date, our suppliers have worked diligently to ensure our products continue their vital role in providing food security and critical infrastructure. And we're cautiously optimistic that they will continue to meet demand and help us ensure continuous service to our customers.
In addition to supply constraints, we're also managing through significant inflation for both raw materials and logistics, which will continue to hit us throughout the second half of the year. Lastly, despite progress in the U.S. with respect to the pandemic, COVID remains a challenge as we face disruptions to some of our foreign operations and supply base, with India as the most recent example. As we've done since last March, we continue to work through these challenges, ensuring safe working conditions for our employees and continuous support to our customers.
Before addressing our industry outlook, I'd like to first offer my gratitude to our employees and dealers, who worked through so many unique circumstances over the last year. We owe our results to the incredible efforts of our frontline employees, who kept our factories running during the pandemic and managed to keep production schedules on time amidst various supply constraints. Similarly, our field employees and dealers keep finding ways to serve our customers and have gone above and beyond during this last year. 
Slide 7 shows our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. In U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up roughly 25% for the year, reflecting improved fundamentals in the ag sector. At this point, we anticipating producing in line with retail demand for the year, keeping inventory levels relatively tight heading into fiscal year '22. Meanwhile, we expect industry sales of small ag and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up roughly 10%. Similarly, our shipment schedules imply production roughly in line with retail demand for most products. 
Moving on to Europe, the industry is forecast to be up roughly 10% as higher commodity prices strengthened business conditions in the arable segment, offsetting some weaknesses in dairy and livestock. Our [ Monheim ] tractor order book extends through the end of the fiscal year, demonstrating continued progress towards executing our regional strategy focused on large and precision ag. In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase about 20%. The combination of higher commodity prices, strong production and a favorable currency environment have boosted profitability of farmers, driving orders through the remainder of the year. Despite limited government-sponsored financing fleet, the key markets for Deere such as India are performing slightly better. 
Moving on to our segment forecast, beginning on Slide 8. For Production and Precision Ag, net sales are forecast to be up between 25% and 30% in fiscal year '21. The forecast includes a currency tailwind of about 2 points and expectations of nearly 7 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranged between 20% and 21%, and contemplates consistent performance across the various geographical regions. 
Slide 9 shows our forecast for the Small Ag and Turf segment. Net sales in fiscal year '21 are forecast to be up between 20% and 25%. The guidance includes expectations for 3 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency impact of about 3 points. The segment's operating margin is forecast to range between 16.5% and 17.5%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Brent."

The q",512,"Thanks, Cory. Now let's focus on Construction and Forestry on Slide 10. For the quarter, net sales of $3.079 billion, were up 36%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. The quarter results were boosted by 4.5 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of about 4 points. Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $489 million, resulting in a 15.9% operating margin due to higher shipment volumes and sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. Also keep in mind that last year's results included employee separation and impairment costs totaling $85 million. 
Let's turn to our 2021 Construction & Forestry industry outlook on Slide 11. North American construction equipment industry sales are now forecast to be up between 15% and 20%, while sales of compact construction equipment are expected to be up between 20% to 25%. To date, in markets for earthmoving and compact equipment have benefited primarily from strength in the housing market as well as some recovery from trough conditions in the oil and gas sector. Additionally, we are beginning to see positive indicators for nonresidential investment as well as strengthening order activity from independent rental companies. Furthermore, current demand levels are still benefiting from the industry's collective response of managing inventories tightly during the early days of the pandemic. In forestry, we now expect the industry to be up between 15% to 20% as lumber demand remains very strong, particularly in North America. 
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 12. Deere's Construction & Forestry 2021 net sales are now forecast to be up between 25% and 30%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes expectations of about 3 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of about 2 points. We expect the segment's operating margin to be ranged between 12% to 13% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and nonrecurring expenses from 2020. 
Let's move now to our Financial Services Operation on Slide 13. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the second quarter was $222 million, benefiting from a lower provision for credit losses, improvement on operating lease residual values and more favorable financing spreads, while last year's results included impairments on lease residual values. For fiscal year 2021, the net income forecast is now $800 million. The provision for credit losses forecast for 2021 is 9 basis points when compared to the average portfolio managed. 
Slide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '21, our full year outlook for net income is now forecast to be between $5.3 billion and $5.7 billion. The guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 23% and 25%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in a range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion and contemplates a $700 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plan.

Before we respond to your questions, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our financial results as well as address some of the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

Before we respond to your questions, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our financial results as well as address some of the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. With respect to the results for the quarter, we are encouraged by the progress we've made in improving our structural profitability. While unit volumes for large ag equipment remained below prior cycles, we are achieving significantly higher levels of profitability. These favorable results are due in part to the work we've done over the last 18 months to reposition our organization. 
During that time, we've: one, reorganized the company around production systems; two, taken significant strides towards optimizing our cost structure; and three, adapted our investment priorities to drive a greater focus degree of focus on the products and solutions that are most differentiated and then unlock the highest economic value for our customers. Underlying this is the unique tech stack that we have built over the last 2 decades. We believe it is a combination of best-in-class products, a best-in-class dealer channel and the tech stack that will drive the solutions that make our customers the most profitable and sustainable in the industry. 
In addition to our new strategy, we are also benefiting from the improved fundamentals for our customers. Despite the broad economic challenges brought on by the pandemic, grain and oilseed consumption is outpacing supply and driving increased need for more productivity and efficiency by our customers. Furthermore, the market access challenges of the last years have moderated, boosting customer sentiment and spurring increased confidence in equipment investment. These improved fundamentals, combined with an aged fleet and low inventory levels, give us confidence that the investment cycle will continue beyond 2021. And This dynamic is evidenced by order books for large tractors extending well into fiscal year 2022. 
While these operational and industry tailwinds are currently supporting our business, many challenges and risks remain, particularly with respect to our supply base, global logistics and COVID-related interruptions. As Cory highlighted, these risks have caused spot disruptions in production, and we anticipate those to continue throughout the remainder of the year. However, the incredible effort of our production and supply management teams have allowed us to avoid lengthy stoppages to date. 
One risk I'd like to again highlight relates to the supply of semiconductors, which is experiencing a global shortage. To date, our suppliers have worked closely with us to provide enough supply to allow us to provide our essential equipment without significant disruption. Our forecast contemplates a continuation of this trend. This is important in order to help ensure we keep our customers fully operational and meeting the growing need for grain, oilseed and critical infrastructure. In addition, prices for key raw materials such as steel, have significantly increased over the last quarter. Freight and logistics costs have also experienced upward pressure and our utilization on premium freight has increased. As a result, our current forecast contemplates $1 billion in costs related to higher material in freight, with approximately 3/4 of that occurring in the second half of the year. 
Despite these challenges, we encourage -- we are encouraged by the strength in our end markets as well as the execution our team has delivered so far this year. Furthermore, we see many opportunities to accelerate our investments in technology and sustainability. Although early, we are convinced that our new strategy is the right one and will drive differentiated outcomes for our customers and for all stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the next few quarters."

When we think about where we are today, though, given the demand we're seeing, the underlying fundamentals, the age of the fleet constraints in the supply base, seeing demand push out, we do believe there are continued legs to the demand picture and to the cycle that we're in. And maybe a little bit of comparing and contrasting back to 2013 because we get this question a lot, how -- what is different now versus then, certainly, ag fundamentals are very strong, stocks to use are healthy. They're actually lower than they were back in 2013, if you look at ex-China stocks. Cash receipts, our forecast this year to be higher by about $10 billion compared to 2013. Land values are higher than they were even a year ago but compared back to that time as well. Used inventory, as Cory mentioned, lower than where we were back to 2012. Prices have been seen upward pressure. The large ag fleet is the oldest that it's been in 2 decades compared back to that 2013 time frame when it was at the youngest that it had been. And then as noted, our volumes, unit volumes of large ag in North America are significantly lower than we were back in 2013. And maybe importantly, we don't expect or count on those -- meeting those levels of volume to deliver higher margin performance. 
This year is a good example on much lower volume, our net sales are, call it, $0.5 billion to $1 billion lower than 2013. But our margin performance is about 3 points higher. So I think we feel really good about the ability to deliver innovation, deliver technology to the customer and create value, and that's translating to higher average selling prices, better margins per machine much less reliant on unit volume than maybe we would have been in the past.

So those customers, if you take the average age of combines or tractors, the 9.5 or 6.5 years and you think about the technology difference in that last decade that's gone on with the products, that's pulling a lot of product into the industry. These are higher capacity machines, but there are people demanding the highest productivity best technology on the machines that are coming through. And if you look at where used inventory levels are, even our last generation machines, there's not a lot available in the market for people to upgrade. So that points to a cycle that extends. It also points to a lot of used machines out there that are 8, 9, 10 years old that are ripe for what we can do in the performance upgrade space. So as that population is coming forward, it represents an all-new opportunity for us to take this latest technology back across those machines. So we're really excited about doing both.

One of the drivers, certainly the precision ag side, which you mentioned and the ability to be less reliant on units and units driving where we go and how we perform. I think that is one piece. The -- as we go forward and you start to include sense and act capabilities, that's one of the areas that we see the opportunity to begin to deliver more of a recurring revenue model, which takes some additional cyclicality out of the business as we can create value across each acre that is covered. 
And then the aftermarket side, and in Cory alluded to this when we talk about performance upgrades or retrofit, if the ability to go deeper into the population, the installed base and upgrade those machines, bring them closer to the most current technology and what that also does is it brings them more into the precision ag ecosystem, thinking about the operations center, the flow of data and how that creates a sticky environment and value creation for the customer."

And then my question is around pricing. While pricing is strong, could you also talk about the increase in costs, given that you're embedding most of the precision ag features in the new equipment? I mean your costs have obviously accordingly gone up. So if you could just talk about maybe net pricing, not including like discounting that, but how much of the price increases are actually to cover the increased cost of books?"

From a pricing point of view, I think it's important to kind of delineate how we view price in this -- over time has gotten maybe a little bit confusing, but I want to be clear, the price numbers that we talk about in terms of net price realization is pure like-for-like model, year-over-year price that we've taken. So if we're thinking about the production and precision ag point of view, 9 points of price, that is like-for-like model last year to this year, what have we seen from pricing. 
So we have seen strong price. Cory mentioned this in his comments, they really driven by the overseas price adjustments that we've taken as it related to FX movements and a shift to be a little more dynamic in terms of how we've responded to some of those FX movements. So that's really the price realization. 
Maybe separately, we think about average selling prices over time. And over time, if we look at, call it, the last 7 or 8 years for large ag equipment North America, average selling prices have been up between 5% to 7% on a kind of an annual basis. And that would include traditional price increases, which have been in the range of 3 points. And then on top of that would be the feature piece. So if you call that 7%, 3% roughly inflationary price. But then on top of that would be features such as precision ag, things like ExactApply or others. that would drive additional price. And -- but I tell you, from a cost perspective is those features tend to be very margin attractive. A lot of that is software activated. So there's a lot of upfront cost to develop the first unit, but from a margin point of view, is attractive. Thanks, Ann. We'll go ahead and go to our next question."

Let's start with second quarter results for production and precision ag on Slide 4. Net sales of $4.529 billion were up 35% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price real",1387,"Thanks, Brent. Let's start with second quarter results for production and precision ag on Slide 4. Net sales of $4.529 billion were up 35% compared to the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 9 points, while currency translation was positive by 2 points. Operating profit was just over $1 billion, resulting in a 22% operating margin for the segment compared to a 17% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by price realization and higher shipment volumes and sales mix. These items were partially offset by higher production costs.
With respect to price realization, the above-average results for the quarter were primarily driven by a few different factors. The primary driver of price came from significant midyear adjustments made last year and this year for select foreign markets to offset unfavorable currency movements, which resulted in low double-digit price realization for markets outside of North America. North American list prices were up slightly above average and benefited from prices for new product launches during 2020. Lastly, the current low inventory levels across the industry have led to lower overall incentive spending, thus boosting net price realization. We do anticipate net price realization to moderate some in the second half of the year.
Shifting focus to small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 30%, totaling $3.39 billion in the second quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by nearly 6 points, while currency translation was positive by 4 points.
For the quarter, operating profit was $648 million, resulting in a 19% operating margin for the segment compared to an 8.7% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was due to higher shipment volumes and sales mix, price realization and the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange. These items were partially offset by higher production costs.
Before moving on to our industry forecast for regional ag markets, I'd like to first offer some perspective on the current global ag environment beginning on Slide 6. Over the course of the last 9 months, fundamentals for large ag production systems have steadily improved, driving stronger economic results for our customers and enhanced visibility for our equipment order books. Global stocks of grain have tightened significantly this year on account of multiple factors such as increased Chinese grain imports and recovery in ethanol usage and weather-related production losses in South America. For a second consecutive year, we expect grain and oilseed consumption to outpace supply, supporting fundamentals in the next marketing year.
While government support is expected to decrease this year, principal crop cash receipts in the U.S. are forecast to increase 30%, with improvements in commodity prices more than offsetting the decline in government aid. In addition to higher cash receipts, U.S. customer sentiment has benefited from better market access over the last few quarters with elevated exports to China.
Given the positive environmental backdrop, order activity is up significantly. and all of our large ag order banks are now complete through the end of the fiscal year. For select product lines such as four-wheel drives and 8R tractors, we're now taking orders for fiscal year '22 and have visibility through the first half of the year. Furthermore, we'll open our early order program for planters and sprayers in June, which will yield some additional data points on demand for 2022.
The current market dynamics, coupled with production constraints for the industry, point to a multiyear cycle for ag equipment. Current global inventory levels for both new and used equipment remain at historic lows. While the average age of the North American fleet is at its highest level in 2 decades, even with double-digit growth expected for the industry in '21, shipments of North American large ag equipment remain 40% less on average than the previous cycle. At this point, in 2021, it's clear that demand will carry over into subsequent years due partially to limitation on the industry's production capabilities. Suppliers and logistics providers are currently stretched thin as economies begin recovering from  the lows of the pandemic.
Furthermore, labor markets are extremely tight, delaying efforts to ramp up. To date, we have experienced frequent disruptions. However, our factory managers and supply management teams have done an extraordinary job, keeping our production schedules mostly intact without yet resorting to material work stoppages. While many of these spot disruptions are on account of various supplies, procurement of semiconductor chips remains a significant risk to our production schedule for the remainder of the year. To date, our suppliers have worked diligently to ensure our products continue their vital role in providing food security and critical infrastructure. And we're cautiously optimistic that they will continue to meet demand and help us ensure continuous service to our customers.
In addition to supply constraints, we're also managing through significant inflation for both raw materials and logistics, which will continue to hit us throughout the second half of the year. Lastly, despite progress in the U.S. with respect to the pandemic, COVID remains a challenge as we face disruptions to some of our foreign operations and supply base with India as the most recent example. As we've done since last March, we continue to work through these challenges, ensuring safe working conditions for our employees and continuous support to our customers.
Before addressing our industry outlook, I'd like to first offer my gratitude to our employees and dealers, who worked through so many unique circumstances over the last year. We owe our results to the incredible efforts of our frontline employees, who kept our factories running during the pandemic and managed to keep production schedules on time amidst various supply constraints. Similarly, our field employees and dealers keep finding ways to serve our customers and have gone above and beyond during this last year.
Slide 7 shows our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. In U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up roughly 25% for the year, reflecting improved fundamentals in the ag sector. At this point, we anticipating producing in line with retail demand for the year, keeping inventory levels relatively tight heading into fiscal year '22. Meanwhile, we expect industry sales of small ag and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada to be up roughly 10%. Similarly, our shipment schedules imply production roughly in line with retail demand for most products.
Moving on to Europe. The industry is forecast to be up roughly 10% as higher commodity prices strengthened business conditions in the arable segment, offsetting some weaknesses in dairy and livestock. Our Mannheim tractor order book extends through the end of the fiscal year, demonstrating continued progress towards executing our regional strategy focused on large and precision ag. In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase about 20%. The combination of higher commodity prices, strong production and a favorable currency environment have boosted profitability of farmers, driving orders through the remainder of the year.
Despite limited government-sponsored financing programs, private financing is more widely available this year in supporting continued strength in equipment demand. Industry sales in Asia are forecast to be up slightly, though key markets for Deere such as India are performing slightly better.
Moving on to our segment forecast, beginning on Slide 8. For production and precision ag, net sales are forecast to be up between 25% and 30% in fiscal year '21. The forecast includes a currency tailwind of about 2 points and expectations of nearly 7 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranged between 20% and 21%, and contemplates consistent performance across the various geographical regions.
Slide 9 shows our forecast for the small ag and turf segment. Net sales in fiscal year '21 are forecast to be up between 20% and 25%. The guidance includes expectations for 3 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency impact of about 3 points. The segment's operating margin is forecast to range between 16.5% and 17.5%. 
I'll now turn the call back to Brent."

For the quarter, net sales of $3.079 billion were up 36%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes, price realization and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. The quarter results were boosted by 4.5 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of about 4 points. Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $489 million, resulting in a 15.9% operating margin due to higher shipment volumes and sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. Also keep in mind that last year's results included employee separation and impairment costs totaling $85 million.
Let's turn to our 2021 construction and forestry industry outlook on Slide 11. North American construction equipment industry sales are now forecast to be up between 15% and 20%, while sales of compact construction equipment are expected to be up between 20% to 25%. To date, in markets for earthmoving and compact equipment have benefited primarily from strength in the housing market as well as some recovery from trough conditions in the oil and gas sector.
Additionally, we are beginning to see positive indicators for nonresidential investment as well as strengthening order activity from independent rental companies. Furthermore, current demand levels are still benefiting from the industry's collective response of managing inventories tightly during the early days of the pandemic.
In forestry, we now expect the industry to be up between 15% to 20% as lumber demand remains very strong, particularly in North America.
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 12. Deere's construction and forestry 2021 net sales are now forecast to be up between 25% and 30%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes expectations of about 3 points of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of about 2 points. We expect the segment's operating margin to be ranged between 12% to 13% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and nonrecurring expenses from 2020.
Let's move now to our financial services operation on Slide 13. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the second quarter was $222 million, benefiting from a lower provision for credit losses, improvement on operating lease residual values and more favorable financing spreads, while last year's results included impairments on lease residual values. For fiscal year 2021, the net income forecast is now $800 million. The provision for credit losses forecast for 2021 is 9 basis points when compared to the average portfolio managed.
Slide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '21, our full year outlook for net income is now forecast to be between $5.3 billion and $5.7 billion. The guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 23% and 25%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in a range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion and contemplates a $700 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plan.

266112,700826690,2295372,"Deere & Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 21, 2021",2021-05-21,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thanks, Brent. Before we respond to your questions, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our financial results as well as address some of the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.With respect to the results for the quarter, we are encouraged by th",596,"Thanks, Brent. Before we respond to your questions, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our financial results as well as address some of the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
With respect to the results for the quarter, we are encouraged by the progress we've made in improving our structural profitability. While unit volumes for large ag equipment remained below prior cycles, we are achieving significantly higher levels of profitability. These favorable results are due in part to the work we've done over the last 18 months to reposition our organization. During that time, we've: one, reorganized the company around production systems; two, taken significant strides towards optimizing our cost structure; and three, adapted our investment priorities to drive a greater focus -- greater degree of focus on the products and solutions that are most differentiated and then unlock the highest economic value for our customers.
Underlying this is the unique tech stack that we have built over the last 2 decades. We believe it is a combination of best-in-class products, a best-in-class dealer channel and the tech stack that will drive the solutions that make our customers the most profitable and sustainable in the industry.
In addition to our new strategy, we are also benefiting from the improved fundamentals for our customers. Despite the broad economic challenges brought on by the pandemic, grain and oilseed consumption is outpacing supply and driving increased need for more productivity and efficiency by our customers. Furthermore, the market access challenges of the last years have moderated, boosting customer sentiment and spurring increased confidence in equipment investment. These improved fundamentals, combined with an aged fleet and low inventory levels give us confidence that the investment cycle will continue beyond 2021. This dynamic is evidenced by order books for large tractors extending well into fiscal year 2022.
While these operational and industry tailwinds are currently supporting our business, many challenges and risks remain, particularly with respect to our supply base, global logistics and COVID-related interruptions. As Cory highlighted, these risks have caused spot disruptions in production, and we anticipate those to continue throughout the remainder of the year. However, the incredible effort of our production and supply management teams have allowed us to avoid lengthy stoppages to date.
One risk I'd like to again highlight relates to the supply of semiconductors, which is experiencing a global shortage. To date, our suppliers have worked closely with us to provide enough supply to allow us to provide our essential equipment without significant disruption. Our forecast contemplates a continuation of this trend. This is important in order to help ensure we keep our customers fully operational and meeting the growing need for grain, oilseed and critical infrastructure.
In addition, prices for key raw materials such as steel have significantly increased over the last quarter. Freight and logistics costs have also experienced upward pressure, and our utilization on premium freight has increased. As a result, our current forecast contemplates $1 billion in costs related to higher material in freight, with approximately 3/4 of that occurring in the second half of the year.
Despite these challenges, we encourage -- we are encouraged by the strength in our end markets as well as the execution our team has delivered so far this year. Furthermore, we see many opportunities to accelerate our investments in technology and sustainability. Although early, we are convinced that our new strategy is the right one and will drive differentiated outcomes for our customers and for all stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the next few quarters."

The -- when we think about percent of mid-cycle for the business, for PPA and really for SAT or small ag and turf, we're in between 110% and 115% of mid-cycle. And you're correct in that the underlying math there would exclude the previous peak. So we're past those peak years of '12 and '13.
When we think about where we are today, though, given the demand we're seeing, the underlying fundamentals, the age of the fleet, constraints in the supply base, seeing demand push out, we do believe there are continued legs to the demand picture and to the cycle that we're in. And maybe a little bit of comparing and contrasting back to 2013 because we get this question a lot, how -- what is different now versus then, certainly, ag fundamentals are very strong. Stocks to use are healthy. They're actually lower than they were back in 2013, if you look at ex-China stocks.
Cash receipts, our forecast this year to be higher by about $10 billion compared to 2013. Land values are higher than they were even a year ago but compared back to that time as well. Used inventory, as Cory mentioned, lower than where we were back to 2012. Prices have been seen upward pressure. The large ag fleet is the oldest that it's been in 2 decades compared back to that 2013 time frame when it was at the youngest that it had been. And then as noted, our volumes, unit volumes of large ag in North America are significantly lower than we were back in 2013. And maybe importantly, we don't expect or count on those -- meeting those levels of volume to deliver higher margin performance.
This year is a good example on much lower volume, our net sales are, call it, $0.5 billion to $1 billion lower than 2013. But our margin performance is about 3 points higher. So I think we feel really good about the ability to deliver innovation, deliver technology to the customer and create value, and that's translating to higher average selling prices, better margins per machine much less reliant on unit volume than maybe we would have been in the past.

I think the one thing I would add, Ross, is in addition, we're bringing all new levels of technology in the new machines we're bringing out. So those customers, if you take the average age of combines or tractors, the 9.5 or 6.5 years and you think about the technology difference in that last decade that's gone on with the products, that's pulling a lot of product into the industry. These are higher capacity machines, but there are people demanding the highest productivity, best technology on the machines that are coming through. And if you look at where used inventory levels are, even our last generation machines, there's not a lot available in the market for people to upgrade. So that points to a cycle that extends.
It also points to a lot of used machines out there that are 8, 9, 10 years old that are ripe for what we can do in the performance upgrade space. So as that population is coming forward, it represents an all-new opportunity for us to take this latest technology back across those machines. So we're really excited about doing both.

From a pricing point of view, I think it's important to kind of delineate how we view price in this -- over time has gotten maybe a little bit confusing. But I want to be clear, the price numbers that we talk about in terms of net price realization is pure like-for-like model, year-over-year price that we've taken. So if we're thinking about the production and precision ag point of view, 9 points of price, that is like-for-like model last year to this year, what have we seen from pricing.
So we have seen strong price. Cory mentioned this in his comments, they're really driven by the overseas price adjustments that we've taken as it related to FX movements and a shift to be a little more dynamic in terms of how we've responded to some of those FX movements. So that's really the price realization.
Maybe separately, we think about average selling prices over time. And over time, if we look at, call it, the last 7 or 8 years for large ag equipment North America, average selling prices have been up between 5% to 7% on a kind of an annual basis. And that would include traditional price increases, which have been in the range of 3 points.
And then on top of that would be the feature piece. So if you call that 7%, 3% roughly inflationary price. But then on top of that would be features such as precision ag, things like ExactApply or others that would drive additional price. And -- but I tell you, from a cost perspective is those features tend to be very margin attractive. A lot of that is software activated. So there's a lot of upfront cost to develop the first unit, but from a margin point of view, is attractive. Thanks, Ann."

For small ag and turf, we did expect -- we had planned to build a bit above retail a quarter ago and really supply tightness, and continued strength in demand has pulled that back to be essentially in line -- building in line. So more of a constraint from a supply base than it is a shift in our view of what we'd like to have out there. We're going to end the year on small tractors at near historic low again from an inventory to sales perspective in the 20s, 20% range. So still quite a bit lower. So that's the dynamic there.
And I'd say broadly, kind of across all categories, the biggest constraint to building inventory is just that, is supply challenges and the ability to get those out paired with really strong demand across the board."

So in the sprayer world, today, the existing technology ExactApply is going back across, so individual nozzle control and being able to take it back across as many sprayers as we can. In the future, it will be the See & Spray technology.
Maybe the difference is we're now designing and working towards designing at the same time we're planning for the new to design to be able to take it back across the installed base, and that will allow us to accelerate. We're working on making sure that our dealers have the bandwidth. Dealers are busy right now, too, and they're working to put their plans in place to be able to accelerate that effort.

As you can see with our -- with the forecast price, our price forecast moderates a little bit as we start to anniversary some of the actions that we were taking middle of last year. And then we do see a little bit higher overhead spend as it relates to inefficiencies, really driven by the supply chain constraints and some of the disruptions and starts and stops that happened that make us run a little bit less efficiently. So I think those are probably the biggest items.

So we're taking price and we're growing share and differentiating ourselves. And we think that's a really important piece when we think about going around the globe and everyone having strong margin performance, that is different than where we would have been previous cycle. Thanks, Jerry.
Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your time. Have a good day."

266112,700826677,2383116,"Deere & Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2021",2021-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","John Deere demonstrated strong execution in the third quarter, resulting in an 18.7% margin for the equipment operations. Ag fundamentals continued to be solid year-to-date, and results from our 2022 early order programs indicate demand to remain strong h",888,"John Deere demonstrated strong execution in the third quarter, resulting in an 18.7% margin for the equipment operations. Ag fundamentals continued to be solid year-to-date, and results from our 2022 early order programs indicate demand to remain strong heading into the next fiscal year. Meanwhile, robust fundamentals for our construction and forestry equipment continued into the third quarter, leading to improved levels of profitability and a heightened outlook for the rest of this year. 
Slide 3 shows the results for the third quarter. Net sales and revenue were up 29% to $11.5 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 32% to $10.4 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.667 billion or $5.32 per diluted share. 
Now let's turn to a review of our production and precision ag business, starting on Slide 4. Net sales of $4.25 billion were up 29% compared to the third quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 8 points while currency translation was positive by about 4 points. 
Operating profit was $906 million, resulting in a 21% operating margin for the segment compared to an 18% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher shipment volumes, sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. With respect to the price realization, the above-average results for the quarter were primarily driven by a few different factors. The primary driver came from price adjustments made to offset unfavorable currency movements, which resulted in low double-digit price realization for markets outside North America. North American list prices were up slightly above average and benefited from lower incentive spending. 
Shifting focus to small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 32%, totaling $3.147 billion in the third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by just over 3 points, while currency translation was positive by about 3.5 points. For the quarter, operating profit was $582 million, resulting in an 18.5% operating margin for the segment compared to a 14% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was due to higher shipment volumes, sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. Results for the current period were affected by a $27 million onetime gain, while the prior period included $37 million of onetime losses. 
Slide 6 shows our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up about 25% for the year, reflecting improved fundamentals in the ag sector. At this point, we anticipate producing in line with retail demand for the year, keeping inventory levels relatively tight heading into fiscal year '22. As it relates to small ag and turf, we expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be up about 10%. While our shipment schedules imply production roughly in line with the retail demand, our net sales for small ag and turf products are up higher than the year-over-year change in retail sales as activity recovers from significant underproduction in 2020. 
Moving on to Europe. The industry forecast is -- the industry is forecast to be up about -- or between 10% to 15% as higher commodity prices strengthen business conditions in the arable segment and dairy prices remain resilient even as margins show some pressure from rising input costs. At this time, we've opened our Mannheim tractor order book through the second quarter of 2022, filling all production slots through that time period. 
In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase about 20%. The combination of higher commodity prices, strong production and a favorable currency environment have boosted the profitability of farmers, driving orders through the remainder of the year and into the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, which is as far as we've allowed the order book to grow. Despite limited government-sponsored financing programs, private financing is more widely available this year, supporting continued strength in equipment demand. Industry sales in Asia are forecasted to be up significantly, driven primarily by a strong recovery in the Indian tractor market. 
Moving on to our segment forecasts, beginning on Slide 7. For production and precision ag, net sales are forecast to be up between 25% to 30% in fiscal year '21. The forecast includes a currency tailwind of about 2 points and expectations of nearly 8 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranged between 20% and 21% and contemplates consistently solid financial performance across the various geographical regions. 
Slide 8 shows our forecast for small -- for the small ag and turf segment. Net sales in fiscal year '21 are forecast to be up about 25%. The guidance includes expectations for nearly 5 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency impact of about 3 points. The segment's operating margin is forecast to be ranged between 17% and 18%. Before moving on to the results for our construction and forestry division, Jahmy Hindman, our Chief Technology Officer, will offer some thoughts around our recent acquisition of Bear Flag Robotics. Jahmy?"
266112,700826677,2383116,"Deere & Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2021",2021-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thanks, Brent. As many of you are aware, John Deere has a long history of investing in increasing levels of automation in our equipment. These investments have distinctly positioned us to be a leading provider of autonomous solutions for our industry. We'",795,"Thanks, Brent. As many of you are aware, John Deere has a long history of investing in increasing levels of automation in our equipment. These investments have distinctly positioned us to be a leading provider of autonomous solutions for our industry. We're now at a stage of maturity in that journey to make additional bold investments in autonomy, consistent with the tech stack strategy that I shared with you last November. 
Accordingly, earlier this month, we added another exciting capability to our tech stack with our acquisition of Bear Flag Robotics, a technology start-up based in Silicon Valley. Today, I'd like to give you a little more perspective on how this acquisition will accelerate our autonomous capabilities and serve as an important addition to our overall investment in autonomy. 
Bear Flag develops autonomous solutions compatible with existing machines, which means greater tech adoption, increased productivity and improved profitability for our customers. It offers a set of technologies such as LiDAR, cameras and radar that complements our own initiatives and goals to provide customers with solutions that address the individual needs on the farm and the job site. 
The acquisition underscores our smart industrial strategy to deliver smarter machines with advanced technology. It addresses the challenge of scaling food production with fewer available resources, especially that of skilled labor. Increasingly, farm labor shortages are constraining the timing of agronomic jobs or, in some cases, the ability to do that job at all, which has a significant impact on farming outcomes. 
Through autonomy, customers can run their operation more predictably, efficiently, sustainably and profitably from anywhere, ensuring the jobs get done within the optimal timing windows, which has a substantial economic impact. It also represents an important leap forward in our retrofit capabilities across the installed base. We call those performance upgrades, and they'll aid in the evolution of our business model for recurring revenue. 
More important, the combination of John Deere, Blue River and Bear Flag positions autonomy as a key opportunity for differentiated value creation for our customers and our company. We started working with Bear Flag in 2019 as part of Deere's start-up collaborator program. It's an initiative focused on enhancing work with start-up companies whose technology could add value for our customers. It's also an important point of access to some of the leading talent and innovations in our industry. 
Since then, Bear Flag has successfully fielded its autonomous solution on several farms in the United States. As I mentioned, its primary focus has been on its retrofit-first strategy. However, its technical architecture scales quickly with new implements and new tractor models, enabling fast compatibility with a large universe of equipment. This pairs nicely with Deere's comprehensive suite of products across our production systems. And while it's too early to commit to a business model for Bear Flag's products, we're encouraged by their customers' early acceptance of a per-acre approach. This positions autonomy as a service, and we feel that may reduce the barriers to accelerate adoption of the technology. 
This innovative approach and capability are a real testament to the foresight and talent of the Bear Flag team, and I'm confident they will make a strong addition to our current expertise in automation and autonomy. 
Let me wrap up by providing a brief perspective on our thoughts regarding technology investment. Over the last 20 years, we've invested in the building blocks for autonomy, starting with foundational tools like our GPS guidance known as AutoTrac. We've increased the automation in those foundational technologies with the introduction of turn automation and AutoPath being our most recent examples. 
We have also begun automating the quality of the job being done as seen with Combine Advisor. These are core building blocks that set the foundation for autonomy. We've also made strategic investments in companies like Blue River, which has significantly accelerated our time line for both automation and autonomy. Bear Flag Robotics will add new capabilities that help us on this journey as both companies will play a vital role in delivering a full range of autonomous solutions built from a technology foundation that was intentionally crafted over decades for this very moment. 
It's important to note that the breadth and diversity of these use cases introduce a significant complexity. This highlights the ongoing need to expand our tech stack through the acquisition of new technologies while further developing our existing capabilities, which, as you know, are already significant. Looking ahead, we see an enormous opportunity to create even greater customer value through autonomy and are committed to the continued investment in technologies that address the broad array of use cases across agriculture, road building and construction. At this time, I'll turn the call over to John Stone to discuss our construction and forestry division. John?"

So let's look at Slide 11 and talk about construction and forestry's results for the quarter. net sales of just over $3 billion were up 38%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $463 million, resulting in a 15.4% operating margin due to higher shipment volumes and a favorable sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. 
Turning to Slide 12 and take a look at our industry outlook. North American construction equipment industry sales are forecast to be up between 15% and 20%, sales of compact construction equipment expected to be up 20% to 25%. In addition, forestry equipment, driven by strong lumber demand, is expected to be up 15%. To date, end markets for earthmoving and compact equipment had benefited from a strong housing market, and while this growth rate has slowed a bit, we are beginning to see positive indicators for nonresidential investment and order activity from independent rental companies remains exceptionally strong heading into the fourth quarter. Demand for earthmoving and compact construction equipment will exceed our production for the year, resulting in low inventory levels as we exit the fiscal year. 
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 13. We expect our sales to be up around 30%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes expectations of 5 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency tailwind of about 2 points. Our operating margin is expected to be between 13% and 14% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and nonrecurring expenses from 2020. 
Moving on to Slide 14, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk through our construction and forestry strategy and also address how the recent excavator announcement you saw yesterday aligns with our overall smart industrial journey. The first thing I'd call your attention to on this slide is our mission, and our mission why we exist is to answer the fundamental need for smarter, safer and more sustainable construction so our customers can shape tomorrow's world. As a result of the strategy we initiated last year, C&F division is focused on 3 main priorities: margin improvement, differentiation with precision technology and a new excavator strategy that will better position Deere and its customers for the future. I'll talk a little bit about each of these priorities. 
In the area of margin improvement, we've made considerable progress this year, and our guidance implies a line of sight to the highest operating margin in the division's history. We're committed to further improvements that will give C&F the ability to generate 15% margins at mid-cycle volumes. To improve our current margin profile, we accomplished 3 main objectives over the past 1.5 years. First, we reorganized our division around our customers' production systems to mirror the way they do business. This enables us to deliver greater customer value by helping them become more productive, more profitable and while performing their jobs in a more sustainable way. 
Next, we made significant progress optimizing our cost structure, while at the same time maintaining pricing discipline for our products and fixing or exiting unprofitable business segments. Finally, we adjusted our investment priorities to ensure a greater degree of focus on the products and solutions that are the most differentiated and unlock the highest value for our customers. 
Notably leading the way has been the Wirtgen Group, whose performance has substantiated our original deal thesis as a high-performing business that demonstrates higher growth with less cyclicality than our legacy businesses. We've made significant improvements in the cost structure and worldwide distribution network for the Wirtgen Group. And I expect the group to generate greater than 15% operating margin this year, inclusive of deal amortization and impairments, which is a structural improvement relative to the 10.7% margin we produced during our first full year of ownership. No doubt, Wirtgen's best days are still ahead. 
Moving to differentiating technology. And coming over to C&F from ISG just over a year ago was really eye-opening to see the size of the opportunity in front of us for differentiating technology on the job site and on the roads. Productivity in the construction industry has lagged for years, and machine automation, coordination and access to data can address a sizable portion of this productivity gap. Our strategy and technology stack is enabling us to move beyond historical enterprise synergies to leveraging technology like computer vision, advanced control systems, sensors, software, back-end cloud and machine learning training infrastructure to innovate faster. 
Let me give you a few examples on how this technology will make our products smarter, safer and more sustainable. The next generation of Deere's construction equipment will feature a higher degree of our proprietary technology stack, inclusive of grid control, vision systems and remote monitoring. Roads are going digital and we are positioned well to lead this. We see today's state where no individual machine is used to its full capacity, and this inefficiency is coming from a lack of data, a lack of communication and coordination between machines and different steps of the production system. 
Our analysis indicates cost savings in the range of 15% to 30% is possible versus today's traditional methods of roadbuilding and road rehabilitation. And when a 3-mile road rehabilitation project can cost $1 million to $1.5 million, this is a big opportunity. These technologies will also serve to make job sites considerably safer, which is a top priority for our customers. And while we use much the same hardware and software you would encounter on a Blue River sea and spray machine, a construction site is different, of course. It's busy, it's crowded but a lot of the base technology is just the same, but we'll collect different data and train our neural networks on different data sets and use different onboard software for machine control. 
Lastly, we feel we are uniquely positioned to help further the use of recycled and renewable building materials. And for many reasons, construction equipment is likely to lead the way on full electric machines, and we look forward to providing further updates on that in the future. 
Moving on to our new excavator strategy, on Slide 15 is a summary of the transaction highlights, which you also saw in our press release and our 8-K. As noted in the press release, we've entered into definitive agreements with Hitachi Construction Machinery to purchase the Deere-Hitachi joint venture businesses, including 3 factories and a license agreement for the intellectual property for continued manufacture of the current lineup. We will continue to source components from Hitachi and manufacture the current products at our existing locations for the near term. 
For those of you who may not be familiar with our long-standing relationship with Hitachi, let me provide a little context. Deere has produced excavators through a joint venture agreement with Hitachi for the last 30 years. Our jointly-owned factories have produced Hitachi-designed machines, which were distributed under both the Deere and Hitachi brands through the Deere channel in the Americas. This joint venture has been successful and served us well over the years. 
Our new strategy will allow us to leverage our own technology and designs, specifically focused on the markets that matter most to us, furthering the value unlock for our customers with Deere-on-Deere machines while accelerating our innovation and response time to customer and dealer feedback on products. To that end, we've been investing in our own proprietary excavator designs for well over a decade, serving markets outside of the Americas. And we have plans to introduce our next generation of excavators in the Americas in a time line that complements our supply agreement with Hitachi. Finally, I would highlight we do expect this transaction to be accretive to earnings in year 1. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Brent."

Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the third quarter was $227 million, benefiting from an improvement on operating lease residual values as well as income earned on a higher average portfolio, a lower provision for credit losses and more favorable financing spreads. For fiscal year 2021, the net income forecast is now $850 million as the segment continues to benefit from the same factors realized during the quarter. 
Slide 18 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '21, our full year outlook for net income is now forecast to be between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion. The full year forecast reflects the impact from higher raw material prices and logistics costs, which we estimate to have added an additional $1.5 billion in expense experienced mostly in the back half of the year. The guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 22% and 24%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in a range of $5.8 billion to $6 billion. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell for closing comments. Ryan?"

The company continued to demonstrate stro",665,"Thanks, Brent. Before we respond to your questions, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our financial results and the current demand environment as well as provide some commentary on the execution of our strategy. The company continued to demonstrate strong performance in the third quarter while challenges in the supply base persisted and, in some cases, became more complicated. We owe this solid execution to the extraordinary efforts made by our workforce for getting our products to the field and to our dealer channel for best-in-class customer support. 
At this time, we expect many of these challenges to persist through the end of this year and into next. Our guidance reflects a continuation of these challenges but does not contemplate a significant shutdown of operations. Despite the challenging production environment, end market demand remains robust, with order activity providing excellent visibility for our large ag production throughout much of fiscal year '22. 
Results from our planter and sprayer early order programs indicate robust demand will continue well into next year. In fact, we were able to fill our available production slots for fiscal year '22, early in the first phase of the program. At this time, we expect production rates for our crop care products to be up strong double digits on a percentage basis in fiscal year '22 compared to fiscal year '21. Even more encouraging is the take rates for our advanced precision features, which were up significantly from last year, reaching all-time highs. 
Our large tractor order book in the U.S. extends through the second quarter of fiscal year '22, and we have not yet opened it up for orders in the second half of the year. Encouragingly, take rates for our premium and automation activations also reached all-time highs. While we manage this strong demand environment, we are also laser-focused on executing our strategy that will unlock significant new economic headroom for our customers while driving higher levels of sustainability in their operations. As we reflect on what we have built to date and the possibilities we see in the future, we will aggressively make investments that promote deeper customer engagement in our digital platforms and software-driven solutions. 
As we speak, our production systems teams are analyzing each step in our customers' processes and designing or concepting solutions that will increase output while reducing the inputs required. As these types of solutions gain traction, we see the potential for a future less dependent on sales of new equipment units each year and instead, a future tied more closely to the jobs our customers do year in and year out enabled by the technology that makes them more profitable, productive and sustainable. 
Over the next year, we'll talk a bit more about how this transformation will impact the company's goals and ambitions beyond our current set of goals slated for 2022. Ultimately, our next generation of goals will align to the activities and investments required to unlock the total addressable market of new value creation for our customers, which we believe is significant. 
Lastly, the third quarter provided a good representation of our use of cash priorities. Last quarter, I noted that our heightened cash flow levels would enable us to invest more in our technology stack as well as increased cash return to shareholders. And as we indicated, we made investments that will support our smart industrial strategy and will deliver long-term value for shareholders. Beyond that, we raised our dividend by 18% in the second quarter, and in the third quarter, repurchased over [ 700 million ] in shares, our highest amount in 6 years. 
In summary, despite some of the near-term operational challenges, we expect to continue delivering on our financial goals while, at the same time, accelerating our investments in technology and sustainability. Although still early, we are convinced that our strategy will drive differentiated outcomes for our customers and all stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the next few quarters."

As we look at the early order program, the crop care supply sprayers, as that opened up, we essentially filled the full year of production in the first phase of the program so we will not run additional phases there. And when you think about combines, so for combines, we recently opened that up. We're doing that a little bit differently this year in that we've allowed orders to begin. But we are taking time pausing to be able to manage price cost dynamics there so we can make those adjustments.

And so when we look at our other core earthmoving product lines, we do see an opportunity to improve that share quite a bit. 
The margin story is a little bit different. If you think about a 50-50 joint venture structure where Hitachi did the design, we jointly did the manufacturer and then Deere was responsible for the distribution, there is a margin sharing aspect of that relationship. And obviously, as we move to a more traditional supply agreement with Hitachi, that margin sharing goes away. So it's really a mechanical adjustment to that part of the business that will improve the margins. 
And then as we're able to introduce Deere designs, Deere technology in the future, we see that really as further upside to both margin and share in a really important segment.

But then you mentioned earlier some of the volatility in FX markets has led you to be more dynamic in terms of pricing and it's difficult to tell whether that repeats or not. So maybe just to clarify a little bit more -- so we don't just come away thinking, okay, 8 points of price, that's what we heard. That may not tell the whole story in terms of pricing into '22?"

I think certainly, construction as an industry has probably lagged what you see in terms of technology advancements in precision ag. But like we talked, we stand to benefit a lot from moving from just these historical enterprise synergies you've heard Deere talk about to being able to leverage common hardware components, common base software, common sensors and just a different application and different use of those technologies, and they can solve a lot of the same problems in construction. 
Labor availability is tough to find for construction companies, so making machines more automated. It's easier to train a new operator and get them up to speed quickly. When you look at an average job site, estimates would tell you that 30% of the cost of that job site is due to waste and rework. And automation like smart grade, a technology that we have introduced into the market that controls the blade tip, controls the bucket, allows you to do a very precise job down to just over 1 inch precision on the grade, get the grade right, get it fast, do it right the first time and eliminate that 30% waste. 
We've got customer testimonials, it's real. Take rates are on, I'd say, the early part of the adoption curve and it starts to get steep. We're in the mid-double digits and growing. So I think there's a great opportunity. And leveraging Jahmy's organization, leveraging technology developed for ag, we can certainly go a lot faster and at a fraction of the investment that we'd incur if we try to do it all by ourselves."

We provided more visibility to the supply base than we historically have in order to try to work through those challenges and get out ahead of them. But it certainly has been a challenging environment and that very likely continues. 
From a See & Spray select point of view, that is not in the ExactApply take rate that I mentioned. We have limited availability in this early order program. It's a relatively small number that the green on brown solution is a little bit more of a niche operation. But we did fill up the allocation of machines that we had planned for this year.

We've talked about introducing dual distribution with ag dealers as well over the last few years. So we've seen really, really solid and positive results there. So that's just put more pressure on the ability to get more and more inventory out. So that's probably the place where we see the need to build inventory as well as small tractors, where both small tractors and construction are similar in that they're probably in the high teens inventory to sales.

Ag fundamentals continued to be solid year-to-date, and results from our 2022 early order programs indicate demand to remain strong heading into the next fiscal year. Meanwhile, robust fundamentals for our construction and forestry equipment continued into the third quarter, leading to improved levels of profitability and a heightened outlook for the rest of this year.  
Slide 3 shows the results for the third quarter. Net sales and revenue were up 29% to $11.5 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 32% to $10.4 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.667 billion or $5.32 per diluted share.  
Now let's turn to a review of our production and precision ag business, starting on Slide 4. Net sales of $4.25 billion were up 29% compared to the third quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 8 points while currency translation was positive by about 4 points.  
Operating profit was $906 million, resulting in a 21% operating margin for the segment compared to an 18% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher shipment volumes, sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. With respect to the price realization, the above-average results for the quarter were primarily driven by a few different factors. The primary driver came from price adjustments made to offset unfavorable currency movements, which resulted in low double-digit price realization for markets outside North America. North American list prices were up slightly above average and benefited from lower incentive spending.  
Shifting focus to small ag and turf on Slide 5. Net sales were up 32%, totaling $3.147 billion in the third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by just over 3 points, while currency translation was positive by about 3.5 points. For the quarter, operating profit was $582 million, resulting in an 18.5% operating margin for the segment compared to a 14% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was due to higher shipment volumes, sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. Results for the current period were affected by a $27 million onetime gain, while the prior period included $37 million of onetime losses.  
Slide 6 shows our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up about 25% for the year, reflecting improved fundamentals in the ag sector. At this point, we anticipate producing in line with retail demand for the year, keeping inventory levels relatively tight heading into fiscal year '22. As it relates to small ag and turf, we expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to be up about 10%. While our shipment schedules imply production roughly in line with the retail demand, our net sales for small ag and turf products are up higher than the year-over-year change in retail sales as activity recovers from significant underproduction in 2020.  
Moving on to Europe. The industry forecast is -- the industry is forecast to be up about -- or between 10% to 15% as higher commodity prices strengthen business conditions in the arable segment and dairy prices remain resilient even as margins show some pressure from rising input costs. At this time, we've opened our Mannheim tractor order book through the second quarter of 2022, filling all production slots through that time period.  
In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase about 20%. The combination of higher commodity prices, strong production and a favorable currency environment have boosted the profitability of farmers, driving orders through the remainder of the year and into the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, which is as far as we've allowed the order book to grow. Despite limited government-sponsored financing programs, private financing is more widely available this year, supporting continued strength in equipment demand. Industry sales in Asia are forecasted to be up significantly, driven primarily by a strong recovery in the Indian tractor market.  
Moving on to our segment forecasts, beginning on Slide 7. For production and precision ag, net sales are forecast to be up between 25% to 30% in fiscal year '21. The forecast includes a currency tailwind of about 2 points and expectations of nearly 8 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is ranged between 20% and 21% and contemplates consistently solid financial performance across the various geographical regions.  
Slide 8 shows our forecast for small -- for the small ag and turf segment. Net sales in fiscal year '21 are forecast to be up about 25%. The guidance includes expectations for nearly 5 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency impact of about 3 points. The segment's operating margin is forecast to be ranged between 17% and 18%. Before moving on to the results for our construction and forestry division, Jahmy Hindman, our Chief Technology Officer, will offer some thoughts around our recent acquisition of Bear Flag Robotics. Jahmy?"
266112,700826677,2383150,"Deere & Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 20, 2021",2021-08-20,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Thanks, Brent. As many of you are aware, John Deere has a long history of investing in increasing levels of automation in our equipment. These investments have distinctly positioned us to be a leading provider of autonomous solutions for our industry. We'",795,"Thanks, Brent. As many of you are aware, John Deere has a long history of investing in increasing levels of automation in our equipment. These investments have distinctly positioned us to be a leading provider of autonomous solutions for our industry. We're now at a stage of maturity in that journey to make additional bold investments in autonomy, consistent with the tech stack strategy that I shared with you last November.  
Accordingly, earlier this month, we added another exciting capability to our tech stack with our acquisition of Bear Flag Robotics, a technology start-up based in Silicon Valley. Today, I'd like to give you a little more perspective on how this acquisition will accelerate our autonomous capabilities and serve as an important addition to our overall investment in autonomy.  
Bear Flag develops autonomous solutions compatible with existing machines, which means greater tech adoption, increased productivity and improved profitability for our customers. It offers a set of technologies such as LiDAR, cameras and radar that complements our own initiatives and goals to provide customers with solutions that address the individual needs on the farm and the job site.  
The acquisition underscores our smart industrial strategy to deliver smarter machines with advanced technology. It addresses the challenge of scaling food production with fewer available resources, especially that of skilled labor. Increasingly, farm labor shortages are constraining the timing of agronomic jobs or, in some cases, the ability to do that job at all, which has a significant impact on farming outcomes.  
Through autonomy, customers can run their operation more predictably, efficiently, sustainably and profitably from anywhere, ensuring the jobs get done within the optimal timing windows, which has a substantial economic impact. It also represents an important leap forward in our retrofit capabilities across the installed base. We call those performance upgrades, and they'll aid in the evolution of our business model for recurring revenue.  
More important, the combination of John Deere, Blue River and Bear Flag positions autonomy as a key opportunity for differentiated value creation for our customers and our company. We started working with Bear Flag in 2019 as part of Deere's start-up collaborator program. It's an initiative focused on enhancing work with start-up companies whose technology could add value for our customers. It's also an important point of access to some of the leading talent and innovations in our industry.  
Since then, Bear Flag has successfully fielded its autonomous solution on several farms in the United States. As I mentioned, its primary focus has been on its retrofit-first strategy. However, its technical architecture scales quickly with new implements and new tractor models, enabling fast compatibility with a large universe of equipment. This pairs nicely with Deere's comprehensive suite of products across our production systems. And while it's too early to commit to a business model for Bear Flag's products, we're encouraged by their customers' early acceptance of a per-acre approach. This positions autonomy as a service, and we feel that may reduce the barriers to accelerate adoption of the technology.  
This innovative approach and capability are a real testament to the foresight and talent of the Bear Flag team, and I'm confident they will make a strong addition to our current expertise in automation and autonomy.  
Let me wrap up by providing a brief perspective on our thoughts regarding technology investment. Over the last 20 years, we've invested in the building blocks for autonomy, starting with foundational tools like our GPS guidance known as AutoTrac. We've increased the automation in those foundational technologies with the introduction of turn automation and AutoPath being our most recent examples.  
We have also begun automating the quality of the job being done as seen with Combine Advisor. These are core building blocks that set the foundation for autonomy. We've also made strategic investments in companies like Blue River, which has significantly accelerated our time line for both automation and autonomy. Bear Flag Robotics will add new capabilities that help us on this journey as both companies will play a vital role in delivering a full range of autonomous solutions built from a technology foundation that was intentionally crafted over decades for this very moment.  
It's important to note that the breadth and diversity of these use cases introduce a significant complexity. This highlights the ongoing need to expand our tech stack through the acquisition of new technologies while further developing our existing capabilities, which, as you know, are already significant. Looking ahead, we see an enormous opportunity to create even greater customer value through autonomy and are committed to the continued investment in technologies that address the broad array of use cases across agriculture, road building and construction. At this time, I'll turn the call over to John Stone to discuss our construction and forestry division. John?"

So let's look at Slide 11 and talk about construction and forestry's results for the quarter. net sales of just over $3 billion were up 38%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $463 million, resulting in a 15.4% operating margin due to higher shipment volumes and a favorable sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs.  
Turning to Slide 12 and take a look at our industry outlook. North American construction equipment industry sales are forecast to be up between 15% and 20%, sales of compact construction equipment expected to be up 20% to 25%. In addition, forestry equipment, driven by strong lumber demand, is expected to be up 15%. To date, end markets for earthmoving and compact equipment had benefited from a strong housing market, and while this growth rate has slowed a bit, we are beginning to see positive indicators for nonresidential investment and order activity from independent rental companies remains exceptionally strong heading into the fourth quarter. Demand for earthmoving and compact construction equipment will exceed our production for the year, resulting in low inventory levels as we exit the fiscal year.  
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 13. We expect our sales to be up around 30%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes expectations of 5 points of positive price realization and a favorable currency tailwind of about 2 points. Our operating margin is expected to be between 13% and 14% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and nonrecurring expenses from 2020.  
Moving on to Slide 14, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk through our construction and forestry strategy and also address how the recent excavator announcement you saw yesterday aligns with our overall smart industrial journey. The first thing I'd call your attention to on this slide is our mission, and our mission why we exist is to answer the fundamental need for smarter, safer and more sustainable construction so our customers can shape tomorrow's world. As a result of the strategy we initiated last year, C&F division is focused on 3 main priorities: margin improvement, differentiation with precision technology and a new excavator strategy that will better position Deere and its customers for the future. I'll talk a little bit about each of these priorities.  
In the area of margin improvement, we've made considerable progress this year, and our guidance implies a line of sight to the highest operating margin in the division's history. We're committed to further improvements that will give C&F the ability to generate 15% margins at mid-cycle volumes. To improve our current margin profile, we accomplished 3 main objectives over the past 1.5 years. First, we reorganized our division around our customers' production systems to mirror the way they do business. This enables us to deliver greater customer value by helping them become more productive, more profitable and while performing their jobs in a more sustainable way.  
Next, we made significant progress optimizing our cost structure, while at the same time maintaining pricing discipline for our products and fixing or exiting unprofitable business segments. Finally, we adjusted our investment priorities to ensure a greater degree of focus on the products and solutions that are the most differentiated and unlock the highest value for our customers.  
Notably leading the way has been the Wirtgen Group, whose performance has substantiated our original deal thesis as a high-performing business that demonstrates higher growth with less cyclicality than our legacy businesses. We've made significant improvements in the cost structure and worldwide distribution network for the Wirtgen Group. And I expect the group to generate greater than 15% operating margin this year, inclusive of deal amortization and impairments, which is a structural improvement relative to the 10.7% margin we produced during our first full year of ownership. No doubt, Wirtgen's best days are still ahead.  
Moving to differentiating technology. And coming over to C&F from ISG just over a year ago was really eye-opening to see the size of the opportunity in front of us for differentiating technology on the job site and on the roads. Productivity in the construction industry has lagged for years, and machine automation, coordination and access to data can address a sizable portion of this productivity gap. Our strategy and technology stack is enabling us to move beyond historical enterprise synergies to leveraging technology like computer vision, advanced control systems, sensors, software, back-end cloud and machine learning training infrastructure to innovate faster.  
Let me give you a few examples on how this technology will make our products smarter, safer and more sustainable. The next generation of Deere's construction equipment will feature a higher degree of our proprietary technology stack, inclusive of grid control, vision systems and remote monitoring. Roads are going digital and we are positioned well to lead this. We see today's state where no individual machine is used to its full capacity, and this inefficiency is coming from a lack of data, a lack of communication and coordination between machines and different steps of the production system.  
Our analysis indicates cost savings in the range of 15% to 30% is possible versus today's traditional methods of roadbuilding and road rehabilitation. And when a 3-mile road rehabilitation project can cost $1 million to $1.5 million, this is a big opportunity. These technologies will also serve to make job sites considerably safer, which is a top priority for our customers. And while we use much the same hardware and software you would encounter on a Blue River See & Spray machine, a construction site is different, of course. It's busy, it's crowded but a lot of the base technology is just the same, but we'll collect different data and train our neural networks on different data sets and use different onboard software for machine control.  
Lastly, we feel we are uniquely positioned to help further the use of recycled and renewable building materials. And for many reasons, construction equipment is likely to lead the way on full electric machines, and we look forward to providing further updates on that in the future.  
Moving on to our new excavator strategy, on Slide 15 is a summary of the transaction highlights, which you also saw in our press release and our 8-K. As noted in the press release, we've entered into definitive agreements with Hitachi Construction Machinery to purchase the Deere-Hitachi joint venture businesses, including 3 factories and a license agreement for the intellectual property for continued manufacture of the current lineup. We will continue to source components from Hitachi and manufacture the current products at our existing locations for the near term.  
For those of you who may not be familiar with our long-standing relationship with Hitachi, let me provide a little context. Deere has produced excavators through a joint venture agreement with Hitachi for the last 30 years. Our jointly-owned factories have produced Hitachi-designed machines, which were distributed under both the Deere and Hitachi brands through the Deere channel in the Americas. This joint venture has been successful and served us well over the years.  
Our new strategy will allow us to leverage our own technology and designs, specifically focused on the markets that matter most to us, furthering the value unlock for our customers with Deere-on-Deere machines while accelerating our innovation and response time to customer and dealer feedback on products. To that end, we've been investing in our own proprietary excavator designs for well over a decade, serving markets outside of the Americas. And we have plans to introduce our next generation of excavators in the Americas in a time line that complements our supply agreement with Hitachi. Finally, I would highlight we do expect this transaction to be accretive to earnings in year 1. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to Brent."

Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the third quarter was $227 million, benefiting from an improvement on operating lease residual values as well as income earned on a higher average portfolio, a lower provision for credit losses and more favorable financing spreads. For fiscal year 2021, the net income forecast is now $850 million as the segment continues to benefit from the same factors realized during the quarter.  
Slide 18 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year '21, our full year outlook for net income is now forecast to be between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion. The full year forecast reflects the impact from higher raw material prices and logistics costs, which we estimate to have added an additional $1.5 billion in expense experienced mostly in the back half of the year. The guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 22% and 24%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in a range of $5.8 billion to $6 billion. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Campbell for closing comments. Ryan?"

Before we respond to your questions, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our financial results and the current demand environment as well as provide some commentary on the execution of our strategy. The company continued to demonstrate stro",663,"Thanks, Brent. Before we respond to your questions, I'd like to offer a few thoughts on our financial results and the current demand environment as well as provide some commentary on the execution of our strategy. The company continued to demonstrate strong performance in the third quarter while challenges in the supply base persisted and, in some cases, became more complicated. We owe this solid execution to the extraordinary efforts made by our workforce for getting our products to the field and to our dealer channel for best-in-class customer support.  
At this time, we expect many of these challenges to persist through the end of this year and into next. Our guidance reflects a continuation of these challenges but does not contemplate a significant shutdown of operations. Despite the challenging production environment, end market demand remains robust, with order activity providing excellent visibility for our large ag production throughout much of fiscal year '22.  
Results from our planter and sprayer early order programs indicate robust demand will continue well into next year. In fact, we were able to fill our available production slots for fiscal year '22, early in the first phase of the program. At this time, we expect production rates for our crop care products to be up strong double digits on a percentage basis in fiscal year '22 compared to fiscal year '21. Even more encouraging is the take rates for our advanced precision features, which were up significantly from last year, reaching all-time highs.  
Our large tractor order book in the U.S. extends through the second quarter of fiscal year '22, and we have not yet opened it up for orders in the second half of the year. Encouragingly, take rates for our premium and automation activations also reached all-time highs. While we manage this strong demand environment, we are also laser-focused on executing our strategy that will unlock significant new economic headroom for our customers while driving higher levels of sustainability in their operations. As we reflect on what we have built to date and the possibilities we see in the future, we will aggressively make investments that promote deeper customer engagement in our digital platforms and software-driven solutions.  
As we speak, our production systems teams are analyzing each step in our customers' processes and designing or concepting solutions that will increase output while reducing the inputs required. As these types of solutions gain traction, we see the potential for a future less dependent on sales of new equipment units each year and instead, a future tied more closely to the jobs our customers do year in and year out enabled by the technology that makes them more profitable, productive and sustainable.  
Over the next year, we'll talk a bit more about how this transformation will impact the company's goals and ambitions beyond our current set of goals slated for 2022. Ultimately, our next generation of goals will align to the activities and investments required to unlock the total addressable market of new value creation for our customers, which we believe is significant.  
Lastly, the third quarter provided a good representation of our use of cash priorities. Last quarter, I noted that our heightened cash flow levels would enable us to invest more in our technology stack as well as increased cash return to shareholders. And as we indicated, we made investments that will support our smart industrial strategy and will deliver long-term value for shareholders. Beyond that, we raised our dividend by 18% in the second quarter, and in the third quarter, repurchased over $700 million in shares, our highest amount in 6 years.  
In summary, despite some of the near-term operational challenges, we expect to continue delivering on our financial goals while, at the same time, accelerating our investments in technology and sustainability. Although still early, we are convinced that our strategy will drive differentiated outcomes for our customers and all stakeholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress over the next few quarters."

As we look at the early order program, the crop care supply sprayers, as that opened up, we essentially filled the full year of production in the first phase of the program so we will not run additional phases there. And when you think about combines, so for combines, we recently opened that up. We're doing that a little bit differently this year in that we've allowed orders to begin. But we are taking time pausing to be able to manage price/cost dynamics there so we can make those adjustments.  
And then from a price point of view for the PPA products, for production, precision ag products that we have out, either under the order or that we've taken orders on, have carried a roughly 8% price increase for 2022."

And if you look unit volume, it's typically 35%, 40% of any given market. Our share would not be the numbers you said, probably in the range of half that, in fact. And so when we look at our other core earthmoving product lines, we do see an opportunity to improve that share quite a bit.  
The margin story is a little bit different. If you think about a 50-50 joint venture structure where Hitachi did the design, we jointly did the manufacturer and then Deere was responsible for the distribution, there is a margin sharing aspect of that relationship. And obviously, as we move to a more traditional supply agreement with Hitachi, that margin sharing goes away. So it's really a mechanical adjustment to that part of the business that will improve the margins.  
And then as we're able to introduce Deere designs, Deere technology in the future, we see that really as further upside to both margin and share in a really important segment.

I think more importantly than just the share gains and losses are some of the changes we made in terms of how we interact, how we work with our dealers to drive the right behavior. And what we've seen from a return rate perspective is we've seen very, very solid improvements, really to the levels we haven't seen for well over 6, 7 years. So that's been particularly positive.  
As you noted, we've seen gains on the lease book the last few quarters, which has been positive and really demonstrates the underlying demand for used equipment. The upward price pressure we're seeing really across all categories of used equipment from ag to construction and forestry. The current environment with inventories of used quite low and new inventory very low, our expectation would be that, that continues. We wouldn't see a significant shift there.  
And as you look at channel inventories, whether it's small ag, production, precision ag or construction forestry, we're at near historic levels -- low levels across all categories. So we think there's probably a multiyear recovery to rebuild those channel inventories. So I wouldn't expect new inventory to put any pressure on used at this point."

Labor availability is tough to find for construction companies, so making machines more automated. It's easier to train a new operator and get them up to speed quickly. When you look at an average job site, estimates would tell you that 30% of the cost of that job site is due to waste and rework. And automation like smart grade, a technology that we have introduced into the market that controls the blade tip, controls the bucket, allows you to do a very precise job down to just over 1 inch precision on the grade, get the grade right, get it fast, do it right the first time and eliminate that 30% waste.  
We've got customer testimonials, it's real. Take rates are on, I'd say, the early part of the adoption curve and it starts to get steep. We're in the mid-double digits and growing.

And leveraging Jahmy's organization, leveraging technology developed for ag, we can certainly go a lot faster and at a fraction of the investment that we'd incur if we try to do it all by ourselves."

And that's a combination of very strong demand, some of the supply constraints. But we've also been -- we've been growing share.  
We've talked about introducing dual distribution with ag dealers as well over the last few years. So we've seen really, really solid and positive results there. So that's just put more pressure on the ability to get more and more inventory out. So that's probably the place where we see the need to build inventory as well as small tractors, where both small tractors and combat construction are similar in that they're probably in the high teens inventory to sales. And typically, those are probably in the 40% range or so. So to your point, probably a long multiyear recovery to get those back up to the inventory sales levels that we think are best. 
I think we've got time for 1 more question."

Ag fundamentals remained strong through the course of the year and our order books indicate another year of robust demand in 2022. Meanwhile, the Construction & Forestry markets also continued to benefit from strong demand and lean inventories, leading to the division's strongest financial results in over 15 years.
Now let's take a closer look at our year-end results for 2021, beginning on Slide 3. For the full year, net sales and revenues were up 24% to $44 billion, while net sales for equipment operations increased 27% to $39.7 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $5.96 billion or $18.99 per diluted share.
Slide 4 shows the results for the fourth quarter. Net sales and revenue were up 16% to $11.3 billion, while net sales for the equipment operations were up 19% to nearly $10.3 billion. Net income attributable to Deere & Company was $1.283 billion or $4.12 per diluted share.
At this time, I'd like to welcome Cory Reed, President of Production and Precision Ag, to the call to discuss the segment's results and provide an update on the global ag environment. Cory?"

Before I cover our fourth quarter results, I'd like to recognize all of John Deere's 77,000 employees for their tremendous hard work and dedication throughout a year filled with unpredictability. I'd also like to recognize the ongoing efforts and unparalleled capabilities of the John Deere dealer network, that's not only an integral part of our value proposition in the market, but also often called upon in the toughest of times to keep our customers up and running.
Let's start with fourth quarter results for Production and Precision Ag starting on Slide 5. Net sales of $4.66 billion were up 23% compared to the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 7 points and currency translation was also positive by roughly 1 point.
Operating profit was $777 million, resulting in a 16.7% operating margin for the segment compared to 15.2% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by positive price realization, higher shipment volumes and mix, partially offset by higher production costs. Also, it's worth noting that last year's results were negatively impacted by employee separation expenses resulting from restructuring activities.
Shifting focus to Small Ag & Turf on Slide 6. Net sales were up 17%, totaling $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by just over 4 points, while currency translation was minimal. For the quarter, operating profit was $346 million, resulting in a 12.3% operating margin. The higher shipment volumes, sales mix and price realization were partially offset by higher production costs, R&D and SA&G. When comparing to the fourth quarter of 2020, keep in mind, the prior period included $77 million in separation costs and impairments. 
Slide 7 shows our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up approximately 15%, reflecting another year of strong demand. In fiscal year '21, customer demand driven by the combination of strong fundamentals, an advanced fleet age and low inventory outpaced the industry's ability to supply. With all of these dynamics still present in '22, we expect demand to exceed the industry's ability to produce for a second consecutive year as supply-based delays continue to constrain shipments.
Order books for the upcoming year are mostly full, except for a few cases where we've caused orders to manage supply challenges and allow us to reevaluate inflationary pressure later in the year. Currently, orders are complete for the year's production of crop care products, while our combined production slots are over 90% full, with the early order program still ongoing. Meanwhile, large tractor orders are sourced well into the third quarter, and we expect the remainder of the book to fill out shortly.
We're encouraged that take rates for our mainstay precision technologies like Combine Advisor, ExactApply and ExactEmerge, continue to track higher year-over-year. More recent product introductions such as ExactRate Planners and the X9 combine saw significant increases when compared to last year, while our premium and automation software activation take rates are over 85% for our 8 Series and 9R Series tractors.
Additionally, we saw significant increases in customer engagement with our digital tools in 2021. Engaged acres now stand at over 315 million acres, due in part to a sharp increase in Europe, where the number of engaged acres has doubled over the past year. Likewise, use of our digital features such as Expert Alerts and Service Advisor Remote has increased by about 30% compared to last year. In the Small Ag & Turf segment, we expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to remain flat for the year as supply challenges continue to limit industry production. Following 2 years of very robust demand, field inventory levels are at multiyear lows and are unlikely to begin recovering until sometime in 2023. 
Moving on to Europe. The industry is forecast to be up roughly 5% as higher commodity prices strengthened business conditions in the Arable segment and dairy prices remain resilient even as margins show some pressure from rising input costs. We expect the industry will continue to face supply-based constraints, resulting in demand outstripping production for the year. At this time, our order book extends into the third quarter from Mannheim Tractors.
In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase about 5%. Farmer sentiment and profitability remains steady at all-time highs as our customers benefit from robust commodity prices, record production and a favorable currency environment. Our order books reflect the strong sentiment and currently extends into the second quarter, which is as far as we've allowed it to grow. Despite limited government-sponsored financing programs, private financing is supporting continued strength in equipment demand, while strong farmer balance sheets enable many customers to purchase using cash. Industry sales in Asia are forecasted to be flat as India, the world's largest tractor market by units, hold steady in 2022. 
Moving on to our segment forecast beginning on Slide 8. For Production & Precision Ag, net sales are forecasted to be up between 20% and 25% in fiscal year '22. Forecast includes expectations of about 9 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is between 20% and 21%, reflecting consistently solid financial performance across the various geographical regions. 
Slide 9 shows our forecast for the Small Ag & Turf segment. We expect net sales in fiscal year '22 to be up 15% to 20%. This guidance includes nearly 7 points of positive price realization and roughly 1 point of currency headwind. The segment's operating margin is forecasted to range between 16% and 17%.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Brent Norwood."

Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 10. For the quarter, net sales of $2.8 billion were up 14%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and 6 points of positive price realization. Operating profit moved higher year-over-year",660,"Thanks, Cory. Now let's focus on Construction & Forestry on Slide 10. For the quarter, net sales of $2.8 billion were up 14%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and 6 points of positive price realization. Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $270 million, resulting in a 9.6% operating margin due to positive price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production costs, SA&G and R&D. The quarter also benefited from the lack of onetime expenses included in the prior period.
Let's turn to our 2022 Construction & Forestry industry outlook on Slide 11. Both earthmoving and compact construction equipment industry sales in North America are expected to be up between 5% and 10%. End markets for earthmoving and compact equipment are expected to remain strong in our fiscal year '22 forecast, benefiting from continued strength in the housing market increased activity in the oil and gas sector as well as strong CapEx programs from the independent rental companies.
Demand for earthmoving and compact construction equipment is expected to exceed our production for the year, resulting in continued low inventory levels, especially for compact construction equipment. In forestry, we now expect the industry to be up about 10% to 15% as lumber production looks to remain at elevated levels throughout the year, even though lumber prices have come down from peaks in mid-summer. 
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 12. Deere's Construction & Forestry 2022 net sales are forecasted to be up between 10% to 15%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes about 8 points of positive price realization. We expect the segment's operating margin to be between 13.5% and 14.5% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and lack of onetime items from the prior year. 
Now -- let's move now to our financial services operations on Slide 13. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the fourth quarter was $227 million, benefiting from income earned as improvements on the operating lease portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. Results for the prior were also affected by employee separation costs. For fiscal year 2022, the net income forecast is $870 million as the segment is expected to continue to benefit from a higher average portfolio.
Slide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year 2022, our full year outlook for net income is forecasted to be between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. The full year forecast is inclusive of the impact from higher raw material prices and logistics costs relative to 2021. At this time, we expect 2/3 of that increase to manifest itself in the first half of the year as the comparisons get easier in the back half of fiscal year '22. At this time, our forecasted price realization is expected to outpace both material cost and freight for the entire year, though we will likely be price cost negative in the first quarter. 
Moving on to tax. Our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 25% and 27%. Lastly cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion and includes a $1 billion voluntary contribution to our pension and OPEB plans.
Before we open up the line for Q&A, we'd like to first address a few of the likely questions around the current market dynamics, our financial results and the details around our new labor agreement as well as provide some thoughts on capital allocation for the next year. To cover the range of topics, I'll engage today's call participants to provide some additional color, and then we'll open up the line for additional questions. 
First, I'd like to start with the current demand environment for large ag equipment. Cory, can you provide some additional color on demand for large ag products and which new technologies are resonating with customers?"

We're really encouraged by both the velocity of our order books and the take rates for some of our latest technology. Demand has been strong since the beginning of 2021. And overall, that doesn't look like it's going to let up in 2022. I touched on this earlier. 
Our order books are either full or near full for most of our North American large ag product lines. Starting with the combine EOP, our EOP for 2022 production will finish in January, where we'll grow the levels of F-Series production, and we've already sold out of our planned production for X9 combines. This is the first year in a multiyear ramp-up of production for X9 and we'll ship 1,000-plus units of X9 into North America alone. 
We'll further solidify our market leadership in the Power Class 9 Plus combine categories, while also establishing a clear new global benchmark in both productivity and efficiency. We're also seeing strong demand for some of our newer products, products like ExactRate Planner, Applied Fertilizer Systems and AutoPath. ExactRate represents an important first step in the precision application of fertilizer. Future iterations of this product will be critical in helping us improve nitrogen use efficiency for our customers. In just its second year, we're seeing take rates of that product close to 20%, which is really encouraging.
Similarly, in the first full season, we've seen tremendous feedback from the launch of John Deere AutoPath. AutoPath leverages John Deere's onboard technology like our Gen 4 displays, [ SF-6000 ] receivers, including the [ SF3 ] correction signal and embedded software linked to the John Deere Operations Center throughout a customer's entire production cycle. That technology leverages data from planting to know exactly where the row unit traveled to plant seeds and then creates a guidance line for each subsequent path, making in-season fertilizer applications, manual cultivation for weeding or crop protection passes easier and more accurate. At harvest, it makes it easier to find your [indiscernible] and makes that easy for harvest to be even more efficient.
In 2021, we saw take rates of the automation package activation or subscription, which includes AutoPath, double, leading to more customers enabled with John Deere's highest-value precision ag software. In 2022 and beyond, we'll continue to add value to AutoPath, through new features and new technologies as a part of our precision ag software package strategies and AutoPath will be foundational for even more automated farming in the future, making every step of our customers' production system even better.
Lastly, See & Spray. See & Spray Ultimate is going to hit the market this year on a limited basis, and we're excited to get into more customers' hands. We view See & Spray as just the first step in a long series of sense and act. In that journey, we're encouraged by to see early demand for both See& Spray itself and multiple products related to plant level management in the future."

First, we would -- if you think about first quarter '22, we expect the top line for the equip ops to be pretty similar to the first quarter of '21. Missing a few weeks plus of production will neutralize some of the benefits that Cory mentioned in terms of ramping up to higher line rates in December and January. 
With respect to margins, there are a few things to consider. The first quarter will have our toughest price/cost comp for the year. We expect that to be negative in the first quarter but positive for the full year. We also expect to experience poor overhead absorption due to the lower volumes as mentioned. And there are a few other onetime items that will provide some additional drag, including ratification bonus and some favorable tax credits that we saw in the first quarter of of '21, that don't repeat in '22. 
All in, we expect first quarter margins to be mid- to high single digits for the equipment operations, with those businesses that have been most affected by the delayed ratification to be below that average. Looking beyond the first quarter, though we do expect margins for the rest of the year to be more favorable and incremental is more in line with historical averages. And maybe stepping back and just thinking about the full year impact on margins, we'd say it will be about 1 point lower as a result of a combination of work stoppage and some of the supply disruption."

The smart industrial strategy that we put in place during 2020 is the foundation for us to focus our resources on the areas that are most differentiated from a customer value perspective. It's through that lens that we are positioned to increase the level of investment back into our business, both organically and inorganically through M&A.
As you can see in our guidance, the R&D investment is up 17% in 2022. The focus of the increase is on further developing our tech stack, which accelerates our capabilities related to sense and act, autonomy, digital solutions, connectivity and electrification. We're planning to demonstrate many of our new technologies at our Investor Tech Day in mid-2022. So stay tuned for that exciting event. 
Finally, as it relates to M&A, expect us to continue to be active, aligned with the themes that we have discussed over the last year."

So a lot of our pricing comes from our ability to deliver technologies and the machines that make them or give them the ability to create more yield or manage their cost differently. So that's a big part of it. Now obviously, in the last 18 months, with a lot of the commodity increases, there's also been the opportunity to recover for some of those commodities, and that's allowed us to do that.
But by and large, I would tell you that our pricing model is based upon delivering value for them and being able to make sure that each time they can go to the field, we can make them more profitable by using the equipment that we put out there. And each of the examples [indiscernible] the See & Spray or X9 or AutoPath, that's what they do, is allow him to either create more yield or manage their cost and be more efficient in the field.

And as we think about the '22 plan, we went in assuming that similar level of disruption in activity in supply chain. So we haven't embedded a significant amount of improvement there. We expect to continue to be challenged and choppy.
One of the things we did do during the last couple of months is we continue to bring parts in, parts and components into our facilities. So we were able to continue that. We didn't slow that down. So that's positive as we ramp up, as Cory mentioned, start to ramp up production coming back. That's important, but we think that continues to be a challenge. And it's broad-based.
So chips, you mentioned, very tight. We expect that continues through '22. Other things, there's material challenges. There's labor availability in the supply base and in this extent across many geographies, so logistics become a challenge as well. So we're continuing to work through those supply management teams working really closely with our suppliers. We've given them more visibility than we ever had before to try to work through this and we've tried to plan accordingly."

And then just also, there seems to be a lot of investor chatter that soaring input cost for the farmer are going to lead to a big slowdown in equipment demand or premature end of the cycle. I mean, it seems like the opposite might be true if lower fertilizer application rates lead to greater demand for precision ag as well as lower yields.

I mean one of the things we're focused on is even as we were in the middle of the interruption, was making sure that we could deliver products on time seasonally for our customers. Planting is the top end of that. We continued and made sure we could surge components into our planning lines as people are coming back. We've got a production plan that's commensurate with what our early order program is. 
We do have some risks. We've gone out and talked to our customers about where we are and our dealers about where we are with that. But we feel really confident in our ability to deliver even more planners into the market this year. And where we have the opportunity, if customers want to accept planters later in the season, we'll do that as well. So from that standpoint, we operate with transparency, talk to our dealers and customers and then put a good production plan together that allows us to meet market demand. That demand hasn't slowed. In fact, it's continued and much like all of our other large ag products, planters are one of those things that even post the optimum planning window, people are taking product."

But where are we at right now and how we're seeing this play out, we feel like there is continued runway of replacement recovery out here to continue and to be had. 
And as for a few reasons, one, underlying farm fundamentals continue to be very strong, whether it's cash receipts, income, what we're seeing, land values, for example, those are positive. We see demand for replacement. The age of the fleet, you've heard us talk about this a lot. '21, we got older. And even as we look to '22, we'd expect the fleet overall in North America to age out. And then you have this dynamic that we've seen in '21 and repeated in '22, where demand is above the industry's ability to deliver. Further, in our mind, stretches or elongate a little bit of that recovery cycle. And as mentioned earlier, inventory levels for both new and used are quite low.
So again, when you think about comparing back, we get comparisons back to 2012 and '13, and some of the dynamics, one of the big differences is we are at significantly lower levels of inventory, which makes some of the replacement demand push out a bit further. And then lastly, as it relates to input costs, as input costs rise, the impact that our precision tools can have in terms of leveraging technology to drive more accuracy, more precision with inputs, whether that's seed, fertilizer chemical and make that value proposition even more attractive. 
And if you -- Cory talked a little bit about this in his prepared remarks, but the take rates that we're seeing on technology took a significant step up. Where ExactApply; on sprayers, 55%, which is up quite a bit. ExactEmerge on planters, 55%. And then we're seeing that really across these technologies, a pretty significant step function change in terms of the use of the technology that drives, again, back to better yields and lower cost through increased precision. So we'll continue to execute there, but we feel like there are legs to this recovery that we're in and really began about 1 year ago right now. So thanks, Ross. We'll go ahead and jump to our next question."

And the freight is driven by essentially, all different modes, whether it's air, ocean, truck, all those things are impactful there.
On the material side, it's things like the raw that you mentioned, steel, for example. Traditionally, we buy roughly a quarter ahead. We have seen from a pure spot price, you've seen steel moderate some from where it was peaking probably a bit, a quarter or so ago. So we haven't adjusted significantly, we do work with supply base to ensure that we've got availability. So given the demand we have in the customer desire to get product, we will try to balance that. in terms of having product and making sure we've got the availability of raws.
So I mean, from a price perspective, we haven't gotten into the detail of where we're at or where we're locking in. But definitely, we do expect to see more of that come through the first half of the year, and our comps get a little bit easier in the back half. So of that $2 billion, we expect about 2/3 to come through in the first half of '22.
And maybe lastly, similar splits in terms of the businesses. About half of that is Production Precision Ag; about 30% is Small Ag & Turf; and roughly 20%, C&F. And a lot of that just varies based on the products and the makeup overall of their material. With that, we'll go ahead and jump to our next question."

We think those -- that type of program, it's very, very positive for the industry. It tends to have a long run of impact, but probably start to see more of that in '23. 
When we step back and look at that, there's a significant amount of funding that is roads, bridges, waterways, broadband, all of which really are very attractive and applicable to our earthmoving and road building businesses. So that's -- I think that's particularly positive. If you look at our industry outlooks, we're -- and again, this is muted somewhat by just the supply constraints, but up 5% to 10% North America for both construction and compact construction. Globally, we'd say road building is probably in that same vein of 5% to 10%. 
So we'll keep our eyes out there. Dealers are obviously working very closely with customers. I think we'll watch the independent rental companies.

Let's start with fourth quarter results for production and precision ag starting on Slide 5. Net sales of $4.66 billion were up 23% compared to the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 7 points, and currency translation was also positive by roughly 1 point. Operating profit was $777 million, resulting in a 16.7% operating margin for the segment compared to 15.2% margin for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by positive price realization, higher shipment volumes and mix, partially offset by higher production costs. Also, it's worth noting that last year's results were negatively impacted by employee separation expenses resulting from restructuring activities.
Shifting focus to small ag and turf on Slide 6. Net sales were up 17%, totaling $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization. Price realization in the quarter was positive by just over 4 points, while currency translation was minimal. For the quarter, operating profit was $346 million, resulting in a 12.3% operating margin. The higher shipment volumes, sales mix and price realization were partially offset by higher production costs, R&D and SA&G. When comparing to the fourth quarter of 2020, keep in mind the prior period included $77 million in separation costs and impairments. 
Slide 7 shows our industry outlook for ag and turf markets globally. In the U.S. and Canada, we expect industry sales of large ag equipment to be up approximately 15%, reflecting another year of strong demand. In fiscal year '21, customer demand driven by the combination of strong fundamentals, an advanced fleet age and low inventory outpaced the industry's ability to supply. With all of these dynamics still present in '22, we expect demand to exceed the industry's ability to produce for a second consecutive year as supply-based delays continue to constrain shipments.
Order books for the upcoming year are mostly full, except for a few cases where we've paused orders to manage supply challenges and allow us to reevaluate inflationary pressure later in the year. Currently, orders are complete for the year's production of crop care products, while our combine production slots are over 90% full with the Early Order Program still ongoing. Meanwhile, large tractor orders are sourced well into the third quarter, and we expect the remainder of the book to fill out shortly.
We're encouraged that take rates for our mainstay precision technologies, like Combine Advisor, ExactApply and ExactEmerge, continue to track higher year-over-year. More recent product introductions, such as ExactRate planters and the X9 combine, saw significant increases when compared to last year, while our premium and automation software activation take rates are over 85% for our 8 Series and 9R Series tractors.
Additionally, we saw significant increases in customer engagement with our digital tools in 2021. Engaged acres now stand at over 315 million acres, due, in part, to a sharp increase in Europe, where the number of engaged acres has doubled over the past year. Likewise, use of our digital features, such as Expert Alerts and Service ADVISOR Remote, has increased by about 30% compared to last year. 
In the small ag and turf segment, we expect industry sales in the U.S. and Canada to remain flat for the year as supply challenges continue to limit industry production. Following 2 years of very robust demand, field inventory levels are at multiyear lows and are unlikely to begin recovering until sometime in 2023. 
Moving on to Europe. The industry is forecast to be up roughly 5% as higher commodity prices strengthened business conditions in the arable segment, and dairy prices remain resilient, even as margins show some pressure from rising input costs. We expect the industry will continue to face supply-based constraints, resulting in demand outstripping production for the year. At this time, our order book extends into the third quarter from Mannheim tractors.
In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase about 5%. Farmer sentiment and profitability remained steady at all-time highs as our customers benefit from robust commodity prices, record production and a favorable currency environment. Our order books reflect the strong sentiment and currently extends into the second quarter, which is as far as we've allowed it to grow. Despite limited government-sponsored financing programs, private financing is supporting continued strength in equipment demand, while strong farmer balance sheets enable many customers to purchase using cash. 
Industry sales in Asia are forecast to be flat as India, the world's largest tractor market by units, holds steady in 2022. 
Moving on to our segment forecast beginning on Slide 8. For production and precision ag, net sales are forecast to be up between 20% and 25% in fiscal year '22. Forecast includes expectations of about 9 points of positive price realization for the full year. For the segment's operating margin, our full year forecast is between 20% and 21%, reflecting consistently solid financial performance across the various geographical regions.
Slide 9 shows our forecast for the small ag and turf segment. We expect net sales in fiscal year '22 to be up 15% to 20%. This guidance includes nearly 7 points of positive price realization and roughly 1 point of currency headwind. The segment's operating margin is forecasted to range between 16% and 17%.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Brent Norwood."

For the quarter, net sales of $2.8 billion were up 14%, primarily due to higher shipment volumes and 6 points of positive price realization. Operating profit moved higher year-over-year to $270 million, resulting in a 9.6% operating margin due to positive price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production costs, SA&G and R&D. The quarter also benefited from the lack of onetime expenses included in the prior period.
Let's turn to our 2022 construction and forestry industry outlook on Slide 11. Both earthmoving and compact construction equipment industry sales in North America are expected to be up between 5% and 10%. End markets for earthmoving and compact equipment are expected to remain strong in our fiscal year '22 forecast, benefiting from continued strength in the housing market, increased activity in the oil and gas sector, as well as strong CapEx programs from the independent rental companies.
Demand for earthmoving and compact construction equipment is expected to exceed our production for the year, resulting in continued low inventory levels, especially for compact construction equipment. In forestry, we now expect the industry to be up about 10% to 15% as lumber production looks to remain at elevated levels throughout the year, even though lumber prices have come down from peaks in midsummer. 
Moving to the C&F segment outlook on Slide 12. Deere's construction and forestry 2022 net sales are forecasted to be up between 10% to 15%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes about 8 points of positive price realization. We expect the segment's operating margin to be between 13.5% and 14.5% for the year, benefiting from price, volume and lack of onetime items from the prior year. 
Now -- let's move now to our financial services operations on Slide 13. Worldwide financial services net income attributable to Deere & Company in the fourth quarter was $227 million, benefiting from income earned on higher average portfolio and favorable financing spreads as well as improvements operating lease portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. Results for the prior period were also affected by employee separation costs. For fiscal year 2022, the net income forecast is $870 million as the segment is expected to continue to benefit from a higher average portfolio.
Slide 14 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year 2022, our full year outlook for net income is forecasted to be between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. We expect 2/3 of that increase to manifest itself in the first half of the year as the comparisons get easier in the back half of fiscal year 2022. At this time, our forecasted price realization is expected to outpace both material cost and freight for the entire year, though we will likely be price cost negative in the first quarter. Moving on to tax. Our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 25% and 27%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is expected to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion and includes a $1 billion voluntary contribution to our pension and OPEB plans.
Before we open up the line for Q&A, we'd like to first address a few of the likely questions around the current market dynamics, our financial results and the details around our new labor agreement as well as provide some thoughts on capital allocation for the next year. To cover the range of topics, I'll engage today's call participants to provide some additional color, and then we'll open up the line for additional questions. 
First, I'd like to start with the current demand environment for large ag equipment. Cory, can you provide some additional color on demand for large ag products and which new technologies are resonating with customers?"
266112,700826664,2448322,"Deere & Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2021",2021-11-24,"Earnings Calls","Deere & Company","Executives","Yes. Thanks, Brent. We're really encouraged by both the velocity of our order books and the take rates for some of our latest technology. Demand has been strong since the beginning of 2021. And overall, that doesn't look like it's going to let up in 2022.",498,"Yes. Thanks, Brent. We're really encouraged by both the velocity of our order books and the take rates for some of our latest technology. Demand has been strong since the beginning of 2021. And overall, that doesn't look like it's going to let up in 2022. 
I touched on this earlier. Our order books are either full or near full for most of our North American large ag product lines. Starting with the combine EOP, our EOP for 2022 production will finish in January, where we'll grow the levels of S-Series production, and we've already sold out of our planned production for X9 combines. This is the first year in a multiyear ramp-up of production for X9, and we'll ship 1,000-plus units of X9 into North America alone. 
We'll further solidify our market leadership in the power Class 9 plus combine categories while also establishing a clear, new global benchmark in both productivity and efficiency. We're also seeing strong demand for some of our newer products, products like ExactRate planter applied fertilizer systems and AutoPath. ExactRate represents an important first step in the precision application of fertilizer. Future iterations of this product will be critical in helping us improve nitrogen use efficiency for our customers. In just its second year, we're seeing take rates of that product close to 20%, which is really encouraging.
Similarly, in the first full season, we've seen tremendous feedback from the launch of John Deere AutoPath. AutoPath leverages John Deere's onboard technology like our Gen 4 displays, SF 6000 receivers, including the SF3 correction signal and embedded software linked to the John Deere Operations Center throughout a customer's entire production cycle. That technology leverages data from planting to know exactly where the row unit traveled to plant seeds and then creates a guidance line for each subsequent path, making in-season fertilizer applications, manual cultivation for weeding or crop protection process easier and more accurate. At harvest, it makes it easier to find where your guess row is and makes that easy for harvest to be even more efficient.
In 2021, we saw take rates of the automation package activation or subscription, which includes AutoPath, double, leading to more customers enabled with John Deere's highest-value precision ag software. In 2022 and beyond, we'll continue to add value to AutoPath through new features and new technologies as a part of our precision ag software package strategies. And AutoPath will be foundational for even more automated farming in the future, making every step of our customers' production system even better.
Lastly, See & Spray. See & Spray Ultimate is going to hit the market this year on a limited basis, and we're excited to get it into more customers' hands. We view See & Spray as the -- just the first step in a long series of sense and act. In that journey, we're encouraged by to see early demand for both See & Spray itself and multiple products related to plant-level management in the future."

There are a number of unique items impacting the first quarter. First, we would -- if you think about first quarter '22, we expect the top line for the equip ops to be pretty similar to the first quarter of '21. Missing a few weeks plus of production will neutralize some of the benefits that Cory mentioned in terms of ramping up to higher line rates in December and January. 
With respect to margins, there are a few things to consider. The first quarter will have our toughest price cost comp for the year. We expect that to be negative in the first quarter but positive for the full year. We also expect to experience poor overhead absorption due to the lower volumes, as mentioned. And there are a few other onetime items that will provide some additional drag, including ratification bonus and some favorable tax credits that we saw in the first quarter of '21 that don't repeat in '22. 
All in, we expect first quarter margins to be mid- to high single digits for the equipment operations with those businesses that have been most affected by the delayed ratification to be below that average. Looking beyond the first quarter, though we do expect margins for the rest of the year to be more favorable and incrementals more in line with historical averages. And maybe stepping back and just thinking about the full year impact on margins, we'd say it will be about 1 point lower as a result of a combination of work stoppage and some of the supply disruption."

Given what we're seeing broadly, demand above the industry's ability to produce, we would expect most everything we ship gets retailed but no replenishment of those inventories. 
As a result of that, whether it's large ag equipment, small ag and construction, we think it probably takes multiple years to rebuild some of the field inventory levels coming off of historic lows. For example, if we look at small tractors or compact construction equipment, they are in the teens inventory to sales as we ended the year. And the targets there are probably closer to 40-plus percent inventory to sales. So there's a lot of room to go there. And even large ag, which traditionally comes down, we're at levels we've really not seen before. Row crop tractors, 10% inventory to sales; combines, low single digits, so very, very low. And I think as we consider how this continued replacement drives forward, we do see that as positive in that we see the need to recover inventory over a few years, not just one.

I think, certainly, farmers have seen some headwinds relative to their overall input cost. I think the first part is to for us to focus on being able to deliver technologies that help them improve their profitability. 
So a lot of our pricing comes from our ability to deliver technologies and the machines that make them or give them the ability to create more yield or manage their cost differently. So that's a big part of it. 
Now obviously, in the last 18 months, with a lot of the commodity increases, there's also been the opportunity to recover for some of those commodities, and that's allowed us to do that.
But by and large, I would tell you that our pricing model is based upon delivering value for them and being able to make sure that each time they can go to the field, we can make them more profitable by using the equipment that we put out there. And each of the examples, like the See & Spray or X9 or AutoPath, that's what they do is allow him to either create more yield or manage their cost and be more efficient in the field.

There's an outsized proportion of that impact is in production and precision ag most largely affected. The -- if we think about the puts and takes, particularly in the first quarter, as I mentioned, you've got some amount of lower production impacting that, which drives lower overhead absorption.

And then there, again, you have the larger portion of some onetime items, like ratification bonus. And you may recall, last year in the fourth quarter -- or excuse me, last year in the first quarter, we had about a $50 million benefit from taxes, overseas related. So that goes against this in the first quarter. So that pulls down the absolute margin pretty significantly.
Stepping forward from that and then thinking about the full year, which you mentioned, about 100 bps higher from an absolute margin point of view, we return to the incrementals that would run historically where we expect to see them.

We do have some risks. We've gone out and talked to our customers about where we are and our dealers about where we are with that, but we feel really confident in our ability to deliver even more planters into the market this year. And where we have the opportunity, if customers want to accept planters later in the season, we'll do that as well. So from that standpoint, we operate with transparency, talk to our dealers and customers and then put a good production plan together that allows us to meet market demand. That demand hasn't slowed. In fact, it's continued and much like all of our other large ag products, planters are one of those things that even post the optimum planning window, people are taking product."

But where are we at right now and how we're seeing this play out, we feel like there is continued runway of replacement recovery out here to continue to be had. 
And that's for a few reasons, one, underlying farm fundamentals continue to be very strong. Whether it's cash receipts, income, what we're seeing, land values, for example, those are positive. We see demand for replacement. The age of the fleet, you've heard us talk about this a lot. '21, we got older. And even as we look to '22, we'd expect the fleet overall in North America to age out. And then you have this dynamic that we've seen in '21 and repeating in '22, where demand is above the industry's ability to deliver further, in our mind, stretches or elongates a little bit of that recovery cycle. And as mentioned earlier, inventory levels for both new and used are quite low.
So again, when you think about comparing back, we get comparisons back to 2012 and '13 and some of the dynamics, one of the big differences is we are at significantly lower levels of inventory, which makes some of the replacement demand push out a bit further. 
And then lastly, as it relates to input costs, as input costs rise, the impact that our precision tools can have in terms of leveraging technology to drive more accuracy, more precision with inputs, whether that's seed, fertilizer chemical and make that value proposition even more attractive. 
And if you -- Cory talked a bit about this in his prepared remarks, but the take rates that we're seeing on technology took a significant step-up. Where ExactApply on sprayers, 55%, which is up quite a bit; ExactEmerge on planters, 55%. And then we're seeing that really across these technologies a pretty significant step function change in terms of the use of the technology that drives, again, back to better yields and lower cost through increased precision. 
So we'll continue to execute there, but we feel like there are legs to this recovery that we're in and really began about 1 year ago right now. 
So thanks, Ross."

Just looking to maybe get a little more color on the commentary on raw material headwinds, the $2 billion that you called out, so kind of 2 questions to that. First, where are you in terms of the assumptions that you made relative to current spot prices for things like steel? Like what's kind of baked into this number?
And then given the higher-than-normal visibility that you have in terms of where the Early Order Programs seem to be shaping up, I'm kind of curious as to what you're doing in terms of either forward-buying materials or the various components that you know you're going to need."

And the freight is driven by essentially, all different modes. Whether it's air, ocean, truck, all those things are impactful there.
On the material side, it's things like the raw that you mentioned, steel, for example. Traditionally, we buy roughly a quarter ahead. We have seen -- from a pure spot price, you've seen steel moderate some from where it was peaking probably a bit a quarter or so ago, so we haven't adjusted significantly. We do work with supply base to ensure that we've got availability. So given the demand we have and the customer desire to get product, we will try to balance that in terms of having product and making sure we've got the availability of raws.
So I mean, from a price perspective, we haven't gotten into the detail of where we're at or where we're locking in. But definitely, we do expect to see more of that come through the first half of the year and our comps get a little bit easier in the back half. So of that $2 billion, we expect about 2/3 to come through in the first half of '22.
And maybe, lastly, similar splits in terms of the businesses. About half of that is production and precision ag; about 30% is small ag and turf; and roughly 20%, C&F. And a lot of that just varies based on the products and the makeup, overall, of their material."

So I think, as we've worked through that, I think you see now maybe some of that impact as you see R&D increasing this next year, and that's in the areas that we focused on. So we made adjustments to how we're organized and to how we're allocating the resources. We work through some things like divestitures in 2020. So I think that's the continued model."

But given this dynamic of demand above the industry's ability to produce due to supply, probably not as much impact as one might expect or hope in '22. So we'll continue to watch that. We think those -- that type of program is very, very positive for the industry. It tends to have a long run of impact but probably start to see more of that in '23. 
When we step back and look at that, there's a significant amount of funding that is roads, bridges, waterways, broadband, all of which, really, are very attractive and applicable to our earthmoving and road-building businesses. So that's -- I think that's particularly positive. 
If you look at our industry outlooks, we're -- and again, this is muted somewhat by just the supply constraints but up 5% to 10% North America for both construction and compact construction. Globally, we'd say road building is probably in that same vein, up 5% to 10%. 
So we'll keep our eyes out there. Dealers are obviously working very closely with customers. I think we'll watch the independent rental companies. We've seen some of their CapEx start to move upward in '21 and into '22, and that's probably a good leading indicator of some of the work on infrastructure coming."
