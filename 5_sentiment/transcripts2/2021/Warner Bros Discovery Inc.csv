And we thank you all for joining us here today. This is a dynamic time for Discovery. The past year has been one of change, challenge and opportunity, during which we've shown incredible resilience, creativity and focus as one global team. From navigating the pandemic to generating meaningful momentum towards our strategic pivot, Discovery has responded with drive and determination.
This is also a unique time for us. Because as we are working hard to solidify our core linear business, in which we continue to meaningfully outperform, we are repositioning the company against the massive new opportunity in streaming, where we already see very positive signals and signs that taken together with the durability of our core business will nicely position the company for sustainable long-term growth.
Sustainable long-term growth. That is our mission, and we are laser-focused on delivery. We finished 2020 with strong operating momentum and great command and control across our global businesses, delivering top line improvements across virtually every key operating metric since the pandemic hit while maintaining strong discipline over our expenses without sacrificing quality or missing a beat in our creative execution. We were even able to return nearly $1 billion of capital to shareholders and equity buybacks.
We learned a lot as we manage through 2020. And our tenacity and agility, which is truly at the heart of Discovery took center stage. The impact of our content, either as measured in terms of global share growth or simply in the way people sought us out for comfort and nourishment during a difficult time, became more relevant and more of the moment like never before. We encouraged our talent to bring us into their kitchens, gardens, living rooms, with iPhones and GoPros, and it was a game changer.
When most of our peers showed older repeats, we became closer to real and more authentic on air, and that provided a great boost of adrenaline across the company and our talent partners and refined our IP all around the globe.
And I'm even more excited about 2021 and the meaningful progress we are making in our strategic pivot while at the same time working hard to support our core linear networks business and reinforcing its importance as a critical part of our total consumer offering.
discovery+ is off to a fantastic start, and we couldn't be more encouraged by all the early metrics. After 7 weeks since launching here in the U.S., we have over 11 million paying direct-to-consumer subscribers across our entire portfolio, and we will hit 12 million by the end of this month of February, an increase of 7 million net adds as compared to 5 million subs we reported in December. The vast majority of this increase is attributable to discovery+. And substantially more than half of the 7 million adds are paying discovery+ subscribers in the United States.
And we are really just getting started internationally. As this comes without adding any new markets other than our previous dplay markets that we rebranded to discovery+. For example, we relaunched Italy just a few weeks ago and the U.K. in Q4 2020, both of which are off to a strong start. Given our ownership and control of all of our content, our increasingly relevant content, expect us to light up markets globally over the next 18 months or so. And in many key markets, we intend to partner with key distributors, such as we did with Vodafone and Sky. These discussions are active and going very well, and our existing momentum is helping facilitate these conversations as distributors remain keen to provide incremental value to their subscribers as a means of leveraging their pipe and decommoditizing their offering. In both regards, we are a fantastic partner. We bring strong global and local IP at really superior value. We are, by far, the best value to consumers and distributors in a global SVOD service in the marketplace, helped by our financial model and the fact that we own all of our global IP.
The rollout of the discovery+ platform has been nearly flawless without any technological disruptions or outages. The discovery+ product launched with all major platforms and devices. Roku, Fire, Android, Apple, Samsung, and there's more to come. And we came to market with an ambitious slate of over 1,000 original hours over the coming year. Stay tuned for further delivery partnerships, such as partnerships with cable operators and other connected TV platforms, all of which move us further along as our goal to be among the most widely available platforms to consumers everywhere on the globe with easy access to consumers in every language.
Importantly, consumers love the discovery+ product, and it shows with all key operating metrics pointing in the right direction. We're seeing very high consumer engagement and high video starts. An incredible 93% of our entire 55,000-episode library has been watched, indicating a very healthy long tail of content that has immense value to consumers now that we've made it available. We're also seeing high retention over the first 60 days as well as strong monetization that is already translating into incremental value. Gunnar will provide some additional details and financial context. But in short, stronger operating performance across the board is contributing to a better-than-expected financial profile and accelerating next-gen revenue growth in Q1 and thereafter.
Very healthy role to pay and initial signs of lower churn than we initially modeled will drive accelerating sequential domestic affiliate fee growth, even over Q4's impressive 5% growth rate, as we begin to layer discovery+ on top of our core base, resulting in at least high single, if not double-digit, affiliate growth in the following quarter.
We now have over 100 advertisers and brands on the platform in the U.S., and we expect to double that by the end of Q2. Our team is working hard at implementing our feature-rich product road map. We are now offering contextual keyword targeting, and interactive ads will roll out by the end of Q1 with pause and binge ads scheduled for Q2. And as the subscriber base further scales, the benefits of combining the intelligence and data-mining capabilities on our end, together with advertiser first-party data, will represent a significant opportunity for us and our advertising partners.
We are already an industry leader when it comes to time spent with our linear portfolio. Yet watch time on discovery+ in the U.S. is nearly twice that. This naturally has been extremely well received by our advertising and brand partners, which, coupled with initial signs that discovery+ extends effective reach to non-pay-TV viewers gives us even more conviction and confidence in the long-term ARPU trajectory. In fact, our ad-light ARPU in the U.S. is already above linear, and we are just getting started. As we scale and usage continues, we are confident our ARPU will grow meaningfully.
Internationally, JB and our product and engineering teams are hard at work transitioning our former dplay and Eurosport player platforms to our new discovery+ global product in time for the Tokyo Olympics and the Beijing Games not long thereafter. discovery+ will be the streaming home of the games in Europe with access to every minute, every medal and every hero, live and on demand.
Having this product integration completed will enable us to then execute more of our ambitious international expansion plan in the back half of the year, as I previously noted. Taken together, discovery+ has successfully launched as a truly differentiated product with a fantastic consumer experience, best-in-class product reviews and terrific word of mouth, which is ultimately the most effective form of marketing.
We are being educated every day on what's working and what's not and are responding rapidly to iterate and experiment. We are utilizing all of our levers to effectively and efficiently acquire and retain subscribers, including a growing list of global partnerships with many of the world's leading distributors, an exciting pipeline of originals that we believe will surprise and delight consumers and a brand campaign that is unrivaled in our history.
The team is doing a lot right, and we are seeing the payoff in subscriber additions and engagement, for which we believe there is no better use of our capital and resources than to continue to support these efforts as a means to drive shareholder value. With the very healthy metrics we've seen thus far, scaling our discovery+ subscriber base as quickly as possible is the best use of our free cash flow as we eye sustainable long-term financial growth for the overall Discovery company.
Our first and foremost priority has always been and will always be to reinvest in our business to drive organic growth. Our powerful launch serves as a strong confirmation of what we have been hard at work building over the last many years and that which the acquisition of scripts helped to accelerate. We have spent years amassing and cultivating the most popular real-life entertainment content, brands and personalities, all with a focus on nurturing and delighting our fans across multiple video ecosystems: pay, free and streaming. It's having a real impact and an impact we expect will continue to grow.
Investing in high-quality premium programming across the entirety of our platforms has always been our north star. In fact, at a time when many of our peers are taking their foot off the gas, we expect to increase our spend on fresh content to support our linear networks this year. This further reinforces our strong value proposition to our distribution partners. Indeed, we believe the basic pay-TV bundle is integral and relevant. It offers an incredible value proposition to an important and large segment of consumers.
Discovery is a true global IP company in every sense of the word, one of the very few true global IT companies. And growing our goals of great stories and series has laid the groundwork for the critical next steps we are taking. Evolving from a pay-TV and free-to-air company into a scaling global streaming player.
Discovery's mission is to play hard in traditional free-to-air and cable with fantastic margins and free cash flow and play harder in direct-to-consumer while we are uniquely positioned to achieve long-term sustainable growth.
With that, let me now turn it over to Gunnar."

Echoing David's comments, 2020 was indeed a year that presented its fair share of challenges. Likewise, it stress tested our company in unprecedented ways. Looking back, I'm extraordinarily proud of both how our team reacted to such disruption as well as how we proactively lean forward into our strategic pivot. I do believe we accomplished a tremendous amount in 2020, operationally, financially, managerially and strategically, and it set us up for a great start to 2021 and beyond, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
But first, to briefly recap Q4, a very solid set of results across the board. Starting with U.S. networks. Advertising revenues were consistent with the prior year, supported by an ad market that continued to show signs of recovery as well as the general tightening of the marketplace due to political spend. Following a generally advantageous upfront market, we saw extremely healthy scatter CPMs up in the high 20% range versus upfront and up high single digits year-over-year. And that trend has continued into the first quarter with scatter CPMs up around 40% versus upfront and up mid-teens year-over-year. While on balance demand has returned in most categories to year ago levels, a number of verticals such as travel, movie studios and restaurant chains still remain challenged. U.S. distribution revenues increased a very solid 5% year-over-year during the fourth quarter as pricing more than offset subscriber declines, supporting a nice acceleration from Q3. We benefited from a combination of a slower pace of subscriber declines, the impact from recent renewals and our continued strength across virtual MVPDs. Subscribers to our core fully distributed networks declined by 3% while our total portfolio subscribers declined by 5%. 
Now turning to the international networks for the fourth quarter, which I will discuss on a constant currency basis. Advertising revenues decreased 1% year-over-year, led primarily by continuing sequential improvements across many of our key markets. And some like the U.K., Germany, Poland and certain APAC countries finished the fourth quarter with positive growth, while other markets, such as across Latin America, are still exhibiting COVID-related weakness. Distribution revenues decreased 4% year-over-year. We continue to see modest subscriber turn from more economically challenged countries in Latin America. Furthermore, COVID-related disruption in the sports schedule throughout 2020 continued to impact our Eurosport performance in the fourth quarter as well as continued headwinds in overall pricing, primarily in EMEA. 
Total operating expenses were up 5% during the quarter. Cost of revenues were up 6%, largely due to the condensing of the sports schedule into the back half of the year and continued ramp and content investments to support our next-generation initiatives. SG&A increased 3% as we invested in marketing and branding promotion ahead of the launch of discovery+ as well as personnel and technology spending to support our initiatives. And as we guided, we finished 2020 with total operating expenses flat year-over-year ex FX as we reallocated spend, and we continue to target a low to mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our core linear businesses as we support our next-gen endeavors.
Turning to free cash flow. We finished 2020 with over $2.3 billion in free cash flow, a 56% AOIBDA to free cash flow conversion rate, a great finish considering the volatility and headwinds we faced this past year and still do, to an extent, from disruptions related to COVID while at the same time having absorbed a meaningful step-up in D2C investments. And as we guided to at our December Investor Day, we continue to expect to convert at least 50% of our AOIBDA to free cash flow this year. 
Now turning to discovery+, which is off to a very impressive start. And though it's early in our launch and global rollout, we are very pleased with all of the early metrics. First, we have now surpassed 11 million total global paying direct-to-consumer subscribers after less than 60 days since the launch in the U.S., the majority of which are attributed to discovery+ and more than half of the subscriber additions were in the U.S. And as David mentioned, we will hit 12 million global paying subscribers by the end of the month. Second, importantly, both role to pay and churn have been better than planned. And while early, these represent critical variables in our modeling. Third, engagement, as measured by average watch time per active viewer, has been robust and already significantly ahead of linear. Fourth, this engagement, along with advertisers and brands eager to embrace our subscriber base, is driving higher CPMs. It is worth pointing out the value our advertisers see and the portion of our subscriber base that are not currently pay-TV subscribers, delivering much needed incremental reach to the video advertising ecosystem. This as well has contributed to very healthy ad monetization that is already well ahead of plan. Number five, this has led to ARPU for our Ad-Lite product that has already surpassed average linear ARPU. And we see further upside as we drive scale and subscribers, a key tenet we laid out for you in early December. Number six, early signs of churn are within our expectations, if not better, which, taken together with the monetization framework I provided, are contributing to a higher implied customer lifetime value than our initial modeling. Number seven, finally, subscriber acquisition costs have so far come in very favorably, especially compared with the evolving customer lifetime value. Consequently, taking these early data points together, we see both a very strong start to next-gen revenue growth in 2021, with Q1 poised to grow around 50% with meaningful acceleration in the quarters thereafter and a much more attractive investment opportunity around subscriber growth.
Given discovery+ net adds, the majority of which are in the U.S., we should also enjoy a more direct tailwind to our domestic distribution growth profile this quarter. As such, we expect Q1 domestic distribution revenue to increase at least high single digits, if not low double digits year-over-year, a meaningful acceleration from the last quarter. I must say I like the sound of that. Candidly, it's been a while since we have had a growth profile like that for domestic distribution.
While the advertisers' embrace for discovery+ has been great and will help to support our overall advertising profile as we scale, we expect a modest sequential headwind to Q1 U.S. advertising revenues, in part related to macro factors as well as the launch of discovery+, where we are leaning in with more of our inventory to promote the service.
We have embarked on an aggressive branding and performance marketing campaign, and we are seeing efficient SAC. As I noted earlier, with SAC so favorable to CLV, we expect to lean into this opportunity in a greater way. And we now expect to see greater incremental next-generation losses than the $200 million to $300 million initially described. This could potentially be a couple of hundred million more, but it's too early to pinpoint to find a range. I am very confident to categorize this as success-based spending. We do, however, still see 2021 as representing the peak year for losses from our investment initiatives, which brings us to capital allocation, where our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. And for the near term, the most productive use of our free cash flow will be to drive discovery+ subscribers. Thus, you should not expect us to be in the market buying back our equity in the near term. Though as we gain additional clarity around requisite spend to support our rollout, we will, of course, revisit the buyback.
We finished 2020 at approximately 3.3x net leverage. Through 2021, due to timing factors around spend and the Olympic Games, our leverage may at times trend above our target range, though we and the rating agencies are comfortable with this outlook, particularly as we remain committed to our investment-grade rating.
Now turning to a couple of housekeeping items to help you with forecasting 2021. We expect our effective book tax rate to remain in the low 20% range while our cash tax rate, excluding PPA, will be in the mid-20% range. And finally, we are budgeting FX to have a positive $170 million year-over-year impact on revenues and a neutral year-over-year impact on AOIBDA.
In closing, we are incredibly excited by the initial success of discovery+ and remain as enthusiastic as ever as we position the company for long-term sustained growth. Clearly, lots more to accomplish given only a few months in, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.
Thank you again for joining us. With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. And David, JB and I will be happy to take your questions."

As I mentioned, we're really just getting started. We've built a robust platform, but in order to roll it out globally, it needs to be modified, needs to be modified to be embedded with Vodafone, to be embedded with Telecom Italia, each of the different distributors. We're working on getting it embedded with a number of the cable players domestically and around the world. We have rebranded dplay discovery+. As you know, our strategy outside the U.S., which we think is really unique, is local entertainment, local nonfiction, local sport in Europe and local entertainment, local nonfiction around the world. And that library from the last 25 to 30 years of local content really differentiates us from Netflix and Disney. It makes us a great companion if you're putting together a bundle.
So we are seeing some real growth in the few markets that we've launched in. We're using the Olympics as a forcing mechanism where we're looking to rebuild the platform so that coming out of the -- we're ready with the Olympics all across Europe. And then coming out of that, we'll be able to roll out. But for instance, Vodafone will not be for a little while. But JB, why don't you give some more specifics?"

So Robert, as David mentioned, we obviously undergoing a significant amount of work to replatform. Basically, what that means is our front-end product that was the former dplay product in Europe was built on a different front-end platform than our U.S. product. And so as we do 2 things, one is migrate the U.S. product to be our global product, we have some important kind of infrastructure work to get done here in advance of the Olympics. And number two, as we talked about in back in December, we will be collapsing our Eurosport player product into discovery+. And so we need to also do some work to incorporate that product into discovery+. Both of those things are our primary focus and taking up a fair amount of our engineering and product bandwidth over the course of the next 4, 5 months pre Olympics. So that's going to be the primary focus in getting that right in the first half of this year. As we come out of the Olympics and go into the second half of the year, that's when you're going to see the acceleration of the international rollouts. And so that's the time frame I think about. The -- and using Vodafone specifically, since you mentioned it, really, that will be a back half of and even bleeding several markets into '22 as well as we launch with them.
And then the third thing in terms of ARPU, the only thing I'd say there is what we do know and what we've seen so far is these retail partnerships with the Vodafone and others as well as our direct-to-consumer, the premium and the multiples over our wholesale model internationally are still easily 3 to 4x the pricing that we see in our existing wholesale model. So we see a lot of pricing advantage in the discovery+ model and the partnerships we have versus our existing business."

The good news is there's a huge amount of incremental content coming from them as well as all the content that we were putting on Magnolia. All of that will continue to be on discovery+.
We've come up with a really creative partnership because Magnolia itself is a huge business for them and a transactional business. And so we will be launching an app together where people can go and take all kinds of classes, they can do workshops, they can transact business with the Magnolia product, they can transact business with a number of things that Chip and Jo will be curating. But all the content that's developed will be on discovery+. So effectively, when it launches, whatever number of subs that we have will be subs that will have the Magnolia app available to it. So it's really a win-win. It becomes effectively part of us, and we become part of them, they become part of us. And it's 1 and 1 equals 2."

So a couple of points of what we're seeing so far. And remember, it's early days. But starting with the U.S., I think the most important point that I've looked at is our ability to monetize the advertising side for the Ad-Lite subscribers. And I'm super pleased with what we're seeing there. We had this bogey of getting 3x the CPM compared to linear, and we're on a very good track here. We're already making more on a per-sub basis altogether with these Ad-Lite subscribers compared to the linear ecosystem. So that's great. Obviously, the price points for the ad-free product, and I should say that the subscriber base is skewing a little more towards ad-free given the relative attractiveness of the price point here, I think. But -- so for the U.S. side, so far, ahead of expectations. Internationally, as JB said, the most important point is we're expecting a multiple delta between what we're achieving here on the direct-to-consumer side compared with linear. But I also want to say it's early days, and especially on the international side, driven by deal cadence, et cetera, that number could move around a little. That's why you're not going to hear us talk a lot about ARPU specifically. I would like you guys to focus on the next-generation revenue. That's why we gave the growth guidance there. And it's a very compelling story. I think we grew 18% in 2020. Fourth quarter was up 26% for next-generation revenue. We're now looking at roughly 50% for the first quarter, and I expect that number, that growth to further accelerate as we go through the year. So top to bottom, I think, very, very encouraging first results here."

And so as we -- part of the replatforming we talked about just a minute ago, it is going to enable us to offer an Ad-Lite and an Ad-Free product as we take discovery+ around the world. And I think in a number of markets, particularly in Europe with our big advertising footprint there, that we think there's going to be additional opportunity for higher ARPU growth with both products and both tiers and market at the same time."

Gunnar, one of the things that seemed pretty conservative at the Analyst Day was your target margin of 20% for streaming. Is it fair to say you're basing well beyond that, given some of the metrics you laid out? And if you threw all this into a blender, what kind of margins would you get on sort of a terminal basis for streaming? And a clarification, Gunnar, you said CPMs were up 40% over the upfront 1Q. You said up mid-teens year-over-year. Not to be sort of too in the weeds, but is that sort of booked to date? Or is that your anticipation of how the quarter is tracking, including the March period last year where it fell off?
And for David, when you think about the usage of the research you've done so far, I know it's early days, how do you feel about the idea? Is this super fans coming in and racing to try your streaming service? Is this just a mix of subscribers that you think is sustainable and normal and not overly driven by super fans? So what's your anticipation there? And then lastly, David, if you wouldn't mind, on content and investment, it seems like at least our track and you'll tell me how far off we are, it seems like shows representing about 9% of your linear viewing has seen their originals debut on streaming. Is that sort of the right mix? Are you thinking of ramping that more aggressively? Or is the originals that you have coming means that the linear is going to sort of stay with the content level that it has right now?"

We're seeing subscribers coming in from our own marketing on our own platforms. We're seeing a lot of digital. The age is really across the board. A lot of that has to do, I think, with the great work that Disney has done in acclimating people. The encouraging thing is that we see good numbers about people once they know about the product wanting to have the product. And we're -- one of the reasons that we're marketing is we think we've got a great product, and we need more people to understand what it is. For 60 days in, with a product called discovery+, we've had to do a lot of work. It's a great brand that people love, but we had to explain that it's home, food, Chip and Jo, crime, Oprah Winfrey. And there's a -- all the stuff that people like. So that was number one. The role to pay has been terrific. The amount of time people have been spending on is terrific. And so right now, it looks good. We can't tell you how big the market is. But right now, it feels like we're off and running.
In terms of the content that we're moving around, we're really experimenting. And the interesting thing is, the way our product works so far is it's very different than Disney or Netflix. We have this massive library. And when we say what's trending, if you took all the top shows that are trending and put them all together, it represents less than 10% of what people are watching. And so it's -- we have such a diversity of content. When you talk about scripted series and scripted movies, where you have 8 people playing that game, they're going there for a scripted series, and they tend -- or they're going there for a movie. For us, since we've pulled together that other 50%, they're watching Discovery stuff. They're going in and watching Prince William and an environmental documentary. And other people are going in there and watching the fact that we have the largest crime library or paranormal or food fans. So we're just experimenting. We're moving things around, but we still have a full commitment to the existing bundle. We are the bundle. I mean it's basically news, sports and us. And a lot of the other players are now in -- they're in repeat mode. And for us, we have a real equitable argument. I was talking with some of our operators over the weekend about the amount of original content that we're still doing and the amount of viewership that we're getting on the platform. And so we think we could do both, and we're experimenting moving things between the 2."

We have our traditional business with great margins where we continue to -- which we think outside the U.S., it's declining but at a much slower rate than in the U.S. But in the U.S., we're seeing some stability. We expect that it will decline, but we really like our position there. Then we have the GO AVOD, where we have a very young demo with very good economics, and people continue to go there. And the more people we can get to go there, the more people can come over that want to get our SVOD service, which has a lot more stuff. So we think it's a really like a great 1-2-3 combo. And for advertisers, it's terrific. So we're going to continue to look at the market.
And as JB said, we're evolving. We have a very low-priced product given the marketplace. It's an unbelievable value. If you look at the value of us at $4.99 and Ad-Lite versus everyone else, with the library we have and the originals, it's terrific. Outside the U.S., we can go a lot cheaper than that and still have a multiple of the ARPU that we get. But as JB said, we're learning. We've been at this for 5 years. That's how I think we took so much time to launch to figure out how do we get everything aligned. But the idea of AVOD, SVOD, Ad-Lite and some -- now we're going to add SVOD with low commercials, but we'll also, in some markets, we might want to put in a big front porch of AVOD. And we've been doing that in a couple of markets already and finding that that's a real feeder. And the fact that we have advertisers in GO, that's one of the reasons we have 100 advertisers in discovery+ right now. So who knows where all this will be in 5 years. But right now, we have great ARPU on our existing business domestically and around the world. We're getting started. We're way ahead of where we were. And we like the metrics, and we're going to -- we'll just follow the consumer need. I don't know, JB, just maybe a little on AVOD from your perspective?"

And I guess the point would be, generally, to David's point of, these are just incredibly additive customer segments. I think we look at each of these as being very additive customer segments. And the GO performance so far, even in the course of discovery+, has continued to see the same high level of engagement as we had pre-discovery+ launch as we have post-discovery+ launch. And so from an engagement perspective, all indications are, which was, again, a little bit of our thesis back in December, which we obviously didn't know 100%, but that this could be not an either/or but an and. And that so far, it is looking a lot more like an and even that we might have expected back in December. And on GO, we're still very pleased with the engagement and the level of usage that, that platform is getting. And we have some new product innovations that we're going to be rolling out over the course of the next couple of months that we think we'll continue to make that product ever more compelling.

And so we'll continue to do that. It's still a great model. And we think it's going to go on for quite some time. It's also a terrific feeder. So the people that are watching our cable channels are buying the product. People that are going to GO and seeing some of the product that they've downloaded and they like, they're buying the product. So we think it's really advantageous to us to keep that nourished. And it's good for us with our existing distributors because they appreciate that and that we're key to the bundle and we're supporting it.
Having said that, there are a number of things that we're learning. Like if we do a big crime documentary, a big crime documented, we could put it on ID, and we have put it on ID. But they -- some of those things are -- they want to watch it when they want to watch it. When we did the Prince William documentary on the environment, on Discovery, I think it would have done well. It did unbelievably well in discovery+. Everybody wanted to see it. Same thing with Attenborough. I think a lot of the stuff that we have, some of it is different, but we are starting to get some clues on the kind of things that people like to have on a platform and watch whenever they want.
We also have seen that we're getting a lot of comments that this is a service that people could watch sort of in 2 ways. One is, while they're cooking. They can -- we added a feature where you can almost like a synthetic channel, where if you love Fixer Upper and you love the Property Brothers and you love Guy Fieri, you can just put that into the app, and that's what will run all day long. And so on the one hand, you may really want to watch the Attenborough or this great crime documentary or Ina Garten is doing a great show with Melissa McCarthy, but you also may want to just put it on so you have something really fun that you love to watch while you're cooking or while you're home schooling the kids or while you're working. And a lot of the SVOD products are -- have -- are there for intention what is -- where you have a full-on focused intent to view, which we have, and we have great content, great characters, great brands, but we also have this ability to be a companion. The content is on, and it's a great companion for you when you're home or it's a great companion. We have your favorite shows. So it's a balance. And we're looking -- we think we could do both. Fantastic, differentiated content that people love and also the content and characters that they love that they can hang around with all day. Remember, food and HG and ID, together with FOX News, are the 4 longest length of view cable networks in America, with our 3 being women and FOX News being men, and there's a reason for that, behaviorally. People sometimes want to have that on during the day, and they can do that with our app. And so we think both of those provide a value equation."

One is the Olympics is going to flow through with a very significant license fee, of course, in the third quarter. Other than that, the content spend on a consolidated basis for the entire company is growing significantly. That's part of that guide that we have given, obviously, with a focus on direct-to-consumer first products. But keep in mind, as David said, we're experimenting with those windows for our content. And I think one of our great advantages has always been our ability to use that content across territories, across platforms and thereby further driving that efficiency. So that's one of the chunks that had always been part of his guidance. I think in terms of what we see additional spend right now, first and foremost, it's marketing. And again, I mean, I said it earlier, but given how our engagement and churn metrics and the monetization metrics are trending, our customer lifetime value looks much better than what we thought it was going to be in December. And at the same time, subscriber acquisition has been incredibly efficient, a little better than we planned for. So that gap between customer lifetime value and SAC is just very compelling, and that's the largest driver for us to really lean in and spend more on the marketing side, all the way through the funnel, initially, a lot of top of the funnel marketing, but we'll definitely keep firing on that performance marketing side as we go through the year here. And then in addition to that, on the technology side as well, there's a lot of fast follow features that are in the pipeline. The team is working hard. JB already spoke about replatforming. There's some work to do internationally as well. But again, all of that is going to help us accelerate the rollout here. It's going to help us accelerate the advertising growth. David already mentioned binge ads and pause ads and interactive ads, et cetera, that are coming down the pike as early as March, April, May, et cetera. So it's very exciting.
And again, from the CFO perspective, what gives me a lot of comfort is this is a success-based spend. We're going to toggle it up and down with what we see in terms of the performance of the product. And again, I could not be more excited about this being the best use of our free cash flow right now."

The only one that's been exclusive to discovery+ has been actually Fixer Upper from Chip and Joanna. I guess, 2 thoughts come to mind. One, do you think your service is uniquely less exposed or less -- need less original programming than other streaming services because people like watching your catalog content over and over? Two, do you think that Fixer Upper sort of point you in the direction of maybe Chip and Joanna shouldn't be launching a cable network and should just stay exclusive, their content should stay exclusive to discovery+? And then just the last piece of that, you mentioned pausing the share buyback to invest in discovery+. I guess, just given investor excitement over your stock and the huge move you've seen in your stock year-to-date, why not take advantage of it, actually sell stock, strengthen the balance sheet and actually invest even more in programming? Again, maybe you don't need to spend that much on programming, given what I mentioned before. So I just love your views on that whole subject."

Let me start with the content. We've never made our entire library available before. So one is there's a lot of excitement about being able to sit down and watch all MythBusters, look at all the seasons of Deadliest Catch, Ice Road Truckers, go back and watch a bunch of Lifetime movies all in one sitting. So we're making available this whole bucket of content, all the food -- go back, Guy Fieri, spend an afternoon watching Diners and Dives. So there's a lot of appeal in our full library, too, there's a huge amount of original content that is on there that's doing really well. The metrics are really not the same for us. If you take those 12 -- top 12 shows, that's less than 10% of what's viewed on the platform. So I'm not on the inside of these other SVOD platforms. But when they launch a big movie or they launch a big series, if they name 3, it might be 30% of the view or 40% of view. For us, it's less than 10%. So our product is a lot of long tail. When you -- and a lot of the original content is very helpful, I think, because it makes -- it is clear that it's differentiated. One of the reasons why a lot of people that have GO are moving over and paying for this product is there's more there and there's a ton of original content. So I think -- we think we're on to something with the mix. We're not being guided that much by seeing that they're watching this show or that show. Because when we actually look at the full numbers, the answer is that they -- we've represented 50% of what people watch on TV. And that's not available anywhere else. You go to the others for scripted series and scripted movies, and the big takeaway for us is people are willing to pay for that other 50% so far. And that could be a yellow brick road for us."

So you take a Magnolia Table or Bobby and Giada in Italy or even some of the offshoots of the 90-day franchise, and I think that's one of the things we see as a great success is ultimately being able to super serve and give people even more, but that stuff is exclusive to discovery+. And so while it could fit naturally in a second window or down the line back on a network, because it's very complementary to the existing franchises, they are exclusive to discovery+. So we do think, in order to continue to expand the base also, that will be important to have a right balance of certainly some of the library and the depth of the library is incredibly important.

I mean, consistent with what we did think in our and what we outlined is what we thought was sort of part of our secret sauce back in December, of this combination of great local IP with the strength of the global library, we are seeing that bear fruit, which is a lot of the local IP that is, whether it be in Poland, the Nordics, the U.K., Italy, is what's driving a significant amount of volume to the service and in terms of the acquisitions and then coming into the service finding and discovering all this new and great content that people have never seen.
And I think the other thing -- this is true about international, it's also true about the U.S., is the reality is the 55,000 hours is such a large volume of content in the genres and passion areas that people love, that without a digital algorithmic recommendation engine to surface that stuff to people, it's just never something that could have been perfectly exploited on linear television, when you have a 24/7 channel and you are limited by capacity. And so -- and by the way, that replatforming that we're doing internationally is partly to take advantage of these more sophisticated recommendation engine that we have on discovery+ that currently doesn't exist in discovery+ outside the U.S., but will once we finish the replatform. So that surfacing of new content, even if it's out of the library, that feels new to so many viewers, we think is also a big opportunity to satisfy the consumers."

On the ad budgets, getting back to -- before we get to discovery+, with our traditional business, what Stanlow has been and his team are very effectively done -- and he and I have been on the road with all the big agencies at least 3 times over the -- since the Scripps deal, is dealing with the fact that the broadcasters are getting -- are getting over $60 in CPM, and we were getting 1/3 of that. And -- but we're the #1 player for women or the #2 player for women. And we have the #1 network with TLC. We have the #1 show with 90 Day Fiance. And so we've been pushing that rock up hill. And you see in our numbers how we've been driving that CPM. But now we have a whole basket where we have this win-win of come in with us for $40-plus CPM. Why are you going to get a repeat on a broadcast network when you could buy original content on us? And we get a huge premium on our CPM. We believe that this should ultimately flip. And aside from sports, we should be getting a premium versus the broadcasters because we're producing -- we have length of view. We have an audience that's engaged. We have endemic with food and home where advertisers want to be. And so we think we have some real momentum there, and we're going to push on it. Because we think, from an equitable perspective and from a performance perspective, we should see much more of that money with much more CPM with better returns. And we think advertisers are starting to agree with us. And you should see that flowing through over a period of time. And with GO and discovery+, we do have a lot more opportunity. Because with discovery+ bigger than we thought, with GO continuing to perform, we have more capacity. And we're seeing that the attractiveness of that capacity in terms of the kind of premiums that we're getting in CPM on discovery+, where there's only a few ads, is really terrific. So it's -- and it's incremental reach. Real incremental reach for us, non-cable, and so -- which is quite helpful.
And on the local, leaning in, we do need original content. We have been doing it. JB's work been producing a lot of it in every language. We have the factory that converts all of our content into every language, but we are doing more original because it's helping us both on linear and direct-to-consumer. But JB, talk about how we've kind of pivoted this year to lean in even harder."

I think the other thing that's exciting for us that we've never been able to take advantage of in a material way is we have now, even in the last 90 days, examples of shows that originate out of 1 market that are top 10 or top 5, in some cases, drivers in other international markets. And so when we talk about local content, local content used to only mean monetization in one market. The reality is now we're starting to see more value and benefit being driven out of local content -- multi market. So we did an Estonia documentary on the terrible and tragic capsizing, the largest ferry disaster in the Nordics, that was originated out of our Nordics business. It's now a top performer in the U.K., a top performer in Italy. And so local content investment doesn't just mean local. It means local with value now to travel, which is something that we never had.

First, can we talk a little bit about the affiliate pace domestically and especially the strength you're talking about in the first quarter, the 5% that you saw in the fourth quarter, that seems to all be coming from the linear business. And I'd appreciate if you could talk about what drove that acceleration. I know we talked about a little bit of the improvement in subscribers. But really, it seems like you would have had to have some kind of pricing -- discrete pricing improvement there. So can you just help with that and how much that impacts that underlying pace as we go into the new year and that growth you're expecting?
And then just a couple on international digital, if I could. Of the 5 million subscribers, next-gen subscribers you discussed in the fourth quarter, how many of those were dplay subs that sort of became discovery+ subs on the conversion?

Michael, let me start with the distribution guidance. And you may have noted that I deliberately said distribution rather than affiliate because I do not want to create the perception that our traditional affiliate number is accelerating by 100% here. So you're 100% right. We were up 5% in the fourth quarter, and that was almost completely traditional business-driven. It's a combination of pricing, slightly better subscriber trends. We've lost less than in prior quarters. And also, we've done very well on the side of the virtual MVPDs. So that's the Q4 number, mostly linear. For Q1, we're talking about high single digit, potentially double-digit. Then a lot of that acceleration is obviously coming from the B2C trends, given the subscriber success that we've seen so far, that is going to start very materially contributing to that number. That's why I started talking about distribution the way we laid it out in our financial statements as well rather than just affiliate.

And we thank you all for joining us here today. 
This is a dynamic time for Discovery. The past year has been one of change, challenge and opportunity, during which we've shown incredible resilience, creativity and focus as one global team. From navigating the pandemic to generating meaningful momentum towards our strategic pivot, Discovery has responded with drive and determination. This is also a unique time for us because as we are working hard to solidify our core linear business, in which we continue to meaningfully outperform, we are repositioning the company against the massive new opportunity in streaming, where we already see very positive signals and signs that taken together with the durability of our core business, will nicely position the company for sustainable long-term growth. Sustainable long-term growth, that is our mission and we are laser-focused on delivery. 
We finished 2020 with strong operating momentum and great command and control across our global businesses, delivering top line improvements across virtually every key operating metric since the pandemic hit while maintaining strong discipline over our expenses without sacrificing quality or missing a beat in our creative execution. We were even able to return nearly $1 billion of capital to shareholders in equity buybacks. 
We learned a lot as we managed through 2020, and our tenacity and agility, which is truly at the heart of Discovery, took center stage. The impact of our content, either as measured in terms of global share growth or simply in the way people sought us out for comfort and nourishment during a difficult time, became more relevant and more of the moment like never before. We encouraged our talent to bring us into their kitchens, gardens, living rooms with iPhones and GoPros, and it was a game changer. When most of our peers showed older repeats, we became closer to real and more authentic on air, and that provided a great boost of adrenaline across the company and our talent partners and refined our IP all around the globe. And I'm even more excited about 2021 and the meaningful progress we are making in our strategic pivot while, at the same time, working hard to support our core linear networks business and reinforcing its importance as a critical part of our total consumer offering. 
discovery+ is off to a fantastic start, and we couldn't be more encouraged by all the early metrics. After 7 weeks since launching here in the U.S., we have over 11 million paying direct-to-consumer subscribers across our entire portfolio, and we will hit 12 million by the end of this month of February, an increase of 7 million net adds as compared to 5 million subs we reported in December. The vast majority of this increase is attributable to discovery+. And substantially more than half of the 7 million adds are paying discovery+ subscribers in the United States. 
And we are really just getting started internationally as this comes without adding any new markets other than our previous Dplay markets that we rebranded to discovery+. For example, we relaunched Italy just a few weeks ago and the U.K. in Q4 2020, both of which are off to a strong start. Given our ownership and control of all of our content, our increasingly relevant content, expect us to light up markets globally over the next 18 months or so. And in many key markets, we intend to partner with key distributors, such as we did with Vodafone and Sky. These discussions are active and going very well, and our existing momentum is helping facilitate these conversations as distributors remain keen to provide incremental value to their subscribers as a means of leveraging their pipe and decommoditizing their offering. 
In both regards, we are a fantastic partner. We bring strong global and local IP at really superior value. We are by far the best value to consumers and distributors in a global SVOD service in the marketplace, helped by our financial model and the fact that we own all of our global IP. 
The rollout of the discovery+ platform has been nearly flawless without any technological disruptions or outages. The discovery+ product launched with all major platforms and devices, Roku, Fire, Android, Apple, Samsung, and there's more to come. And we came to market with an ambitious slate of over 1,000 original hours over the coming year. Stay tuned for further delivery partnerships, such as partnerships with cable operators and other connected TV platforms, all of which move us further along as our goal to be among the most widely available platforms to consumers everywhere on the globe with easy access to consumers in every language. 
Importantly, consumers love the discovery+ product, and it shows with all key operating metrics pointing in the right direction. We're seeing very high consumer engagement and high video starts. An incredible 93% of our entire 55,000-episode library has been watched, indicating a very healthy long tail of content that has immense value to consumers now that we've made it available. We're also seeing high retention over the first 60 days as well as strong monetization that is already translating into incremental value. Gunnar will provide some additional details and financial context, but in short, stronger operating performance across the board is contributing to a better-than-expected financial profile and accelerating next-gen revenue growth in Q1 and thereafter. 
Very healthy roll to pay and initial signs of lower churn than we initially modeled will drive accelerating sequential domestic affiliate fee growth even over Q4's impressive 5% growth rate as we begin to layer discovery+ on top of our core base, resulting in at least high-single, if not double-digit, affiliate growth in the following quarter. We now have over 100 advertisers and brands on the platform in the U.S., and we expect to double that by the end of Q2. Our team is working hard at implementing our feature-rich product road map. We are now offering contextual keyword targeting, and interactive ads will roll out by the end of Q1 with pause and binge ads scheduled for Q2. And as the subscriber base further scales, the benefits of combining the intelligence and data-mining capabilities on our end, together with advertiser first-party data, will represent a significant opportunity for us and our advertising partners.  
We are already an industry leader when it comes to time spent with our linear portfolio, yet watch time on discovery+ in the U.S. is nearly twice that. This naturally has been extremely well received by our advertising and brand partners, which, coupled with initial signs that discovery+ extends effective reach to non-pay-TV viewers, gives us even more conviction and confidence in the long-term ARPU trajectory. In fact, our AdLite ARPU in the U.S. is already above linear, and we are just getting started. As we scale and usage continues, we are confident our ARPU will grow meaningfully. 
Internationally, JB and our product and engineering teams are hard at work transitioning our former Dplay and Eurosport Player platforms to our new discovery+ global product in time for the Tokyo Olympics and the Beijing Games not long thereafter. discovery+ will be the streaming home of the games in Europe with access to every minute, every medal and every hero, live and on demand. Having this product integration completed will enable us to then execute more of our ambitious international expansion plan in the back half of the year, as I previously noted. 
Taken together, discovery+ has successfully launched as a truly differentiated product with a fantastic consumer experience, best-in-class product reviews and terrific word of mouth, which is ultimately the most effective form of marketing. We are being educated every day on what's working and what's not and are responding rapidly to iterate and experiment. We are utilizing all of our levers to effectively and efficiently acquire and retain subscribers, including a growing list of global partnerships with many of the world's leading distributors, an exciting pipeline of originals that we believe will surprise and delight consumers and a brand campaign that is unrivaled in our history. 
The team is doing a lot right, and we are seeing the payoff in subscriber additions and engagement, for which we believe there is no better use of our capital and resources than to continue to support these efforts as a means to drive shareholder value. With the very healthy metrics we've seen thus far, scaling our discovery+ subscriber base as quickly as possible is the best use of our free cash flow as we eye sustainable long-term financial growth for the overall Discovery company. 
Our first and foremost priority has always been and will always be to reinvest in our business to drive organic growth. Our powerful launch serves as a strong confirmation of what we have been hard at work building over the last many years and that which the acquisition of Scripps helped to accelerate. We have spent years amassing and cultivating the most popular real-life entertainment content, brands and personalities, all with a focus on nurturing and delighting our fans across multiple video ecosystems: pay, free and streaming. It's having a real impact and an impact we expect will continue to grow. 
Investing in high-quality premium programming across the entirety of our platforms has always been our North Star. In fact, at a time when many of our peers are taking their foot off the gas, we expect to increase our spend on fresh content to support our linear networks this year. This further reinforces our strong value proposition to our distribution partners. Indeed, we believe the basic pay-TV bundle is integral and relevant and offers an incredible value proposition to an important and large segment of consumers. 
Discovery is a true global IP company in every sense of the word, one of the very few true global IP companies. And growing our vault of great stories and series has laid the groundwork for the critical next steps we are taking, evolving from a pay-TV and free-to-air company into a scaling global streaming player. Discovery's mission is to play hard in traditional free to air and cable with fantastic margins and free cash flow and play harder in direct to consumer while we are uniquely positioned to achieve long-term sustainable growth. 
With that, let me now turn it over to Gunnar."

Echoing David's comments, 2020 was indeed a year that presented its fair share of challenges. Likewise, it stress tested our company in unprecedented ways. 
Looking back, I'm extraordinarily proud of both how our team reacted to such disruption as well as how we proactively leaned forward into our strategic pivot. I do believe we accomplished a tremendous amount in 2020 operationally, financially, managerially and strategically, and it set us up for a great start to 2021 and beyond, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. 
But first, to briefly recap Q4, a very solid set of results across the board. Starting with U.S. Networks. Advertising revenues were consistent with the prior year, supported by an ad market that continued to show signs of recovery as well as the general tightening of the marketplace due to political spend. Following a generally advantageous upfront market, we saw extremely healthy scatter CPMs, up in the high 20% range versus upfront and up high single digits year-over-year, and that trend has continued into the first quarter with scatter CPMs up around 40% versus upfront and up mid-teens year-over-year. While on balance, demand has returned in most categories to year-ago levels, a number of verticals such as travel, movie studios and restaurant chains still remain challenged. 
U.S. distribution revenues increased a very solid 5% year-over-year during the fourth quarter as pricing more than offset subscriber declines, supporting a nice acceleration from Q3. We benefited from a combination of a slower pace of subscriber declines, the impact from recent renewals and our continued strength across virtual MVPDs. Subscribers to our core fully distributed networks declined by 3% while our total portfolio subscribers declined by 5%.  
Now turning to the International Networks for the fourth quarter, which I will discuss on a constant-currency basis. Advertising revenues decreased 1% year-over-year, led primarily by continuing sequential improvements across many of our key markets. And some like the U.K., Germany, Poland and certain APAC countries finished the fourth quarter with positive growth while other markets such as across Latin America are still exhibiting COVID-related weakness. 
Distribution revenues decreased 4% year-over-year.  We continue to see modest subscriber churn from more economically challenged countries in Latin America. Furthermore, COVID-related disruption in the sports schedule throughout 2020 continued to impact our Eurosport performance in the fourth quarter as well as continued headwinds in overall pricing, primarily in EMEA.  
Total operating expenses were up 5% during the quarter. Cost of revenues were up 6% largely due to the condensing of the sports schedule into the back half of the year and continued ramp in content investments to support our next-generation initiatives. SG&A increased 3% as we invested in marketing and branding promotion ahead of the launch of discovery+ as well as personnel and technology spending to support our initiatives. And as we guided, we finished 2020 with total operating expenses flat year-over-year ex FX as we reallocated spend and we continue to target a low to mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our core linear business as we support our next-gen endeavors. 
Turning to free cash flow. We finished 2020 with over $2.3 billion in free cash flow, a 56% AOIBDA to free cash flow conversion rate, a great finish considering the volatility and headwinds we faced this past year and still do, to an extent, from disruptions related to COVID while, at the same time, having absorbed a meaningful step-up in D2C investments. And as we guided to at our December Investor Day, we continue to expect to convert at least 50% of our AOIBDA to free cash flow this year.  
Now turning to discovery+, which is off to a very impressive start. And though it's early in our launch and global rollout, we are very pleased with all of the early metrics. First, we have now surpassed 11 million total global paying direct-to-consumer subscribers after less than 60 days since the launch in the U.S., the majority of which are attributed to discovery+ and more than half of the subscriber additions were in the U.S. And as David mentioned, we will hit 12 million global paying subscribers by the end of the month. 
Second, importantly, both roll to pay and churn have been better than planned, and while early, these represent critical variables in our modeling. Third, engagement as measured by average watch time per active viewer has been robust and already significantly ahead of linear. 
Fourth, this engagement, along with advertisers and brands eager to embrace our subscriber base, is driving higher CPMs. It is worth pointing out the value our advertisers see and the portion of our subscriber base that are not currently pay-TV subscribers, delivering much needed incremental reach to the video advertising ecosystem. This as well has contributed to very healthy ad monetization that is already well ahead of plan. 
Number five, this has led to ARPU for our AdLite product that has already surpassed average linear ARPU, and we see further upside as we drive scale and subscribers, a key tenet we laid out for you in early December. Number six, early signs of churn are within our expectations, if not better, which, taken together with the monetization framework I provided, are contributing to a higher implied customer lifetime value than our initial modeling. 
Number seven, finally, subscriber acquisition costs have so far come in very favorably, especially compared with the evolving customer lifetime value. Consequently, taking these early data points together, we see both a very strong start to next-gen revenue growth in 2021, with Q1 poised to grow around 50% with meaningful acceleration in the quarters thereafter and a much more attractive investment opportunity around subscriber growth. 
Given discovery+ net adds, the majority of which are in the U.S., we should also enjoy a more direct tailwind to our domestic distribution growth profile this quarter. As such, we expect Q1 domestic distribution revenue to increase at least high single digits, if not low double digits year-over-year, a meaningful acceleration from the last quarter. I must say I like the sound of that. Candidly, it's been a while since we have had a growth profile like that for domestic distribution. 
While the advertisers' embrace for discovery+ has been great and will help to support our overall advertising profile as we scale, we expect a modest sequential headwind to Q1 U.S. advertising revenues, in part related to macro factors as well as the launch of discovery+, where we are leaning in with more of our inventory to promote the service. We have embarked on an aggressive branding and performance marketing campaign, and we are seeing efficient SAC. As I noted earlier, with SAC so favorable to CLV, we expect to lean into this opportunity in a greater way, and we now expect to see greater incremental next-generation losses than the $200 million to $300 million initially described. This could potentially be a couple of hundred million more, but it's too early to pinpoint a finer range. I am very confident to categorize this as success-based spending. 
We do, however, still see 2021 as representing the peak year for losses from our investment initiatives, which brings us to capital allocation, where our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. And for the near term, the most productive use of our free cash flow will be to drive discovery+ subscribers. Thus, you should not expect us to be in the market buying back our equity in the near term. Though as we gain additional clarity around requisite spend to support our rollout, we will, of course, revisit the buyback. 
We finished 2020 at approximately 3.3x net leverage. Through 2021, due to timing factors around spend and the Olympic Games, our leverage may at times trend above our target range, though we and the rating agencies are comfortable with this outlook, particularly as we remain committed to our investment-grade rating. 
Now turning to a couple of housekeeping items to help you with forecasting 2021. We expect our effective book tax rate to remain in the low 20% range while our cash tax rate excluding PPA will be in the mid-20% range. And finally, we are budgeting FX to have a positive $170 million year-over-year impact on revenues and a neutral year-over-year impact on AOIBDA. 
In closing, we are incredibly excited by the initial success of discovery+ and remain as enthusiastic as ever as we position the company for long-term sustained growth. Clearly, lots more to accomplish given only a few months in, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. 
Thank you again for joining us. With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. And David, JB and I will be happy to take your questions."

As I mentioned, we're really just getting started. We've built a robust platform, but in order to roll it out globally, it needs to be modified, needs to be modified to be embedded with Vodafone, to be embedded with Telecom Italia, each of the different distributors. We're working on getting it embedded with a number of the cable players domestically and around the world. 
We have rebranded Dplay to discovery+. As you know, our strategy outside the U.S., which we think is really unique, is local entertainment, local nonfiction, local sport in Europe; and local entertainment, local nonfiction around the world. And that library from the last 25 to 30 years of local content really differentiates us from Netflix and Disney. It makes us a great companion if you're putting together a bundle. 
So we are seeing some real growth in the few markets that we've launched in. We're using the Olympics as a forcing mechanism where we're looking to rebuild the platform so that coming out of the -- we're ready with the Olympics all across Europe. And then coming out of that, we'll be able to roll out. But for instance, Vodafone will not be for a little while. 
But JB, why don't you give some more specifics?"

So Robert, as David mentioned, we are obviously undergoing a significant amount of work to replatform. Basically, what that means is our front-end product that was the former Dplay product in Europe was built on a different front-end platform than our U.S. product. And so we do 2 things. One is migrate the U.S. product to be our global product. We have some important kind of infrastructure work to get done here in advance of the Olympics. 
And number two, as we talked about back in December, we will be collapsing our Eurosport Player product into discovery+. And so we need to also do some work to incorporate that product into discovery+. Both of those things are our primary focus and taking up a fair amount of our engineering and product bandwidth over the course of the next 4, 5 months pre Olympics. So that's going to be the primary focus, getting that right in the first half of this year. 
As we come out of the Olympics and go into the second half of the year, that's when you're going to see the acceleration of the international rollouts. And so that's the time frame I think about. The -- and using Vodafone specifically, since you mentioned it, really, that will be a back half of '21 and even bleeding several markets into '22 as well as we launch with them. 
And then the third thing in terms of ARPU, the only thing I'd say there is what we do know and what we've seen so far is these retail partnerships with Vodafone and others as well as our direct to consumer, the premium and the multiples over our wholesale model internationally are still easily 3 to 4x the pricing that we see in our existing wholesale model. So we see a lot of pricing advantage in the discovery+ model and the partnerships we have versus our existing business."

And for the audience around the world and particularly here in the U.S., the delight with the fact that Fixer Upper is back, Magnolia Table with Jo, really strong, all exclusive to discovery+. As well as the slate that we've been developing and they as chief creative officers have been creating is on discovery+. The good news is there's a huge amount of incremental content coming from them as well as all the content that we were putting on Magnolia. All of that will continue to be on discovery+. 
We've come up with a really creative partnership because Magnolia itself is a huge business for them and a transactional business. And so we will be launching an app together where people can go and take all kinds of classes, they can do workshops, they can transact business with the Magnolia product, they can transact business with a number of things that Chip and Jo will be curating. But all the content that's developed will be on discovery+.  
So effectively, when it launches, whatever number of subs that we have will be subs that will have the Magnolia app available to it. So it's really a win-win. It becomes effectively part of us, and they -- we become part of them, they become part of us, and it's 1 and 1 equals 2."

So a couple of points on what we're seeing so far, and remember, it's early days. 
But starting with the U.S. I think the most important point that I've looked at is our ability to monetize the advertising side for the AdLite subscribers, and I'm super pleased with what we're seeing there. We had this bogey of getting 3x the CPM compared to linear, and we're on a very good track here. We're already making more on a per-sub basis altogether with these AdLite subscribers compared to the linear ecosystem. So that's great. 
Obviously, the price points for the ad-free product -- and I should say that the subscriber base is skewing a little more towards ad-free given the relative attractiveness of the price point here, I think. But -- so for the U.S. side, so far, ahead of expectations. 
Internationally, as JB said, the most important point is we're expecting a multiple delta between what we're achieving here on the direct-to-consumer side compared with linear. But I also want to say it's early days, and especially on the international side, driven by deal cadence, et cetera, that number could move around a little. That's why you're not going to hear us talk a lot about ARPU specifically. 
I would like you guys to focus on the next-generation revenue. That's why we gave the growth guidance there. And it's a very compelling story. I think we grew 18% in 2020. Fourth quarter was up 26% for next-generation revenue. We're now looking at roughly 50% for the first quarter, and I expect that number -- that growth to further accelerate as we go through the year. So top to bottom, I think very, very encouraging first results here."

Gunnar, one of the things that seemed pretty conservative at the Analyst Day was your target margin of 20% for streaming. Is it fair to say you're pacing well beyond that, given some of the metrics you laid out? And if you threw all this into a blender, what kind of margins would you get on sort of a terminal basis for streaming? 
And a clarification, Gunnar. You said CPMs were up 40% over the upfront 1Q. You said up mid-teens year-over-year. Not to be sort of too in the weeds, but is that sort of books to date or is that your anticipation of how the quarter is tracking, including the March period last year where it fell off?
And for David, when you think about the usage of the research you've done so far, I know it's early days, how do you feel about the idea? Is this super fans coming in and racing to try your streaming service? Is this just a mix of subscribers that you think is sustainable and normal and not overly driven by super fans? Sort of what's your anticipation there? 
And then lastly, David, if you wouldn't mind, on content and investment. It seems like -- at least our track and you'll tell me how far off we are, it seems like shows representing about 9% of your linear viewing has seen their originals debut on streaming. Is that sort of the right mix? Are you thinking of ramping that more aggressively? Or is the originals that you have coming means that the linear is going to sort of stay with the content level that it has right now?"

We're seeing subscribers coming in from our own marketing on our own platforms. We're seeing a lot of digital. The age is really across the board. A lot of that has to do, I think, with the great work that Disney has done in acclimating people. 
The encouraging thing is that we see good numbers about people once they know about the product, wanting to have the product. And we're -- one of the reasons that we're marketing is we think we've got a great product and we need more people to understand what it is. For 60 days in, with a product called discovery+, we've had to do a lot of work. It's a great brand that people love, but we had to explain that it's home, food, Chip and Jo, crime, Oprah Winfrey. And there's all of this -- all the stuff that people like. So that was number one. 
The roll to pay has been terrific. The amount of time people have been spending on is terrific. And so right now, it looks good. We can't tell you how big the market is, but right now, it feels like we're off and running.
In terms of the content that we're moving around, we're really experimenting. And the interesting thing is the way our product works so far is it's very different than Disney or Netflix. We have this massive library, and when we say what's trending, if you took all the top shows that are trending and put them all together, it represents less than 10% of what people are watching. And so it's -- we have such a diversity of content. 
When you talk about scripted series and scripted movies, where you have 8 people playing that game, they're going there for a scripted series and they tend -- or they're going there for a movie. For us, since we've pulled together that other 50%, they're watching Discovery stuff. They're going in and watching Prince William in an environmental documentary. And other people are going in there and watching the fact that we have the largest crime library or paranormal or food fans. So we're just experimenting. 
We're moving some -- we're moving things around, but we still have a full commitment to the existing bundle. We are the bundle. I mean it's basically news, sports and us. And a lot of the other players are now in -- they're in repeat mode. And for us, we have a real equitable argument. I was talking with some of our operators over the weekend about the amount of original content that we're still doing and the amount of viewership that we're getting on the platform. And so we think we could do both, and we're experimenting moving things between the 2."

And it's really -- we have a holistic view here. We have our traditional business with great margins where we continue to -- which we think, outside the U.S., it's declining but at a much slower rate than in the U.S. But in the U.S., we're seeing some stability. We expect that it will decline, but we really like our position there. 
Then we have the GO AVOD, where we have a very young demo with very good economics, and people continue to go there. And the more people we can get to go there, the more people can come over that want to get our SVOD service, which has a lot more stuff. So we think it's really like a great 1-2-3 combo. And for advertisers, it's terrific. So we're going to continue to look at the market.
And as JB said, we're evolving. We have a very low-priced product given the marketplace. It's an unbelievable value. If you look at the value of us at $4.99 in AdLite versus everyone else, with the library we have and the originals, it's terrific. Outside the U.S., we can go a lot cheaper than that and still have a multiple of the ARPU that we get. 
But as JB said, we're learning. We've been at this for 5 years. That's how I think we took so much time to launch, to figure out how do we get everything aligned. But the idea of AVOD, SVOD, AdLite and some -- now we're going to add SVOD with low commercials, but we'll also, in some markets, we might want to put in a big front porch of AVOD. And we've been doing that in a couple of markets already and finding that that's a real feeder. And the fact that we have advertisers in GO, that's one of the reasons we have 100 advertisers in discovery+ right now. 
So who knows where all this will be in 5 years, but right now, we have great ARPU on our existing business domestically and around the world. We're getting started. We're way ahead of where we were. And we like the metrics, and we're going to -- we'll just follow the consumer need. 
I don't know, JB, just maybe a little on AVOD from your perspective."

And I guess the point would be generally, to David's point of these are just incredibly additive customer segments. I think we look at each of these as being very additive customer segments. 
And the GO performance so far, even in the course of discovery+, has continued to see the same high level of engagement as we had pre-discovery+ launch, as we have post-discovery+ launch. And so from an engagement perspective, all indications are -- which was, again, a little bit of our thesis back in December which we obviously didn't know 100%, but that this could be not an either/or but an and. And that so far, it is looking a lot more like an and even that we might have expected back in December. 
And on GO, we're still very pleased with the engagement and the level of usage that, that platform is getting. And we have some new product innovations that we're going to be rolling out over the course of the next couple of months that we think will continue to make that product ever more compelling.

Just give us a sense of your mindset sitting here today. 
And then, Gunnar, you gave some advertising commentary for Q1. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the shape of the year. Obviously, the comps get pretty easy in Q2, Q3. And then would you be willing to give us what the next-gen revenues were in dollars last year?"

And I would say -- I wouldn't say best, I would say different. We're continuing to invest in our traditional channels around the world, and that's building our global IP library. And so we'll continue to do that. It's still a great model, and we think it's going to go on for quite some time. 
It's also a terrific feeder. So the people that are watching our cable channels are buying the product. People that are going to GO and seeing some of the product that they've downloaded and they like, they're buying the product. So we think it's really advantageous to us to keep that nourished. And it's good for us with our existing distributors because they appreciate that and that we're key to the bundle and we're supporting it.
Having said that, there are a number of things that we're learning. Like if we do a big crime documentary, a big crime documentary, we could put it on ID and we have put it on ID. But they -- some of those things are they want to watch it when they want to watch it. 
When we did the Prince William documentary on the environment, on Discovery, I think it would have done well. It did unbelievably well in discovery+. Everybody wanted to see it. Same thing with Attenborough. I think a lot of the stuff that we have, some of it is different, but we are starting to get some clues on the kind of things that people like to have on a platform and watch whenever they want.
We also have seen that we're getting a lot of comments that this is a service that people could watch sort of in 2 ways. One is while they're cooking, they can -- we added a feature where you can -- almost like a synthetic channel, where if you love Fixer Upper and you love the Property Brothers and you love Guy Fieri, you can just put that into the app, and that's what will run all day long. And so on the one hand, you may really want to watch the Attenborough or this great crime documentary or Ina Garten is doing a great show with Melissa McCarthy, but you also may want to just put it on so you have something really fun that you love to watch while you're cooking or while you're home schooling the kids or while you're working. 
And a lot of the SVOD products are -- have -- are there for intention, what is -- where you have a full-on focused intent to view, which we have, and we have great content, great characters, great brands, but we also have this ability to be a companion. The content is on and it's a great companion for you when you're home or it's a great companion -- we have your favorite shows. So it's a balance. And we're looking -- we think we could do both, fantastic, differentiated content that people love and also the content and characters that they love that they can hang around with all day. 
Remember, Food and HG and ID, together with FOX News are the 4 longest length of view cable networks in America, with our 3 being women and FOX News being men. And there's a reason for that behaviorally. People sometimes want to have that on during the day, and they can do that with our app. And so we think both of those provide a value equation."

One is the Olympics is going to flow through with a very significant license fee, of course, in the third quarter. Other than that, the content spend on a consolidated basis for the entire company is growing significantly. That's part of that guide that we have given, obviously, with a focus on direct-to-consumer first products. 
But keep in mind, as David said, we're experimenting with those windows for our content. And I think one of our great advantages has always been our ability to use that content across territories, across platforms and thereby, further driving that efficiency. But -- so that's one of the chunks that had always been part of this guidance. 
I think in terms of where we see additional spend right now, first and foremost, it's marketing. And again, I mean I said it earlier, but given how our engagement, churn metrics and the monetization metrics are trending, our customer lifetime value looks much better than what we thought it was going to be in December. And at the same time, subscriber acquisition has been incredibly efficient, a little better than we planned for. 
So that gap between customer lifetime value and SAC is just very compelling, and that's the largest driver for us to really lean in and spend more on the marketing side, all the way through the funnel. Initially, a lot of top-of-the-funnel marketing, but we'll definitely keep firing on that performance marketing side as we go through the year here. 
And then in addition to that, on the technology side as well, there's a lot of fast-follow features that are in the pipeline. The team is working hard. JB already spoke about replatforming. There's some work to do internationally as well. But again, all of that is going to help us accelerate the rollout here. It's going to help us accelerate the advertising growth. David already mentioned binge ads and pause ads and interactive ads, et cetera, that are coming down the pike as early as March, April, May, et cetera. So it's very exciting.
And again, from the CFO perspective, what gives me a lot of comfort is this is success-based spend. We're going to toggle it up and down with what we see in terms of the performance of the product. And again, I could not be more excited about this being the best use of our free cash flow right now."

The only one that's been exclusive to discovery+ has been actually Fixer Upper from Chip and Joanna. 
I guess 2 thoughts come to mind. One, do you think your service is uniquely less exposed or less -- need less original programming than other streaming services because people like watching your catalog content over and over? Two, do you think that Fixer Upper sort of point you in the direction of maybe Chip and Joanna shouldn't be launching a cable network and should just stay exclusive -- their content should stay exclusive to discovery+? 
And then just the last piece of that, you mentioned pausing the share buyback to invest in discovery+. I guess just given investor excitement over your stock and the huge move you've seen in your stock year-to-date, why not take advantage of it to actually sell stock, strengthen the balance sheet and actually invest even more in programming? Again, maybe you don't need to spend that much on programming, given what I mentioned before. So I'd just love your views on that whole subject."

So we're making available this whole bucket of content, all the food -- go back with Guy Fieri, spend an afternoon watching Diners and Dives (sic) [ Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives ]. 
So there's a lot of appeal in our full library, too. There's a huge amount of original content that is on there that's doing really well. The metrics are really not the same for us. If you take those 12 -- top 12 shows, that's less than 10% of what's viewed on the platform. So I'm not on the inside of these other SVOD platforms, but when they launch a big movie or they launch a big series, if they name 3, it might be 30% of the viewing or 40% of viewing. For us, it's less than 10%. So our product has a lot of long tail. 
When you -- and a lot of the original content is very helpful, I think, because it makes -- it is clear that it's differentiated. One of the reasons why a lot of people that have GO are moving over and paying for this product is there's more there and there's a ton of original content. So I think -- we think we're on to something with the mix. 
We're not being guided that much by seeing that they're watching this show or that show because when we actually look at the full numbers, the answer is that they -- we've represented 50% of what people watch on TV, and that's not available anywhere else. You go to the others for scripted series and scripted movies, and the big takeaway for us is people are willing to pay for that other 50% so far. And that could be a yellow brick road for us."

So you take a Magnolia Table or Bobby and Giada in Italy or even some of the offshoots of the 90 Day franchise and I think that's one of the things we see as a great success, is ultimately being able to super serve and give people even more, but that stuff is exclusive to discovery+. 
And so while it could fit naturally in a second window or down the line back on a network because it's very complementary to the existing franchises, they are exclusive to discovery+. So we do think, in order to continue to expand the base also, it will be important to have a right balance. Certainly, some of the library and the depth of the library is incredibly important, but also some of the exclusive content, even if it is based on some IP and franchises that come from the television networks."

I mean consistent with what we did think in our hypothesis and what we outlined is what we thought was sort of part of our secret sauce back in December of this combination of great local IP with the strength of the global library. We are seeing that bear fruit, which is a lot of the local IP that is -- whether it be in Poland, the Nordics, the U.K., Italy, is what's driving a significant amount of volume to the service and -- in terms of the acquisitions and then coming into the service, finding and discovering all this new and great content that people had never seen.
And I think the other thing, this is true about international, it's also true about the U.S., is -- the reality is the 55,000 hours is such a large volume of content in the genres and passion areas that people love, that without a digital algorithmic recommendation engine to surface that stuff to people, it's just never something that could have been perfectly exploited on linear television when you have a 24/7 channel and you are limited by capacity. And so -- and by the way, that replatforming that we're doing internationally is partly to take advantage of these more sophisticated recommendation engine that we have on discovery+ that currently doesn't exist in discovery+ outside the U.S. but will once we finish the replatform. So that surfacing of new content, even if it's out of the library, that feels new to so many viewers, we think is also a big opportunity to satisfy the consumers."

It just sounds like it's a very attractive overall offering you can provide as Discovery, the company, to advertisers. I'm curious if it's an incremental positive there.
And then the second question is just really on local international production. Are you seeing that getting a bit harder or get bit more expensive now that discovery+ and other -- a lot of other streaming services are trying to build up a local content?"

On the ad budgets, getting back to what -- even before we get to discovery+, with our traditional business, what Steinlauf has been -- and his team have very effectively done, and he and I have been on the road with all the big agencies at least 3 times over the -- since the Scripps deal, is dealing with the fact that the broadcasters are getting over $60 in CPM and we were getting 1/3 of that. And -- but we're the #1 player for women -- or the #2 player for women. And we have the #1 network with TLC. We have the #1 show with 90 Day Fiance. And so we've been pushing that rock uphill. And you see in our numbers how we've been driving that CPM. 
But now that we have a whole basket where we have this win-win of ""Come in with us for $40-plus CPM,"" why are you going to get a repeat on a broadcast network when you could buy original content on us and we get a huge premium on our CPM. We believe that this should ultimately flip. And aside from sports, we should be getting a premium versus the broadcasters because we're producing -- we have length of view. We have an audience that's engaged. We have endemics with food and home where advertisers want to be. And so we think we have some real momentum there, and we're going to push on it because we think, from an equitable perspective and from a performance perspective, we should see much more of that money with much more CPM with better returns. And we think advertisers are starting to agree with us, and you should see that flowing through over a period of time. 
And with GO and discovery+, we do have a lot more opportunity because with discovery+ bigger than we thought, with GO continuing to perform, we have more capacity. And we're seeing that the attractiveness of that capacity in terms of the kind of premiums that we're getting in CPM on discovery+ where there's only a few ads is really terrific. So it's -- and it's incremental reach, real incremental reach for us, non-cable, and so -- which is quite helpful.
And on the local, leaning in, we do need original content. We have been doing it. JB's work has been producing a lot of it in every language. We have the factory that converts all of our content into every language, but we are doing more original because it's helping us both on linear and direct to consumer. 
But JB, talk about how we've kind of pivoted this year to lean in even harder."

I think the other thing that's exciting for us that we've never been able to take advantage of in a material way is we have now, even in the last 90 days, examples of shows that originate out of one market that are top 10 or top 5, in some cases, drivers in other international markets. 
And so when we talk about local content, local content used to only mean monetization in one market. The reality is now we're starting to see more value and benefit being driven out of local content multi market. So we did an Estonia documentary on the terrible and tragic capsizing, the largest ferry disaster in the Nordics, that was originated out of our Nordics business. It's now a top performer in the U.K., a top performer in Italy. And so local content investment doesn't just mean local. It means local with value now to travel, which is something that we never had.

I know we talked about a little bit of the improvement in subscribers, but really, it seems like you would have had to have some kind of pricing -- discrete pricing improvement there. So can you just help with that and how much that impacts that underlying pace as we go into the new year and that growth you're expecting?
And then just a couple on international digital, if I could. Of the 5 million subscribers -- next-gen subscribers you discussed in the fourth quarter, how many of those were Dplay subs that sort of became discovery+ subs on the conversion?

So you're 100% right, we were up 5% in the fourth quarter, and that was almost completely traditional business-driven. It's a combination of pricing, slightly better subscriber trends. We've lost less than in prior quarters. And also, we've done very well on the side of the virtual MVPDs. So that's the Q4 number, mostly linear. 
For Q1, we're talking about high single digit, potentially double digit. Then a lot of that acceleration is obviously coming from the B2C trends, given the subscriber success that we've seen so far, that is going to start very materially contributing to that number. That's why I started talking about distribution the way we laid it out in our financial statements as well rather than just affiliate.

I couldn't be prouder of how ou",1529,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review both our Q1 performance and the meaningful progress we are making since our launch of discovery+ across our operating segments, brands and global markets. I couldn't be prouder of how our company has executed, near flawlessly, responding with creativity, precision and focus across the board, while at the same time, accelerating the pace of innovation throughout our organization as we embrace substantial growth opportunities around the globe. 
We continue to reposition the company and put it on a path of sustainable growth for the long term. Our ability to generate free cash flow is crucial, allowing us to fully fund our pivot and underscoring the efficiency of our model. Indeed, even during this moment of increased investment, as clearly evidenced in our financials this quarter, our free cash flow machine is working harder than ever, and it is reinforcing an evolving narrative about Discovery's differentiated hand. 
With the strong global launch of discovery+, we are now scaling a very well received global direct-to-consumer offering that complements our incumbent linear channel presence in every television market around the globe. In Q1, Discovery had the most watched domestic pay-TV portfolio. Internationally, we enjoyed an impressive seventh consecutive quarter of linear share growth, anchored by our 27th straight month of growth in our female genres and best-ever quarterly performances in several markets, including the U.K., France and Germany. This growth was supported by the continued global expansion of our Scripps lifestyle brand and content. We achieved this while simultaneously launching and building discovery+. Our continued strategic focus leverages Discovery's powerful, competitive advantages, well-established consumer connections in every market in the world, vast local language IP ownership, deep and expanding distribution relationships and a super efficient content production model to power both our global direct-to-consumer expansion and our core linear business. To achieve this, we are investing more than ever before in our content across the board to support these platforms. 
So far, in 2021, it is all coalescing and exceeding all of our early benchmarks across almost every KPI. We are pleased to report that just 4 months into our U.S. launch of discovery+ and with the vast majority of our international expansion still ahead of us, we have 15 million total paying subs across our global direct-to-consumer base. And we continue to move forward with strong momentum. When I think about our 15 million direct-to-consumer paying subscribers that we have today and the fact that we were able to add 10 million paying subscribers since the end of last year, we're just really impressed with our traction. At the end of Q1, we crossed 13 million paying global subscribers, representing sub-growth that compares quite favorably to our peers over the same period, underscoring the value, appeal and stickiness of our content, all of which supported our conviction about our opportunity ahead. But our sub count tells only part of the story. We are equally encouraged by early metrics and KPIs across engagement, churn and monetization and ARPU, particularly in the U.S., which likely place us at the very top of an impressive list of peer offerings, many of whom have had a far longer runway thus far than we have. 
Roll to pay has been between 80% and 85% of 3 trial subs. Engagement is approximately 3 hours per day per viewing subscriber and well ahead of linear. The retention is strong giving us confidence that while early monthly churn is trending towards low single digits. Consumers clearly love the discovery+ product. We see that on social in the App store product ratings and the feedback from partners, clients and talent in the marketplace. Our App Store ratings ranked as among the sector's top. Our Apple App store rating is 4.9 and based on a very large number of reviews. Our strong early KPIs are driving exceptional monetization. Our 4 99 AdLite product with only 4 minutes of commercial time generated over $10 of ARPU in the quarter, already well ahead of our longer term goal, and it's still trending up. 
Our overall blended U.S. ARPU of around $7 is already in line with what we generate in linear, and we see healthy momentum for that figure to grow during the course of this year. And on a global blended basis, we are seeing ARPU of over $5. Gunnar will provide some additional detail on metrics and KPIs. But in short, we are working towards a [subsidive] customer lifetime value, particularly as contrasted against the cost to gain a subscriber, encouraging us to lean in from an investment standpoint when it comes to marketing, content and technological capability in order to maximize this meaningful growth opportunity. We have an extremely focused approach on all the ways we can be available to the broader swath of users while driving a rich and dynamic user experience. A cornerstone of this will be expanding our partnerships with many of the world's leading distributors and platforms. We recently launched on Comcast Xfinity Flex and soon on X1 and are deepening our relationship with Amazon around the globe with availability on prime video channels in the United States and a global rollout plan for other PVC markets. 
Now let's look at Italy. It's a great example of a market where we see encouraging early signs of the long-term growth potential against which we are executing our strategy, bringing together our market expertise, strong local talent, sticky original content, management resources and relationships, production and technology infrastructure and popular brand and channel presence. Like a number of other markets in Europe, Italy is relatively underpenetrated with respect to pay-TV at roughly 20% with really one main distributor. It has significant mobile penetration and usage. And where Discovery enjoys a healthy pay and free-to-air presence with depth in local in language content. And though we have grown our audience share, the existing pay-TV market structure limits the upside from this segment of the ecosystem. The launch of discovery+ has catalyzed a new growth trajectory. Our addressable market has grown more than 10x from pay-TV to now include mobile and broadband. discovery+ enables an entry cost for premium video that's 75% plus more affordable than traditional bundles. And discovery+ ARPU are already more than 3x greater than our wholesale portfolio. This is a powerful combination of potential universe and price growth. 
What we are seeing in Italy guides our thinking on the prospects of what our other international markets would look like. There are significant markets such as Brazil, Germany and Australia with similar characteristics and where our ability to offer a direct-to-consumer offering, packaged with mobile or multi-platform operators should ultimately result in new customers, higher ARPUs and a deeper direct connection with ARPU. 
Of equal importance is the balance we have been able to strike across all linear and direct consumer businesses, reflecting on our Q1 performance, which, by many measures, is still facing COVID-related headwinds. I'm proud of our team's ability to manage through difficult operating circumstances. And you will see that in our Q2 outlook. Gunnar will take you through the details, but I'm pleased to note that in every international region, we're seeing positive advertising growth versus 2020 with record shares in Q1 from major markets like U.K., France and Germany. We are seeing the great resilience in our advertising business, not just internationally, but also domestically. This, taken together with very strong scatter pricing in the U.S. and public spending across the globe, give us confidence in our advertising outlook for the balance of the year, especially with the growing discovery+ opportunity. We couldn't be more excited to present to our advertisers at this year's upfront on May 18 at a time when our brands and programming have never been stronger or more relevant. 
At the same time, growth in both domestic and international distribution revenues will be boosted by discovery+. Net-net, we see a healthy inflection in our revenue trajectory behind the global backdrop of improving underlying advertiser demand and continued share gains, particularly in our international markets. Taking a step back and assessing where we are as a company. I'm extraordinarily optimistic. We've gotten off to a great start with discovery+, exceeding our expectations, and are effectively managing through a dynamic, fluid and exciting a time as I have ever seen in my many years in the media business. We are encouraged by the engagement and reception to discovery+ from our consumers, advertisers and distribution partners around the globe, underscoring the strength of our differentiated and . This is an early tailwind that gives us great confidence as we lean even harder into our pivot. Yet as important as discovery+'s success is to the future prospects of the company. Of equivalent importance is our core linear business, the foundation of the company and backbone of our strong free cash flow. As we drive long-term sustainable growth, it is imperative that we nurture both sides of the company as interconnected and supportive to one another.  
Thank you, and I'd like to turn the call over to Gunnar. After which, JB, Gunnar and I will take your questions. Thanks so much."

To th",1898,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. My aim this morning is to provide a slightly more detailed peak into the operating model as well as our near-term outlook than what we would more normally do, in large part given the recent volatility. 
To the extent that this has created additional questions and/or concerns, my goal would be to help alleviate it as possible this morning. 2021 is off to a great start. As David just mentioned and which I'll provide a little more context around KPIs, particularly in the U.S., where we launched at the beginning of this year, across engagement, monetization and churn and implied customer lifetime value continue to reinforce our belief that prioritizing investment in discovery+ will generate superior returns on capital. 
As noted, engagement is truly stellar with viewing subs watching roughly 3 hours of content per day, well ahead of linear and nationally, an underlying contributor to both retention and monetization. And retention is indeed looking very encouraging with churn coming in quite a bit lower than we had initially anticipated. While it is still too early to evaluate a stable monthly churn rate, the retention curve of our first subscriber cohorts are looking very encouraged. Based on these early observations, we expect trend towards low single digits over the course of the next 12 months. 
Turning to monetization, which is also well ahead of plan. Then the ARPU for discovery+ in the U.S. is already in line with our $7 linear [indiscernible] going by the strong monetization of the AdLite product where ARPU has already exceeded $10 in the first quarter. Clearly, strong engagement in watch time despite offering only a 4 million [indiscernible] amending themselves to healthy advertiser demand and return exceptional CPEs. Still early days, though we see a notable path for further monetization as we continue to scale and drive additional engagement, attract additional advertisers and brands and roll out new advertising products. 
Global ARPU is over $5 [indiscernible] with international ARPU as expected below that of the U.S. This is in part due to the market price points and in part because we are launching the greater share of our subscribers coming through promotional partnerships, which drive faster adoption and marketing efficiency, but also come at an initially lower ARPU. That being said, we are in virtually all cases to see ARPUs that are multiples that both the existing wholesale linear pay PBP at which we currently monetize it. This, of course, is a core tenet of our international discovery+ strategy and a great objective testament to the quality and value of our content in the marketplace not limited by the boundaries of traditional pay-TV ecosystem. 
Taking these metrics together, we are modeling a much more substantive estimate of customer lifetime value while subscriber acquisition cost is currently running at a very healthy cushion to that. Based on these trends, we are increasingly more confident with our outer year projections and our target margin profile of 20% at scale. While it's still too early to formally update this number, we believe there is meaningful upside to the target based on all these initial indicators trending above our business case assumptions. 
During the first quarter, next-generation revenues increased 52% year-over-year. And we look to build upon this momentum in Q2 with next-generation revenues set to more than double yearly, driven by both volume of subs and modernization. We did invest heavily in marketing spend in the first quarter to support the U.S. launch of discovery+ and rebranding and play in key international markets, a sizable portion of which was dedicated to upper funnel brand marketing to build awareness as well as bottom-up funnel performance marketing. This accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year increase in OpEx alongside content and [indiscernible] In the aggregate, next-gen OIBDA losses were roughly $400 million in the first quarter. We expect a modest sequential improvement in next-gen losses in Q2 as continued substantial marketing efforts to roll out additional territory and requisite content and tech spend will begin to be offset by more material revenue contributions. Also, we expect to better optimize a refined marketing spend as we gain additional insights. Quarter-to-quarter losses and quite possibly what ultimately falls into 2021 versus 2022 is still subject to a number of moving pieces. And we will obviously provide as much transparency as possible ahead of such movements, particularly as impacted by rollout plans around the Olympic games, planned technology spend and platform integrations and determined by specific partners. 
That said, we continue to remain confident that 2021 will represent the peak year for loss from our investment initiatives. Of course, we are as mindful as ever about the magnitude of these expenses and their impact on our financials, yet we are reassured by the compelling return metrics against this 
Now turning to the segments. In the U.S., advertising finished down 4% during the first quarter, in large part due to universe estimates and sub level declines, which ultimately translated into lower impressions across the industry and our networks. That said, we continue to outperform our pay-TV network peers on share during the quarter. Moreover, pricing remained robust, scatter CPMs developing strongly during Q1 and expected to be up around 30% year-over-year with roughly 50% premium versus upfront in Q2. In fact, total dollar volume for Q2 scatter will be up considerably versus last year as we see categories such as auto and travel coming back as well as from the input of B2C companies, including many new TV advertisers. discovery+ has started to advertising revenue in Q1 as subscribers grew throughout the quarter, and we expect an increasing tailwind from this component through Q2. As such, we expect U.S. advertising revenue to grow in the low double-digit range, helped in part by COVID comps, strong pricing and advertiser demand across the businesses. 
U.S. distribution revenues were up 12% during the quarter, at the high end of our expectations. Mid-single-digit linear distribution revenue growth continued to be supported by contractual filling fee increases, partially offset by pay-TV subscriber decline. Subscribers to our fully distributed linear networks declined by 2%, while our total pay-TV subscribers declined by 4%, likely top of peer performance, helped by additional network carriage resin affiliate renewals and continuing share gains at virtual MVPD where we remain very well canvassed across all key platforms. In addition to our healthy traditional affiliates business, the launch of discovery+ and the subsequent ramp-up of subscribers accounted for much of the sequential acceleration in distribution revenue growth. During Q2, we expect reported distribution revenue growth will accelerate further even against a much tougher comparison given the significant onetime benefit recognized last year, implying a significant acceleration on an underlying basis, supported by similar drivers as in Q1. 
Turning to international networks, which I will discuss, as always, on a constant currency basis. Advertising were 8% during the first quarter as all international regions, EMEA, LATAM and APAC returned to growth, the first since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Latin America developed positively driven by Brazil and Mexico. And despite intermittent lockdown in certain EMEA markets, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the region due to continuing share gains in key markets like the U.K., Spain and France. Finally, APAC was also up significantly during the quarter. In Q2, as we comped the substantial declines faced by the advertiser industry last year during the initial stages of the COVID pandemic, we expect international advertising revenue growth to exceed 50%. International distribution revenue was down 2% in Q1 due to lower linear pricing in certain European markets, partially offset by our growing discovery+ subscriber base. We expect international distribution revenue to accelerate to mid-single-digit growth during the second quarter, driven by the same factors. As we called out in prior quarters, as we repositioned a number of key international distribution partnerships towards a hybrid-type structure, we've opted to trade nearer-term upside on the linear portfolio for greater in terms of support for our DC efforts. Segment performance has already reflected some of the impact of this over the last 2 quarters. 
Turning to the expense side. Total operating expenses for the consolidated company were up 21% during the quarter. Cost of revenues were up 2%, largely due to the continued rent and content investment to support our next-generation initiatives and the timing of sports content in Europe, partially offset by more efficient content spending. SG&A increased 48% to reflect marketing and branding as well as personnel and technology spend to support our next-generation initiatives.  As we guided previously, we continue to target low- to mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our core linear business offerings.
Turning to free cash flow. We produced Q1 free cash flow of $179 million with an AOIBDA to free cash flow conversion rate similar to the prior year quarter. We remain confident and reassured in our ability to financially support all of our strategic endeavors as we continue to convert AOIBDA at a highly efficient rate despite the initially significant ramp in our investments. 
We did not buy back any shares during the quarter. As I noted earlier, we continue to review investments in discovery+ as the best fundamental use of our free cash flow in order to drive sustainable growth in shareholder value. Further, for the next few quarters, we also want to maintain an appropriate amount of financial cushion in the cadence of our global discovery+ rollout remains fluid, both in terms of where and when we launch and the level of investment required to penetrate specific markets. And while we are investing against a rigorous financial framework, bear in mind, that we're gearing up for 2 sets of Olympic games this summer and in Q1 next year, both of which will be 10 pole events for the marketing of our D2C and linear brand. We will, of course, continue to update you on our views on capital allocation as we [indiscernible] quarter at approximately 3.5x net leverage, and needless to say, remain fully committed to our investment-grade rating. 
Turning to a couple of housekeeping items. Number one, as you may have noticed, we are no longer disclosing adjusted EPS as overlaid free cash flow continue to be the key financial metrics in evaluating our operating performance. I will, however, provide you with the PPA impact each quarter as well as point out key note items to help calculate an adjusted EPS number to the extent helpful. For the first quarter, PPA was $0.32 per share. Number 2, we expect FX to have roughly a positive $40 million year-over-year impact on revenues and around a negative $25 million year-over-year impact in AOIBDA in 2021, reflecting the strengthening of the dollar and sterling since the start of the year. 
We are operating on strong footing, evidenced by a rapidly growing direct-to-consumer business and the resilient core linear business. And our ability to convert AOIBDA to free cash flow where I continue to see at least 50% this year has never been more valuable given reinvestment demands. We have a self-funded business aimed at supporting an immense global direct-to-consumer opportunities.  We couldn't be more excited as a management team to focus on continuing to deliver solid operating performance while we build the framework to support long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value. I'd like to turn it over to the operator to start taking questions."

So let me take -- let me start with that last question. The -- we're super excited about the upcoming launches here. As you have seen in our numbers, if you do the math, we've been adding about 1.5 million subscribers on a monthly basis over the past 2 months here. And I do want to point out that these numbers are going to be moving around a little, but the Comcast launch is going to be one very positive event. And to answer your question, I do think there is a significant incremental impact. That's what we've seen with other deals coming online after launch. So that should be a positive. And we also look at other events happening internationally over the next couple of months that could further support the subscriber growth here, most importantly, obviously, the Olympics coming in internationally. And so that's for the subscriber trend here. 
To your other question on the U.S. affiliate side, again, as I just laid out, we're super happy with what we're seeing for distribution across the entire ecosystem here, clearly seeing very healthy and accelerating the contributions from discovery+ and our D2C efforts overall. But we're also looking at a very healthy underlying trend in the core business. You saw the linear subscriber numbers, which have again been a little better than maybe over the average of the past 18 months or so, with only 2% down for our core networks. And as I said, we've continued to enjoy roughly mid-single-digit growth here in the linear part of the ecosystem. 
Yes. The -- your question about renewals and impact of discovery+, look, as I said, we are continuing to get fee increases. That's one of the reasons we have been able to continue the growth that we have delivered in the fourth quarter, now in the first quarter. And we have been seeing very positive discussions for the past renewals and for upcoming renewals as well. As you have heard, clearly, discovery+ is an argument in those discussions, but it's one of many. And to me, it comes back to just the rational look at what the economics are. And we are delivering close to 20% of viewership for our affiliates. We're a great partner. We're leaning in with investments. This company is investing as much in content as never before this year. And we're doing that, and we're making that available to our affiliates at a very, very competitive rate. And so again, I don't want to make any predictions here on individual renewals, but those are constructive discussions, and we feel that we're in a very good position."

They're able to create value for us and for them by -- and I think they have some real entitlement. They're a broadband leader. And these channel stores have really developed. And Comcast is looking. And between Flex and X1, it could be a real generator of value for both of us. And as Gunnar said, the share of our traditional channels are going up. They're selling those channels. The cost of those channels are very low, and we're probably the best actor in that space and that we're providing the core value of the bundle.

So again, we delivered 12% in Q1, and I expect an acceleration off of this number. I'm not getting more specific here because, to some extent, it is going to depend on the cadence of subscriber additions on the D2C side because, as I said, that's flowing through now very significantly on the revenue side. But if you keep in mind, last year in Q2, we had a very sizable one-off item. So that's going to work against us here. And when I say acceleration from the 12%, I mean, despite that one-off. So on an underlying basis, we'll see this may be -- this may be an underlying high single-digit growth quarter, which is going to come through as -- sorry, high teens, high-teens growth quarter, which is going to come through as an acceleration against the 12%."

I think, David, first for you, how are you balancing content on Go versus discovery+, how are you -- and versus the linear networks?

I think number two, upfront looks like up 15% to 20% for CPMs year-over-year. It's early. We've got a ways to go, but the setup looks very, very strong. Any thoughts for Discovery and comments on that? And if I could tag on a quick one, ad load at 4 minutes. When does that start increasing?

On the upfront, look, I don't know that I've seen 50% increases in CPMs of a prior year upfront before. The CPMs are very high.

On the upfront, look, I don't know that I've seen 50% increases in CPMs of a prior year upfront before. The CPMs are very high. But what we really have an advantage of is that the broadcasters have been getting $60 plus, and we've been getting less than half that. And now all of a sudden, instead of companies, we're booking -- we're really making progress in booking significant dollars in the 40s, high 40s, even $50. And part of that has to do with the fact that our share is going up. We have some hit shows whether it be mail on Discovery or whether it be shows like like 90 Day Fiance, which is #1 show on television. And we've started to get paid a lot more money for that. And so I think you will see our CPMs, I think, meaningfully better because we have a lot of headroom still to drive our CPM versus competitors that have been at a very high level. So I think we hit this upfront at a very good moment. In addition, we have now some scale inventory on discovery+, which is selling very well. And in the -- in that environment, then on Go, we don't have the disadvantage of it's -- a viewer is a viewer. So we don't have that inherent disadvantage versus the broadcasters. So we're getting paid on every sub. And we also have a very good demographic, which is generating dramatically higher CPMs than we're seeing in traditional. So overall, I think the advertising market, very, very strong, upfront coming up, feeling good about it. In terms of balancing, the idea that we have viewing subs on discovery+ spending over 3 hours. And that we have the highest ratings and that our churn is extremely low is telling us a lot about the quality of this product. But what's really interesting is that the top shows, our top original shows and top shows from our channels are only generating about 10% of the viewership. We have a very long tail library about the size of Netflix, and people are spending a lot of time with it. And a lot of times -- so we don't have like the one -- we don't have the one-hit show or the one-hit movie. But I think as a result of that, we're seeing much lower churn than our peers. And usage, that is a lot more. And that's generating real economics for us on the advertising side, which has surprised us, the kind of economics that we're getting. We will continue to experiment with how we move IP around. We have a lot of originals now on discovery+, and we have more coming. And we'll be doing that globally in addition to the local content that we have outside the U.S. JB, maybe you could speak to the balance as we look outside the U.S. for discovery+."

And so we're continuing to lean into that. We are seeing, obviously, a lot of that great content. People -- and the success we've had to date in the markets, knowing that, obviously, since we launched and started talking about discovery+'s success over the last few months, we've launched in no really new additional markets in the markets we already had. So all that is still to come. And in the markets we already have with the growth we've seen, it's all been an exploitation of the content we are investing in, winnowing, in some cases, earlier on discovery+ and then getting a sort of second fund later on either a free-to-air or pay nets, and in some cases, obviously, some content exclusively on discovery+. And that combination of content mix is working extremely well for us. And it's one that we're continuing to look at the data and the response of the consumer and continue to modify and adjust as necessary. 
The only other thing I'd say, Dave, to the question also about the 4 minutes of advertising. We obviously market the service as 5. And so we came out with a lower ad load than even what we marketed. We're going to continue to stay at that level for now. But that actually, over time, when we think it's appropriate, which we don't have any plans to do that for the minute, but down the road, we obviously have some flexibility to move above the 4 minutes if we need."

So there's an underlying positive dynamic. But if you just take a step back here, why are we saw excited about this? Number one, we've ceased to just sell a commercial demo. It's a big difference between the linear TV and our digital platform here. We're selling every single eyeball on discovery+ and TV Everywhere for that matter. Number two is we've got a really level playing field here. That big gap between and cable CPMs that we've been discussing for seen for decades here just doesn't exist. It's premium online video, and we're getting full value for our product. Not only that, we have a highly engaged audience. You heard some of the stats that we mentioned that are probably top of the industry, very family-friendly content environment. Couple that with the fact that premium online video inventory is scarce in the first place because a lot of the viewership is happening on ad-free platforms, that drives super high demand and a hot market environment right now. The other thing that I want to make -- the other point I want to make here in terms of upside is we're still in the early innings from the perspective of our product offerings towards advertisers, right? We have just launched our Binge advertising product pause ads. We're working on more. And it's in a way, it's part of the prioritization exercise here to get all those features online. But there are a couple of great other ideas. So I do think that we will, without even playing with a number of minutes here, we will have a pretty positive run rate here for ARPU over the next couple of months."

And so universal-wise, we feel like it's -- to continue to be fairly stable. There are -- I mean again, it's hard to talk about the international markets in broad strokes. But there are select markets which are seeing obviously more challenges, Brazil has been one where we've seen more of subscriber decline as the middle class there has been hit harder over the last few years. But overall, the universe remains fairly stable.

But net-net, reasonable stability with some continued churn down from the higher, more broadly packaged tiers down to a slightly lower price tiers in some markets. And I think as it relates to the news about the shuttering of the Asian channels, look, I think we've obviously leaned in, not to say we have shut full portfolios of channels.

And you would assume some efficiency as the product becomes -- grows in awareness as we start getting more word of mouth, et cetera, and as we're benefiting from the high retention that we're seeing in our subscriber base. So taking all that together, again, it's just too early just to start talking about sort of an updated margin profile for 3, 4, 5 years out, but we feel very, very good about it. And to point it out, breakeven. Again, as we said before, it's not a metric we manage towards. As long as I can acquire subscribers here with phenomenal lifetime values at a fraction of that effect of cost of that lifetime value, we'll do it. And we also stand by what we said earlier. I don't think anyone is going to have the margins that we will have in this business. And I think we're going to get there much -- get to breakeven or scaled margins much earlier than anyone else just because our fundamental underlying economics are not changing. We're getting the same value from the consumer, and we're getting the same leverage out of our content. We continue to be in super efficient verticals that we're super strong in and that we have 30 years of experience. And we continue to exploit our content across platforms and across the entire globe. And it's amazing to see how this model, again, it's early days, but how it's working. We're getting phenomenal cross-pollination between our TV Everywhere environment and discovery+. It's great. And we'll just have to -- that's why I decided to give a couple more KPIs so you can all sort of make up your minds and think about it, how does it compare to what you're hearing from others. What does the model look like? And we'll just keep giving you some transparency here and take it from there rather than giving you a long-term, 5-year outlook or something."

Here we are trending right now well over $10. And as we get bigger, it's continuing to grow. And we have this strong demo. So we look at AdLite as something that as we look at ad-free versus AdLite, we've been talking to those customers at 4 minutes an hour. They seem very happy. They -- ad-free very happy, but we don't really see a difference. And the ability to generate significant incremental economics off of the AdLite. So you'll see us pushing on AdLite. And when -- in the ad free, which was very inexpensive as we were going to be rolling it out outside the U.S. The ability to do an AdLite outside the U.S.,  JB and I, after seeing this data, immediately, 2 months ago, were wow. And so we've been pivoting because there could be upwards of 50% incremental revenue. And as we get to scale more than that by doing the AdLite and you have a very good customer experience, so which was a surprise to us. We really thought people are used to commercials, they're not going to want any. But it's one of the reasons we're not going to 5. They're so happy with the 4.

And selectively, and particularly, as David said, we're experimenting in different ways to try and see what the data tells us. We're experimenting with some early windows or pulling -- having a talent that's been doing stuff on linear do some additional stuff for us on D2C. But it's -- we can do a little bit of both. It's continue to produce great originals and stories for our traditional [indiscernible] and give people an ability to want to access that and embark subscribing to it in the bigger bundles, access to it on d+, either concurrently or even a bit later in some cases.

So the idea would be indeed tempting to say, okay, we have a digital business and a linear business. This is not the reality right now and maybe less so for us than for others just because we have that amazing IP exploitation model. One of the big advantages that we have is our ability to take so many bites at the apple across the global footprint and across platform. So that's why, right now, it is a little hard to really cleanly split out a digital P&L and a linear P&L. And frankly, it's also not entirely in line with how we manage the company because JV and his team are very much looking at international markets in an aggregate basis. And some of the trade-off decisions that we've laid out are very much focusing on trading off linear and digital. That being said, we will try to make it as easy as possible for you guys to form a view. And look, by laying out the metrics here for our discovery+ product, by giving you a perspective on losses that we have incurred from launching and by giving you at least a short-term outlook about how we expect those loss to be trending, we're trying to help you model this. And as I said earlier, I would assume those losses to start-up start tapering a little bit in the second quarter. Again, I also want to have the flexibility to lean in further if we find other markets are coming online that have a great opportunity to acquire subs at a multiple of their acquisition cost. So we'll need some wiggle room here, but I'm trying to sort of give you an understanding of that financial profile. As I said, I mean, I am focused on long-term sustainable growth for this company. I think that's what's going to drive shareholder value. And I mean if you just look at, if you just look at our guidance here for the second quarter, accelerating U.S. distribution revenues from 12% against the tough comp, double-digit U.S. ad sales growth, 50% international ad sales growth and significant acceleration in international distribution growth to mid-single digits. I think, again, it's early days, but I would say it's working."

Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review both our Q1 performance and the meaningful progress we are making since our launch of discovery+. Across our operating segments, brands and global markets, I couldn't be prouder of how",1525,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review both our Q1 performance and the meaningful progress we are making since our launch of discovery+. 
Across our operating segments, brands and global markets, I couldn't be prouder of how our company has executed, near flawlessly, responding with creativity, precision and focus across the board while, at the same time, accelerating the pace of innovation throughout our organization as we embrace substantial growth opportunities around the globe.  We continue to reposition the company and put it on a path of sustainable growth for the long term. 
Our ability to generate free cash flow is crucial, allowing us to fully fund our pivot and underscoring the efficiency of our model. Indeed, even during this moment of increased investment, as clearly evidenced in our financials this quarter, our free cash flow machine is working harder than ever, and it is reinforcing an evolving narrative about Discovery's differentiated hand.  
With the strong global launch of discovery+, we are now scaling a very well-received global direct-to-consumer offering that complements our incumbent linear channel presence in every television market around the globe. In Q1, Discovery had the most watched domestic pay-TV portfolio. Internationally, we enjoyed an impressive seventh consecutive quarter of linear share growth, anchored by our 27th straight month of growth in our female genres and best-ever quarterly performances in several markets, including the U.K., France and Germany. This growth was supported by the continued global expansion of our Scripps lifestyle brand and content. We achieved this while simultaneously launching and building discovery+. 
Our continued strategic focus leverages Discovery's powerful competitive advantages, well-established consumer connections in every market in the world, vast local language IP ownership, deep and expanding distribution relationships and a super efficient content production model to power both our global direct-to-consumer expansion and our core linear business. To achieve this, we are investing more than ever before in our content across the board to support these platforms.  
So far in 2021, it is all coalescing and exceeding all of our early benchmarks across almost every KPI. We are pleased to report that just 4 months into our U.S. launch of discovery+ and with the vast majority of our international expansion still ahead of us, we have 15 million total paying subs across our global direct-to-consumer base. And we continue to move forward with strong momentum. 
When I think about our 15 million direct-to-consumer paying subscribers that we have today and the fact that we were able to add 10 million paying subscribers since the end of last year, we're just really impressed with our traction. At the end of Q1, we crossed 13 million paying global net subscribers, representing sub growth that compares quite favorably to our peers over the same period, underscoring the value, appeal and stickiness of our content, all of which supported our conviction about our opportunity ahead. 
But our sub count tells only part of the story. We are equally encouraged by early metrics and KPIs across engagement, churn and monetization and ARPU, particularly in the U.S., which likely place us at the very top of an impressive list of peer offerings, many of whom have had a far longer runway thus far than we have. Roll-to-pay has been between 80% and 85% of pre-trial subs. Engagement is approximately 3 hours per day per viewing subscriber and well ahead of linear. The retention is strong, giving us confidence that while early, monthly churn is trending towards low single digits. 
Consumers clearly love the discovery+ product. We see that on social, in the App Store product ratings and the feedback from partners, clients and talent in the marketplace. Our App Store ratings rank as among the sector's top. Our Apple App Store rating is 4.9 and based on a very large number of reviews. Our strong early KPIs are driving exceptional monetization. Our $4.99 AdLite product, with only 4 minutes of commercial time, generated over $10 of ARPU in the quarter, already well ahead of our longer-term goal. And it's still trending up.
Our overall blended U.S. ARPU of around $7 is already in line with what we generate in linear, and we see healthy momentum for that figure to grow during the course of this year. And on a global blended basis, we are seeing ARPU of over $5. Gunnar will provide some additional detail on metrics and KPIs. But in short, we are working towards a substantive customer lifetime value, particularly as contrasted against the cost to gain a subscriber, encouraging us to lean in from an investment standpoint when it comes to marketing, content and technological capability in order to maximize this meaningful growth opportunity. 
We have an extremely focused approach on all the ways we can be available to the broader swath of users while driving a rich and dynamic user experience. A cornerstone of this will be expanding our partnerships with many of the world's leading distributors and platforms. We recently launched on Comcast Xfinity Flex and soon on X1 and are deepening our relationship with Amazon around the globe with availability on Prime Video Channels in the United States and a global rollout plan for other PVC markets.  
Now let's look at Italy. It's a great example of a market where we see encouraging early signs of the long-term growth potential against which we are executing our strategy, bringing together our market expertise, strong local talent, sticky original content, management resources and relationships, production and technology infrastructure and popular brand and channel presence. 
Like a number of other markets in Europe, Italy is relatively underpenetrated with respect to pay-TV at roughly 20% with really one main distributor. It has significant mobile penetration and usage and where Discovery enjoys a healthy pay and free-to-air presence with depth and local in-language content. And though we have grown our audience share, the existing pay-TV market structure limits the upside from this segment of the ecosystem. 
The launch of discovery+ has catalyzed a new growth trajectory. Our addressable market has grown more than 10x from pay-TV to now include mobile and broadband. discovery+ enables an entry cost for premium video that's 75%-plus more affordable than traditional bundles. And discovery+ ARPU are already more than 3x greater in our wholesale portfolio. This is a powerful combination of potential universe and price growth. 
What we are seeing in Italy guides our thinking on the prospects of what our other international markets could look like. There are significant markets, such as Brazil, Germany and Australia, with similar characteristics and where our ability to offer a direct-to-consumer offering packaged with mobile or multi-platform operators should ultimately result in new customers, higher ARPUs and a deeper, direct connection with our  
[Audio Gap]
Of equal importance is the balance we have been able to strike across our linear and direct-to-consumer businesses. Reflecting on our Q1 performance, which, by many measures, is still facing COVID-related headwinds, I'm proud of our team's ability to manage through difficult operating circumstances. And you will see that in our Q2 outlook. Gunnar will take you through the details, but I'm pleased to note that in every international region, we're seeing positive advertising growth versus 2020 with record shares in Q1 from major markets like U.K., France and Germany. 
We are seeing the great resilience in our advertising business not just internationally but also domestically. This, taken together with very strong scatter pricing in the U.S. and public spending across the globe, give us confidence in our advertising outlook for the balance of the year, especially with the growing discovery+ opportunity. We couldn't be more excited to present to our advertisers at this year's upfronts on May 18, at a time when our brands and programming have never been stronger or more relevant. At the same time, growth in both domestic and international distribution revenues will be boosted by discovery+. 
Net-net, we see a healthy inflection in our revenue trajectory behind the global backdrop of improving underlying advertiser demand and continued share gains, particularly in our international markets. Taking a step back and assessing where we are as a company, I'm extraordinarily optimistic. We've gotten off to a great start with discovery+, exceeding our expectations [indiscernible] and are effectively managing through a dynamic, fluid and exciting a time as I have ever seen in my many years in the media business. 
We are encouraged by the engagement and reception to discovery+ from our consumers, advertisers and distribution partners around the globe, underscoring the strength of our differentiated hand. This is an early tailwind that gives us great confidence as we lean even harder into our pivot. 
Yet, as important as discovery+'s success is to the future prospects of the company, of equivalent importance is our core linear business, the foundation of the company and backbone of our strong free cash flow. As we drive [indiscernible]  long-term, sustainable growth, it is imperative that we nurture both sides of the company as interconnected and supportive to one another.   
Thank you, and I'd like to turn the call over to Gunnar, after which JB, Gunnar and I will take your questions. Thanks so much."

Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. My aim this morning is to provide a slightly more detailed peek into the operating model as well as our near-term outlook than what we'd more normally do in large part given the recent volatility. To the exten",1923,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. My aim this morning is to provide a slightly more detailed peek into the operating model as well as our near-term outlook than what we'd more normally do in large part given the recent volatility. To the extent that this has created additional questions and/or concerns, my goal would be to help alleviate as much about it as possible this morning. 
2021 is off to a great start. As David just mentioned and which I'll provide a little more context around, our KPIs, particularly in the U.S., where we launched at the beginning of this year, across engagement, monetization and churn and implied customer lifetime value continue to reinforce our belief that prioritizing investment in discovery+ will generate superior returns on capital.  
As noted, engagement is truly stellar with viewing subs watching roughly 3 hours of content per day, well ahead of linear, and nationally an underlying contributor to both retention and monetization. 
And retention is indeed looking very encouraging with churn coming in quite a bit lower than we had initially anticipated. While it is still too early to evaluate a stable monthly churn rate, the retention curves of our first subscriber cohorts are looking very encouraging. Based on these early observations, we expect churn to trend towards low single digits over the course of the next 12 months.  
Turning to monetization, which is also well ahead of plan. Blended ARPU for discovery+ in the U.S. is already in line with our $7 linear [indiscernible]   owing to the strong monetization of the AdLite product where ARPU has already exceeded $10 in the first quarter. Clearly, strong engagement and watch time, despite offering only a 4-minute ad load, are lending themselves to healthy advertiser demand and, in turn, exceptional CPMs. Still early days, though we see a notable path for further monetization as we continue to scale and drive additional engagement, attract additional advertisers and brands and roll out new advertising products.  
Global ARPU is over $5 already, with international ARPU, as expected, below that of the the U.S. This is in part due to market price points and in part because we are launching with the greater share of our subscribers coming through promotional partnerships, which drive faster adoption and marketing efficiency but also come at an initially lower ARPU. That being said, we are, in virtually all cases, seeing ARPUs that are multiples with that of the existing wholesale linear pay-TV [ feeds ] at which we currently monetize [indiscernible]. This, of course, is a core tenet of our international discovery+ strategy and a great objective testament to the quality and value of our content in a marketplace not limited by the boundaries of a traditional pay-TV ecosystem.  
Taking these metrics together, we are modeling a much more substantive estimate of customer lifetime value, while subscriber acquisition cost is currently running at a very healthy cushion to that [indiscernible]. Based on these trends, we're increasingly more confident with our outer year projections and our target margin profile of 20% at scale. While it's still too early to formally update this number, we believe there is meaningful upside to the target based on all these initial indicators trending above our business case assumptions.  
During the first quarter, next-generation revenues increased 52% year-over-year. And we look to build upon this momentum in Q2 with next-generation revenues set to more than double yearly driven by both volume of subs and monetization efforts. 
We did invest heavily in marketing spend in the first quarter to support the U.S. launch of discovery+ and rebranding and [ deep-playing ] in key international markets, a sizable portion of which was dedicated to upper-funnel brand marketing to build awareness as well as bottom-up the funnel performance marketing. This accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year increase in OpEx alongside content and tech spend. 
In the aggregate, next-gen OIBDA losses were roughly $400 million in the first quarter. We expect a modest sequential improvement in next-gen losses in Q2 as continued substantial marketing efforts to roll out additional territories and requisite content and tech spend will begin to be offset by more material revenue contributions. Also, we expect to better optimize and refine marketing spend as we gain additional insights. 
Quarter-to-quarter losses and quite possibly what ultimately falls into 2021 versus 2022 is still subject to a number of moving pieces. And we will obviously provide as much transparency as possible ahead of such movements, particularly as impacted by rollout plans around the Olympic Games, planned technology spend and platform integrations as determined by specific partners. That said, we continue to remain confident that 2021 will represent the peak year for losses from our investment initiatives. 
Of course, we are as mindful as ever about the magnitude of these expenses and their impact on our financials. Yet, we are reassured by the compelling return metrics against this spend. 
Now turning to the segments. In the U.S., advertising finished down 4% during the first quarter in large part due to universe estimates and sub level declines, which ultimately translated into lower impressions across the industry and our networks. 
That said, we continued to outperform our pay-TV network peers on share during the quarter. Moreover, pricing remained robust, scatter CPMs developing strongly during Q1 and expected to be up around 30% year-over-year with roughly 50% premium versus upfront in Q2. In fact, total dollar volume for Q2 scatter will be up considerably versus last year as we see categories, such as auto and travel, coming back as well as from the influx of B2C companies, including many new TV advertisers. 
discovery+ had started 
[Audio Gap] 
to advertising revenue in Q1 as subscribers grew throughout the quarter, and we expect an increasing tailwind from this component through Q2. As such, we expect U.S. advertising revenue to grow in the low double-digit range in the future, helped in part by COVID comps, strong pricing and advertiser demand across the pay-TV business. 
U.S. distribution revenues were up 12% during the quarter, at the high end of our expectations. Mid-single-digit linear distribution revenue growth continued to be supported by contractual affiliate fee increases, partially offset by pay-TV subscriber decline. Subscribers to our fully distributed linear networks declined by 2%, while our total pay-TV subscribers declined by 4%, likely top-of-peer performance, helped by additional network carriage [indiscernible] affiliate renewals and continuing share gains at virtual MVPDs where we remain very well canvassed across all key platforms. 
In addition to our healthy traditional affiliate business, the launch of discovery+ and the subsequent ramp-up of subscribers accounted for much of the sequential acceleration in distribution revenue growth. During Q2, we expect reported distribution revenue growth will accelerate further, even against a much tougher comparison given the significant onetime benefit recognized last year, implying a significant acceleration on an underlying basis, supported by similar drivers as in Q1. 
Turning to international networks, which I will discuss, as always, on a constant currency basis. Advertising grew 8% during the first quarter as all international regions, EMEA, LatAm and APAC, returned to growth, a first since the start of the COVID pandemic. Latin America developed positively driven by Brazil and Mexico. And despite intermittent lockdowns in certain EMEA markets, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the region due to continuing share gains in key markets like the U.K., Spain and France. Finally, APAC was also up significantly during the quarter. 
In Q2, as we comped the substantial declines faced by the advertising industry last year during the initial stages of the COVID pandemic, we expect international advertising revenue growth to exceed 50%. 
International distribution revenue was down 2% in Q1 due to lower linear pricing in certain European markets, partially offset by our growing discovery+ subscriber base. We expect international distribution revenue to accelerate to mid-single-digit growth during the second quarter driven by the same factors. 
As we called out in prior quarters, as we repositioned a number of key international distribution partnerships towards a hybrid-type structure, we've opted to trade nearer-term upside on the linear portfolio for greater
[Audio Gap]
in terms of [ support ] for our D2C efforts. Segment performance has already reflected some of the impact of this over the last 2 quarters. 
Turning to the expense side. Total operating expenses for the consolidated company were up 21% during the quarter. 
Cost of revenues were up 2% largely due to the continued ramp in content investment to support our next-generation initiatives and the timing of sports content in Europe, partially offset by more efficient content spend limits. 
SG&A increased 48% to reflect marketing and branding as well as personnel and technology spend to support our next-generation initiatives. As we guided previously, we continue to target low to mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our core linear business offerings.
Turning to free cash flow. We produced Q1 free cash flow of $179 million with an AOIBDA-to-free cash flow conversion rate similar to the prior year quarter. We remain confident and reassured in our ability to financially support all of our strategic endeavors as we continue to convert AOIBDA at a highly efficient rate despite the initially significant ramp in our investments. 
We did not buy back any shares during the quarter. As I noted earlier, we continue to view investments in discovery+ as the best fundamental use of our free cash flow in order to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value. Further, for the next few quarters, we also want to maintain an appropriate amount of financial cushion since the cadence of our global discovery+ rollout remains fluid, both in terms of where and when we launch and the level of investment required to penetrate specific markets. 
And while we are investing against a rigorous financial framework, bear in mind that we're gearing up for 2 sets of Olympic Games this summer and in Q1 next year, both of which will be tent-pole events for the marketing of our D2C and linear brand. We will, of course, continue to update you on our views on capital allocation as we proceed. 
We
[Audio Gap]
quarter at approximately 3.5x net leverage and, needless to say, remain fully committed to our investment-grade rating. 
Turning to a couple of housekeeping items. Number one, as you may have noticed, we are no longer disclosing adjusted EPS as AOIBDA and free cash flow continue to be the key financial metrics in evaluating our operating performance. I will, however, provide you with the PPA impact each quarter as well as point out key noteworthy items to help calculate an adjusted EPS number to the extent helpful. For the first quarter, PPA was $0.32 per share. 
Number two, we expect FX to have roughly a positive $40 million year-over-year impact on revenues and around a negative $25 million year-over-year impact in AOIBDA in 2021, reflecting the strengthening of the dollar and sterling since the start of the year. 
We are operating on strong footing, evidenced by a rapidly growing direct-to-consumer business and the resilient core linear business. And our ability to convert AOIBDA to free cash flow where I continue to see at least 50% this year has never been more valuable given reinvestment demands. We have a self-funded business aimed at supporting an immense global direct-to-consumer opportunity.  We couldn't be more excited as a management team to focus on continuing to deliver solid operating performance while we build the framework to support long-term, sustainable growth and shareholder value. 
I'd like to turn it over to the operator to start taking questions."

So let me take -- let me start with that last question. The -- we're super excited about the upcoming launches here. As you have seen in our numbers, if you do the math, we've been adding about 1.5 million subscribers on a monthly basis over the past 2 months here. And I do want to point out that these numbers are going to be moving around a little, but the Comcast launch is going to be one very positive event. 
And to answer your question, I do think there is a significant incremental impact. That's what we've seen with other deals coming online after launch. So that should be a positive. 
And we also look at other events happening internationally over the next couple of months that are -- that could further support the subscriber growth here, most importantly, obviously, the Olympics coming in internationally. And so that's for the subscriber trend here. 
To your other question on the U.S. affiliate side, again, as I just laid out, we're super happy with what we're seeing for distribution across the entire ecosystem here, clearly seeing very healthy and accelerating the contributions from discovery+ and our D2C efforts overall. But we're also looking at a very healthy underlying trend in the core business. You saw the linear subscriber numbers, which have again been a little better than maybe over the average of the past 18 months or so, with only 2% down in our -- for our core networks. And as I said, we've continued to enjoy roughly mid-single-digit growth here in the linear part of the ecosystem, yes. 
The -- your question about renewals and impact of discovery+, look, as I said, we are continuing to get fee increases. That's one of the reasons we have been able to continue the growth that we have delivered in the fourth quarter, now in the first quarter. And we have been seeing very positive discussions for the past renewals and for upcoming renewals as well. As you have heard, clearly, discovery+ is an argument in those discussions, but it's one of many. And to me, it comes back to just the rationale, cool look at what the economics are, and we are delivering close to 20% of viewership for our affiliates. 
We're a great partner. We're leaning in with investments. This company is investing as much in content as never before this year. And we're doing that, and we're making that available to our affiliates at a very, very competitive rate. And so again, I don't want to make any predictions here on individual renewals, but those are constructive discussions, and we feel that we're in a very good position."

So again, we delivered 12% in Q1, and I expect an acceleration off of this number. I'm not getting more specific here because, to some extent, it is going to depend on the cadence of subscriber additions on the D2C side because, as I said, that's flowing through now very significantly on the revenue side. 
But if you keep in mind, last year in Q2, we had a very sizable one-off item. So that's going to work against us here. And when I say acceleration from the 12%, I mean despite that one-off. So on an underlying basis, we'll see. This may be an underlying high single-digit growth quarter, which is going to come through as a -- sorry, high teens, high-teens growth quarter, which is going to come through as an acceleration against the 12%, yes."

Any thoughts for Discovery and comments on that? And if I could tag on; I have a quick one. Ad load at 4 minutes. When does that start increasing? Or do you just leave it at 4 minutes because it's good or not?"

On the upfront, look, I don't know that I've seen 50% increases in CPMs off of a prior year upfront before. The CPMs are very high.

On the upfront, look, I don't know that I've seen 50% increases in CPMs off of a prior year upfront before. The CPMs are very high. But what we really have an advantage of is that the broadcasters have been getting $60-plus, and we've been getting less than half that. And now, all of a sudden, instead of [indiscernible], we're booking a -- we're really making progress in booking significant dollars in the $40s, high $40s, even $50. And part of that has to do with the fact that our share is going up. We have some hit shows, whether it be mail on Discovery or whether it be shows like 90 Day Fiance, which is the #1 show on television, and we've started to get paid a lot more money for that. 
And so I think you will see the -- our CPMs, I think, meaningfully better because we have a lot of headroom still to drive our CPM versus competitors that are -- that have been at a very high level. So I think we hit this upfront at a very good moment. 
In addition, we have now some scale inventory on discovery+ which is selling very well. And in the -- in that environment then on GO, we don't have the disadvantage of -- it's a -- a viewer is a viewer. So we don't have that inherent disadvantage versus the broadcasters. So we're getting paid on every sub. 
And we also have a very good demographic which is generating dramatically higher CPMs than we're seeing in traditional. 
So overall, I think the advertising market, very, very strong. Upfront coming up, feeling good about it. 
In terms of balancing, the idea that we have viewing subs on discovery+ spending over 3 hours and that we have the highest ratings and that our churn is extremely low is telling us a lot about the quality of this product. But what's really interesting is that the top shows, our top original shows and top shows from our channels, are only generating about 10% of the viewership. We have a very long-tail library about the size of Netflix, and people are spending a lot of time with it. 
And a lot of times -- so we don't have like the one -- we don't have the one-hit show or the one-hit movie. But I think as a result of that, we're seeing much lower churn than our peers' and usage that is a lot more, and that's generating real economics for us on the advertising side, which has surprised us, the kind of economics that we're getting. 
We will continue to experiment with how we move IP around. We have a lot of originals now on discovery+, and we have more coming. And we'll be doing that globally, in addition to the local content that we have outside the U.S. 
JB, maybe you could speak to the balance as we look outside the U.S. for discovery+."

I mean look, we are continuing to obviously -- with all our great local content, and we've said it from the beginning, our power outside the U.S. is this combination of great local IP with the universal stories that come from the U.S. pipeline. And so we're continuing to lean into that. We are seeing, obviously, a lot of that great content. People -- and the success we've had to date in the markets, knowing that, obviously, since we launched and started talking about discovery+'s success over the last few months, we've launched in no really new additional markets in the markets we already had. So all that is still to come. 
And in the markets we already have, with the growth we've seen, it's all been an exploitation of the content we are investing in, windowing, in some cases, earlier on discovery+, and then getting a sort of second fun later on either a free-to-air or our pay nets, and in some cases, obviously, some content exclusively on discovery+. And that combination of content mix is working extremely well for us. And it's one that we're continuing to look at the data and the response of the consumer and continuing to modify and adjust as necessary. 
The only other thing I'd say, Dave, to the question also about the 4 minutes of advertising, we obviously market the service as 5. And so we came out with a lower ad load than even what we marketed. We're going to continue to stay at that level for now, but that actually, over time, when we think it's appropriate, which we don't have any plans to do that for the minute, but down the road, we obviously have some flexibility to move above the 4 minutes if we need."

I mean we have so much opportunity without having to fiddle with the consumer experience here, right? As we said, we're already tracking north of $10 ARPU for that headline product. And as you would imagine, there's been a positive trend over the course of the quarter as we have sort of fired up the subscriber base and attracted more advertisers into the product. So there is an underlying positive dynamic. 
But if you just take a step back here, why are we saw excited about this? Number one, we're -- we've ceased to just sell a commercial demo. It's a big difference between the linear TV and our digital platform here. We're selling every single eyeball on discovery+ and TV Everywhere for that matter. 
Number two is we've got a really level playing field here. That big gap between broadcasters and cable CPMs that we've been discussing for and seen for decades here just doesn't exist. It's premium online video, and we're getting full value for our product. Not only that, we have a highly engaged audience. You heard some of the stats that we mentioned that are probably top of the industry. Very family-friendly content environment. 
Couple that with the fact that premium online video inventory is scarce in the first place because a lot of the viewership is happening on ad-free platforms. That drives super high demand and a hot market environment right now. 
The other thing that I want to make -- the other point I want to make here in terms of upside is we're still in the early innings from the perspective of our product offering towards advertisers, right? We have just launched our [ Binge ] advertising product, pause ads. We're working on more. And it's -- in a way, it's part of the prioritization exercise here to get all those features online, but there are a couple of great other ideas. So I do think that we will -- without even playing with the number of minutes here, we will have a pretty positive run rate here for ARPU over the next couple of months."

We have seen -- which we've been seeing actually for years. It's not necessarily a new trend.

And so universe-wise, we feel like it's -- it continues to be fairly stable. There are so -- I mean, again, it's hard to talk about the international markets broad strokes, but there are select markets which are seeing, obviously, more challenges. Brazil has been one where we've seen more of subscriber decline as the middle class there has been hit harder over the last few years. But overall, the universe remains fairly stable. 
And the outlook for it for us continues to be that it will remain pretty stable with, again, some pockets of different markets moving in different directions. But net-net, reasonable stability with some continued churn down from the higher, more broadly packaged tiers down to a slightly lower-priced tiers in some markets. 
And I think as it relates to the Disney news about their shuttering of the Asian channels, look, I think we've obviously leaned in. Not to say we have shut full portfolios of channels, but, as we've talked to you before, selectively in markets where we think the long-term opportunity of what is possible with discovery+ and the ARPUs that Gunnar and David talked to where there's an advantage there, we've leaned into that in select markets like we've talked to you about, in Denmark and other places. And we'll continue to look at that.

And look, I mean, just giving a little more color, as I said before, we have stayed away from giving you very specific guidance to breakeven, et cetera. I continue to be super, super happy with the metrics that we're seeing for d+. And as I said a minute ago, in December, we put out there this 20% margin bogey for sort of the d+ business at scale. That's looking incredibly conservative based on what we're seeing right now. I mean let me just sort of take a step back here. 
We [indiscernible] roll to pay numbers which are top of the industry. Churn rate, and again, I want to be careful here because it's so early days, but the cohort numbers are looking extremely compelling. And we're doing better on ARPU than we originally modeled. 
Take those 3 together, that just leads to a customer lifetime value estimate right now. And I want to be specific, it's still an estimate, but it's significantly better than what we had in mind when we gave that number in December. At the same time, we're acquiring these subs at pretty efficient subscriber acquisition costs. 
In fact, a lot of the loss that we're looking at here for start-up investments in the quarter is essentially -- the vast majority of this is just marketing driven. And you would assume some efficiency as the product becomes -- grows in awareness as we start getting more word of mouth, et cetera, and as we're benefiting from the high retention that we're seeing in our subscriber base. 
So taking all that together, again, it's just too early just to start talking about sort of an updated margin profile for 3, 4, 5 years out, but we feel very, very good about it. 
And to this point about breakeven, again, as we said before, it's not a metric we manage towards. As long as I can acquire subscribers here with phenomenal lifetime values at a fraction of that effect or cost of that lifetime value, we'll do it. 
And we also stand by what we said earlier. I don't think anyone is going to have the margins that we will have in this business. And I think we're going to get there much -- get to breakeven or scale margins much earlier than anyone else just because our fundamental underlying economics are now changing. We're getting the same value from the consumer, and we're getting the same leverage out of our content. We continue to be in super efficient verticals that we're super strong in and that we have 30 years of experience in. 
And we continue to exploit our content across platforms and across the entire globe. And it's amazing to see how this model -- again, it's early days, but how it's working. We're getting phenomenal cross-pollination between our TV Everywhere environment and discovery+. It's great. And we'll just have to -- that's why I decided to give a couple more KPIs, so you can all sort of make up your minds and think about how does it compare to what you're hearing from others. What does the model look like? And we'll just keep giving you some transparency here and take it from there rather than giving you a long-term, 5-year outlook as well."

To your point, we look at AdLite as kind of a breakout hit. Here we are trending right now well over $10. And as we get bigger, it's continuing to grow. And we have this strong demo. So we look at AdLite as something that, as we look at ad free versus AdLite, we've been talking to those customers, and at 4 minutes an hour, they seem very happy. The ad free, they're very happy, but we don't really see a difference. And the ability to generate significant incremental economics off of the AdLite. So you'll see us pushing on AdLite. 
And when -- in the ad free, which was very inexpensive as we were going to be rolling it out outside the U.S., the ability to do an AdLite outside the U.S. -- JB and I, after seeing this data, immediately, 2 months ago, were wow. And so we've been pivoting because there could be upwards of 50% incremental revenue. And as we get to scale more than that by doing the AdLite and you have a very good customer experience, so which was a surprise to us -- we really thought people are used to commercials they're not going to want any.

Fixer Upper, we didn't -- and Chip and Jo, we haven't put anywhere except for discovery+. That was a big helper to us. The BBC content will only be on discovery+. 
We're trying -- we're experimenting with -- we've put a 90-day series on that only went on discovery+, and it drove a lot of subscribers and a lot of viewership. And then those viewers are watching our whole 90-day library with over 150 hours of original on there. So we're trying to -- and then at some point there, we've put that back on, some of that content back. That's what we're trying to figure out right now. 
But we've been able to feed the growth. As Gunnar said, we're seeing some steady and strong growth on discovery+. And we're really focused on growing internationally where JB is taking it out. And internationally, it's a little bit of a different story because we're local in sport. But JB, why don't you talk a little bit about the international piece of that balance?"

And so the exclusivity that you knew exists in scripted, which, for the price tag, you can only do 1 or the other, I think we have a very balanced and smart approach, which is we are -- for franchises and talent that are known to our linear brands, we continue to make sure that we're nurturing those audiences. 
And selectively, and particularly, as David said, we're experimenting in different ways to try and see what the data tells us. We're experimenting with some early windows or pulling a -- having a talent that's been doing stuff on linear do some additional stuff for us on D2C. But it's -- we can do a little bit of both. It's continuing to produce great originals and stories for our traditional [indiscernible] and give people an ability to -- who want to access that and weren't subscribing to it on -- in the bigger bundles access to it on d+ either concurrently or even a bit later in some cases and, at the same time, invest in some originals for discovery+ that are unique, new IP, new faces, new talent, new stories, edgier stories, in some cases, what we could do on linear traditionally and without breaking the bank on content budgets. 
And so it's a really -- it's another strength of our unique content model that doesn't make it such an either/or, and we're continuing to experiment with some of the windows and see what the data tells us."

So the idea would be indeed tempting to say, okay, we have a digital business and a linear business. 
This is not the reality right now and maybe less so for us than for others just because we have that amazing IP exploitation model. One of the big advantages that we have is our ability to take so many bites at the apple across the global footprint and across platforms. So that's why, right now, it is a little hard to really cleanly split out a digital P&L and a linear P&L. And frankly, it's also not entirely in line with how we manage the company because JB and his team are very much looking at international markets in an aggregate basis. And some of the trade-off decisions that we've laid out are very much focusing on trading off linear and digital. 
That being said, we will try to make it as easy as possible for you guys to form a view. And look, by laying out the metrics here for our discovery+ product, by giving you a perspective on losses that we have incurred from launching and by giving you at least a short-term outlook about how we expect those losses to be trending, we're trying to help you model this. 
And as I said earlier, I would assume those start-up losses to start tapering a little bit in the second quarter. Again, I also want to have the flexibility to lean in further if we find other markets are coming online that have a great opportunity to acquire subs at a multiple of their acquisition cost. So we'll need some wiggle room here, but I'm trying to sort of give you an understanding of that financial profile. 
And as I said, I mean, I am focused on long-term, sustainable growth for this company. I think that's what's going to drive shareholder value. And I mean if you just look at guidance here for the second quarter, accelerating U.S. distribution revenues from 12% against the tough comp, double-digit U.S. ad sales growth, 50% international ad sales growth and significant acceleration in international distribution growth to mid-single digits.

Across our operating segments, brands and global markets, I couldn't be prouder of how",1525,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review both our Q1 performance and the meaningful progress we are making since our launch of discovery+. 
Across our operating segments, brands and global markets, I couldn't be prouder of how our company has executed, near flawlessly, responding with creativity, precision and focus across the board while, at the same time, accelerating the pace of innovation throughout our organization as we embrace substantial growth opportunities around the globe.  We continue to reposition the company and put it on a path of sustainable growth for the long term. 
Our ability to generate free cash flow is crucial, allowing us to fully fund our pivot and underscoring the efficiency of our model. Indeed, even during this moment of increased investment, as clearly evidenced in our financials this quarter, our free cash flow machine is working harder than ever, and it is reinforcing an evolving narrative about Discovery's differentiated hand.  
With the strong global launch of discovery+, we are now scaling a very well-received global direct-to-consumer offering that complements our incumbent linear channel presence in every television market around the globe. In Q1, Discovery had the most watched domestic pay-TV portfolio. Internationally, we enjoyed an impressive seventh consecutive quarter of linear share growth, anchored by our 27th straight month of growth in our female genres and best-ever quarterly performances in several markets, including the U.K., France and Germany. This growth was supported by the continued global expansion of our Scripps lifestyle brand and content. We achieved this while simultaneously launching and building discovery+. 
Our continued strategic focus leverages Discovery's powerful competitive advantages, well-established consumer connections in every market in the world, vast local language IP ownership, deep and expanding distribution relationships and a super efficient content production model to power both our global direct-to-consumer expansion and our core linear business. To achieve this, we are investing more than ever before in our content across the board to support these platforms.  
So far in 2021, it is all coalescing and exceeding all of our early benchmarks across almost every KPI. We are pleased to report that just 4 months into our U.S. launch of discovery+ and with the vast majority of our international expansion still ahead of us, we have 15 million total paying subs across our global direct-to-consumer base. And we continue to move forward with strong momentum. 
When I think about our 15 million direct-to-consumer paying subscribers that we have today and the fact that we were able to add 10 million paying subscribers since the end of last year, we're just really impressed with our traction. At the end of Q1, we crossed 13 million paying global net subscribers, representing sub growth that compares quite favorably to our peers over the same period, underscoring the value, appeal and stickiness of our content, all of which supported our conviction about our opportunity ahead. 
But our sub count tells only part of the story. We are equally encouraged by early metrics and KPIs across engagement, churn and monetization and ARPU, particularly in the U.S., which likely place us at the very top of an impressive list of peer offerings, many of whom have had a far longer runway thus far than we have. Roll-to-pay has been between 80% and 85% of pre-trial subs. Engagement is approximately 3 hours per day per viewing subscriber and well ahead of linear. The retention is strong, giving us confidence that while early, monthly churn is trending towards low single digits. 
Consumers clearly love the discovery+ product. We see that on social, in the App Store product ratings and the feedback from partners, clients and talent in the marketplace. Our App Store ratings rank as among the sector's top. Our Apple App Store rating is 4.9 and based on a very large number of reviews. Our strong early KPIs are driving exceptional monetization. Our $4.99 AdLite product, with only 4 minutes of commercial time, generated over $10 of ARPU in the quarter, already well ahead of our longer-term goal. And it's still trending up.
Our overall blended U.S. ARPU of around $7 is already in line with what we generate in linear, and we see healthy momentum for that figure to grow during the course of this year. And on a global blended basis, we are seeing ARPU of over $5. Gunnar will provide some additional detail on metrics and KPIs. But in short, we are working towards a substantive customer lifetime value, particularly as contrasted against the cost to gain a subscriber, encouraging us to lean in from an investment standpoint when it comes to marketing, content and technological capability in order to maximize this meaningful growth opportunity. 
We have an extremely focused approach on all the ways we can be available to the broader swath of users while driving a rich and dynamic user experience. A cornerstone of this will be expanding our partnerships with many of the world's leading distributors and platforms. We recently launched on Comcast Xfinity Flex and soon on X1 and are deepening our relationship with Amazon around the globe with availability on Prime Video Channels in the United States and a global rollout plan for other PVC markets.  
Now let's look at Italy. It's a great example of a market where we see encouraging early signs of the long-term growth potential against which we are executing our strategy, bringing together our market expertise, strong local talent, sticky original content, management resources and relationships, production and technology infrastructure and popular brand and channel presence. 
Like a number of other markets in Europe, Italy is relatively underpenetrated with respect to pay-TV at roughly 20% with really one main distributor. It has significant mobile penetration and usage and where Discovery enjoys a healthy pay and free-to-air presence with depth and local in-language content. And though we have grown our audience share, the existing pay-TV market structure limits the upside from this segment of the ecosystem. 
The launch of discovery+ has catalyzed a new growth trajectory. Our addressable market has grown more than 10x from pay-TV to now include mobile and broadband. discovery+ enables an entry cost for premium video that's 75%-plus more affordable than traditional bundles. And discovery+ ARPU are already more than 3x greater in our wholesale portfolio. This is a powerful combination of potential universe and price growth. 
What we are seeing in Italy guides our thinking on the prospects of what our other international markets could look like. There are significant markets, such as Brazil, Germany and Australia, with similar characteristics and where our ability to offer a direct-to-consumer offering packaged with mobile or multi-platform operators should ultimately result in new customers, higher ARPUs and a deeper, direct connection with our  
[Audio Gap]
Of equal importance is the balance we have been able to strike across our linear and direct-to-consumer businesses. Reflecting on our Q1 performance, which, by many measures, is still facing COVID-related headwinds, I'm proud of our team's ability to manage through difficult operating circumstances. And you will see that in our Q2 outlook. Gunnar will take you through the details, but I'm pleased to note that in every international region, we're seeing positive advertising growth versus 2020 with record shares in Q1 from major markets like U.K., France and Germany. 
We are seeing the great resilience in our advertising business not just internationally but also domestically. This, taken together with very strong scatter pricing in the U.S. and public spending across the globe, give us confidence in our advertising outlook for the balance of the year, especially with the growing discovery+ opportunity. We couldn't be more excited to present to our advertisers at this year's upfronts on May 18, at a time when our brands and programming have never been stronger or more relevant. At the same time, growth in both domestic and international distribution revenues will be boosted by discovery+. 
Net-net, we see a healthy inflection in our revenue trajectory behind the global backdrop of improving underlying advertiser demand and continued share gains, particularly in our international markets. Taking a step back and assessing where we are as a company, I'm extraordinarily optimistic. We've gotten off to a great start with discovery+, exceeding our expectations [indiscernible] and are effectively managing through a dynamic, fluid and exciting a time as I have ever seen in my many years in the media business. 
We are encouraged by the engagement and reception to discovery+ from our consumers, advertisers and distribution partners around the globe, underscoring the strength of our differentiated hand. This is an early tailwind that gives us great confidence as we lean even harder into our pivot. 
Yet, as important as discovery+'s success is to the future prospects of the company, of equivalent importance is our core linear business, the foundation of the company and backbone of our strong free cash flow. As we drive [indiscernible]  long-term, sustainable growth, it is imperative that we nurture both sides of the company as interconnected and supportive to one another.   
Thank you, and I'd like to turn the call over to Gunnar, after which JB, Gunnar and I will take your questions. Thanks so much."

To the exten",1923,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. My aim this morning is to provide a slightly more detailed peek into the operating model as well as our near-term outlook than what we'd more normally do in large part given the recent volatility. To the extent that this has created additional questions and/or concerns, my goal would be to help alleviate as much about it as possible this morning. 
2021 is off to a great start. As David just mentioned and which I'll provide a little more context around, our KPIs, particularly in the U.S., where we launched at the beginning of this year, across engagement, monetization and churn and implied customer lifetime value continue to reinforce our belief that prioritizing investment in discovery+ will generate superior returns on capital.  
As noted, engagement is truly stellar with viewing subs watching roughly 3 hours of content per day, well ahead of linear, and nationally an underlying contributor to both retention and monetization. 
And retention is indeed looking very encouraging with churn coming in quite a bit lower than we had initially anticipated. While it is still too early to evaluate a stable monthly churn rate, the retention curves of our first subscriber cohorts are looking very encouraging. Based on these early observations, we expect churn to trend towards low single digits over the course of the next 12 months.  
Turning to monetization, which is also well ahead of plan. Blended ARPU for discovery+ in the U.S. is already in line with our $7 linear [indiscernible]   owing to the strong monetization of the AdLite product where ARPU has already exceeded $10 in the first quarter. Clearly, strong engagement and watch time, despite offering only a 4-minute ad load, are lending themselves to healthy advertiser demand and, in turn, exceptional CPMs. Still early days, though we see a notable path for further monetization as we continue to scale and drive additional engagement, attract additional advertisers and brands and roll out new advertising products.  
Global ARPU is over $5 already, with international ARPU, as expected, below that of the the U.S. This is in part due to market price points and in part because we are launching with the greater share of our subscribers coming through promotional partnerships, which drive faster adoption and marketing efficiency but also come at an initially lower ARPU. That being said, we are, in virtually all cases, seeing ARPUs that are multiples with that of the existing wholesale linear pay-TV [ feeds ] at which we currently monetize [indiscernible]. This, of course, is a core tenet of our international discovery+ strategy and a great objective testament to the quality and value of our content in a marketplace not limited by the boundaries of a traditional pay-TV ecosystem.  
Taking these metrics together, we are modeling a much more substantive estimate of customer lifetime value, while subscriber acquisition cost is currently running at a very healthy cushion to that [indiscernible]. Based on these trends, we're increasingly more confident with our outer year projections and our target margin profile of 20% at scale. While it's still too early to formally update this number, we believe there is meaningful upside to the target based on all these initial indicators trending above our business case assumptions.  
During the first quarter, next-generation revenues increased 52% year-over-year. And we look to build upon this momentum in Q2 with next-generation revenues set to more than double yearly driven by both volume of subs and monetization efforts. 
We did invest heavily in marketing spend in the first quarter to support the U.S. launch of discovery+ and rebranding and [ deep-playing ] in key international markets, a sizable portion of which was dedicated to upper-funnel brand marketing to build awareness as well as bottom-up the funnel performance marketing. This accounted for the vast majority of the year-over-year increase in OpEx alongside content and tech spend. 
In the aggregate, next-gen OIBDA losses were roughly $400 million in the first quarter. We expect a modest sequential improvement in next-gen losses in Q2 as continued substantial marketing efforts to roll out additional territories and requisite content and tech spend will begin to be offset by more material revenue contributions. Also, we expect to better optimize and refine marketing spend as we gain additional insights. 
Quarter-to-quarter losses and quite possibly what ultimately falls into 2021 versus 2022 is still subject to a number of moving pieces. And we will obviously provide as much transparency as possible ahead of such movements, particularly as impacted by rollout plans around the Olympic Games, planned technology spend and platform integrations as determined by specific partners. That said, we continue to remain confident that 2021 will represent the peak year for losses from our investment initiatives. 
Of course, we are as mindful as ever about the magnitude of these expenses and their impact on our financials. Yet, we are reassured by the compelling return metrics against this spend. 
Now turning to the segments. In the U.S., advertising finished down 4% during the first quarter in large part due to universe estimates and sub level declines, which ultimately translated into lower impressions across the industry and our networks. 
That said, we continued to outperform our pay-TV network peers on share during the quarter. Moreover, pricing remained robust, scatter CPMs developing strongly during Q1 and expected to be up around 30% year-over-year with roughly 50% premium versus upfront in Q2. In fact, total dollar volume for Q2 scatter will be up considerably versus last year as we see categories, such as auto and travel, coming back as well as from the influx of B2C companies, including many new TV advertisers. 
discovery+ had started 
[Audio Gap] 
to advertising revenue in Q1 as subscribers grew throughout the quarter, and we expect an increasing tailwind from this component through Q2. As such, we expect U.S. advertising revenue to grow in the low double-digit range in the future, helped in part by COVID comps, strong pricing and advertiser demand across the pay-TV business. 
U.S. distribution revenues were up 12% during the quarter, at the high end of our expectations. Mid-single-digit linear distribution revenue growth continued to be supported by contractual affiliate fee increases, partially offset by pay-TV subscriber decline. Subscribers to our fully distributed linear networks declined by 2%, while our total pay-TV subscribers declined by 4%, likely top-of-peer performance, helped by additional network carriage [indiscernible] affiliate renewals and continuing share gains at virtual MVPDs where we remain very well canvassed across all key platforms. 
In addition to our healthy traditional affiliate business, the launch of discovery+ and the subsequent ramp-up of subscribers accounted for much of the sequential acceleration in distribution revenue growth. During Q2, we expect reported distribution revenue growth will accelerate further, even against a much tougher comparison given the significant onetime benefit recognized last year, implying a significant acceleration on an underlying basis, supported by similar drivers as in Q1. 
Turning to international networks, which I will discuss, as always, on a constant currency basis. Advertising grew 8% during the first quarter as all international regions, EMEA, LatAm and APAC, returned to growth, a first since the start of the COVID pandemic. Latin America developed positively driven by Brazil and Mexico. And despite intermittent lockdowns in certain EMEA markets, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the region due to continuing share gains in key markets like the U.K., Spain and France. Finally, APAC was also up significantly during the quarter. 
In Q2, as we comped the substantial declines faced by the advertising industry last year during the initial stages of the COVID pandemic, we expect international advertising revenue growth to exceed 50%. 
International distribution revenue was down 2% in Q1 due to lower linear pricing in certain European markets, partially offset by our growing discovery+ subscriber base. We expect international distribution revenue to accelerate to mid-single-digit growth during the second quarter driven by the same factors. 
As we called out in prior quarters, as we repositioned a number of key international distribution partnerships towards a hybrid-type structure, we've opted to trade nearer-term upside on the linear portfolio for greater
[Audio Gap]
in terms of [ support ] for our D2C efforts. Segment performance has already reflected some of the impact of this over the last 2 quarters. 
Turning to the expense side. Total operating expenses for the consolidated company were up 21% during the quarter. 
Cost of revenues were up 2% largely due to the continued ramp in content investment to support our next-generation initiatives and the timing of sports content in Europe, partially offset by more efficient content spend limits. 
SG&A increased 48% to reflect marketing and branding as well as personnel and technology spend to support our next-generation initiatives. As we guided previously, we continue to target low to mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our core linear business offerings.
Turning to free cash flow. We produced Q1 free cash flow of $179 million with an AOIBDA-to-free cash flow conversion rate similar to the prior year quarter. We remain confident and reassured in our ability to financially support all of our strategic endeavors as we continue to convert AOIBDA at a highly efficient rate despite the initially significant ramp in our investments. 
We did not buy back any shares during the quarter. As I noted earlier, we continue to view investments in discovery+ as the best fundamental use of our free cash flow in order to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value. Further, for the next few quarters, we also want to maintain an appropriate amount of financial cushion since the cadence of our global discovery+ rollout remains fluid, both in terms of where and when we launch and the level of investment required to penetrate specific markets. 
And while we are investing against a rigorous financial framework, bear in mind that we're gearing up for 2 sets of Olympic Games this summer and in Q1 next year, both of which will be tent-pole events for the marketing of our D2C and linear brand. We will, of course, continue to update you on our views on capital allocation as we proceed. 
We
[Audio Gap]
quarter at approximately 3.5x net leverage and, needless to say, remain fully committed to our investment-grade rating. 
Turning to a couple of housekeeping items. Number one, as you may have noticed, we are no longer disclosing adjusted EPS as AOIBDA and free cash flow continue to be the key financial metrics in evaluating our operating performance. I will, however, provide you with the PPA impact each quarter as well as point out key noteworthy items to help calculate an adjusted EPS number to the extent helpful. For the first quarter, PPA was $0.32 per share. 
Number two, we expect FX to have roughly a positive $40 million year-over-year impact on revenues and around a negative $25 million year-over-year impact in AOIBDA in 2021, reflecting the strengthening of the dollar and sterling since the start of the year. 
We are operating on strong footing, evidenced by a rapidly growing direct-to-consumer business and the resilient core linear business. And our ability to convert AOIBDA to free cash flow where I continue to see at least 50% this year has never been more valuable given reinvestment demands. We have a self-funded business aimed at supporting an immense global direct-to-consumer opportunity.  We couldn't be more excited as a management team to focus on continuing to deliver solid operating performance while we build the framework to support long-term, sustainable growth and shareholder value. 
I'd like to turn it over to the operator to start taking questions."

So let me take -- let me start with that last question. The -- we're super excited about the upcoming launches here. As you have seen in our numbers, if you do the math, we've been adding about 1.5 million subscribers on a monthly basis over the past 2 months here. And I do want to point out that these numbers are going to be moving around a little, but the Comcast launch is going to be one very positive event. 
And to answer your question, I do think there is a significant incremental impact. That's what we've seen with other deals coming online after launch. So that should be a positive. 
And we also look at other events happening internationally over the next couple of months that are -- that could further support the subscriber growth here, most importantly, obviously, the Olympics coming in internationally. And so that's for the subscriber trend here. 
To your other question on the U.S. affiliate side, again, as I just laid out, we're super happy with what we're seeing for distribution across the entire ecosystem here, clearly seeing very healthy and accelerating the contributions from discovery+ and our D2C efforts overall. But we're also looking at a very healthy underlying trend in the core business. You saw the linear subscriber numbers, which have again been a little better than maybe over the average of the past 18 months or so, with only 2% down in our -- for our core networks. And as I said, we've continued to enjoy roughly mid-single-digit growth here in the linear part of the ecosystem, yes. 
The -- your question about renewals and impact of discovery+, look, as I said, we are continuing to get fee increases. That's one of the reasons we have been able to continue the growth that we have delivered in the fourth quarter, now in the first quarter. And we have been seeing very positive discussions for the past renewals and for upcoming renewals as well. As you have heard, clearly, discovery+ is an argument in those discussions, but it's one of many. And to me, it comes back to just the rationale, cool look at what the economics are, and we are delivering close to 20% of viewership for our affiliates. 
We're a great partner. We're leaning in with investments. This company is investing as much in content as never before this year. And we're doing that, and we're making that available to our affiliates at a very, very competitive rate. And so again, I don't want to make any predictions here on individual renewals, but those are constructive discussions, and we feel that we're in a very good position."

They're able to create value for us and for them by -- and I think they have some real entitlement. They're a broadband leader. And these channel stores have really developed. And Comcast is looking. And between Flex and X1, it could be a real generator of value for both of us. 
And as Gunnar said, the share of our traditional channels are going up. They're selling those channels. The cost of those channels are very low, and we're probably the best actor in that space in that we're providing the core value of the bundle.

But what I did say a little earlier is the -- some color on the second quarter, and let me maybe elaborate on that. 
So again, we delivered 12% in Q1, and I expect an acceleration off of this number. I'm not getting more specific here because, to some extent, it is going to depend on the cadence of subscriber additions on the D2C side because, as I said, that's flowing through now very significantly on the revenue side. 
But if you keep in mind, last year in Q2, we had a very sizable one-off item. So that's going to work against us here. And when I say acceleration from the 12%, I mean despite that one-off. So on an underlying basis, we'll see. This may be an underlying high single-digit growth quarter, which is going to come through as a -- sorry, high teens, high-teens growth quarter, which is going to come through as an acceleration against the 12%, yes."

I think number two, upfront looks like up 15% to 20% for CPMs year-over-year. It's early. We've got a ways to go, but the setup looks very, very strong. Any thoughts for Discovery and comments on that? And if I could tag on; I have a quick one. Ad load at 4 minutes. When does that start increasing?

On the upfront, look, I don't know that I've seen 50% increases in CPMs off of a prior year upfront before. The CPMs are very high.

On the upfront, look, I don't know that I've seen 50% increases in CPMs off of a prior year upfront before. The CPMs are very high. But what we really have an advantage of is that the broadcasters have been getting $60-plus, and we've been getting less than half that. And now, all of a sudden, instead of [indiscernible], we're booking a -- we're really making progress in booking significant dollars in the $40s, high $40s, even $50. And part of that has to do with the fact that our share is going up. We have some hit shows, whether it be mail on Discovery or whether it be shows like 90 Day Fiance, which is the #1 show on television, and we've started to get paid a lot more money for that. 
And so I think you will see the -- our CPMs, I think, meaningfully better because we have a lot of headroom still to drive our CPM versus competitors that are -- that have been at a very high level. So I think we hit this upfront at a very good moment. 
In addition, we have now some scale inventory on discovery+ which is selling very well. And in the -- in that environment then on GO, we don't have the disadvantage of -- it's a -- a viewer is a viewer. So we don't have that inherent disadvantage versus the broadcasters. So we're getting paid on every sub. 
And we also have a very good demographic which is generating dramatically higher CPMs than we're seeing in traditional. 
So overall, I think the advertising market, very, very strong. Upfront coming up, feeling good about it. 
In terms of balancing, the idea that we have viewing subs on discovery+ spending over 3 hours and that we have the highest ratings and that our churn is extremely low is telling us a lot about the quality of this product. But what's really interesting is that the top shows, our top original shows and top shows from our channels, are only generating about 10% of the viewership. We have a very long-tail library about the size of Netflix, and people are spending a lot of time with it. 
And a lot of times -- so we don't have like the one -- we don't have the one-hit show or the one-hit movie. But I think as a result of that, we're seeing much lower churn than our peers' and usage that is a lot more, and that's generating real economics for us on the advertising side, which has surprised us, the kind of economics that we're getting. 
We will continue to experiment with how we move IP around. We have a lot of originals now on discovery+, and we have more coming. And we'll be doing that globally, in addition to the local content that we have outside the U.S. 
JB, maybe you could speak to the balance as we look outside the U.S. for discovery+."

I mean look, we are continuing to obviously -- with all our great local content, and we've said it from the beginning, our power outside the U.S. is this combination of great local IP with the universal stories that come from the U.S. pipeline. And so we're continuing to lean into that. We are seeing, obviously, a lot of that great content. People -- and the success we've had to date in the markets, knowing that, obviously, since we launched and started talking about discovery+'s success over the last few months, we've launched in no really new additional markets in the markets we already had. So all that is still to come. 
And in the markets we already have, with the growth we've seen, it's all been an exploitation of the content we are investing in, windowing, in some cases, earlier on discovery+, and then getting a sort of second fun later on either a free-to-air or our pay nets, and in some cases, obviously, some content exclusively on discovery+. And that combination of content mix is working extremely well for us. And it's one that we're continuing to look at the data and the response of the consumer and continuing to modify and adjust as necessary. 
The only other thing I'd say, Dave, to the question also about the 4 minutes of advertising, we obviously market the service as 5. And so we came out with a lower ad load than even what we marketed. We're going to continue to stay at that level for now, but that actually, over time, when we think it's appropriate, which we don't have any plans to do that for the minute, but down the road, we obviously have some flexibility to move above the 4 minutes if we need."

And as you would imagine, there's been a positive trend over the course of the quarter as we have sort of fired up the subscriber base and attracted more advertisers into the product. So there is an underlying positive dynamic. 
But if you just take a step back here, why are we saw excited about this? Number one, we're -- we've ceased to just sell a commercial demo. It's a big difference between the linear TV and our digital platform here. We're selling every single eyeball on discovery+ and TV Everywhere for that matter. 
Number two is we've got a really level playing field here. That big gap between broadcasters and cable CPMs that we've been discussing for and seen for decades here just doesn't exist. It's premium online video, and we're getting full value for our product. Not only that, we have a highly engaged audience. You heard some of the stats that we mentioned that are probably top of the industry. Very family-friendly content environment. 
Couple that with the fact that premium online video inventory is scarce in the first place because a lot of the viewership is happening on ad-free platforms. That drives super high demand and a hot market environment right now. 
The other thing that I want to make -- the other point I want to make here in terms of upside is we're still in the early innings from the perspective of our product offering towards advertisers, right? We have just launched our [ Binge ] advertising product, pause ads. We're working on more. And it's -- in a way, it's part of the prioritization exercise here to get all those features online, but there are a couple of great other ideas. So I do think that we will -- without even playing with the number of minutes here, we will have a pretty positive run rate here for ARPU over the next couple of months."

And so universe-wise, we feel like it's -- it continues to be fairly stable. There are so -- I mean, again, it's hard to talk about the international markets broad strokes, but there are select markets which are seeing, obviously, more challenges.

But net-net, reasonable stability with some continued churn down from the higher, more broadly packaged tiers down to a slightly lower-priced tiers in some markets. 
And I think as it relates to the Disney news about their shuttering of the Asian channels, look, I think we've obviously leaned in.

Looking ahead, though, the DTC losses ease. Olympics losses get better in 2022 and then in 2023. And of course, hopefully, through all this, we'll hopefully see a recovery in linear ad trends and revenue as well.

And look, I mean, just giving a little more color, as I said before, we have stayed away from giving you very specific guidance to breakeven, et cetera. I continue to be super, super happy with the metrics that we're seeing for d+. And as I said a minute ago, in December, we put out there this 20% margin bogey for sort of the d+ business at scale. That's looking incredibly conservative based on what we're seeing right now. I mean let me just sort of take a step back here. 
We [indiscernible] roll to pay numbers which are top of the industry. Churn rate, and again, I want to be careful here because it's so early days, but the cohort numbers are looking extremely compelling. And we're doing better on ARPU than we originally modeled. 
Take those 3 together, that just leads to a customer lifetime value estimate right now. And I want to be specific, it's still an estimate, but it's significantly better than what we had in mind when we gave that number in December. At the same time, we're acquiring these subs at pretty efficient subscriber acquisition costs. 
In fact, a lot of the loss that we're looking at here for start-up investments in the quarter is essentially -- the vast majority of this is just marketing driven. And you would assume some efficiency as the product becomes -- grows in awareness as we start getting more word of mouth, et cetera, and as we're benefiting from the high retention that we're seeing in our subscriber base. 
So taking all that together, again, it's just too early just to start talking about sort of an updated margin profile for 3, 4, 5 years out, but we feel very, very good about it. 
And to this point about breakeven, again, as we said before, it's not a metric we manage towards. As long as I can acquire subscribers here with phenomenal lifetime values at a fraction of that effect or cost of that lifetime value, we'll do it. 
And we also stand by what we said earlier. I don't think anyone is going to have the margins that we will have in this business. And I think we're going to get there much -- get to breakeven or scale margins much earlier than anyone else just because our fundamental underlying economics are now changing. We're getting the same value from the consumer, and we're getting the same leverage out of our content. We continue to be in super efficient verticals that we're super strong in and that we have 30 years of experience in. 
And we continue to exploit our content across platforms and across the entire globe. And it's amazing to see how this model -- again, it's early days, but how it's working. We're getting phenomenal cross-pollination between our TV Everywhere environment and discovery+. It's great. And we'll just have to -- that's why I decided to give a couple more KPIs, so you can all sort of make up your minds and think about how does it compare to what you're hearing from others. What does the model look like? And we'll just keep giving you some transparency here and take it from there rather than giving you a long-term, 5-year outlook as well."

And the advertisers are -- and also, with the length of view so high and the engagement so high, we've been doing extremely well. 
To your point, we look at AdLite as kind of a breakout hit. Here we are trending right now well over $10. And as we get bigger, it's continuing to grow. And we have this strong demo. So we look at AdLite as something that, as we look at ad free versus AdLite, we've been talking to those customers, and at 4 minutes an hour, they seem very happy. The ad free, they're very happy, but we don't really see a difference. And the ability to generate significant incremental economics off of the AdLite. So you'll see us pushing on AdLite. 
And when -- in the ad free, which was very inexpensive as we were going to be rolling it out outside the U.S., the ability to do an AdLite outside the U.S. -- JB and I, after seeing this data, immediately, 2 months ago, were wow. And so we've been pivoting because there could be upwards of 50% incremental revenue. And as we get to scale more than that by doing the AdLite and you have a very good customer experience, so which was a surprise to us -- we really thought people are used to commercials they're not going to want any. But it's one of the reasons we're not going to 5. They're so happy with the 4, and we're getting such a premium for it. And it's working so well we're just going to ride it."

So the idea would be indeed tempting to say, okay, we have a digital business and a linear business. 
This is not the reality right now and maybe less so for us than for others just because we have that amazing IP exploitation model. One of the big advantages that we have is our ability to take so many bites at the apple across the global footprint and across platforms. So that's why, right now, it is a little hard to really cleanly split out a digital P&L and a linear P&L. And frankly, it's also not entirely in line with how we manage the company because JB and his team are very much looking at international markets in an aggregate basis. And some of the trade-off decisions that we've laid out are very much focusing on trading off linear and digital. 
That being said, we will try to make it as easy as possible for you guys to form a view. And look, by laying out the metrics here for our discovery+ product, by giving you a perspective on losses that we have incurred from launching and by giving you at least a short-term outlook about how we expect those losses to be trending, we're trying to help you model this. 
And as I said earlier, I would assume those start-up losses to start tapering a little bit in the second quarter. Again, I also want to have the flexibility to lean in further if we find other markets are coming online that have a great opportunity to acquire subs at a multiple of their acquisition cost. So we'll need some wiggle room here, but I'm trying to sort of give you an understanding of that financial profile. 
And as I said, I mean, I am focused on long-term, sustainable growth for this company. I think that's what's going to drive shareholder value. And I mean if you just look at guidance here for the second quarter, accelerating U.S. distribution revenues from 12% against the tough comp, double-digit U.S. ad sales growth, 50% international ad sales growth and significant acceleration in international distribution growth to mid-single digits. I think, again, it's early days, but I would say it's working."

Discovery continues to deliver strong operating and financial performance, driven by healthy momentum across all our key segments, beginning with our core linear",953,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. 
Discovery continues to deliver strong operating and financial performance, driven by healthy momentum across all our key segments, beginning with our core linear business, which continues to accelerate sequentially, underscoring the durability of our content categories and the overall strength of our brands, while simultaneously scaling our global streaming offerings, most importantly, Discovery Plus, which continues to have strong traction, underpinning total next-generation revenue growth of 130% year-over-year and 17 million total global paying direct-to-consumer subscribers at the end of the second quarter, and 18 million as of today, with momentum around the globe, most notably behind the strength of the Olympics, which we've launched on Discovery Plus in Europe in a number of markets. [Audio Gap]
and social was robust. Advertisers continue to look for incremental reach beyond linear. And with roughly half of the audience base for Discovery Plus being noncable households, the platform is hugely attractive to buyers. We look forward to additional product features and offerings to roll out throughout the year to drive further monetization. But what we are currently seeing is noteworthy. Advertisers are buying targeting capabilities of our platform, with innovative and intelligent solutions and healthy premiums to traditional linear. Internationally, advertising has also come back in a big way, driven by a number of key markets, such as the U.K., Italy, Germany, Poland, as well as a number of Lat Am and APAC markets that resulted in all regions around the globe, turning in an acceleration and traction throughout the quarter. 
Turning to Discovery Plus. We are really pleased with the cadence and monetization of the service, supported by continued subscriber traction and healthy ARPU, notwithstanding the seasonally slower summer period, only exacerbated by the post-COVID reopening. That said, we had healthy sequential improvement in paid subs quarter-over-quarter, with most of Discovery Plus international runway still ahead. Here in the U.S., we continue to add to our distribution and platform footprint. Following last quarter's launch with Comcast, in the coming months, Discovery Plus will also be available to Cop subscribers across their Contour TV and Contour streamer platforms. Discovery Plus will also shortly be available on VIZIO SmartCast, advancing our rollout to all major consumer platforms. 
As we've noted previously, the bulk of the 2021 Discovery international market launches would be in the second half of this year, with key market launches such as Brazil, Canada and the Philippines to come in the second half of the year. 
Vodafone successfully launched in July in the U.K. market for mobile customers. And we expect additional markets such as Spain, the Netherlands and Italy to launch as planned following the migration of our front-end technology to our common global platform this fall. 
J.B. and his team have been deliberate and methodical in managing our international rollout to ensure the best consumer experience. This includes ensuring we have strong integrations with local partners and completing a major replatforming to get both our front-end and back-end technologies on one common platform. It is a complicated road map of engineering and commercial logistics, not to mention COVID challenges around the globe in some of our tech hubs, at the same time that we have been planning, producing and delivering the Olympic Games from Tokyo. 
We continue to learn a lot as we go, in terms of what's working and what's not, with respect to marketing, branding, tech product and features, as well as distribution partners and platforms. We are very pleased with the metrics we look at to evaluate our position within the marketplace, consumer acceptance, role to pay, viewing time for active subscriber churn, monetization and so on. 
We provided an early glimpse across these metrics last quarter, and I'm pleased that we continue to track well against our internal plans. And the momentum we are building as we look ahead to our exciting plans post merger with WarnerMedia and HBO. 
Taken together, we could not be more excited about the possibilities ahead to serve consumers with the deepest and most compelling content offering in the world. Consumers want choice and simplicity. We believe that the combined company will be able to offer more of both. In a video market that could see more consumer selectivity as the market stores, we believe the combined company will be well positioned to compete in the global streaming marketplace. The regulatory process continues to move forward as planned, giving us confidence in our previously stated time frame of mid-next year to close. 
And lastly, the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which, as I noted earlier, has been a very pleasant surprise during what can only be described as challenging circumstances. At this point, about halfway through, we've already doubled our total sub gains from the last Olympic Games in Pyong Chang, with nearly 0.75 billion minutes of Olympic content streamed, up over 18x versus the last games. 
Like with the Winter Games, we've enjoyed some truly remarkable viewing shares in key markets, like the Nordics, in which our share of television viewing for certain sports has been upwards of 60% to 80%, and with outstanding traction with streaming across all markets, notably in the U.K. and Italy, which are newly launched markets for Discovery Plus. We are very excited about the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing in early 2022, and then, of course, Paris in 2024, right in our backyard. These are truly hallmark, high-value branding events, and are super funnels that drive awareness, viewing and subscribers to our platforms. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Gunnar to take you through our financials.  After which, Gunnar, JB and I look forward to taking your questions."

Echoing David's comments, I am very pleased with our operating performance this quarter, in which both our traditional core linear busines",1764,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. 
Echoing David's comments, I am very pleased with our operating performance this quarter, in which both our traditional core linear business alongside our next-generation streaming platforms combined to deliver very healthy revenue growth and impressive AOIBDA and free cash flow conversion. 
While comparisons against last year's advertising performance were very favorable, we are especially encouraged by the acceleration and sequential improvements we've enjoyed from every region around the globe and returned to near pre-pandemic levels. The U.S. Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific all turned in impressive results. And of course, Discovery Plus is providing a nice tailwind to our performance. 
Turning to second quarter results, beginning with the U.S. segment. 
Advertising revenues increased 12% year-over-year as we continued to take advantage of a very robust advertising market for both linear and digital inventory. We saw strong demand in all key categories, including CPG, pharma, cosmetics, auto, retail and home improvement, far more than offsetting the software viewership across the industry as compared to the peak COVID Q2 of last year. Scatter CPMs were up 50% plus versus last year's [indiscernible] and up more than 30% year-over-year. Additionally, next-generation advertising demand was very healthy across our suite of products, with revenues up 70% year-over-year. Specifically for Discovery Plus, more than 800 advertisers have now bought inventory on the platform, more than 4x the number of advertisers that we had targeted by the end of the second quarter. Interestingly, more than 90% of all clients who have bought inventory on Discovery Plus also bought inventory at our Go and TV Everyware offering, underscoring the power of integrated audience solutions across our suite of digital products. 
Furthermore, we continued to roll out new ad products on Discovery Plus. For example, we recently launched GreenLight, an ad product that allows clients to own the first ad served to every user on Discovery Plus on a specific day. 
As noted earlier, the strength of the upfront market underpins the continued relevance and importance of television as an advertising medium, contributing to greater confidence in our ability to drive top line advertising revenue growth. 
While we faced comparisons against political advertising in the second half of the year and some modest headwinds from the Olympics here in the U.S. in Q3, layering in the tailwind from this upfront, we should enjoy sequentially faster revenue growth in Q4 over Q3. 
Distribution revenues grew 12% year-over-year on a reported basis or 18% like-for-like, primarily driven by continued traction and monetization of the Discovery Plus subscriber base, helped by linear affiliate pricing, offsetting the year-over-year decline in pay TV subscribers. Subscribers to our fully distributed networks were down 3% during the quarter, while total portfolio of subscribers were down 7%. However, recall that we sold Great American Country during the quarter. When adjusted for the sale, total portfolio subscribers would have been down 3% year-over-year during the quarter, as we continued to benefit from specific distribution gains across certain networks from recent renewals. We will begin lapping those renewals in the coming months. And you should expect to see our linear subscriber trends more in line with the industry going forward, as we have discussed prior. Worth noting also is that the sale of GAC did result in a modest headwind to both reported advertising and distribution revenue this quarter as we did not recognize any contribution for. 
Turning to the International segment, which I will, as always, discuss on an ex FX basis. Advertising revenues increased 70% year-over-year as we saw significant growth off the second quarter last year. We saw a strong revenue growth across all regions, with the pace accelerating throughout the quarter, with a number of key markets nicely above 2019, as David mentioned. Distribution revenues increased 6% versus the prior year, supported primarily by direct-to-consumer subscriber growth. Though as noted, there were no material new market launches during the quarter. This was partially offset by lower linear affiliate rates in certain European markets. 
Total company operating expenses increased 33% during the quarter. Cost of revenues increased 25% year-over-year, as sports returned to a more normalized schedule this year versus virtually no sports last year due to COVID related shutdowns as well as the continuing investment in B2C content. 
SG&A increased 43% versus the prior year as we invested in marketing and personnel to support our Discovery Plus rollout. We continue to focus on driving efficiency in our core linear networks, and we remain on track to reduce core linear OpEx in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range for the year. 
As we guided, we reduced our losses from investment projects significantly in the second quarter to roughly $250 million versus more than $400 million in the first quarter, benefiting from both strong next-generation revenue growth as well as more efficient marketing spend, primarily in the U.S. 
Q2 next-generation revenue growth of 130% is annualizing at a $1.6 billion run rate. And we expect additional sequential quarterly revenue growth for the year and beyond. As we launch new markets during the second half of the year, we expect that we will continue to incur investment losses, though more or less in the same ballpark as this past quarter, mainly driven by content and marketing costs. We continue to expect that investment losses will peak this year. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with all of the core KPIs we closely monitor, and we continue to track well against our internal plans. 
Global direct-to-consumer ARPU remains consistent with Q1, as the impact of certain international distribution partnerships and associated early promotional activity is offset by our strong and growing U.S. ARPU, which is nicely supported by the AdLite Discovery Plus product. 
Roll to pay still remains high at an average of close to 80% across the global DTC portfolio, as average engagement per viewing subscriber, which is more or less in line with what we saw last quarter. As well, we remain pleased with overall churn, which naturally is at the lower end for the most mature subscriber cohorts and skews higher for the most recent one. 
As I noted, the vast majority of our international Discovery Plus [ growth ] thus far has come from existing markets. And we plan to launch in a number of key markets and territories during the second half of this year, including Brazil, Canada and the Philippines, alongside additional Vodafone markets in Italy, the Netherlands and Spain around the end of the year. 
It is worth highlighting that a handful of these market launches have been extended out about a quarter or so later than our original internal plans call for, primarily resulting from the requisite harmonization of our technology platforms, the added benefit of which will enable us to roll out an international AddLife product. This has been a heavy lift, particularly given team constraints related to COVID in our tech hubs, primarily in India. Other puts and takes to consider will be our ability to maintain and keep subscribers that come in during the Olympic Games, though the initial role to pay numbers look very encouraging. At net, we remain very excited about our local go-to-market strategies across these important countries through the end of the year. 
Turning to housekeeping items. 
Net income for the quarter was $672 million or $1.01 per share on a diluted basis. 
First, please note, we recognized a $0.09 per share gain on the sale of Great American Country as well as a $0.09 per share noncash gain on an existing investment in Sharecare, the company that recently went public. 
Second, our effective tax rate during the quarter was negligible, as we recognized certain noncash tax benefits totaling $162 million or $0.24 per share. Given these tax benefits, we now expect the full year effective book tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. For cash taxes, we are now anticipating a slightly higher rate, in the high 20% range for the year, excluding PPA amortization, as we are positioning our tax footprint for optimal outcomes across a number of legislative scenarios for '22 and beyond. Third, and finally, the PPA impact was $0.30 per share. 
Adjusted for the above, EPS would have been $0.89 per diluted share. 
Now turning to free cash flow and our leverage. 
We generated $757 million of free cash flow in the quarter, representing a near 70% conversion rate of AOIBDA, notwithstanding the continued investments we are making as well as the return to normalized content production levels. Year-to-date, our AOIBDA to free cash flow conversion rate is nearly 50%, and we remain confident that we will convert at least 50% of our AOIBDA for free cash flow this year, even with the anticipated new market launches and slightly higher cash taxes mentioned earlier. 
At the end of the quarter, our net leverage was 3.25x, which is within our current target range. We expect our net leverage could be temporarily at the high end of our target range due to the Olympics in the current quarter. As a reminder, we do expect to recognize the $175 million to $200 million of AOIBDA losses during the third quarter as a result of the Olympics, though we continue to expect that we will break even or generate slightly positive AOIBDA and free cash flow over the life of the deal. 
As indicated when we announced our transaction with WarnerMedia, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter as we continued to invest in our next-generation initiatives and conserve cash ahead of the closing of the deal. 
And finally, we now expect FX to have roughly a positive $100 million year-over-year impact on revenue and a negative $20 million impact on AOIBDA in 2021. 
We continue to operate on solid footing, dynamically growing our direct-to-consumer business, with contributions to our top line growth becoming increasingly meaningful and optimizing the resilient core linear business, creating strong conversion of AOIBDA to free cash flow. 
We remain focused on delivering solid operating performance while we built the framework to support long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value. And we are eager and excited once we gain all the reposit approvals to roll up our sleeves to capture the tremendous opportunities offered by our proposed merger with WarnerMedia. And of course, we look forward to speaking with you at the appropriate time on our thoughts and plans around integration, strategic direction, synergy, et cetera. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator to take your questions."

And so we feel good about that. 
I think as Gunnar touched on in his comments, we are -- these are sort of leaning towards more sort of September and into the fourth quarter, where we had hoped, obviously, to be [ studied ] more ahead of that into the third quarter. But due to obviously wanting to make sure we got the Olympic Games off the ground successfully and getting this replatforming completed, some of that will hit a little bit later in the second half of the year than we initially thought. 
And in that time period, I think we do see internationally some -- obviously, we're expecting significantly more growth coming out of those new market launches as we get towards the back half of the year. 
As it relates to '22, I think it's a little bit early to talk about that. The only comment, which David and Gunnar may amplify, is, obviously, as we get later into 2022 and we get further visibility on the timing of the WarnerMedia deal, we obviously will look at making sure we stay smart in the context of when that timing and when that deal might close as to how we maximize the rollout schedule of those services into 2022.

And all of our -- the entire Olympics was offered throughout Europe on our product. People are spending a huge amount of time, as you've seen it, 18x what it was before in for PanCan. It was very simple. The navigation was simple. We spent a lot of time making sure we get the product right. That's going to help us. But we're also, as I've said, we're learning. One of the things that we're -- that we've learned along the way is navigation and simplicity is very important for people to be able to find the products that they want, particularly with the complicated product like the Olympics, and it's really working. We'll have Beijing coming up in a few months. It's very unusual that we get a back-to-back like that. So we think that we can do better in terms of keeping subs and growing subs because we don't have a 2-year lag between the 2 games, which is advantageous. 
The other thing that we're learning as we look to roll out outside the U.S. is that AdLite is a really compelling product. we're generating about $6 in advertising per subscriber here in the U.S. with 3 minutes of advertising. And the friction for users is nonexistent, when they used to seeing 14, 18 minutes to C3. And so there may be a real strategic opportunity for us here. We're doing extremely well in packaging that product together with linear, together with AVOD here in the U.S. And so whereas a year ago, we thought everything would just be subscription, we're looking at AVOD as a meaningful opportunity to go into markets at a lower price, get more scale and be able to pick up actually more money. We're making more money on our AdLite product by an awful lot here in the U.S. And so doing that requires more engineering, more coding, but we want to get it right. And as JB said, as we get closer to the Warner Bros. Discovery to our transaction, we'll continue to look -- right now, we're both accelerating. And Warner is doing a terrific job, John Stankey and Anne and Jason. If you take a look at -- and Casey. You take a look at the momentum that they have, they're driving hard. We're driving hard. And then we'll true up together. At some point, we really do have our strategy. We can't share it with you right now, but we will look carefully as to how we want to true these up together. And so that might affect as we get closer to the approval what exactly we do, knowing that when we're coming together as a new comp."

David, some press reports suggested that you might have made some comments at Sun Valley about the merger, maybe timing and further industry consolidation. For those of us who were invited to conference, I was wondering if you could just maybe expand on some of those comments in this public forum. 
And then, Gunnar, I think you reiterated being a peak investment this year in terms of the AOIBDA drag at NextGen. As you think about the merger with WarnerMedia and the DTC services, I know spending on content remains pretty sacred. But when you think about either stack or tech, is there any reason that you might decelerate, that as you're going to be combining all these systems at some future point? And could that create any upside to maybe the 5x leverage target when we close?"

Well, let me first speak to the merger timing. I was in D.C. last week. I met with the -- across the board, spent a full day. There's broad support for this transaction. We haven't heard any pushback. We haven't seen any public pushback. T",779,"Thanks, Steven. Well, let me first speak to the merger timing. I was in D.C. last week. I met with the -- across the board, spent a full day. There's broad support for this transaction. We haven't heard any pushback. We haven't seen any public pushback. This becomes a very strong company for consumers, a more compelling streaming business. And so right now, it feels to us on every level like we've seen green lights. We're not seeing any yellow lights or red lights. Having said that, we're not in control of the timing. Disney was able to get their deal done in 6 months. Everything so far is extremely positive. But some of the timing with respect to the IRS and the DOJ, we can't -- they're working very effectively with us, the AT&T team and John. John has a terrific team that's working with our team. But ultimately, it could be significantly sooner. It could be a little later. We're just not in charge of the timing. But we feel very good about it at this point. There's nothing that we see. And I mean -- we're still hoping that we could really get lucky and it will happen a lot sooner. And that's what we're all pushing for. 
On consolidation, look, I take a look at this business: Warner Brothers Discovery. And there's just -- the toughest thing to do is to put together a great library or a great menu of content or IT. That is the most difficult thing to do. Yes, we need a strategy for what the price is? Is it ad? Is it AdLite? Is it exactly how do you go to market in each country? But the toughest thing to do is come up with a menu and have the strength of content to not only get people to come there, but get them to stay. 
And one of the things that's happened since our deal is you look at the Amazon deal where you look at the announcement of the deal, almost $1 billion for that basket of content, 8 -- almost $9 billion for the basket of content that MGM has, great company. [ Reece ] developed a great company. But we own a significant amount of the MGM library, this new company when it comes together: Harry Potter, King Kong, Godzilla, Batman, Game of Thrones. You look at what Casey is doing right now with hats, white LOTUS, Mayor of East Town, Sex and the City Coming Back, Friends, Friends Reunion, Space Jam having a big week, a big week against the Marvel property. And so which Tobii put together. And Jason. They're sitting on top of just an extraordinary library of IP. Hannah Barbera. All these things you cannot create. And so we look at all of that, and we say we can't wait to close. We think we have the broadest, most compelling IP together with what Discovery has. 
And as Gunnar said, we're seeing over 3 hours of engagement. Our churn is very low. We have great nourishment. And the combination of Harry Potter, King Kong, Batman, together with all of our great nourishing content globally and all the local content we have around the world as well as sports and news, we think makes us really compelling. 
Having said that, you look at -- here's 2 transactions that have happened. People need more IP. We -- I believe that what we have is not only do we have, I think, the strongest set of IP, but we have the broadest global -- we have the most global content in language of anybody. So I think we start off in a very, very strong position. And I think we're fine if nothing happens. 
But I believe that over the next couple of years, there's going to be more and more people are going to look, and they're going to raise their hand, and they'll do more consolidation. There'll be a more IP library sold, because you need a lot of content to be successful. And I think people are going to take a look at what we have, what John Stankey put together, together with what we have. And it's really going to be formidable. Disney and Netflix have gotten across the lake. And we think that this will be the third global streaming service, successful, sustainable. That's our mission. And a lot of the other IP that are subscale will probably be raising their hands or -- where there will be a lot of consolidation. And some of that may be opportunities for us. But right now, I really like where we are."

To the second part of your question. HBO Max had guided to 2022 being peak investment year. That's how we reflected in the model as well. And there's no update right now as to position here.

We're not going to talk about exactly how we're going to package at this point because we just can't do that right now. We have a compelling plan. We're looking at -- we're going country to country. We're actually trying some different things so that we can learn more. We're watching the great success that John and Anne is having as they accelerate. But we're focused on 200 million global subscribers. This is not about niche. This is about global subscribers. 
And we -- for me, after we close this deal, it is going to be 2 absolute missions. Mission #1 is drive direct-to-consumer to 200 million subscribers in every language in the world and with a product that's easy to navigate and use. And we think we can do that when we close. We're both growing, so we're going to start with a good base to get there. But that's the left side. The right side is focused on having the best creative company in the world. And Warner Bros. has been the greatest creative company in the world, the place that the talent want to come, the place where they feel nourished and supported. And that's the history of Warner Bros. And most of the great content that I've seen, that we've all seen, we don't even realize that. In the end, we see that Warner Bros. seal. And it stands for something. It stands for great storytelling. And we are one -- maybe the only company that has the ability to focus only on that one thing. We're not in the phone business when this deal closes. We're not in the retail business. We're not in the cloud business. We're not in a stable business. And so that's the focus. 
And that singular focus, I think, will drive a great culture. This is where people that care about content, that love content, that saw the magic when they were kids and they looked up at that screen. That's why we all got into this business. And that's the only business that we're in. And I think that, that, together with the fact that Warner Bros. itself, we can open a movie everywhere in the world as well or better, maybe best of class. 
And that's not going away. The motion picture business is not going away. It's why it's the top of the patina. It's why the greatest writers, producers and creative talent came. And when you look up at that big screen, that's where stars are made and that's where the magic happens. And so 200 million subscribers, a great team putting these companies together to drive toward that and a great creative culture with a -- at the very top of motion picture business that will be 100 years old in 2 years and has a heritage of of all the great storytelling that we all grew up with. That's the company, and that's what we're going to drive for."

So we feel that it's not necessarily a question of going high priced small or low price broader. The reality is that we're able to hit the sweet spot right now with the pricing that we have in most of our markets, which is, on average, for the entertainment tier, in this $4 to $6 price range, and that that's scaling very nicely. Now again, hard to talk about the globe in one swoop, because, ultimately, markets where we have more premium sports, we will price higher. Markets where we don't and then have lower price sensitivities like LatAm or Asia, we'll price lower. But generally, we feel like we can actually hit a very attractive price point, much higher than our wholesale pricing today, and still be in a sweet spot that ultimately delivers scale at the same time."

And broadcast is in the 60s, and where we have been in the 20s. And so we -- one, we made some more progress against the broadcasters. But Discovery Premiere is in the -- And so for advertisers to be able to get content that has the same or better reach with the same or better engagement in the 40s, for us, it's a dramatic increase. But for advertisers, it's a significant decrease because instead of buying a broadcaster for $64, they're buying us for $45 or $43 or $47. And so it's a real win-win. And we're able to service -- we have great demos, and we're able to go -- not only do we have the Premiere product, but now we have Discovery Plus, with the engagement and a much younger audience. And we could put together between linear and Discovery Plus and Go a really compelling package. And the result was our most successful upfront. And I think it's -- the fact that ratings are down in the aggregate is something that we're going to be living with for a long time. But look, I've told the story before. But in the 90s, we went up and -- when I was running the cable group, broadcast was going down and advertising rates were going up. And Walt said that can't continue. And it continued to the date. It's been going on for 20 years. I can't predict that that's what's going to happen. But there's not a lot of great inventory out there. The inventory is declining. And we have some of the best inventory out there. And then, one, it's generally underpriced. So when we get big increases, it still looks good. But 2, the overall bouquet of what we're offering now between the young demos on Discovery Plus and Go and the engagement in the audience that we have on all of our brands and what we can put together for our advertisers, there's real scarcity. You have the scatter market at plus 50 right now. And there are a lot of others that are under-delivering, and so they'll be out of sale. 
So in general, when you see the fourth quarter, you're going to see a real opportunity. But I talk about visibility. It's because the numbers in terms of the upfront that's going to start in the fourth quarter -- and it's a good thing because maybe we'll be down 15%. But maybe the beta, it looks like the advertising is going to be up dramatically more than that. We can't predict whether that will continue. But it's -- right now, it's a trend with scarcity. And the way that our content and linear content can deliver an audience for an advertiser the prices are going up, up. And so we hope that continues because it's an offset, and it allows us to still grow in linear, which is meaningful."

And that's where, particularly with the launch of Discovery Plus coming, we're at an even more attractive price point than what they would have paid even for a more reasonably priced pay TV package. We're excited to see those subs that might have left the pay TV bundle over the last few years have a chance to come back to us at a more attractively priced Discovery Plus option going forward. 
In terms of shutting cable nets like I think Disney has announced, we still see a very healthy business on the pay TV side. The hybrid deals we talked to you about where we've done deals with existing partners, the continued carriage of some of our channels at healthy economics, plus launch Discovery Plus, and so do a kind of 2 for 1. Those have been very successful for us so far. And we continue to see a lot of opportunity to be able to drive both of those. So we don't see necessarily the shutdown scenarios. But over time, there may be a handful of markets where we say they may be worth experimenting. But for now, we see a healthy ecosystem and healthy partnerships with this hybrid model."

Then we were going direct to consumer in Europe with individual sports. And the good news is we're trying different things, and we're trying to figure out. Ultimately, the consumer is going to decide how they want it. And we're finding that we're having more success when we put the sports together with the entertainment together with the nonfiction. But it's early days. It's still only in the third inning. So in a lot of these markets now where we have football, where we have cycling and we're putting it all on D+, we're looking and we're trying to get a sense of what's the acceleration of subs? What happens to the churn? Right now, it looks quite favorable. We're also anxious to see which will -- where we're not getting an inside look at all in Warner, but they launched in Latin America, and they launched with a lot of very compelling sports like football in Latin America. How -- what is their experience? The Olympics has been a really good experience for us. We're doing very well with it. Share is up 30% for Ping. We're finding that the engagement is much higher, as I've said. And so we don't know yet what the churn is going to be. I think it's going to be helped by the fact that we have Beijing coming. But ultimately, when these companies come together, it's all about the IP menu. We have news; what role will news play? We have sports we're if not the leader, we're one of the leaders in the world in terms of the sports. Jeff Zucker and John Stankey and Jason got -- we're able to lock up sports rights in the U.S. with some of the best leagues outside of football, which is compelling. So we look at all that IP and figure out, what do we do with it? How do we offer it? Is it all pay? Is some of it free? Is it all together in one package? Is it in 2 packages? But it's -- the sports, I think, is not that different from Harry Potter or a King Kong or DC Comics or a lot of the HBO IP. But with the exception of the fact that we don't own most of the sports. So what we've done is we've tried to get long rights for those sports and be very careful about what we pay for it. But we will -- there is a difference in that, when you're building these -- the franchises that we have, whether it's Ship in Joe, whether it's the Oprah Winfrey product or whether it's a Warner Building, DC, you own that forever. And sports, you have to eventually come back and pay for. And so there will be a view over the next several years of how that -- how important sports is, how and what the return is on it. But we're very happy with the fact that we have fantastic sports globally that we'll be able to use when this company comes together in the package. And we're doing very well with sports in Europe right now.

David, obviously, there's tremendous demand for linear television as we head into the fall season.

Were you able to do more non-Nielsen deals? Or  do you think that's even cost the company any money in the past and maybe it's something we shouldn't be that focused on?

Discovery continues to deliver strong operating and financial performance, driven by healthy momentum across all our key segments, beginning with our core linear business, which continues to accelerate sequentially, underscoring the durability of our content categories and the overall strength of our brands, while simultaneously scaling our global streaming offerings, most importantly, Discovery Plus, which continues to have strong traction, underpinning total next-generation revenue growth of 130% year-over-year and 17 million total global paying direct-to-consumer subscribers at the end of the second quarter, and 18 million as of today, with momentum around the globe, most notably behind the strength of the Olympics, which we've launched on Discovery Plus in Europe in a number of markets. Or the Eurosport Player which Discovery Plus has yet to launch though we've had some fantastic traction thus far. We are excited about prospects for the second half of the year as well as for the Beijing Olympics. More on all of that in a moment. The combination of continued strong execution across our core business while scaling our streaming platforms drove healthy top line growth and strong OIBDA and free cash flow conversion supported by vigilance on costs. Gunnar and his team continue to do a terrific job leading transformation across the organization with an eye towards continued efficiency, particularly as we absorb investment spend to support the growth and rollout of Discovery Plus. And we delivered a meaningful sequential improvement in our investment losses as we lean into modernization and begin to see the benefits of scale from an expense base. In fact, this quarter annualized Next Generation revenue is $1.6 billion and we see additional revenue growth ahead. In terms of the core, as you've heard from out peers, the industry just wrapped an incredibly healthy upfront providing us with a level of visibility we have not seen in quite some time. Jon Steinlauf and his team delivered top-of-tier performance and a record for our company, a testament to the programming and brands that viewers love and that our advertiser partners value, as well as our differentiated suite of products and platforms available to reach consumers in an otherwise increasingly fragmented marketplace. We achieved rates of change inclusive of the stepped up performance of Discovery Premier that were well ahead of the peer group. Premier has proved to be a great success, a unique vehicle that packages first run episodes from our most popular series and networks, in which sales more than doubled. Over 200 clients are now buying Premier. They enjoy ratings and reach that is equivalent or greater than broadcast prime but at a significant CPM discount. You've heard me tout this as a true win-win, and we keep driving this forward and clients love it. Moreover, demand for our bouquet of digital properties across Discovery Plus, our GO app, VOD and sites  
in social was robust. Advertisers continue to look for incremental reach beyond linear. And with roughly half of the audience base for Discovery Plus being noncabled households, the platform is hugely attractive to buyers. We look forward to additional product features and offerings to roll out throughout the year to drive further monetization. But what we are currently seeing is noteworthy. Advertisers are buying targeting capabilities of our platform, with innovative and intelligent solutions and healthy premiums to traditional linear. Internationally, advertising has also come back in a big way, driven by a number of key markets, such as the U.K., Italy, Germany, Poland, as well as a number of Lat Am and APAC markets that resulted in all regions around the globe turning in an acceleration and traction throughout the quarter. 
Turning to Discovery Plus. We are really pleased with the cadence and monetization of the service, supported by continued subscriber traction and healthy ARPU, notwithstanding the seasonally slower summer period, only exacerbated by the post-COVID reopening. That said, we had healthy sequential improvement in paid subs quarter-over-quarter, with most of Discovery Plus International runway still ahead. Here in the U.S., we continue to add to our distribution and platform footprint. Following last quarter's launch with Comcast, in the coming months, Discovery Plus will also be available to Cox subscribers across their Contour TV and Contour stream player platforms. Discovery Plus will also shortly be available on VIZIO SmartCast, advancing our rollout to all major consumer platforms. 
As we've noted previously, the bulk of the 2021 Discovery International market launches would be in the second half of this year, with key market launches such as Brazil, Canada and the Philippines to come in the second half of the year. 
Vodafone successfully launched in July in the U.K. market for mobile customers. And we expect additional markets such as Spain, the Netherlands and Italy to launch as planned following the migration of our front-end technology to our common global platform this fall. 
JB and his team have been deliberate and methodical in managing our international rollout to ensure the best consumer experience. This includes ensuring we have strong integrations with local partners and completing a major replatforming to get both our front-end and back-end technologies on one common platform. It is a complicated road map of engineering and commercial logistics, not to mention COVID challenges around the globe in some of our tech hubs, at the same time that we have been planning, producing and delivering the Olympic Games from Tokyo. 
We continue to learn a lot as we go, in terms of what's working and what's not, with respect to marketing, branding, tech product and features, as well as distribution partners and platforms. We are very pleased with the metrics we look at to evaluate our position within the marketplace, consumer acceptance, role to pay, viewing time for active subscriber, churn, monetization and so on. 
We provided an early glimpse across these metrics last quarter, and I'm pleased that we continue to track well against our internal plans. And the momentum we are building as we look ahead to our exciting plans post merger with WarnerMedia and HBO. 
Taken together, we could not be more excited about the possibilities ahead to serve consumers with the deepest and most compelling content offering in the world. Consumers want choice and simplicity. We believe that the combined company will be able to offer more of both. In a video market that could see more consumer selectivity as the market reach soars, we believe the combined company will be well positioned to compete in the global streaming marketplace. The regulatory process continues to move forward as planned, giving us confidence in our previously stated time frame of mid-next year to close. 
And lastly, the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which, as I noted earlier, has been a very pleasant surprise during what can only be described as challenging circumstances. At this point, about halfway through, we've already doubled our total sub gains from the last Olympic Games in PyeongChang, with nearly 0.75 billion minutes of Olympic content streamed, up over 18x versus the last games. 
Like with the Winter Games, we've enjoyed some truly remarkable viewing shares in key markets, like the Nordics, in which our share of television viewing for certain sports has been upwards of 60% to 80%, and with outstanding traction with streaming across all markets, notably in the U.K. and Italy, which are newly launched markets for Discovery Plus. We are very excited about the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing in early 2022, and then, of course, Paris in 2024, right in our backyard. These are truly hallmark, high-value branding events, and are super funnels that drive awareness, viewing and subscribers to our platforms. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Gunnar to take you through our financials.  After which, Gunnar, JB and I look forward to taking your questions."

Echoing David's comments, I am very pleased with our operating performance this quarter, in which both our traditional core linear busines",1767,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. 
Echoing David's comments, I am very pleased with our operating performance this quarter, in which both our traditional core linear business alongside our Next Generation streaming platforms combined to deliver very healthy revenue growth and impressive AOIBDA and free cash flow conversion. 
While comparisons against last year's advertising performance were very favorable, we are especially encouraged by the acceleration and sequential improvements we've enjoyed from every region around the globe and return to near pre-pandemic levels. The U.S., Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific all turned in impressive results. And of course, Discovery Plus is providing a nice tailwind to our performance. 
Turning to second quarter results, beginning with the U.S. segment. 
Advertising revenues increased 12% year-over-year as we continued to take advantage of a very robust advertising market for both linear and digital inventory. We saw strong demand in all key categories, including CPG, pharma, cosmetics, auto, retail and home improvement, far more than offsetting the softer viewership across the industry as compared to the peak COVID Q2 of last year. Scatter CPMs were up 50% plus versus last year's upfront and up more than 30% year-over-year. Additionally, Next Generation advertising demand was very healthy across our suite of products, with revenues up 70% year-over-year. Specifically for Discovery Plus, more than 800 advertisers have now bought inventory on the platform, more than 4x the number of advertisers that we had targeted by the end of the second quarter. Interestingly, more than 90% of all clients who have bought inventory on Discovery Plus also bought inventory at our GO and TV Everywhere offering, underscoring the power of integrated audience solutions across our suite of digital products. 
Furthermore, we continued to roll out new ad products on Discovery Plus. For example, we recently launched GreenLight, an ad product that allows clients to own the first ad served to every user on Discovery Plus on a specific day. 
As noted earlier, the strength of the upfront market underpins the continued relevance and importance of television as an advertising medium, contributing to greater confidence in our ability to drive top line advertising revenue growth. 
While we faced comparisons against political advertising in the second half of the year and some modest headwinds from the Olympics here in the U.S. in Q3, layering in the tailwind from this upfront, we should enjoy sequentially faster revenue growth in Q4 over Q3. 
Distribution revenues grew 12% year-over-year on a reported basis or 18% like-for-like, primarily driven by continued traction and monetization of the Discovery Plus subscriber base, helped by linear affiliate pricing, offsetting the year-over-year decline in pay TV subscribers. Subscribers to our fully distributed networks were down 3% during the quarter, while total portfolio of subscribers were down 7%. However, recall that we sold Great American Country during the quarter. When adjusted for the sale, total portfolio subscribers would have been down 3% year-over-year during the quarter, as we continued to benefit from specific distribution gains across certain networks from recent renewals. We will begin lapping those renewals in the coming months. And you should expect to see our linear subscriber trends more in line with the industry going forward, as we have discussed prior. Worth noting also is that the sale of GAC did result in a modest headwind to both reported advertising and distribution revenue this quarter as we did not recognize any contribution for [indiscernible]. 
Turning to the International segment, which I will, as always, discuss on an ex FX basis. Advertising revenues increased 70% year-over-year as we saw significant growth off the second quarter last year. We saw a strong revenue growth across all regions, with the pace accelerating throughout the quarter, with a number of key markets nicely above 2019, as David mentioned. Distribution revenues increased 6% versus the prior year, supported primarily by direct-to-consumer subscriber growth. Though as noted, there were no material new market launches during the quarter. This was partially offset by lower linear affiliate rates in certain European markets. 
Total company operating expenses increased 33% during the quarter. Cost of revenues increased 25% year-over-year, as sports returned to a more normalized schedule this year versus virtually no sports last year due to COVID-related shutdowns as well as the continuing investment in B2C content. 
SG&A increased 43% versus the prior year as we invested in marketing and personnel to support our Discovery Plus rollout. We continue to focus on driving efficiency in our core linear networks, and we remain on track to reduce core linear OpEx in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range for the year. 
As we guided, we reduced our losses from investment projects significantly in the second quarter to roughly $250 million versus more than $400 million in the first quarter, benefiting from both strong Next Generation revenue growth as well as more efficient marketing spend, primarily in the U.S. 
Q2 Next Generation revenue growth of 130% is annualizing at a $1.6 billion run rate. And we expect additional sequential quarterly revenue growth for the year and beyond. As we launch in new markets during the second half of the year, we expect that we will continue to incur investment losses, though more or less in the same ballpark as this past quarter, mainly driven by content and marketing costs. We continue to expect that investment losses will peak this year. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with all of the core KPIs we closely monitor, and we continue to track well against our internal plans. 
Global direct-to-consumer ARPU remains consistent with Q1, as the impact of certain international distribution partnerships and associated early promotional activity is offset by our strong and growing U.S. ARPU, which is nicely supported by the AdLite Discovery Plus product. 
Roll to pay still remains high at an average of close to 80% across the global DTC portfolio, as does average engagement per viewing subscriber, which is more or less in line with what we saw last quarter. As well, we remain pleased with overall churn, which naturally is at the lower end for the most mature subscriber cohorts and skews higher for the most recent one. 
As I noted, the vast majority of our international Discovery Plus growth thus far has come from existing markets. And we plan to launch in a number of key markets and territories during the second half of this year, including Brazil, Canada and the Philippines, alongside additional Vodafone markets in Italy, the Netherlands and Spain around the end of the year. 
It is worth highlighting that a handful of these market launches have been extended out about a quarter or so later than our original internal plans called for, primarily resulting from the requisite harmonization of our technology platforms, the added benefit of which will enable us to roll out an international AdLite product. This has been a heavy lift, particularly given team constraints related to COVID in our tech hubs, primarily in India. Other puts and takes to consider will be our ability to maintain and keep subscribers that come in during the Olympic Games, though the initial roll-to-pay numbers look very encouraging. At net, we remain very excited about our local go-to-market strategies across these important countries through the end of the year. 
Turning to housekeeping items. 
Net income for the quarter was $672 million or $1.01 per share on a diluted basis. 
First, please note, we recognized a $0.09 per share gain on the sale of Great American Country as well as a $0.09 per share noncash gain on an existing investment in Sharecare, the company that recently went public. 
Second, our effective tax rate during the quarter was negligible, as we recognized certain noncash tax benefits totaling $162 million or $0.24 per share. Given these tax benefits, we now expect the full year effective book tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. For cash taxes, we are now anticipating a slightly higher rate, in the high 20% range for the year, excluding PPA amortization, as we are positioning our tax footprint for optimal outcomes across a number of legislative scenarios for '22 and beyond. Third, and finally, the PPA impact was $0.30 per share. 
Adjusted for the above, EPS would have been $0.89 per diluted share. 
Now turning to free cash flow and our leverage. 
We generated $757 million of free cash flow in the quarter, representing a near 70% conversion rate of AOIBDA, notwithstanding the continued investments we are making as well as the return to normalized content production levels. Year-to-date, our AOIBDA to free cash flow conversion rate is nearly 50%, and we remain confident that we will convert at least 50% of our AOIBDA for free cash flow this year, even with the anticipated new market launches and slightly higher cash taxes mentioned earlier. 
At the end of the quarter, our net leverage was 3.25x, which is within our current target range. We expect our net leverage could be temporarily at the high end of our target range due to the Olympics in the current quarter. As a reminder, we do expect to recognize the $175 million to $200 million of AOIBDA losses during the third quarter as a result of the Olympics, though we continue to expect that we will break even or generate slightly positive AOIBDA and free cash flow over the life of the deal. 
As indicated when we announced our transaction with WarnerMedia, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter as we continued to invest in our Next Generation initiatives and conserve cash ahead of the closing of the deal. 
And finally, we now expect FX to have roughly a positive $100 million year-over-year impact on revenue and a negative $20 million impact on AOIBDA in 2021. 
We continue to operate on solid footing, dynamically growing our direct-to-consumer business, with contributions to our top line growth becoming increasingly meaningful and optimizing the resilient core linear business, creating strong conversion of AOIBDA to free cash flow. 
We remain focused on delivering solid operating performance while we build the framework to support long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value. And we are eager and excited once we gain all the requisite approvals to roll up our sleeves to capture the tremendous opportunities offered by our proposed merger with WarnerMedia. And of course, we look forward to speaking with you at the appropriate time on our thoughts and plans around integration, strategic direction, synergy, et cetera. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator to take your questions."

And so we feel good about that. 
I think as Gunnar touched on in his comments, we are -- these are sort of leaning towards more sort of September and into the fourth quarter, where we had hoped, obviously, to be starting more ahead of that into the third quarter. But due to obviously wanting to make sure we got the Olympic Games off the ground successfully and getting this replatforming completed, some of that will hit a little bit later in the second half of the year than we initially thought. 
And in that time period, I think we do see internationally some -- obviously, we're expecting significantly more growth coming out of those new market launches as we get towards the back half of the year. 
As it relates to '22, I think it's a little bit early to talk about that. The only comment, which David and Gunnar may amplify, is, obviously, as we get later into 2022 and we get further visibility on the timing of the WarnerMedia deal, we obviously will look at making sure we stay smart in the context of when that timing and when that deal might close as to how we maximize the rollout schedule of those services into 2022. 
So that's, I think, as much as I know. Gunnar or David, if you want to add anything else, that's as much."

And all of our -- the entire Olympics was offered throughout Europe on our product. People are spending a huge amount of time, as you've seen it, 18x what it was before in for PyeongChang. It was very simple. The navigation was simple. We spent a lot of time making sure we get the product right. That's going to help us. But we're also, as I've said, we're learning. One of the things that we're -- that we've learned along the way is navigation and simplicity is very important for people to be able to find the products that they want, particularly with a complicated product like the Olympics, and it's really working. We'll have Beijing coming up in a few months. It's very unusual that we get a back-to-back like that. So we think that we can do better in terms of keeping subs and growing subs because we don't have a 2-year lag between the 2 games, which is advantageous. 
The other thing that we're learning as we look to roll out outside the U.S. is that AdLite is a really compelling product. We're generating about $6 in advertising per subscriber here in the U.S. with 3 minutes of advertising. And the friction for users is nonexistent. When they're used to seeing 14, 18 minutes to see 3, and so there may be a real strategic opportunity for us here. We're doing extremely well in packaging that product together with linear, together with AVOD here in the U.S. And so whereas a year ago, we thought everything would just be subscription, we're looking at AVOD as a meaningful opportunity to go into markets at a lower price, get more scale and be able to pick up actually more money. We're making more money on our AdLite product by an awful lot here in the U.S. And so doing that requires more engineering, more coding, but we want to get it right. And as JB said, as we get closer to the Warner Bros. Discovery to our transaction, we'll continue to look -- right now, we're both accelerating. And Warner is doing a terrific job, John Stankey and Ann and Jason. If you take a look at -- and Casey. You take a look at the momentum that they have, they're driving hard. We're driving hard. And then we'll true up together. At some point, we really do have our strategy. We can't share it with you right now, but we will look carefully as to how we want to true these up together. And so that might affect as we get closer to the approval what exactly we do, knowing that when we're coming together as a new company."

David, some press reports suggested that you might have made some comments at Sun Valley about the merger, maybe timing and further industry consolidation.

And then, Gunnar, I think you reiterated being at peak investment this year in terms of the AOIBDA drag at NextGen. As you think about the merger with WarnerMedia and the DTC services, I know spending on content remains pretty sacred. But when you think about either stack or tech, is there any reason that you might decelerate that as you're going to be combining all these systems at some future point? And could that create any upside to maybe the 5x leverage target when you close?"

Well, let me first speak to the merger timing. I was in D.C. last week. I met with the -- across the Board, spent a full day. There's broad support for this transaction. We haven't heard any pushback. We haven't seen any public pushback. T",772,"Thanks, Steven. Well, let me first speak to the merger timing. I was in D.C. last week. I met with the -- across the Board, spent a full day. There's broad support for this transaction. We haven't heard any pushback. We haven't seen any public pushback. This becomes a very strong company for consumers, a more compelling streaming business. And so right now, it feels to us on every level like we've seen green lights. We're not seeing any yellow lights or red lights. Having said that, we're not in control of the timing. Disney was able to get their deal done in 6 months. Everything so far is extremely positive. But some of the timing with respect to the IRS and the DOJ, we can't -- they're working very effectively with us, the AT&T team and John. John has a terrific team that's working with our team. But ultimately, it could be significantly sooner. It could be a little later. We're just not in charge of the timing. But we feel very good about it at this point. There's nothing that we see. And I mean -- we're still hoping that we could really get lucky and it will happen a lot sooner. And that's what we're all pushing for. 
On consolidation, look, I take a look at this business: Warner Bros. Discovery. And there's just -- the toughest thing to do is to put together a great library or a great menu of content or IT. That is the most difficult thing to do. Yes, we need a strategy for what the price is? Is it ad? Is it AdLite? Exactly how do you go to market in each country? But the toughest thing to do is come up with a menu and have the strength of content to not only get people to come there, but get them to stay. 
And one of the things that's happened since our deal is you look at the Amazon deal where you look at the announcement of the Reese Witherspoon deal, almost $1 billion for that basket of content, 8 -- almost $9 billion for the basket of content that MGM has, great company. Reese developed a great company. But we own a significant amount of the MGM library, this new company when it comes together: Harry Potter, King Kong, Godzilla, Batman, Game of Thrones. You look at what Casey is doing right now with Hats, white Lotus, Mare of Easttown, Sex and the City coming back, Friends, Friends Reunion, Space Jam having a big week, a big week against the Marvel property which Toby put together. Ann and Jason, they're sitting on top of just an extraordinary library of IP. Hanna-Barbera. All these things you cannot create. And so we look at all of that, and we say we can't wait to close. We think we have the broadest, most compelling IP together with what Discovery has. 
And as Gunnar said, we're seeing over 3 hours of engagement. Our churn is very low. We have great nourishment. And the combination of Harry Potter, King Kong, Batman, together with all of our great nourishing content globally and all the local content we have around the world as well as sports and news, we think makes us really compelling. 
Having said that, you look at -- here's 2 transactions that have happened. People need more IP. We -- I believe that what we have is not only do we have, I think, the strongest set of IP, but we have the broadest global -- we have the most global content in language of anybody. So I think we start off in a very, very strong position. And I think we're fine if nothing happens. 
But I believe that over the next couple of years, there's going to be more and more people are going to look, and they're going to raise their hand, and they'll do more consolidation. There'll be more IP library sold, because you need a lot of content to be successful. And I think people are going to take a look at what we have, what John Stankey put together, together with what we have. And it's really going to be formidable. Disney and Netflix have gotten across the lake. And we think that this will be the third global streaming service, successful, sustainable. That's our mission. And a lot of the other IP that are subscale will probably be raising their hands or -- there will be a lot of consolidation. And some of that may be opportunities for us. But right now, I really like where we are."

We're actually trying some different things so that we can learn more. We're watching the great success that John and Ann is having as they accelerate. But we're focused on 200 million global subscribers. This is not about niche. This is about global subscribers. 
And we -- for me, after we close this deal, it is going to be 2 absolute missions. Mission #1 is drive direct-to-consumer to 200 million subscribers in every language in the world and with a product that's easy to navigate and use. And we think we can do that when we close. We're both growing, so we're going to start with a good base to get there. But that's the left side. The right side is focused on having the best creative company in the world. And Warner Bros. has been the greatest creative company in the world, the place that the talent want to come, the place where they feel nourished and supported. And that's the history of Warner Bros. And most of the great content that I've seen, that we've all seen, we don't even realize it. In the end, we see that Warner Bros. seal. And it stands for something. It stands for great storytelling. And we are one -- maybe the only company that has the ability to focus only on that one thing. We're not in the phone business when this deal closes. We're not in the retail business. We're not in the cloud business. We're not in the cable business. And so that's the focus. 
And that singular focus, I think, will drive a great culture. This is where people that care about content, that love content, that saw the magic when they were kids and they looked up at that screen. That's why we all got into this business. And that's the only business that we're in. And I think that, that, together with the fact that Warner Bros. itself, we can open a movie everywhere in the world as well or better, maybe best of class. 
And that's not going away. The motion picture business is not going away. It's why it's the top of the patina. It's why the greatest writers, producers and creative talent came. And when you look up at that big screen, that's where stars are made and that's where the magic happens. And so 200 million subscribers, a great team putting these companies together to drive toward that and a great creative culture with a -- at the very top a motion picture business that will be 100 years old in 2 years and has a heritage of all the great storytelling that we all grew up with. That's the company, and that's what we're going to drive for."

Now again, hard to talk about the globe in one swoop, because, ultimately, markets where we have more premium sports, we will price higher. Markets where we don't and that have lower price sensitivities like LatAm or Asia, we'll price lower.

Well, first, the upfront was the best upfront that I've seen in my career. On average, it was up about 20%, and we were able to beat that significantly.

On average, it was up about 20%, and we were able to beat that significantly. So I think I believe we were best of market, but this was a market that was up 20%, and we picked up -- we did much better than that. And one of the reasons is because of the Discovery Premiere. And in some ways, it's a great story, but it's one that -- it starts off with the fact that we're not getting enough and we haven't been getting enough for -- in CPM for the great content that we have. And broadcast is in the 60s, and where we have been in the 20s. And so we -- one, we made some more progress against the broadcasters. But Discovery Premiere is in the 40s. And so for advertisers to be able to get content that has the same or better reach with the same or better engagement in the 40s, for us, it's a dramatic increase. But for advertisers, it's a significant decrease because instead of buying a broadcaster for $64, they're buying us for $45 or $43 or $47. And so it's a real win-win. And we're able to service -- we have great demos, and we're able to go -- not only do we have the Premiere product, but now we have Discovery Plus, with the engagement of a much younger audience. And we could put together between linear and Discovery Plus and GO a really compelling package. And the result was our most successful upfront. And I think it's -- the fact that ratings are down in the aggregate is something that we're going to be living with for a long time. But look, I've told the story before. But in the 90s, we went up and -- when I was running the cable group, broadcast was going down and advertising rates were going up. And Walt said that can't continue. And it continued to the date. It's been going on for 20 years. I can't predict that that's what's going to happen. But there's not a lot of great inventory out there. The inventory is declining. And we have some of the best inventory out there. And then, one, it's generally underpriced. So when we get big increases, it still looks good. But 2, the overall bouquet of what we're offering now between the young demos on Discovery Plus and GO and the engagement in the audience that we have on all of our brands and what we can put together for our advertisers, there's real scarcity. You have the scatter market at plus 50 right now. And there are a lot of others that are under-delivering, and so they'll be out of sale. 
So in general, when you see the fourth quarter, you're going to see a real opportunity. But I talk about visibility. It's because the numbers in terms of the upfront that's going to start in the fourth quarter -- and it's a good thing because maybe we'll be down 15%. But maybe the advertising -- it looks like the advertising is going to be up dramatically more than that. We can't predict whether that will continue. But it's -- right now, it's a trend with scarcity. And the way that our content and linear content can deliver an audience for an advertiser, the prices are going up, up. And so we hope that continues because it's an offset, and it allows us to still grow in linear, which is meaningful."

Obviously, reality in the TLC sort of genre, also a big driver for us. As you spread out and go internationally, it becomes a little bit more diverse in the sense that, obviously, we have bigger broadcast content in markets like Poland, the Nordics, Italy. And so we have bigger entertainment formats also that are working extremely well. And then sports, which we've talked about, both in terms of the Olympics and outside of the Olympics.

The reality is, oftentimes, as David said, particularly these days, our focus is in a different direction right now with the closing of the Warner deal. That's our primary focus. 
So in terms of the ad sales climb, then I'll come to Poland at the end. On ad sales, we do see a vast majority of our clients overlapping between linear and digital. So it's a very strong correlation. And a number of clients were doing both. On Poland, look, we -- as we said, I think, publicly in the past, we remain very committed to the business. It's a great business. It continues to be a growth business and a very healthy business for us. The environment is obviously challenged. We're actively talking to all the different constituents and stakeholders to make our case. And we think it'd be very, very economically irrational for the government to try and pass any laws that ultimately would change our position and make the environment way less attractive for foreign investment, not just media, but any foreign investment.

There are, as David said, generally, broadly, we do see some cord shaving, but the cord cutting has remained fairly stable internationally. So we don't see the same sort of dynamics as we've seen in some in the U.S. The cord shaving is really sort of elements of some of the higher tiered and higher price points, people churning down to lower tiers in certain markets. But those are, I'd say, more limited, and in the higher-priced markets like Northern Europe in some cases. And then there are markets like Brazil, for example, for macroeconomic reasons that certainly have seen subscriber decline over the last few years as the middle class has been squeezed. But at the same time, we know in the markets like that, that video consumption and video viewership is as hungry as ever. And that's where, particularly with the launch of Discovery Plus coming, we're at an even more attractive price point than what they would have paid even for a more reasonably priced pay TV package. We're excited to see those subs that might have left the pay TV bundle over the last few years have a chance to come back to us at a more attractively priced Discovery Plus option going forward. 
In terms of shutting cable nets like I think Disney has announced, we still see a very healthy business on the pay TV side. The hybrid deals we talked to you about where we've done deals with existing partners, the continued carriage of some of our channels at healthy economics, plus launch Discovery Plus, and so do a kind of 2 for 1. Those have been very successful for us so far. And we continue to see a lot of opportunity to be able to drive both of those. So we don't see necessarily the shutdown scenarios. But over time, there may be a handful of markets where we say they may be worth experimenting. But for now, we see a healthy ecosystem and healthy partnerships with this hybrid model."

Then we were going direct to consumer in Europe with individual sports. And the good news is we're trying different things, and we're trying to figure out. Ultimately, the consumer is going to decide how they want it. And we're finding that we're having more success when we put the sports together with the entertainment together with the nonfiction. But it's early days. It's still only in the third inning. So in a lot of these markets now where we have football, where we have cycling and we're putting it all on D+, we're looking and we're trying to get a sense of what's the acceleration of subs? What happens to the churn? Right now, it looks quite favorable. We're also anxious to see which will -- where we're not getting an inside look at all in Warner, but they launched in Latin America, and they launched with a lot of very compelling sports like football in Latin America. How -- what is their experience? The Olympics has been a really good experience for us. We're doing very well with it. Share is up 30% from PyeongChang. We're finding that the engagement is much higher, as I've said. And so we don't know yet what the churn is going to be. I think it's going to be helped by the fact that we have Beijing coming. But ultimately, when these companies come together, it's all about the IP menu. We have news; what role will news play? We have sports. We're if not the leader, we're one of the leaders in the world in terms of the sports. Jeff Zucker and John Stankey and Jason got -- were able to lock up sports rights in the U.S. with some of the best leagues outside of football, which is compelling. So we look at all that IP and figure out, what do we do with it? How do we offer it? Is it all pay? Is some of it free? Is it all together in one package? Is it in 2 packages? But it's -- the sports, I think, is not that different from Harry Potter or King Kong or DC Comics or a lot of the HBO IP. But with the exception of the fact that we don't own most of the sports. So what we've done is we've tried to get long rights for those sports and be very careful about what we pay for it. But we will -- there is a difference in that, when you're building these -- the franchises that we have, whether it's Chip and Jo, whether it's the Oprah Winfrey product or whether it's a Warner Building, DC, you own that forever. And sports, you have to eventually come back and pay for. And so there will be a view over the next several years of how that -- how important sports is, how and what the return is on it. But we're very happy with the fact that we have fantastic sports globally that we'll be able to use when this company comes together in the package. And we're doing very well with sports in Europe right now.

Discovery continues to deliver strong operating and financial performance, driven by healthy momentum across all our key segments, beginning with our core linear",1310,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. 
Discovery continues to deliver strong operating and financial performance, driven by healthy momentum across all our key segments, beginning with our core linear business, which continues to accelerate sequentially, underscoring the durability of our content categories and the overall strength of our brands, while simultaneously scaling our global streaming offerings, most importantly, Discovery Plus, which continues to have strong traction, underpinning total next-generation revenue growth of 130% year-over-year and 17 million total global paying direct-to-consumer subscribers at the end of the second quarter, and 18 million as of today, with momentum around the globe, most notably behind the strength of the Olympics, which we've launched on Discovery Plus in Europe in a number of markets. Or the Eurosport Player which Discovery Plus has yet to launch though we've had some fantastic traction thus far. 
We are excited about prospects for the second half of the year as well as for the Beijing Olympics. More on all of that in a moment. The combination of continued strong execution across our core business while scaling our streaming platforms drove healthy top line growth and strong OIBDA and free cash flow conversion supported by vigilance on costs. Gunnar and his team continue to do a terrific job leading transformation across the organization with an eye towards continued efficiency, particularly as we absorb investment spend to support the growth and rollout of Discovery Plus. And we delivered a meaningful sequential improvement in our investment losses as we lean into modernization and begin to see the benefits of scale from an expense base. 
In fact, this quarter annualized next generation revenue is $1.6 billion and we see additional revenue growth ahead. In terms of the core, as you've heard from our peers, the industry just wrapped an incredibly healthy upfront providing us with a level of visibility we have not seen in quite some time. 
Jon Steinlauf and his team delivered top-of-tier performance and a record for our company, a testament to the programming and brands that viewers love and that our advertising partners value, as well as our differentiated suite of products and platforms available to reach consumers in an otherwise increasingly fragmented marketplace. We achieved rates of change inclusive of the stepped-up performance of Discovery Premiere that were well ahead of the peer group. Premiere has proved to be a great success, a unique vehicle that packages first run episodes from our most popular series and networks, in which sales more than doubled. Over 200 clients are now buying Premiere. They enjoy ratings and reach that is equivalent or greater than broadcast prime but at a significant CPM discount. You've heard me tout this as a true win-win, and we keep driving this forward and clients love it. Moreover, demand for our bouquet of digital properties across Discovery Plus, our GO app, VOD and sites in social was robust. Advertisers continue to look for incremental reach beyond linear. And with roughly half of the audience base for Discovery Plus being noncabled households, the platform is hugely attractive to buyers. We look forward to additional product features and offerings to roll out throughout the year to drive further monetization. But what we are currently seeing is noteworthy. Advertisers are buying targeting capabilities of our platform, with innovative and intelligent solutions and healthy premiums to traditional linear. Internationally, advertising has also come back in a big way, driven by a number of key markets, such as the U.K., Italy, Germany, Poland, as well as a number of Lat Am and APAC markets that resulted in all regions around the globe turning in an acceleration and traction throughout the quarter. 
Turning to Discovery Plus. We are really pleased with the cadence and monetization of the service, supported by continued subscriber traction and healthy ARPU, notwithstanding the seasonally slower summer period, only exacerbated by the post-COVID reopening. That said, we had healthy sequential improvement in paid subs quarter-over-quarter, with most of Discovery Plus International runway still ahead. 
Here in the U.S., we continue to add to our distribution and platform footprint. Following last quarter's launch with Comcast, in the coming months, Discovery Plus will also be available to Cox subscribers across their Contour TV and Contour stream player platforms. Discovery Plus will also shortly be available on VIZIO SmartCast, advancing our rollout to all major consumer platforms. 
As we've noted previously, the bulk of the 2021 Discovery Plus International market launches would be in the second half of this year, with key market launches such as Brazil, Canada and the Philippines to come in the second half of the year. 
Vodafone successfully launched in July in the U.K. market for mobile customers. And we expect additional markets such as Spain, the Netherlands and Italy to launch as planned following the migration of our front-end technology to our common global platform this fall. 
JB and his team have been deliberate and methodical in managing our international rollout to ensure the best consumer experience. This includes ensuring we have strong integrations with local partners and completing a major replatforming to get both our front-end and back-end technologies on one common platform. It is a complicated road map of engineering and commercial logistics, not to mention COVID challenges around the globe in some of our tech hubs, at the same time that we have been planning, producing and delivering the Olympic Games from Tokyo. 
We continue to learn a lot as we go, in terms of what's working and what's not, with respect to marketing, branding, tech product and features, as well as distribution partners and platforms. We are very pleased with the metrics we look at to evaluate our position within the marketplace, consumer acceptance, role to pay, viewing time for active subscriber, churn, monetization and so on. 
We provided an early glimpse across these metrics last quarter, and I'm pleased that we continue to track well against our internal plans. And the momentum we are building as we look ahead to our exciting plans post merger with WarnerMedia and HBO. 
Taken together, we could not be more excited about the possibilities ahead to serve consumers with the deepest and most compelling content offering in the world. Consumers want choice and simplicity. We believe that the combined company will be able to offer more of both. In a video market that could see more consumer selectivity as the market reach soars, we believe the combined company will be well positioned to compete in the global streaming marketplace. The regulatory process continues to move forward as planned, giving us confidence in our previously stated time frame of mid-next year to close. 
And lastly, the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which, as I noted earlier, has been a very pleasant surprise during what can only be described as challenging circumstances. 
At this point, about halfway through, we've already doubled our total sub gains from the last Olympic Games in PyeongChang, with nearly 0.75 billion minutes of Olympic content streamed, up over 18x versus the last games. 
Like with the Winter Games, we've enjoyed some truly remarkable viewing shares in key markets, like the Nordics, in which our share of television viewing for certain sports has been upwards of 60% to 80%, and with outstanding traction with streaming across all markets, notably in the U.K. and Italy, which are newly launched markets for Discovery Plus. We are very excited about the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing in early 2022, and then, of course, Paris in 2024, right in our backyard. These are truly hallmark, high-value branding events, and are super funnels that drive awareness, viewing and subscribers to our platforms. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Gunnar to take you through our financials.  After which, Gunnar, JB and I look forward to taking your questions."

Echoing David's comments, I am very pleased with our operating performance this quarter, in which both our traditional, core linear busine",1765,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. 
Echoing David's comments, I am very pleased with our operating performance this quarter, in which both our traditional, core linear business alongside our next generation streaming platforms combined to deliver very healthy revenue growth and impressive AOIBDA and free cash flow conversion. 
While comparisons against last year's advertising performance were very favorable, we are especially encouraged by the acceleration and sequential improvements we've enjoyed from every region around the globe and return to near pre-pandemic levels. The U.S., Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific all turned in impressive results. And of course, Discovery Plus is providing a nice tailwind to our performance. 
Turning to second quarter results, beginning with the U.S. segment. 
Advertising revenues increased 12% year-over-year as we continued to take advantage of a very robust advertising market for both linear and digital inventory. We saw strong demand in all key categories, including CPG, pharma, cosmetics, auto, retail and home improvement, far more than offsetting the softer viewership across the industry as compared to the peak COVID Q2 of last year. Scatter CPMs were up 50% plus versus last year's upfront and up more than 30% year-over-year. 
Additionally, Next Generation advertising demand was very healthy across our suite of products, with revenues up 70% year-over-year. Specifically for Discovery Plus, more than 800 advertisers have now bought inventory on the platform, more than 4x the number of advertisers that we had targeted by the end of the second quarter. Interestingly, more than 90% of all clients who have bought inventory on Discovery Plus also bought inventory at our GO and TV Everywhere offerings, underscoring the power of integrated audience solutions across our suite of digital products. 
Furthermore, we continued to roll out new ad products on Discovery Plus. For example, we recently launched Greenlights, an ad product that allows clients to own the first ad served to every user on Discovery Plus on a specific day. 
As noted earlier, the strength of the upfront market underpins the continued relevance and importance of television as an advertising medium, contributing to greater confidence in our ability to drive top line advertising revenue growth. 
While we faced comparisons against political advertising in the second half of the year and some modest headwinds from the Olympics here in the U.S. in Q3, layering in the tailwind from this upfront, we should enjoy sequentially faster revenue growth in Q4 over Q3. 
Distribution revenues grew 12% year-over-year on a reported basis or 18% like-for-like, primarily driven by continued traction and monetization of the Discovery Plus subscriber base, helped by linear affiliate pricing, offsetting the year-over-year decline in pay-TV subscribers. Subscribers to our fully distributed networks were down 3% during the quarter, while total portfolio of subscribers were down 7%. However, recall that we sold Great American Country during the quarter. When adjusted for the sale, total portfolio of subscribers would have been down 3% year-over-year during the quarter, as we continued to benefit from specific distribution gains across certain networks from recent renewals. We will begin lapping those renewals in the coming months. And you should expect to see our linear subscriber trends more in line with the industry going forward, as we have discussed prior. Worth noting also is that the sale of GAC did result in a modest headwinds to both reported advertising and distribution revenue this quarter as we did not recognize any contribution for [indiscernible] quarter. 
Turning to the International segment, which I will, has always, discuss on an ex FX basis. Advertising revenues increased 70% year-over-year as we saw significant growth off the second quarter last year. We saw a strong revenue growth across all regions, with the pace accelerating throughout the quarter, with a number of key markets nicely above 2019, as David mentioned. Distribution revenues increased 6% versus the prior year, supported primarily by direct-to-consumer subscriber growth. Though as noted, there were no material new market launches during the quarter. This was partially offset by lower linear affiliate rates in certain European markets. 
Total company operating expenses increased 33% during the quarter. Cost of revenues increased 25% year-over-year, as sports returned to a more normalized schedule this year versus virtually no sports last year due to COVID-related shutdowns as well as the continuing investment in B2C content. 
SG&A increased 43% versus the prior year as we invested in marketing and personnel to support our Discovery Plus rollout. We continue to focus on driving efficiency in our core linear networks, and we remain on track to reduce core linear OpEx in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range for the year. 
As we guided, we reduced our losses from investment projects significantly in the second quarter to roughly $250 million versus more than $400 million in the first quarter, benefiting from both strong next generation revenue growth as well as more efficient marketing spend, primarily in the U.S. 
Q2 next generation revenue growth of 130% is annualizing at a $1.6 billion run rate. And we expect additional sequential quarterly revenue growth for the year and beyond. As we launch in new markets during the second half of the year, we expect that we will continue to incur investment losses, though more or less in the same ballpark as this past quarter, mainly driven by content and marketing costs. We continue to expect that investment losses will peak this year. 
Overall, we remain very pleased with all of the core KPIs we closely monitor, and we continue to track well against our internal plans. 
Global direct-to-consumer ARPU remains consistent with Q1, as the impact of certain international distribution partnerships and associated early promotional activity is offset by our strong and growing U.S. ARPU, which is nicely supported by the AdLite Discovery Plus product. 
Roll-to-Pay still remains high at an average of close to 80% across the global DTC portfolio, as does average engagement per viewing subscriber, which is more or less in line with what we saw last quarter. As well, we remain pleased with overall churn, which naturally is at the lower end for the most mature subscriber cohorts and skews higher for the most recent one. 
As I noted, the vast majority of our international Discovery Plus growth thus far has come from existing markets. And we plan to launch in a number of key markets and territories during the second half of this year, including Brazil, Canada and the Philippines, alongside additional Vodafone markets in Italy, the Netherlands and Spain around the end of the year. 
It is worth highlighting that a handful of these market launches have been extended out about a quarter or so later than our original internal plans called for, primarily resulting from the requisite harmonization of our technology platforms, the added benefit of which will enable us to roll out an international AdLite product. 
This has been a heavy lift, particularly given team constraints related to COVID in our tech hubs, primarily in India. Other puts and takes to consider will be our ability to maintain and keep subscribers that come in during the Olympic Games, though the initial Roll-to-Pay numbers look very encouraging. Net-net, we remain very excited about our local go-to-market strategies across these important countries through the end of the year. 
Turning to housekeeping items. 
Net income for the quarter was $672 million or $1.01 per share on a diluted basis. 
First, please note, we recognized a $0.09 per share gain on the sale of Great American Country as well as a $0.09 per share noncash gain on an existing investment in Sharecare, the company that recently went public. 
Second, our effective tax rate during the quarter was negligible, as we recognized certain noncash tax benefits totaling $162 million or $0.24 per share. Given these tax benefits, we now expect the full year effective book tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. For cash taxes, we are now anticipating a slightly higher rate, in the high 20% range for the year, excluding PPA amortization, as we are positioning our tax footprint for optimal outcomes across a number of legislative scenarios for '22 and beyond. Third, and finally, the PPA impact was $0.30 per share. 
Adjusted for the above, EPS would have been $0.89 per diluted share. 
Now turning to free cash flow and our leverage. 
We generated $757 million of free cash flow in the quarter, representing a near 70% conversion rate of AOIBDA, notwithstanding the continued investments we are making as well as the return to normalized content production levels. Year-to-date, our AOIBDA to free cash flow conversion rate is nearly 50%, and we remain confident that we will convert at least 50% of our AOIBDA for free cash flow this year, even with the anticipated new market launches and slightly higher cash taxes mentioned earlier. 
At the end of the quarter, our net leverage was 3.25x, which is within our current target range. We expect our net leverage could be temporarily at the high end of our target range due to the Olympics in the current quarter. As a reminder, we do expect to recognize the $175 million to $200 million of AOIBDA losses during the third quarter as a result of the Olympics, though we continue to expect that we will break even or generate slightly positive AOIBDA and free cash flow over the life of the deal. 
As indicated when we announced our transaction with WarnerMedia, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter as we continued to invest in our Next Generation initiatives and conserve cash ahead of the closing of the deal. 
And finally, we now expect FX to have roughly a positive $100 million year-over-year impact on revenue and a negative $20 million impact on AOIBDA in 2021. 
We continue to operate on solid footing, dynamically growing our direct-to-consumer business, with contributions to our top line growth becoming increasingly meaningful and optimizing the resilient core linear business, creating strong conversion of AOIBDA to free cash flow. 
We remain focused on delivering solid operating performance while we build the framework to support long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value. And we are eager and excited once we gain all the requisite approvals to roll up our sleeves to capture the tremendous opportunities offered by our proposed merger with WarnerMedia. And of course, we look forward to speaking with you at the appropriate time on our thoughts and plans around integration, strategic direction, synergy, et cetera. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator to take your questions."

And so we feel good about that. 
I think as Gunnar touched on in his comments, we are -- those are sort of leaning towards more sort of September and into the fourth quarter, where we had hoped, obviously, to be starting more ahead of that into the third quarter. But due to obviously wanting to make sure we got the Olympic Games off the ground successfully and getting this replatforming completed, some of that will hit a little bit later in the second half of the year than we initially thought. 
And in that time period, I think we do see internationally some -- obviously, we're expecting significantly more growth coming out of those new market launches as we get towards the back half of the year. 
As it relates to '22, I think it's a little bit early to talk about that. The only comment, which David and Gunnar may amplify, is, obviously, as we get later into 2022 and we get further visibility on the timing of the WarnerMedia deal, we obviously will look at making sure we stay smart in the context of when that timing and when that deal might close as to how we maximize the rollout schedule of those services into 2022. 
So that's, I think, as much as I know. Gunnar or David, if you want to add anything else, that's as much."

The execution on the Olympics was really almost flawless. And all of our -- the entire Olympics was offered throughout Europe on our product.

And all of our -- the entire Olympics was offered throughout Europe on our product. People are spending a huge amount of time, as you've seen it, 18x what it was before for PyeongChang. It was very simple. The navigation was simple. We spent a lot of time making sure we get the product right. That's going to help us. But we're also, as I've said, we're learning. One of the things that we're -- that we've learned along the way is navigation and simplicity is very important for people to be able to find the products that they want, particularly with a complicated product like the Olympics, and it's really working. 
We'll have Beijing coming up in a few months. It's very unusual that we get a back-to-back like that. So we think that we can do better in terms of keeping subs and growing subs because we don't have a 2-year lag between the 2 games, which is advantageous. 
The other thing that we're learning as we look to roll out outside the U.S. is that AdLite is a really compelling product. We're generating about $6 in advertising per subscriber here in the U.S. with 3 minutes of advertising. And the friction for users is nonexistent. When they're used to seeing 14, 18 minutes to [ see 3 ], and so there may be a real strategic opportunity for us here. We're doing extremely well in packaging that product together with linear, together with AVOD here in the U.S. And so whereas a year ago, we thought everything would just be subscription, we're looking at AVOD as a meaningful opportunity to go into markets at a lower price, get more scale and be able to pick up actually more money. We're making more money on our AdLite product by an awful lot here in the U.S. And so doing that requires more engineering, more coding, but we want to get it right. 
And as JB said, as we get closer to the Warner Bros. Discovery to our transaction, we'll continue to look -- right now, we're both accelerating. And Warner is doing a terrific job, John Stankey and Ann and Jason. If you take a look at -- and Casey. You take a look at the momentum that they have, they're driving hard. We're driving hard. And then we'll true up together. At some point, we really do have our strategy. We can't share it with you right now, but we will look carefully as to how we want to true these up together. And so that might affect as we get closer to the approval what exactly we do, knowing that when we're coming together as a new company."

We're not seeing any yellow lights or red lights. Having said that, we're not in control of the timing. Disney was able to get their deal done in 6 months. Everything so far is extremely positive. But some of the timing with respect to the IRS and the DOJ, we can't -- they're working very effectively with us, the AT&T team and John. John has a terrific team that's working with our team. But ultimately, it could be significantly sooner. It could be a little later. We're just not in charge of the timing. But we feel very good about it at this point. There's nothing that we see. And I mean -- we're still hoping that we could really get lucky and it will happen a lot sooner. And that's what we're all pushing for. 
On consolidation, look, I take a look at this business: Warner Bros. Discovery. And there's just -- the toughest thing to do is to put together a great library or a great menu of content or IT. That is the most difficult thing to do. Yes, we need a strategy for what the price is? Is it ad? Is it AdLite? Exactly how do you go to market in each country? But the toughest thing to do is come up with a menu and have the strength of content to not only get people to come there but get them to stay. 
And one of the things that's happened since our deal is you look at the Amazon deal where you look at the announcement of the Reese Witherspoon deal, almost $1 billion for that basket of content, 8 -- almost $9 billion for the basket of content that MGM has, great company. Reese developed a great company. But we own a significant amount of the MGM library, this new company when it comes together: Harry Potter, King Kong, Godzilla, Batman, Game of Thrones. You look at what Casey is doing right now with Hats, white Lotus, Mare of Easttown, Sex and the City coming back, Friends, Friends Reunion, Space Jam having a big week, a big week against the Marvel property which Toby put together. Ann and Jason, they're sitting on top of just an extraordinary library of IP. Hanna-Barbera. All these things you cannot create. And so we look at all of that, and we say we can't wait to close. We think we have the broadest, most compelling IP together with what Discovery has. 
And as Gunnar said, we're seeing over 3 hours of engagement. Our churn is very low. We have great nourishment. And the combination of Harry Potter, King Kong, Batman, together with all of our great nourishing content globally and all the local content we have around the world as well as sports and news, we think makes us really compelling. 
Having said that, you look at -- here's 2 transactions that have happened. People need more IP. We -- I believe that what we have is not only do we have, I think, the strongest set of IP, but we have the broadest global -- we have the most global content in language of anybody. So I think we start off in a very, very strong position. And I think we're fine if nothing happens. 
But I believe that over the next couple of years, there's going to be more and more people are going to look, and they're going to raise their hand, and they'll do more consolidation. There'll be more IP library sold, because you need a lot of content to be successful. And I think people are going to take a look at what we have, what John Stankey put together, together with what we have. And it's really going to be formidable. Disney and Netflix have gotten across the lake. And we think that this will be the third global streaming service, successful, sustainable. That's our mission. And a lot of the other IP that are subscale will probably be raising their hands or -- there will be a lot of consolidation. And some of that may be opportunities for us. But right now, I really like where we are."

You're seeing the revenue contributions kicking in. We're tracking at an annual run rate of $1.6 billion NextGen revenues now. Significant step down in our start-up losses from our investment initiatives overall. So this is in line with what we've been talking about previously. And I don't want to go through all the details again why, but we will be able to get some nice profitability out of streaming at comparably lower subscriber numbers earlier. 
To the second part of your question. HBO Max had guided to 2022 being peak investment year. That's how we reflected in our deal model as well. And there's no update right now as to sort of the combined operation, as you would imagine, because we're still managing these 2 companies completely separately. But if you look at our free cash flow conversion in the second quarter, you can clearly see that we got our priorities straight and the entire management team is working hard to really get us position here.
And again, from that perspective, while I don't want to give an update on that 5x leverage expectation right now, again, I view that as a nonissue. We have a ton of confidence that we'll very, very quickly get to where we need to be."

JB and David as well, JB, what are you seeing from Discovery Plus so far in international markets? How does that inform your launch strategy for upcoming markets? And in particular, if you think about pricing for this service, are you better off pricing at a premium for super fans or pricing low and trying to drive the service as broadly as possible?"

We're not going to talk about exactly how we're going to package at this point because we just can't do that right now. We have a compelling plan. We're looking at -- we're going country to country. We're actually trying some different things so that we can learn more. We're watching the great success that John and Ann are having as they accelerate. But we're focused on 200 million global subscribers. This is not about niche. This is about global subscribers. 
And we -- for me, after we close this deal, it is going to be 2 absolute missions. Mission #1 is drive direct-to-consumer to 200 million subscribers in every language in the world and with a product that's easy to navigate and use. And we think we can do that when we close. We're both growing, so we're going to start with a good base to get there. But that's the left side. The right side is focused on having the best creative company in the world. And Warner Bros. has been the greatest creative company in the world, the place that the talent wants to come, the place where they feel nourished and supported. And that's the history of Warner Bros. And most of the great content that I've seen, that we've all seen, we don't even realize it. In the end, we see that Warner Bros. seal. And it stands for something. It stands for great storytelling. And we are one -- maybe the only company that has the ability to focus only on that one thing. We're not in the phone business when this deal closes. We're not in the retail business. We're not in the cloud business. We're not in the cable business. And so that's the focus. 
And that singular focus, I think, will drive a great culture. This is where people that care about content, that love content, that saw the magic when they were kids and they looked up at that screen. That's why we all got into this business. And that's the only business that we're in. And I think that, that, together with the fact that Warner Bros. itself, we can open a movie everywhere in the world as well or better, maybe best of class. 
And that's not going away. The motion picture business is not going away. It's why it's the top of the patina. It's why the greatest writers, producers and creative talent came. And when you look up at that big screen, that's where stars are made and that's where the magic happens. And so 200 million subscribers, a great team putting these companies together to drive toward that and a great creative culture with a -- at the very top a motion picture business that will be 100 years old in 2 years and has a heritage of all the great storytelling that we all grew up with. That's the company, and that's what we're going to drive for."

So we feel that it's not necessarily a question of going high priced small or low price broader. The reality is that we're able to hit the sweet spot right now with the pricing that we have in most of our markets, which is, on average, for the entertainment tier, in this $4 to $6 price range, and that that's scaling very nicely. Now again, hard to talk about the globe in one swoop, because, ultimately, markets where we have more premium sports, we will price higher. Markets where we don't and that have lower price sensitivities like LatAm or Asia, we'll price lower. But generally, we feel like we can actually hit a very attractive price point, much higher than our wholesale pricing today, and still be in a sweet spot that ultimately delivers scale at the same time."

On average, it was up about 20%, and we were able to beat that significantly. So I think I believe we were best of market, but this was a market that was up 20%, and we picked up -- we did much better than that. And one of the reasons is because of the Discovery Premiere. And in some ways, it's a great story, but it's one that -- it starts off with the fact that we're not getting enough and we haven't been getting enough for -- in CPM for the great content that we have. 
And broadcast is in the 60s, and where we have been in the 20s. And so we -- one, we made some more progress against the broadcasters. But Discovery Premiere is in the 40s. And so for advertisers to be able to get content that has the same or better reach with the same or better engagement in the 40s, for us, it's a dramatic increase. But for advertisers, it's a significant decrease because instead of buying a broadcaster for $64, they're buying us for $45 or $43 or $47. And so it's a real win-win. And we're able to service -- we have great demos, and we're able to go -- not only do we have the Premiere product, but now we have Discovery Plus, with the engagement of a much younger audience. And we could put together between linear and Discovery Plus and GO a really compelling package. And the result was our most successful upfront. And I think it's -- the fact that ratings are down in the aggregate is something that we're going to be living with for a long time. But look, I've told the story before. But in the 90s, we went up and -- when I was running the cable group, broadcast was going down and advertising rates were going up. And Walt said that can't continue. And it continued to the date. It's been going on for 20 years. I can't predict that that's what's going to happen. But there's not a lot of great inventory out there. The inventory is declining. And we have some of the best inventory out there. And then, one, it's generally underpriced. So when we get big increases, it still looks good. But 2, the overall bouquet of what we're offering now between the young demos on Discovery Plus and GO and the engagement in the audience that we have on all of our brands and what we can put together for our advertisers, there's real scarcity. You have the scatter market at plus 50 right now. And there are a lot of others that are under-delivering, and so they'll be out of sale. 
So in general, when you see the fourth quarter, you're going to see a real opportunity. But I talk about visibility. It's because the numbers in terms of the upfront that's going to start in the fourth quarter -- and it's a good thing because maybe we'll be down 15%. But maybe the advertising -- it looks like the advertising is going to be up dramatically more than that. We can't predict whether that will continue. But it's -- right now, it's a trend with scarcity. And the way that our content and linear content can deliver an audience for an advertiser, the prices are going up, up. And so we hope that continues because it's an offset, and it allows us to still grow in linear, which is meaningful."

There are, as David said, generally, broadly, we do see some cord shaving, but the cord cutting has remained fairly stable internationally. So we don't see the same sort of dynamics as we've seen in some in the U.S. The cord shaving is really sort of elements of some of the higher tiered and higher-priced points, people churning down to lower tiers in certain markets. But those are, I'd say, more limited, and in the higher-priced markets like Northern Europe in some cases. And then there are markets like Brazil, for example, for macroeconomic reasons that certainly have seen subscriber decline over the last few years as the middle class has been squeezed. But at the same time, we know in the markets like that, that video consumption and video viewership is as hungry as ever. And that's where, particularly with the launch of Discovery Plus coming, we're at an even more attractive price point than what they would have paid even for a more reasonably priced pay TV package. We're excited to see those subs that might have left the pay TV bundle over the last few years have a chance to come back to us at a more attractively priced Discovery Plus option going forward. 
In terms of shutting cable nets like I think Disney has announced, we still see a very healthy business on the pay TV side. The hybrid deals we talked to you about where we've done deals with existing partners, the continued carriage of some of our channels at healthy economics, plus launch Discovery Plus, and so do a kind of 2 for 1. Those have been very successful for us so far. And we continue to see a lot of opportunity to be able to drive both of those. So we don't see necessarily the shutdown scenarios. But over time, there may be a handful of markets where we say they may be worth experimenting. But for now, we see a healthy ecosystem and healthy partnerships with this hybrid model."

We're also anxious to see which will -- where we're not getting an inside look at all in Warner, but they launched in Latin America, and they launched with a lot of very compelling sports like football in Latin America. How -- what is their experience? The Olympics has been a really good experience for us. We're doing very well with it. Share is up 30% from PyeongChang. We're finding that the engagement is much higher, as I've said. And so we don't know yet what the churn is going to be. I think it's going to be helped by the fact that we have Beijing coming. But ultimately, when these companies come together, it's all about the IP menu. We have news; what role will news play? We have sports. We're if not the leader, we're one of the leaders in the world in terms of the sports. Jeff Zucker and John Stankey and Jason got -- were able to lock up sports rights in the U.S. with some of the best leagues outside of football, which is compelling. So we look at all that IP and figure out, what do we do with it? How do we offer it? Is it all pay? Is some of it free? Is it all together in one package? Is it in 2 packages? But it's -- the sports, I think, is not that different from Harry Potter or King Kong or DC Comics or a lot of the HBO IP. But with the exception of the fact that we don't own most of the sports. So what we've done is we've tried to get long rights for those sports and be very careful about what we pay for it. But we will -- there is a difference in that, when you're building these -- the franchises that we have, whether it's Chip and Jo, whether it's the Oprah Winfrey product or whether it's a Warner Building, DC, you own that forever. And sports, you have to eventually come back and pay for. And so there will be a view over the next several years of how that -- how important sports is, how and what the return is on it. But we're very happy with the fact that we have fantastic sports globally that we'll be able to use when this company comes together in the package. And we're doing very well with sports in Europe right now. 
JB, anything to add?"

David, obviously, there's tremendous demand for linear television as we head into the fall season. Can you talk a little bit about whether Discovery was able to navigate some of the measurement challenges that Nielsen has created in the past around delivery and make goods? Were you able to do more non-Nielsen deals? Or do you think that's even cost the company any money in the past and maybe it's something we shouldn't be that focused on? But I know you've spent a lot of time on it. And it seems like the demand side of advertising is strong. I'm curious if you could just comment whether you guys feel like that's a headwind or you've sort of navigated around it. 
And then on streaming. I don't know if this is for Gunnar or David. The 18 million number, I guess, captures probably the Olympic lift you got. And it seems like you're talking about most of your international launches coming in Q4. Just wondering if there is any other headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about in the third quarter.

This continues to be an exciting and busy time here at Discovery across a range of business initiatives and strategic planning for the next year and the years ahead. I'm very pleased with our focus",1847,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. This continues to be an exciting and busy time here at Discovery across a range of business initiatives and strategic planning for the next year and the years ahead. I'm very pleased with our focus, performance and strong operating discipline as we simultaneously ramp up our integration planning, strategic reviews and approach ahead of the WarnerMedia merger. We are increasingly enthused about the transformative opportunity ahead by bringing together these complementary assets, talented creative leaders and employees all around the globe. 
This morning, I'll provide some brief commentary on Q3 operating performance and update you on the progress we are making as we work toward the close of our transaction and integration of the businesses. Gunner will then take you through additional puts and takes on the quarter. Very briefly on Q3, it was a solid quarter all around. Subscriber growth for our direct-to-consumer platforms picked up nicely post summer, and we added a healthy 3 million paying subscribers around the globe, reaching a total of 20 million subscribers, and we've seen continued growth thus far in Q4. 
We were able to deliver this growth as well as driving double-digit growth in both advertising and distribution revenues while converting a healthy amount of OIBDA to free cash flow. This positions us nicely above our guidance of at least 50% conversion this year, and we see free cash flow is tracking to exceed $2.1 billion for the full year, and that's after funding very significant investments in our discovery+ rollout. Additionally and importantly, we have had the opportunity to refine some of our transaction leverage assumptions after examining WarnerMedia's draft carve-out financials. 
Though we took a conservative approach initially while modeling the pro forma transaction, we now expect our net leverage at close to be at or below 4.5x and versus the 5x that we noted in May, and we are currently tracking below the 4.5. This is predominantly based on estimated contractual adjustments to working capital and, to a lesser extent, an improved outlook in our operating performance. Accordingly, we now see a path to reducing leverage to around 3x, meaningfully sooner than what we articulated in May. More on this shortly from Gunner, but this points to a stronger financial footing than we had anticipated as we stand up the merged company and accelerate the pace to delever, supporting our ability to make focused investments in growth initiatives even without any asset sales. 
On the regulatory front, echoing John Stankey's comments on the AT&T call, we are well on track for a mid-2022 close and are engaged in the typical regulatory filing process in jurisdictions around the globe, including our planned filing with the SEC of a preliminary draft of our merger proxy expected out in late November. The transformative upside from the merger is, of course, the global direct-to-consumer opportunity. And while we appreciate some of the questions that a number of you have asked regarding clarity and specifics regarding the product, investment and go-to-market road map, it is still premature for us to provide details, given where we are in the ongoing regulatory review process. 
That said, having conducted further operational and strategic diligence, I can share with you some broad strokes around what underpins our confidence and enthusiasm in our global go-to-market attack plan. First, it's all about the content. From the start, under 1 roof will be a combination of 2 companies whose common culture of creative excellence, iconic characters and franchises will result in a differentiated competitive offering. I believe the biggest and most compelling menu of IP for consumers in the world, spanning comedy to true crime, kids and family, lifestyle to adventure, drama to documentaries, news and sports and, of course, sci-fi and superheroes. I believe the most complete and balanced portfolio offered in 1 service in the world. 
And secondly, we view our ability and commitment to tactically invest in our content portfolio as a critical strategic driver, building upon our respective long-tenured track records of producing relevant and complementary programming around the globe. This should help to make our service uniquely global and local at the same time. 
Third, given the breadth of our content offering, we expect the combined service will appeal broadly to all demographics, young and old, with strong male and female genres, again, very complementary such that our global total addressable market should be on par with the biggest streaming service. 
Assessing the overlap in respective subscriber bases, at least here in the U.S., we believe less than half of discovery+ subscribers are also HBO Max subscribers, which, with the right packaging, provides a real opportunity to broaden the base of our combined offering. And with our global appeal, infrastructure and local market capabilities, our international road map is very much still untapped and provides meaningful upside over the coming years. 
Lastly, our ability to drive revenue and ARPU positions us well for long-term growth, particularly given our plans to market with a lower-priced AdLite service, starting off in the U.S. and later in key international markets, a meaningful distinction from some competitors where we see an opportunity to drive value. We gained confidence in this strategic direction from our experience with ad monetization on discovery+ in the U.S., where advertisers covet the incremental reach, demos, targetability and product flexibility and pay premium rates to address this audience, helping make this tier our highest ARPU offering. 
The opportunity to scale an AdLite offering represents one of the most significant upside drivers for the company long term, while offering a compelling value to more price-sensitive consumers and will benefit from Discovery's depth in local ad sales infrastructure and teams around the world to help monetize. It's quite clear that the winners in streaming are and will be those companies that can provide consumers with the best quality stories, the most appealing content choices, personalized and simple products and all at a great value. We expect our highly complementary combination will drive such a winning value proposition and will be reflected across key operating metrics over time. 
A few words on the linear side of the house before turning over to Gunnar. As we think about what can be achieved in terms of bringing great networks and brands together under 1 roof, the analog to Scripps is a valuable benchmark. And we believe the opportunity is far greater here, both on costs and advertising revenue potential. Ultimately, to better support our core linear business and more broadly, the entire traditional ecosystem, this, I believe, is one of the least appreciated elements of this transaction. 
Considered with Scripps, the platform we created in aggregating female demos, the bedrock on which we launched Premier, our product that offers advertisers the unduplicated reach of a broadcast network across all of our prime time originals at significantly more efficient CPMs than broadcast. We can take that advertising platform to the next level by weaving in sports, scripted news and mail-oriented programming, together with our existing core competencies. It's a true win-win, generating significant revenue upside to us with improved options, efficiency and savings to our advertising partners by replicating the reach of a broadcast network at better value. Cost synergy opportunities are significant. We draw upon the expertise of our transformation office, which since our merger with Scripps Networks in 2018, continuously challenges our management team and me to refine and transform how we conduct and manage our organization from top to bottom around the globe. Nothing is sacred, and no stone is unturned. 
With Scripps, we ultimately captured more than $1 billion in cost savings, representing about 35% of all non-content expenses and about 3x our original synergy target before we stop attributing incremental savings to the merger. A large chunk of the cost synergy opportunity that we have already conveyed speaks to the best practices and tailwind in place from the integration of Scripps. It's a great starting point. 
As we refine and integrate global ops, enterprise tech, corporate functions, real estate, direct-to-consumer infrastructure and tech and streamline efforts across duplicative functions like SG&A and marketing spend, a process that we see broken down into 3 distinct waves over the next few years. We approached $3 billion in cost saves as a tangible and achievable goal, especially against the combined company that should spend around $35 billion this year and growing from there. 
Stepping back for a moment to reflect on our direct-to-consumer pivot. Nearing a year since discovery+ launched, I'm proud of what we have accomplished under the leadership of JB and the world-class team we have assembled over the last few years. We continue to learn a great deal, challenge ourselves, sharpening our focus and gaining perspective for the next leg of our direct-to-consumer journey with WarnerMedia and HBO. And as we've noted recently, we continue to refine our discovery+ plans, taking a more thoughtful and tactical approach to investing in the product. and doing so in ways that also support our plans for the combined company after we close the transaction. For example, we are moving forward in priority markets. such as Canada, Italy, Brazil and the U.K., some of which are where HBO Max hasn't announced plans or in some cases, has indicated that they cannot launch in the near to medium term for contractual reasons. 
As you heard from John, Jason and the team on their earnings call, HBO Max continues to aggressively move forward with their global expansion plans. Most recently in Latam, and last week in Europe. And we look forward to closing the transaction so that we can coordinate and maximize our marketing, technology and content spend for the enhancement of the combined effort. Until such time, we continue to roll out new and exciting content to entertain and sustain our subscribers around the globe. 
And our metrics look great. Roll to pay remains near 75% globally. Churn, particularly in the U.S., continues to look strong and approaching peer group lows, while App Store ratings are firmly at the top while monetization and engagement continued to exceed our expectations, all of which helps to solidify our discovery+ base as we endeavor to roll into and formulate a more comprehensive and broader offering with HBO Max. 
In closing, this is an exciting and dynamic time for us as we plan our next steps, and we are as eager to share them as we know you are to hear them, and we expect that will be in short order. While the opportunity for course capture and enhanced efficiency is both tangible and material, our North Star, our right to play will be in achieving long-term sustainable financial growth resulting from the combination of these 2 great content companies, helping to nurture our important linear presence while driving global scale across our direct-to-consumer platform. anchored by as rich and relevant portfolio of creative franchises anywhere in the world. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Gunnar after which JB, Gunnar and I will be happy to answer any of your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Reiterating David's comments, I'm pleased with what the Discovery team has achieved since the discovery+ Analyst Day not even a year ago. Over that time, we have added 15 mill",1376,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
Reiterating David's comments, I'm pleased with what the Discovery team has achieved since the discovery+ Analyst Day not even a year ago. Over that time, we have added 15 million paying direct-to-consumer subscribers globally, finishing the third quarter with 20 million paying DTC subscribers. Since the start of our discovery+ journey, we have launched in over 25 new markets, notably the U.S. and the U.K. and most recently, Canada and the Philippines, with Brazil to come over the next few weeks. At the same time, we have continued to drive growth in markets like Poland, the Nordics, Italy and India, where we doubled down on our direct-to-consumer efforts with a renewed and expanded content offering. 
And our next-generation revenues finished the third quarter with $425 million for the quarter or a $1.7 billion annualized run rate with global D2C ARPU of approximately $5 and $7 blended discovery+ ARPU in the U.S., again, supported by our over $10 ARPU for the discovery+ AdLite product, which continues to monetize very well. Investment losses for the quarter were in the low $200 million range, slightly better than our guidance from last quarter, and we expect investment losses more or less in that range in the fourth quarter as well. As always, we maintain a disciplined approach with respect to investing in direct-to-consumer initiatives. As both David and I have noted over the last few months, it is through this lens that we view the opportunity ahead, both leading up to the merger and beyond. 
We are very focused on nourishing our existing subscriber base with an increasing content offering and new product features. At the same time, you should expect us to be guided by a rigorous analysis of customer lifetime value and subscriber acquisition cost to determine our marketing spend for new sub-additions. 
And now I'd like to quickly review our reporting segments, starting with the U.S. Third quarter advertising revenues increased 5% year-over-year. Pricing was healthy versus last year, driven by scatter pricing that was up 40% year-over-year. Additionally, we continue to see strong demand for our discovery+ AdLite product, which contributed to the growth in the quarter. This was partly offset by weaker audience delivery year-over-year, some of it's attributable to the Nielsen panel issues as well as the lapping of our very strong performance last year during the pandemic. Furthermore, some of our networks have lost share to the strong sports calendar this year. 
While scatter pricing is still very healthy in Q4, up 30% to 35% over both upfront and last year, the overall tone in the market is a bit more subdued than the last few quarters as clients work through the constraints in the global supply chain. And though there is slightly less visibility as a result, we are very pleased with how our portfolio is positioned based on the strength from the upfront and contribution from direct to consumer. Distribution revenues increased 21% year-over-year, largely due to the continued growth of discovery+ as well as linear affiliate rate increases, in part helped by successful renewals with DIRECTV, Verizon, Hulu and Altice so far this year. 
As disclosed in our earnings release, pay-TV subscribers to our fully distributed linear networks declined by 3% year-over-year, while total portfolio linear subscribers declined 4% excluding the impact of the sale of our Great American Country network last quarter. 
Turning to international, which I will, as always, discuss on a constant currency basis. International advertising increased 26% versus last year as the global advertising marketplace continued to recover from the pandemic. We also benefited from the Olympics in Europe across our linear and digital platform. Although as we've noted in the past, advertising for the Olympic Games is less consequential in Europe as compared to the U.S. All of our international regions, including many of our key markets like the U.K., Germany, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Australia and New Zealand and Mexico were up meaningfully compared to last year as well as compared to 2019. We see momentum continuing into Q4, even as needless to say, the year-over-year comps get tougher from here on out. 
International Distribution revenues grew 6% during the quarter, primarily due to the growth in direct-to-consumer subscribers which have nearly tripled over the past year across our footprint outside the U.S., in part aided by the Olympic sign-ups. 
Turning to operating expenses. Total company OpEx increased 50% during the quarter or 17% excluding the Olympics, for which the overall AOIBDA losses were in line with our guidance of around $200 million for the quarter. We continue to focus on driving efficiency in our core linear networks, and we remain on track to reduce core linear OpEx in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range for the year. 
Turning to some housekeeping items. Net income for the quarter was $156 million or $0.24 per share on a diluted basis. A couple of items to note. First, we recognized a $0.12 per share noncash gain from the $15 billion of notional interest rate hedges that we recently implemented to mitigate interest rate risk for future debt issuances to finance the cash portion of the WarnerMedia transaction. The hedges provide additional security and visibility towards our overall cost of deal-related debt financing, which is now trending better than our initial expectations. And the final note on this, as the derivatives do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes, we are required to report the changes in fair market value on our income statement, which could result in some additional variability to our net income until the WarnerMedia transaction closes. We will, of course, call this impact out each quarter. 
Second, the impact of PPA amortization during the third quarter was $0.30 per share. Adjusted for the above, EPS would have been $0.42 per diluted share. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 15%, and we continue to expect the full year effective book tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. For cash taxes, we continue to anticipate a rate in the high 20% range for the year, excluding PPA amortization, though this is subject to change as we are carefully monitoring ongoing tax legislation. And we expect FX to have roughly a negative $15 million year-over-year impact on revenues and a negative $10 million impact on AOIBDA in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to free cash flow and our leverage. We generated $705 million of free cash flow in the quarter, obviously, a very strong conversion rate of AOIBDA, notwithstanding the continuing investments we're making as well as the return to normalized content production levels. Year-to-date, our AOIBDA to free cash flow conversion rate is over 60%. And with a few months left in the quarter, we see free cash flow topping $2.1 billion for the full year and clearly ahead of our 50% conversion guidance. 
And to expand on the point that David made earlier, we now expect our net leverage to be at or below 4.5x by the time we close the WarnerMedia merger. Over the past few months, having had the opportunity to dig further into WarnerMedia's draft carve-out financials and with better visibility on estimated working capital in conjunction with our better P&L and free cash flow performance, we now believe that we will have a healthy amount less net debt at closing than originally anticipated. While naturally, these metrics are preliminary and a function of working capital at close, we now do expect to be in a position to reduce leverage to 3x meaningfully sooner than what we stated in May. 
Our long-term target net leverage range for Warner Bros. Discovery remains at 2.5 to 3x. As we work towards closing the WarnerMedia transaction in mid-2022, we have redirected our experienced integration and transformation office to hit the ground running. And as we refine our strategic review and integration plans, and as we develop our synergy capture plans further, we are as enthusiastic as ever about the prospects of combining these 2 world-class portfolios and franchises. 
With that, we look forward to sharing a lot more in due time. And for now, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to start taking your questions."

First, this is something that John Stankey and I talked about is we created this vision together of this company being what we believe is the best media company with the greatest and most comprehensive content offering. And as part of that,",695,"Thanks, Doug. First, this is something that John Stankey and I talked about is we created this vision together of this company being what we believe is the best media company with the greatest and most comprehensive content offering. And as part of that, we're spending more money on content and leaning in and WarnerMedia is spending more money on content and leaning in. We both committed to do that to keep both of our ecosystems nourished and strong and growing. So when the deal -- when and if the deal gets approved, then we come together, we'll come together with strength. And you see that with -- on the Warner side, where we're cheering them on with the success of Dune around the world with Ann and Tobi on that side and Casey Bloys having an incredible run at HBO with succession, White LOTUS, Hac, MarafEastTown. It's just -- if you look at the culture and the impact of that content, together with the extraordinary library they have, us leaning in on our side with more original content. 
And so for us, we're also spending a lot more on the international side to get ready. We think that's a strategic advantage. And when you look at the content, we think in terms of the demographics, that we will appeal broadly to every demo. I mentioned this, but we're very strong with women. That's a particular strength of Discovery where we're doing many quarters with the leading media company in America for women, together with the length of view of women watching our channels, whether it's food or HG or Oprah or ID and TLC and that's continuing. 
In addition, we look around the world. It's not just local content, but we're the leader in sports in Europe. They have sports in Latin America. And CNN is the leader in news with the most compelling news brand around the world. And one of the few global -- maybe the only global new service that has the kind of resources around the world in news gathering. And so as we go out and build this service and make this offering, and I do think it's the best content wins, there's a great product in Netflix and entertainment. There's a great product with Disney, with [indiscernible] is building with entertainment. And we think we have a comparable product, maybe even more diversely attractive in entertainment. But on top of that, we also have sports, which we're using in Europe and learning a lot from. And in markets like Poland, where we're doing news and sports together with broad entertainment and nonfiction, we're finding real meaningful traction and real reduction in churn. And so I think we have a lot to learn, but we have a terrific product, and we're working on our go-to-market. 
We have brought on an old friend of mine who I've known for 15 years, one of the most talented people, I think, in the business. He's busy with a lot of other things, but we do have a commitment now that Kevin Mayer, who built Disney+ will be in the car with -- as a consultant with JB and I and Bruce and Gunnar and the whole team, as we've already built, as we've talked about, a go-to-market strategy. We're going to be honing that. Kevin has a big brain. He's learned a lot about this. We've learned a lot in Europe and with discovery+. We've been at it for a long time, but he had a lot of success at Disney. He's super excited about getting in the car with us and helping us with everything that he's learned. A lot of knowledge about windowing, about how different pieces of content, whether it's movies perform. We're anxious to get in a room with Anne and the team at Warner. I was there last week, meeting for the first time with Ann's whole team, but they're super smart over there. And so we think adding Kevin to the overall team is going to be helpful to us. And off we go. Who's got the best menu? I think we got the best menu."

And so I think it's a big, big helper to us that we had a very strong upfront. 
There are supply chain issues. There are put level issues. But we're still seeing that there will be material growth in advertising, and we can't predict what's going to happen in the future. But as I've said before, I saw a lot of people in the mid-90s saying that it's the end of broadcast television. It may be a transition away from a lot of the younger demo being on there, but we see huge numbers. And we're not getting credit for it. But I think one of the reasons why the ad market was up so much for us is the advertisers know there's a massive audience over 55 watching food, watching HG, watching Discovery, watching ID, and they get those. Right now, they get them for free. We talked about in the upfront, a number of us in the industry. Independently, we're out there trying to get credit for that. 
But I think that the linear platform is here for quite a long time, and there'll be ups and downs on advertising. But advertisers, they find it's very effective to be in linear video, much more effective than others. And then we have the complement of discovery+, which is just a huge driver for us in terms of the demo complements and attractiveness. Gunnar?"

I'm just wondering what pieces do you think you're missing in the combined company."

Let me start by saying, look, I don't think we're missing anything. And the first thing we're going to do is look to drive all the tremendous assets and a differentiated IP and the great library and local content that we have, pull it all together and go to market. We think we have something quite strong. I'm just making the point that there will -- given that we're going to be delevering quicker given the fact that we're -- we will be much lower levered than expected, that over time, as others are struggling, that there'll be an opportunity for us to look at IP and to see where we need more help if we need more help. 
On the integration side, we're really lucky. We got 2 big tentpoles here. One is Gunnar will be the CFO of this company. He did -- he's done an exceptional job. He led the initiative with Scripps, where we said we'd be less than 3.5x levered 2 years later, and we did it in less than a year. And we said we'd deliver $350 million, and we delivered over $1 billion. And all of that was just cost not revenue synergy. 
He came up with these targets and is quite confident in those targets. And so Gunnar will be kind of the lead horse. He'll talk to it. We have a very experienced team here. Bruce Campbell and JB and Adrian and I have been together for 25 years. We're looking forward to bringing in some incredibly talented people at Warner. But when we acquired Universal, JB was the one for Bob Reitan, for Jeff Immelt that ran the integration of that entire transaction, which was cable, movies, theme parks, with over 146 work teams and work groups and did a magnificent job on that. And so we're fully deployed. We got -- there's a lot that we can't do now, but Gunnar, why don't I pass it off to you and JB?"
22666093,1685135542,2422716,"Discovery, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Yes.

But again, I mean, from the perspective of challenges, again, as I've been saying from the very beginning, we've taken a conservative approach to this, and we're very well aware of the size of the checks that we're writing here for this combination, and we have been careful with our assumptions. So all the work that we've done since gives me more and more confidence in our ability to deliver or out [indiscernible] against these synergies. 
As I -- as David said and as I said earlier in the prepared remarks, doing more work now, having transparency into albeit draft carve-out financials for the WarnerMedia carve-out group, as I said, the cash payment is going to be a significantly lower one from today's perspective. That gives us a better starting point from a leverage perspective. And as we said earlier, this sort of below 4.5x leverage that we're seeing right now is, to a large extent, driven by working capital adjustments. But to some extent, it's also driven by our current performance, both for the P&L and the free cash flow being above what we assumed in our conservative agency model that we base our first communication on. 
So again, it's early still. We obviously still can only do so much until we have regulatory clearance. But as we said, that the team is up and running. Simon Robinson, our Chief Transformation Officer, and his team fully redirected at this now so that we hit the ground running, and I think we're in very good shape. You are pointing out, obviously, 1 of the key questions here with the tech platforms, JB, why don't you give a perspective on how we're looking at that?"

And I don't think necessarily the decision is a monolithic one. We look at these as multiple different modules that make up all the different components of both their and our tech platforms. And we have a lot of experience, as you mentioned, in terms of the effort and the work and the discipline required in re-platforming either one to the other in one direction or the other. That decision, we haven't made yet, but we're undergoing obviously, a significant diligence process to understand which is the best in class on both. And it may be a little bit of a combination of those depending on certain modules in the platform that we may apply. 
And so we think it's actually a great opportunity because Rich and Jason and the team on their side have obviously spent a lot of time and are investing a lot in upgrading their tech platform as we speak. We've obviously spent a lot of time and a lot of money doing the same over the course of the last 12 to 18 months. And as the 2 groups come together, we will have essentially a choice of a -- what we think will be an incredibly attractive kind of tech buffet that we will look to make the best of both to decide how we move into a common platform going forward."

And I think the other thing to keep in mind is, yes, part of what -- in David's comments about us being more disciplined and tactical at this stage of phasing the further rollouts of discovery+, for example, is also a view towards we may be able to more quickly in markets where we may not have launched discovery+ to be able to quickly fold -- more quickly fold the content offering into a joint platform at that stage versus having to replatform 2 existing platforms in a market into one. 
And so I think speed to market will be a variant of both where we have and haven't launched, number one. And number two, while we -- the final decisions on exactly which parts of the tech platform we migrate to will influence how long it takes us to get there. But remember that there may be 2 phases to this where there may be an initial phase which allows for more of a quick bundling of services and a second phase, which eventually allows for, obviously, a common service on one tech platform. That's the time line and evolution, certainly, Jessica, that we'll talk to you more in detail as soon as we can give you more color."

Obviously, there's streaming related costs, et cetera. But a lot of it is fixed. And so there's a huge opportunity to completely sort of deduplicate that spend base. And to JB's point of multiple ways, especially on the marketing side, I have no doubt that we will out of the gate sort of even in the first phase before fully aligning tech platforms, we'll be able to get a lot of leverage out of the combined marketing spend."

One of the real advantages of Discovery is for 20 years, we've been in market with local teams, selling locally, producing local content throughout Latin America, throughout Europe. In Europe, we expanded into free-to-air in a number of markets where we're the equivalent of NBC or CBS and some markets, we're the equivalent of like NBC and CBS combined. In Northern Europe, in Poland, we're quite big with a number of free-to-air channels in Italy and Germany. And we have a library that's meaningful in each of those markets. And we have a lot of data on what people are watching. We have a good sense of what kind of content they're looking at on the direct-to-consumer platforms because we've been at it for a long time. 
We also have sports in Europe. And we've tried a lot of things. Some haven't worked out as well as we'd expect, and that's a good thing, because we've learned that sometimes packaging the sports independently doesn't work as well as packaging it more broadly. A number of sports together reduces the churn significantly, makes the appeal higher when you put sports together with entertainment, together with nonfiction. We came out with the Olympics. We had 1 million-plus sign-ups for the Olympics. 
And so we continue to learn. That's a good thing. We're continuing to invest, learn and grow. That's what John and Jason and Anne and the team is continuing to do on a parallel basis independently. But as we come together, we'll all be smarter. You look at at what people thought about windowing of just as a student of this and the meetings I'm having. What's the right windowing strategy? What works best for a direct-to-consumer product? Is it better to have -- to build up a movie in the theater and then bring it? Is it stronger on the platform if it goes day in date? Is it stronger if it goes day and date at $30 versus free? There's a lot that we are learning just as observers. And there's a tremendous amount that Jason has learned and Anne and that Disney has learned and that the industry has learned. 
And one of the great benefits for me is I have this ability to really listen. And also, this has been a great experiment in how people are consuming content and when people come on for a movie or series, what's the reaction. A lot of what is on the Warner side I haven't seen because at this point, we can't see it. But the general industry knowledge and trends are things that we're noting aggressively, and we're learning from. And we're continuing to experiment in Europe. 
On the news side, we've been experimenting ourselves. And in Poland, we went independent. Now we're packaging it together. I think it's going to -- it is probably going to depend on the market, and it depends on the offering. We have a very, very strong service in Poland, and it's been very helpful to us. We're one of the leading voices in the market. We have a 24-hour news channel there that's quite compelling. We don't know what the right answer yet, but having news and sports -- news is -- the more people go to a direct-to-consumer product, the lower the churn. The more time they spend, the lower the churn. That's why we're so excited about how much time people are spending with discovery+, which has a library that's being broadly viewed and the idea that people spending hours on that product and the churn is low is encouraging for what bodes for the combination of the 2. 
But as people -- if you could put news or sports and people also go regularly for that, it's another reason to have the service. It's another reason to value the service. It's another reason not to churn out of the service. And Disney has been very effective in doing packaging of services where you don't put them together, bundling. And so -- and that's the current plan right now for CNN as we've read about it, and so it's exciting and we'll look and see."

So first, given the deal, it clearly makes sense to take a more disciplined approach to your DTC strategy I assume this will drive some near-term financial benefits. So can you provide a bit more color on the DTC investment levels going ahead? I know you called out the low $200 million range for Q3 and Q4. Where are you seeing some opportunities here? And is that a good quarterly run rate through deal close? Or can the losses continue to be narrow given the strong top line trends? 
And then just second, the accelerated path to deleveraging post deal close is very encouraging. Is there any more color you can provide on the drivers for both Discovery stand-alone where you continue to deliver robust free cash flow and then on the pro forma outlook. Just Gunner, it's fantastic to hear about your continued role here, and I know you provided a lot of details already, but any more specifics on the improved pro forma leverage targets, particularly if there's an updated view on pro forma EBITDA given maybe some minor asset sales from the WarnerMedia side?"
22666093,1685135542,2422716,"Discovery, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Kutgun. So let me start with the delevering piece here and give a little more color. Again, there are 2 things that we have updated. One is sort of our model of how we look at pro forma combined financials for the company. And number 2 i",669,"Great. Thank you, Kutgun. So let me start with the delevering piece here and give a little more color. Again, there are 2 things that we have updated. One is sort of our model of how we look at pro forma combined financials for the company. And number 2 is just flowing through our current performance. And that's, by the way, linked to your first question as well, because we're just doing a lot better and we're generating a lot more free cash flow than what we anticipated half a year ago. 
But if you take a step back, the challenge here is that WarnerMedia is not a stand-alone company but is a carve-out group. We obviously made certain assumptions about what the balance sheet of that company and carve-out group would look like but had to wait for some still draft carve-out financials to get full confidence in the financial setup of that combined entity. And accordingly, what we put into our model and what I presented to rating agencies for the rating discussion was a conservative model not fully flowing through certain adjustments. The most important one of which is the working capital adjustment. 
So we have always talked about the $43 billion as subject to adjustments, and that's the working capital adjustment. From today's perspective, that looks like it's going to be $4 billion, $5 billion lower in terms of what the net payment is going to be with an impact on the net debt balance that we're going to start this company with. And then that has obviously a very significant impact on leverage. So the second thing, though, is about 25% or 30% of this improvement here is just driven by our better operating performance. obviously, better AOIBDA improves the denominator of that leverage equation, and that's developed very nicely as well. 
And I do want to caveat this. As we said right now, it looks below 4.5x. This number is going to move around with working capital. But what's not going to change, in my view, is the very significantly increased confidence that I have in our ability to very, very quickly delever below the 3x and to very quickly get us into the long-term comfortable leverage target range. And again, the other point I want to keep pointing out is we have already -- I got a lot of questions on this, we have already anticipated very significant reinvestments in our business case. 
To your first question, on the DTC investment, I'll let JB talk about some of the opportunities a little more because we do have, obviously, the Olympics coming up and market launches kicking in here. But you're right in general, we've always looked at and we'll continue to look at capital allocation through the lens of risk and return. The return side is is almost fairly easy in this space because it's just the relationship between customer lifetime value and subscriber acquisition costs. And it is fair to say that I've asked the marketing teams to give us a little more cushion between the 2 in order to manage some of the uncertainties as we go into the scenarios for next year. 
So you're right, we should see lower investment losses, especially if you keep in mind that at the beginning of next year, we're starting to comp against the very significant investments that we made in the first quarter of 2020 as we launched the U.S. product. At the same time, I also do want to point out we're continuing, as David said it, we're continuing to really nourish the existing subscriber base that we have. We're continuing to invest in content in a significant way. So keep that in mind as well over the next few quarters. You will continue to see content expense coming up. We're also continuing to invest in technology and product features, but just a little less focused, I would say, in the mix on necessarily driving for the every last subscriber. JB?"

So we are getting the same questions from partners which is totally legitimate and sort of that is making us, in some cases, rethink when is the right time to launch and a lot of that is largely when there -- those things are being pushed off, is a pushing off of marketing and in some cases, content expense to later when we have a better view of what the the combined product will look like and we can come back to our partners with a more definitive sense of when and what we will be launching together."

I'd just be curious how you think about that. And then just lastly, I couldn't tell on your commentary, are you planning on keeping HBO Max and discovery+ separate?

I mean, Rich, on the channel store question, the reality is they've obviously been a very good partner of ours on the Discovery side. We're well aware that as you said, HBO is taking a different position. I think the 3 questions that we have -- that we are waiting to engage further with the HBO side is, number one, we have found so far that it there's the question about these channel stores bringing in a different customer base than what we might be able to address directly is an ongoing question. And we've certainly seen some good incremental subscriber growth coming from that channel store ecosystem and how much of that is cannibalistic versus what we could do direct or not is an ongoing set of analysis that we have going. And obviously, we want to compare notes with the HBO team at the right time. But that's a question because ultimately, we want to try and get our product out to as many consumers on whatever platforms as necessary. 
The second is the data element and the customer relationship, which I think is a little less known. And I think as some of the Amazon executives have talked about publicly now, we do have access to customer information as part of our relationship, and that's an important differentiator. That doesn't make this just a sort of traditional anonymized handle store relationship but where we actually have customer information on the channel store consumer. And so that makes the equation a little bit different. 
And so you overlay those 2 things, and we say, the third thing is, obviously, we want to have more engaged conversations with the Warner team and look and see whether the strategy that they're following today or the strategy that we are following today makes sense for the combined and the North Star will be 2 things, which is ultimately how do we get the product in front of more consumers in aggregate, and how do we do it in a financially strong way. And if we think we can deliver a -- still get the customer relationship but get in front of more people with the right economics, I think it's one that we will certainly remain very open to. So we haven't made a decision definitively, but we're remaining very open, and we'll certainly -- that will be part of the story when we come back to you, Rich and the team. We'll tell you more about it at the right time."

Should we assume that you get there a little more quickly just because you're going to be starting from a lower base? Or is it more that you'll just have a bit more flexibility starting from that 4.5x or below? And then maybe one for JB on discovery+ and NextGen. Is it logical for us to assume maybe just a little bit slower pace of net adds going forward as you take a more focused approach and sort of avoid stepping into places where HBO is strong and be a bit more selective? And if that is the case, I'm wondering if there's some free cash flow benefit to that near-term strategy just because stock expense runs a little bit lower."

Yes, Steve. So yes, I mean, I'll start with the flexibility. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks, I am very convinced from today's perspective that we're going to hit that upper end of our target range of 3x earlier than we originally mentioned. And it is the 2.5x to 3x range that I want to see going forward. And to your question about flexibility, we don't need flexibility because our deal model already assumes very significant reinvestments and further investments in building out the DTC product and growing content expenses over the 5-year term here that we have modeled. So clear answer is, yes, very hopeful that we will be hitting that upper end of the 2.5 to 3x range earlier. 
Regarding raising debt, again, we've mentioned the $15 billion hedge that we have put on and pretty much in line with what I said earlier about the conservatism in our initial model. The answer is yes, there is some room. We have obviously taken some conservatism as well as we modeled out our interest rates. We've locked in very attractive rates with this $15 billion hedge program. Again, I don't want to make any promises. We'll -- it still will be some time before we implement the financing, but a good part is hedged now. We'll have to monitor the spreads as well. But I believe that we're in a very, very comfortable position relative to what we put out in the original statement and in our deal models. 
And before I hand it off to JB for the subscriber outlook here, the financial part of that question is you should absolutely assume further free cash flow performance here as we move forward. I do want to have the balance sheet in the best possible shape as we come up on closing the deal. And as I said earlier, I now explicitly guided to at least $2.1 billion of free cash flow, so a significantly higher conversion than what we went into the year with and what we guided at the beginning of the year, and that's all part of our ambition here to be disciplined and get this balance sheet in perfect shape.

And so we're excited about that, and we still see healthy growth out of those markets, and we're spending at levels, to Gunnar's point, that we think are reasonable without leaning too far in, but they'd be the sort of slightly more conservative fact to LTV ratios that we're spending at plus the slowdown in some of the new market launches as we go towards the end of the year and into 2022. 
It doesn't mean that the net adds numbers will be a little bit slower than they might have been in the past. And maybe worth just, Rich, I realized we didn't hit Rich's second question about the bundling clarification. I think David and my point on the bundling was purely that in -- back to Jessica's question about the tech rollout, it will take a bit of time, no question to come to 1 platform. And so while that process is underway, there will be opportunities in a much quicker fashion closer to day 1 to potentially do some very creative bundling propositions. That is an interim strategy, not a long-term strategy, I think, at this point is what we'd say."

I think he's seen and learned more about Europe and sports. And so I think that's exciting. The team at Warner and the way they're growing, the knowledge, the capability there, the attack plan that they have is really impressive. Andy Fossil is super strong.

On the affiliate side, and Gunnar, you could fill in some more. But I think we reached deals that were very favorable for us. on the carriage side, very strong. And I think it's win-win. They want to commit to carry all of our channels. This whole idea that a bunch of our channels were going to get dropped, that never happened. They're good value. I don't say that with great glee. But when you look at the overall package and the viewership, we're a great value, and they're making a lot of money selling advertising on our services. So it went very well for us with meaningful increases and real security, and I think it went well for them and continuing to get really good products. 
And in terms of how do we -- how does this align with Warner has nothing to do with it. We're operating as an independent company, and we're operating on the strength of the channels that Kathleen Finch and Nancy have been building here with Discovery and Oprah and Food and HG. And so it's -- we've been overdelivering. People love our stuff, and it's just a reinforcing of this narrative that despite the fact that the world is changing, that we were able to get deals with some of the toughest and strongest and most knowledgeable distributors on very favorable terms with strong carriage commitments as we make this transition together. And so I think that's -- it's a very good sign for the 2 sides. Gunnar, anything to add?"

Subscriber growth for our direct-to-consumer platforms picked up nicely post summer, and we added a healthy 3 million paying subscribers around the globe, reaching a total of 20 million subscribers. And we've seen continued growth thus far in Q4.
We were able to deliver this growth as well as driving double-digit growth in both advertising and distribution revenues while converting a healthy amount of OIBDA to free cash flow. This positions us nicely above our guidance of at least 50% conversion this year, and we see free cash flow is tracking to exceed $2.1 billion for the full year, and that's after funding very significant investments in our discovery+ rollout. 
Additionally and importantly, we have had the opportunity to refine some of our transaction leverage assumptions after examining WarnerMedia's draft carve-out financials. Though we took a conservative approach initially while modeling the pro forma transaction, we now expect our net leverage at close to be at or below 4.5x versus the 5x that we noted in May, and we are currently tracking below the 4.5. This is predominantly based on estimated contractual adjustments to working capital and, to a lesser extent, an improved outlook in our operating performance. 
Accordingly, we now see a path to reducing leverage to around 3x, meaningfully sooner than what we articulated in May. More on this shortly from Gunnar. But this points to a stronger financial footing than we had anticipated as we stand up the merged company and accelerate the pace to delever, supporting our ability to make focused investments in growth initiatives even without any asset sales.
On the regulatory front, echoing John Stankey's comments on the AT&T call, we are well on track for a mid-2022 close and are engaged in the typical regulatory filing process in jurisdictions around the globe, including our planned filing with the SEC of a preliminary draft of our merger proxy expected out in late November. The transformative upside from the merger is, of course, the global direct-to-consumer opportunity. And while we appreciate some of the questions that a number of you have asked regarding clarity and specifics regarding the product, investment and go-to-market road map, it is still premature for us to provide details, given where we are in the ongoing regulatory review process.
That said, having conducted further operational and strategic diligence, I can share with you some broad strokes around what underpins our confidence and enthusiasm in our global go-to-market attack plan. First, it's all about the content. From the start, under one roof, will be a combination of 2 companies whose common culture of creative excellence, iconic characters and franchises will result in a differentiated competitive offering. I believe the biggest and most compelling menu of IP for consumers in the world, spanning comedy to true crime, kids and family, lifestyle to adventure, drama to documentaries, news and sports and, of course, sci-fi and superheroes. I believe the most complete and balanced portfolio offered in one service in the world.
And secondly, we view our ability and commitment to tactically invest in our content portfolio as a critical strategic driver, building upon our respective long-tenured track records of producing relevant and complementary programming around the globe. This should help to make our service uniquely global and local at the same time.
Third, given the breadth of our content offering, we expect the combined service will appeal broadly to all demographics, young and old, with strong male and female genres, again, very complementary such that our global total addressable market should be on par with the biggest streaming service.
Assessing the overlap in respective subscriber bases, at least here in the U.S., we believe less than half of discovery+ subscribers are also HBO Max subscribers, which, with the right packaging, provides a real opportunity to broaden the base of our combined offering. And with our global appeal, infrastructure and local market capabilities, our international road map is very much still untapped and provides meaningful upside over the coming years.
Lastly, our ability to drive revenue and ARPU positions us well for long-term growth, particularly given our plans to market with a lower-priced AdLite service, starting off in the U.S. and later in key international markets, a meaningful distinction from some competitors where we see an opportunity to drive value. We gained confidence in this strategic direction from our experience with ad monetization on discovery+ in the U.S., where advertisers covet the incremental reach, demos, targetability and product flexibility and pay premium rates to address this audience, helping make this tier our highest ARPU offering.
The opportunity to scale an AdLite offering represents one of the most significant upside drivers for the company long term, while offering a compelling value to more price-sensitive consumers and will benefit from Discovery's depth in local ad sales infrastructure and teams around the world to help monetize. It's quite clear that the winners in streaming are and will be those companies that can provide consumers with the best quality stories, the most appealing content choices, personalized and simple products and all at a great value. We expect our highly complementary combination will drive such a winning value proposition and will be reflected across key operating metrics over time.
A few words on the linear side of the house before turning over to Gunnar. As we think about what can be achieved in terms of bringing great networks and brands together under one roof, the analog to Scripps is a valuable benchmark. And we believe the opportunity is far greater here, both on costs and advertising revenue potential, ultimately, to better support our core linear business and, more broadly, the entire traditional ecosystem. This, I believe, is one of the least appreciated elements of this transaction.
Considered with Scripps, the platform we created in aggregating female demos, the bedrock on which we launched Premiere, our product that offers advertisers the unduplicated reach of a broadcast network across all of our prime time originals at significantly more efficient CPMs than broadcast. We can take that advertising platform to the next level by weaving in sports, scripted news and mail-oriented programming, together with our existing core competencies. It's a true win-win, generating significant revenue upside to us with improved options, efficiency and savings to our advertising partners by replicating the reach of a broadcast network at better value. 
Cost synergy opportunities are significant. We draw upon the expertise of our transformation office, which, since our merger with Scripps Networks in 2018, continuously challenges our management team and me to refine and transform how we conduct and manage our organization from top to bottom around the globe. Nothing is sacred, and no stone is unturned.
With Scripps, we ultimately captured more than $1 billion in cost savings, representing about 35% of all non-content expenses and about 3x our original synergy target before we stop attributing incremental savings to the merger. A large chunk of the cost synergy opportunity that we have already conveyed speaks to the best practices and tailwind in place from the integration of Scripps. It's a great starting point.
As we refine and integrate global ops, enterprise tech, corporate functions, real estate, direct-to-consumer infrastructure and tech and streamline efforts across duplicative functions like SG&A and marketing spend, a process that we see broken down into 3 distinct waves over the next few years. We approached $3 billion in cost saves as a tangible and achievable goal, especially against the combined company that should spend around $35 billion this year and growing from there.
Stepping back for a moment to reflect on our direct-to-consumer pivot. Nearing a year since discovery+ launched, I'm proud of what we have accomplished under the leadership of JB and the world-class team we have assembled over the last few years. We continue to learn a great deal, challenge ourselves, sharpening our focus and gaining perspective for the next leg of our direct-to-consumer journey with WarnerMedia and HBO. 
And as we've noted recently, we continue to refine our discovery+ plans, taking a more thoughtful and tactical approach to investing in the product, and doing so in ways that also support our plans for the combined company after we close the transaction. For example, we are moving forward in priority markets. such as Canada, Italy, Brazil and the U.K., some of which are where HBO Max hasn't announced plans or, in some cases, has indicated that they cannot launch in the near to medium term for contractual reasons.
As you heard from John, Jason and the team on their earnings call, HBO Max continues to aggressively move forward with their global expansion plans. Most recently in LatAm, and last week in Europe. And we look forward to closing the transaction so that we can coordinate and maximize our marketing, technology and content spend for the enhancement of the combined effort. Until such time, we continue to roll out new and exciting content to entertain and sustain our subscribers around the globe.
And our metrics look great. Roll to pay remains near 75% globally. Churn, particularly in the U.S., continues to look strong and approaching peer group lows, while App Store ratings are firmly at the top while monetization and engagement continued to exceed our expectations, all of which helps to solidify our discovery+ base as we endeavor to roll into and formulate a more comprehensive and broader offering with HBO Max.
In closing, this is an exciting and dynamic time for us as we plan our next steps, and we are as eager to share them as we know you are to hear them, and we expect that will be in short order. While the opportunity for course capture and enhanced efficiency is both tangible and material, our North Star, our right to play will be in achieving long-term sustainable financial growth resulting from the combination of these 2 great content companies, helping to nurture our important linear presence while driving global scale across our direct-to-consumer platform, anchored by as rich and relevant portfolio of creative franchises anywhere in the world.
I'd now like to turn it over to Gunnar. After which, JB, Gunnar and I will be happy to answer any of your questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.Reiterating David's comments, I'm pleased with what the Discovery team has achieved since the discovery+ Analyst Day not even a year ago. Over that time, we have added 15 milli",1375,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
Reiterating David's comments, I'm pleased with what the Discovery team has achieved since the discovery+ Analyst Day not even a year ago. Over that time, we have added 15 million paying direct-to-consumer subscribers globally, finishing the third quarter with 20 million paying DTC subscribers. Since the start of our discovery+ journey, we have launched in over 25 new markets, notably the U.S. and the U.K., and most recently, Canada and the Philippines, with Brazil to come over the next few weeks. At the same time, we have continued to drive growth in markets like Poland, the Nordics, Italy and India, where we doubled down on our direct-to-consumer efforts with a renewed and expanded content offering.
And our next-generation revenues finished the third quarter with $425 million for the quarter or a $1.7 billion annualized run rate with global D2C ARPU of approximately $5 and $7 blended discovery+ ARPU in the U.S., again, supported by our over $10 ARPU for the discovery+ AdLite product, which continues to monetize very well. Investment losses for the quarter were in the low $200 million range, slightly better than our guidance from last quarter, and we expect investment losses more or less in that range in the fourth quarter as well. 
As always, we maintain a disciplined approach with respect to investing in direct-to-consumer initiatives. As both David and I have noted over the last few months, it is through this lens that we view the opportunity ahead, both leading up to the merger and beyond. We are very focused on nourishing our existing subscriber base with an increasing content offering and new product features. At the same time, you should expect us to be guided by a rigorous analysis of customer lifetime value and subscriber acquisition cost to determine our marketing spend for new sub-additions.
And now I'd like to quickly review our reporting segments. Starting with the U.S., third quarter advertising revenues increased 5% year-over-year. Pricing was healthy versus last year, driven by scatter pricing that was up 40% year-over-year. Additionally, we continue to see strong demand for our discovery+ AdLite product, which contributed to the growth in the quarter. This was partly offset by weaker audience delivery year-over-year, some of it's attributable to the Nielsen panel issues as well as the lapping of our very strong performance last year during the pandemic. Furthermore, some of our networks have lost share to the strong sports calendar this year.
While scatter pricing is still very healthy in Q4, up 30% to 35% over both upfront and last year, the overall tone in the market is a bit more subdued than last few quarters as clients work through the constraints in the global supply chain. And though there is slightly less visibility as a result, we are very pleased with how our portfolio is positioned based on the strength from the upfront and contribution from direct to consumer. Distribution revenues increased 21% year-over-year, largely due to the continued growth of discovery+ as well as linear affiliate rate increases, in part helped by successful renewals with DIRECTV, Verizon, Hulu and Altice so far this year.
As disclosed in our earnings release, pay-TV subscribers to our fully distributed linear networks declined by 3% year-over-year, while total portfolio linear subscribers declined 4% excluding the impact of the sale of our Great American Country network last quarter.
Turning to international, which I will, as always, discuss on a constant currency basis. International advertising increased 26% versus last year as the global advertising marketplace continued to recover from the pandemic. We also benefited from the Olympics in Europe across our linear and digital platform. Although as we've noted in the past, advertising for the Olympic Games is less consequential in Europe as compared to the U.S. All of our international regions, including many of our key markets like the U.K., Germany, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Australia and New Zealand and Mexico were up meaningfully compared to last year as well as compared to 2019. We see momentum continuing into Q4, even as, needless to say, the year-over-year comps get tougher from here on out.
International distribution revenues grew 6% during the quarter, primarily due to the growth in direct-to-consumer subscribers, which have nearly tripled over the past year across our footprint outside the U.S., in part aided by the Olympic sign-ups.
Turning to operating expenses. Total company OpEx increased 50% during the quarter or 17% excluding the Olympics, for which the overall AOIBDA losses were in line with our guidance of around $200 million for the quarter. We continue to focus on driving efficiency in our core linear networks, and we remain on track to reduce core linear OpEx in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range for the year.
Turning to some housekeeping items. Net income for the quarter was $156 million or $0.24 per share on a diluted basis. A couple of items to note. First, we recognized a $0.12 per share noncash gain from the $15 billion of notional interest rate hedges that we recently implemented to mitigate interest rate risk for future debt issuances to finance the cash portion of the WarnerMedia transaction. The hedges provide additional security and visibility towards our overall cost of deal-related debt financing, which is now trending better than our initial expectations. And the final note on this, as the derivatives do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes, we are required to report the changes in fair market value on our income statement, which could result in some additional variability to our net income until the WarnerMedia transaction closes. We will, of course, call this impact out each quarter.
Second, the impact of PPA amortization during the third quarter was $0.30 per share. Adjusted for the above, EPS would have been $0.42 per diluted share. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 15%, and we continue to expect the full year effective book tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. For cash taxes, we continue to anticipate a rate in the high 20% range for the year, excluding PPA amortization, though this is subject to change as we are carefully monitoring ongoing tax legislation. And we expect FX to have roughly a negative $15 million year-over-year impact on revenues and a negative $10 million impact on AOIBDA in the fourth quarter.
Now turning to free cash flow and our leverage. We generated $705 million of free cash flow in the quarter, obviously, a very strong conversion rate of AOIBDA, notwithstanding the continuing investments we're making as well as the return to normalized content production levels. Year-to-date, our AOIBDA to free cash flow conversion rate is over 60%. And with a few months left in the quarter, we see free cash flow topping $2.1 billion for the full year and clearly ahead of our 50% conversion guidance.
And to expand on the point that David made earlier, we now expect our net leverage to be at or below 4.5x by the time we close the WarnerMedia merger. Over the past few months, having had the opportunity to dig further into WarnerMedia's draft carve-out financials and with better visibility on estimated working capital in conjunction with our better P&L and free cash flow performance, we now believe that we will have a healthy amount less net debt at closing than originally anticipated. While naturally, these metrics are preliminary and a function of working capital at close, we now do expect to be in a position to reduce leverage to 3x meaningfully sooner than what we stated in May. Our long-term target net leverage range for Warner Bros. Discovery remains at 2.5 to 3x. 
As we work towards closing the WarnerMedia transaction in mid-2022, we have redirected our experienced integration and transformation office to hit the ground running. And as we refine our strategic review and integration plans and as we develop our synergy capture plans further, we are as enthusiastic as ever about the prospects of combining these 2 world-class portfolios and franchises.
With that, we look forward to sharing a lot more in due time. And for now, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to start taking your questions."

First, this is something that John Stankey and I talked about as we created this vision together of this company being what we believe is the best media company with the greatest and most comprehensive content offering. And as part of that,",700,"Thanks, Doug. First, this is something that John Stankey and I talked about as we created this vision together of this company being what we believe is the best media company with the greatest and most comprehensive content offering. And as part of that, we're spending more money on content and leaning in, and WarnerMedia is spending more money on content and leaning in. We both committed to do that to keep both of our ecosystems nourished and strong and growing. So when the deal -- when and if the deal gets approved, then we come together -- we'll come together with strength. And you see that with -- on the Warner side, where we're cheering them on with the success of Dune around the world with Ann and Tobi on that side and Casey Bloys having an incredible run at HBO with succession, White LOTUS, Hacks, Mare of Easttown. It's just -- if you look at the culture and the impact of that content, together with the extraordinary library they have, us leaning in on our side with more original content.
And so for us, we're also spending a lot more on the international side to get ready. We think that's a strategic advantage. And when you look at the content, we think, in terms of the demographics, that we will appeal broadly to every demo. I mentioned this, but we're very strong with women. That's a particular strength of Discovery where we're doing many quarters with the leading media company in America for women, together with the length of view of women watching our channels, whether it's food or HG or Oprah or ID and TLC and that's continuing.
In addition, we look around the world. It's not just local content, but we're the leader in sports in Europe. They have sports in Latin America. And CNN is the leader in news with the most compelling news brand around the world. And one of the few global -- maybe the only global new service that has the kind of resources around the world in news gathering. And so as we go out and build this service and make this offering, and I do think it's the best content wins, there's a great product in Netflix and entertainment. There's a great product with Disney, with Chabeck is building with entertainment. And we think we have a comparable product, maybe even more diversely attractive in entertainment. 
But on top of that, we also have sports, which we're using in Europe and learning a lot from. And in markets like Poland where we're doing news and sports together with broad entertainment and nonfiction, we're finding real meaningful traction and real reduction in churn. And so I think we have a lot to learn, but we have a terrific product, and we're working on our go to market.
We have brought on an old friend of mine who I've known for 15 years, one of the most talented people, I think, in the business. He's busy with a lot of other things, but we do have a commitment now that Kevin Mayer, who built Disney+ will be in the car with -- as a consultant with JB and I and Bruce and Gunnar and the whole team, as we've already built, as we've talked about, a go-to-market strategy. We're going to be honing that. 
Kevin has a big brain. He's learned a lot about this. We've learned a lot in Europe and with discovery+. We've been at it for a long time, but he had a lot of success at Disney. He's super excited about getting in the car with us and helping us with everything that he's learned. A lot of knowledge about windowing, about how different pieces of content, whether it's movies perform. We're anxious to get in a room with Ann and the team at Warner. I was there last week, meeting for the first time with Ann's whole team. But they're super smart over there, and so we think adding Kevin to the overall team is going to be helpful to us. And off we go. Who's got the best menu? I think we got the best menu."

And so I think it's a big, big helper to us that we had a very strong upfront.
There are supply chain issues. There are put level issues. But we're still seeing that there will be material growth in advertising, and we can't predict what's going to happen in the future. But as I've said before, I saw a lot of people in the mid-90s saying that it's the end of broadcast television. It may be a transition away from a lot of the younger demo being on there, but we see huge numbers. And we're not getting credit for it, but I think one of the reasons why the ad market was up so much for us is the advertisers know there's a massive audience over 55 watching food, watching HG, watching Discovery, watching ID, and they get those. Right now, they get them for free. We talked about in the upfront, a number of us in the industry. Independently, we're out there trying to get credit for that.
But I think that the linear platform is here for quite a long time, and there'll be ups and downs on advertising. But advertisers, they find it's very effective to be in linear video, much more effective than others. And then we have the complement of discovery+, which is just a huge driver for us in terms of the demo complements and attractiveness. Gunnar?"

On the integration side, we're really lucky. We got 2 big tent poles here. One is Gunnar will be the CFO of this company. He did -- he's done an exceptional job. He led the initiative with Scripps, where we said we'd be less than 3.5x levered 2 years later, and we did it in less than a year. And we said we'd deliver $350 million, and we delivered over $1 billion. And all of that was just cost not revenue synergy. He came up with these targets and he's quite confident in those targets. And so Gunnar will be kind of the lead horse. He'll talk to it. 
We have a very experienced team here. Bruce Campbell and JB and Adrian and I have been together for 25 years. We're looking forward to bringing in some incredibly talented people at Warner. But when we acquired Universal, JB was the one for Bob Reitan, for Jeff Immelt that ran the integration of that entire transaction, well, which was cable, movies, theme parks, with over 146 work teams and work groups and did a magnificent job on that. And so we're fully deployed. We got -- there's a lot that we can't do now, but Gunnar, why don't I pass it off to you and JB?"

But again, I mean, from the perspective of challenges, again, as I've been saying from the very beginning, we've taken a conservative approach to this, and we're very well aware of the size of the checks that we're writing here for this combination, and we have been careful with our assumptions. So all the work that we've done since gives me more and more confidence in our ability to deliver or outperform against these synergies.
As I -- as David said and as I said earlier in the prepared remarks, doing more work now, having transparency into albeit draft carve-out financials for the WarnerMedia carve-out group, as I said, the cash payment is going to be a significantly lower one from today's perspective. That gives us a better starting point from a leverage perspective. And as we said earlier, this sort of below 4.5x leverage that we're seeing right now is, to a large extent, driven by working capital adjustments. But to some extent, it's also driven by our current performance, both for the P&L and the free cash flow being above what we assumed in our conservative agency model that we base our first communication on.
So again, it's early still. We obviously still can only do so much until we have regulatory clearance. But as we said, the team is up and running. Simon Robinson, our Chief Transformation Officer, and his team fully redirected at this now so that we hit the ground running, and I think we're in very good shape. You are pointing out, obviously, one of the key questions here with the tech platforms. JB, why don't you give a perspective on how we're looking at that?"

And we have a lot of experience, as you mentioned, in terms of the effort and the work and the discipline required in re-platforming either one to the other -- in one direction or the other. That decision, we haven't made yet, but we're undergoing obviously a significant diligence process to underscore which is the best in class on both. And it may be a little bit of a combination of those depending on certain modules in the platform that we may apply.
And so we think it's actually a great opportunity because Rich and Jason and the team on their side have obviously spent a lot of time and are investing a lot in upgrading their tech platform as we speak. We've obviously spent a lot of time and a lot of money doing the same over the course of the last 12 to 18 months. And as the 2 groups come together, we will have essentially a choice of a -- what we think will be an incredibly attractive kind of tech buffet that we will look to make the best of both to decide how we move into a common platform going forward."

And I think the other thing to keep in mind is, yes, part of what -- in David's comments about us being more disciplined and tactical at this stage of phasing the further rollouts of discovery+, for example, is also a view towards we may be able to more quickly in markets where we may not have launched discovery+ to be able to quickly fold -- more quickly fold the content offering into a joint platform at that stage versus having to replatform 2 existing platforms in a market into one.
And so I think speed to market will be a variant of both where we have and haven't launched, number one. And number two, while we -- the final decisions on exactly which parts of the tech platform we migrate to will influence how long it takes us to get there. But remember that there may be 2 phases to this where there may be an initial phase, which allows for more of a quick bundling of services and a second phase, which eventually allows for, obviously, a common service on one tech platform. That's the time line and evolution, certainly, Jessica, that we'll talk to you more in detail as soon as we can give you more color."

Again, what we said when we first announced this deal was, remember, there's roughly $6 billion in technology and marketing spend between the 2 platforms, and we're assuming growth. We brought together 2 companies with significant expansion plans. A lot of that spend is, by its nature, a fixed cost, relatively independent of the subscriber number. Obviously, there's streaming related costs, et cetera. But a lot of it is fixed. And so there's a huge opportunity to completely sort of deduplicate that spend base. And to JB's point of multiple ways, especially on the marketing side, I have no doubt that we will, out of the gate sort of even in the first phase before fully aligning tech platforms, we'll be able to get a lot of leverage out of the combined marketing spend."

One of the real advantages of Discovery is, for 20 years, we've been in market with local teams, selling locally, producing local content throughout Latin America, throughout Europe. In Europe, we expanded into free-to-air in a number of markets where we're the equivalent of NBC or CBS. In some markets, we're the equivalent of like NBC and CBS combined. In Northern Europe, in Poland, we're quite big with a number of free-to-air channels in Italy and Germany. And we have a library that's meaningful in each of those markets. And we have a lot of data on what people are watching. We have a good sense of what kind of content they're looking at on the direct-to-consumer platforms because we've been at it for a long time.
We also have sports in Europe. And we've tried a lot of things. Some haven't worked out as well as we'd expect, and that's a good thing because we've learned that sometimes packaging the sports independently doesn't work as well as packaging it more broadly. A number of sports together reduces the churn significantly, makes the appeal higher when you put sports together with entertainment, together with nonfiction. We came out with the Olympics. We had a million-plus sign-ups for the Olympics. And so we continue to learn. That's a good thing. We're continuing to invest, learn and grow. That's what John and Jason and Ann and the team is continuing to do on a parallel basis independently. 
But as we come together, we'll all be smarter. You look at what people thought about windowing of just as a student of this and the meetings I'm having. What's the right windowing strategy? What works best for a direct-to-consumer product? Is it better to have -- to build up a movie in the theater and then bring it? Is it stronger on the platform if it goes day and date? Is it stronger if it goes day and date at $30 versus free? There's a lot that we are learning just as observers. And there's a tremendous amount that Jason has learned and Ann and that Disney has learned and that the industry has learned. 
And one of the great benefits for me is I have this ability to really listen. And also, this has been a great experiment in how people are consuming content and when people come on for a movie or series, what's the reaction. A lot of what is on the Warner side I haven't seen because, at this point, we can't see it. But the general industry knowledge and trends are things that we're noting aggressively, and we're learning from. And we're continuing to experiment in Europe.
On the news side, we've been experimenting ourselves. And in Poland, we went independent. Now we're packaging it together. I think it's going to -- it is probably going to depend on the market, and it depends on the offering. We have a very, very strong service in Poland, and it's been very helpful to us. We're one of the leading voices in the market. We have a 24-hour news channel there that's quite compelling. We don't know what the right answer yet, but having news and sports -- news is -- the more people go to a direct-to-consumer product, the lower the churn. The more time they spend, the lower the churn. That's why we're so excited about how much time people are spending with discovery+, which has a library that's being broadly viewed and the idea that people spending hours on that product and the churn is low is encouraging for what bodes for the combination of the two.
But as people -- if you could put news or sports and people also go regularly for that, it's another reason to have the service. It's another reason to value the service. It's another reason not to churn out of the service. And Disney has been very effective in doing packaging of services where you don't put them together, bundling. And so -- and that's the current plan right now for CNN as we've read about it. And so it's exciting, and we'll look and see."

So let me start with the delevering piece here and give a little more color. Again, there are 2 things that we have updated. One is sort of our model of how we look at pro forma combined financials for the company. And number two",669,"Great. Thank you, Kutgun. So let me start with the delevering piece here and give a little more color. Again, there are 2 things that we have updated. One is sort of our model of how we look at pro forma combined financials for the company. And number two is just flowing through our current performance. And that's, by the way, linked to your first question as well because we're just doing a lot better and we're generating a lot more free cash flow than what we anticipated half a year ago.
But if you take a step back, the challenge here is that WarnerMedia is not a stand-alone company, but is a carve-out group. We obviously made certain assumptions about what the balance sheet of that company and carve-out group would look like, but had to wait for some still draft carve-out financials to get full confidence in the financial setup of that combined entity. And accordingly, what we put into our model and what I presented to rating agencies for the rating discussion was a conservative model not fully flowing through certain adjustments. The most important one of which is the working capital adjustment.
So we have always talked about the $43 billion as subject to adjustments, and that's the working capital adjustment. From today's perspective, that looks like it's going to be $4 billion, $5 billion lower in terms of what the net payment is going to be with an impact on the net debt balance that we're going to start this company with. And then that has obviously a very significant impact on leverage. 
So the second thing, though, is about 25% or 30% of this improvement here is just driven by our better operating performance. obviously, better AOIBDA improves the denominator of that leverage equation, and that's developed very nicely as well.
And I do want to caveat this. As we said, right now, it looks below 4.5x. This number is going to move around with working capital. But what's not going to change, in my view, is the very significantly increased confidence that I have in our ability to very, very quickly delever below the 3x and to very quickly get us into the long-term comfortable leverage target range. And again, the other point I want to keep pointing out is we have already -- I got a lot of questions on this, we have already anticipated very significant reinvestments in our business case.
To your first question, on the D2C investment, I'll let JB talk about some of the opportunities a little more because we do have, obviously, the Olympics coming up and market launches kicking in here. But you're right in general, we've always looked at and we'll continue to look at capital allocation through the lens of risk and return. The return side is almost fairly easy in this space because it's just the relationship between customer lifetime value and subscriber acquisition costs. And it is fair to say that I've asked the marketing teams to give us a little more cushion between the two in order to manage some of the uncertainties as we go into the scenarios for next year.
So you're right, we should see lower investment losses, especially if you keep in mind that at the beginning of next year, we're starting to comp against the very significant investments that we made in the first quarter of 2020 as we launched the U.S. product. At the same time, I also do want to point out, we're continuing -- and as David said it, we're continuing to really nourish the existing subscriber base that we have. We're continuing to invest in content in a significant way. So keep that in mind as well over the next few quarters. You will continue to see content expense coming up. We're also continuing to invest in technology and product features, but just a little less focused, I would say, in the mix on necessarily driving for every last subscriber. JB?"

So we are getting the same questions from partners, which is totally legitimate and sort of that is making us, in some cases, rethink when is the right time to launch. And a lot of that is largely when there -- those things are being pushed off is a pushing off of marketing and, in some cases, content expense to later when we have a better view of what the combined product will look like and we can come back to our partners with a more definitive sense of when and what we will be launching together."

I mean, Rich, on the channel store question, the reality is they've obviously been a very good partner of ours on the Discovery side. We're well aware that, as you said, HBO is taking a different position. I think the 3 questions that we have -- that we are waiting to engage further with the HBO side is, number one, we have found so far that there's -- the question about these channel stores bringing in a different customer base than what we might be able to address directly is an ongoing question. And we've certainly seen some good incremental subscriber growth coming from that channel store ecosystem and how much of that is cannibalistic versus what we could do direct or not is an ongoing set of analysis that we have going. And obviously, we want to compare notes with the HBO team at the right time. But that's a question because, ultimately, we want to try and get our product out to as many consumers on whatever platforms as necessary.
The second is the data element and the customer relationship, which I think is a little less known. And I think as some of the Amazon executives have talked about publicly now, we do have access to customer information as part of our relationship, and that's an important differentiator. That doesn't make this just a sort of traditional anonymized handle store relationship, but where we actually have customer information on the channel store consumer. And so that makes the equation a little bit different. 
And so you overlay those 2 things, and we say -- the third thing is, obviously, we want to have more engaged conversations with the Warner team and look and see whether the strategy that they're following today or the strategy that we are following today makes sense for the combined. And the North Star will be 2 things, which is ultimately how do we get the product in front of more consumers in aggregate and how do we do it in a financially strong way. And if we think we can deliver a -- still get the customer relationship, but get in front of more people with the right economics, I think it's one that we will certainly remain very open to. So we haven't made a decision definitively, but we're remaining very open, and we'll certainly -- that will be part of the story when we come back to you, Rich and the team. We'll tell you more about it at the right time."

Should we assume that you get there a little more quickly just because you're going to be starting from a lower base? Or is it more that you'll just have a bit more flexibility starting from that 4.5x or below? 
And then maybe one for JB on discovery+ and NEXTGEN. Is it logical for us to assume maybe just a little bit slower pace of net adds going forward as you take a more focused approach and sort of avoid stepping into places where HBO is strong and be a bit more selective?

And it is the 2.5x to 3x range that I want to see going forward. And to your question about flexibility, we don't need flexibility because our deal model already assumes very significant reinvestments and further investments in building out the DTC product and growing content expenses over the 5-year term here that we have modeled. So clear answer is, yes, very hopeful that we will be hitting that upper end of the 2.5 to 3x range earlier.
Regarding raising debt, again, we've mentioned the $15 billion hedge that we have put on and pretty much in line with what I said earlier about the conservatism in our initial model. The answer is, yes, there is some room. We have obviously taken some conservatism as well as we modeled out our interest rates. We've locked in very attractive rates with this $15 billion hedge program. Again, I don't want to make any promises. We'll -- it still will be some time before we implement the financing, but a good part is hedged now. We'll have to monitor the spreads as well. But I believe that we're in a very, very comfortable position relative to what we put out in the original statement and in our deal models.

I do want to have the balance sheet in the best possible shape as we come up on closing the deal. And as I said earlier, I now explicitly guided to at least $2.1 billion of free cash flow, so a significantly higher conversion than what we went into the year with and what we guided at the beginning of the year, and that's all part of our ambition here to be disciplined and get this balance sheet in perfect shape. JB?"

And I think it's consistent with what Gunnar just said, we should assume -- obviously, we're continuing to obviously push and see good growth in the markets where we're in, and we'll be launching our newest market in Brazil here over the course of the next 2 weeks. And so we're excited about that, and we still see healthy growth out of those markets, and we're spending at levels, to Gunnar's point, that we think are reasonable without leaning too far in, but they'd be the sort of slightly more conservative fact to LTV ratios that we're spending at plus the slowdown in some of the new market launches as we go towards the end of the year and into 2022. It doesn't mean that the net adds numbers will be a little bit slower than they might have been in the past. 
And maybe worth just, Rich -- I realized we didn't hit Rich's second question about the bundling clarification. I think David and my point on the bundling was purely that in -- back to Jessica's question about the tech rollout, it will take a bit of time, no question to come to one platform. And so while that process is underway, there will be opportunities in a much quicker fashion closer to day 1 to potentially do some very creative bundling propositions. That is an interim strategy, not a long-term strategy, I think, at this point is what we'd say."

I'm just wondering if you guys could give us a little bit of color on sort of the key takes there and whether you see healthy affiliate fee growth coming out of that or any changes in packaging. And if the merger impacted how you approach those deals, given, David, you made that point that bringing the Turner networks in is a real maybe underappreciated asset and part of this transaction. So that's my first one. 
And then I just wanted to come back, David, there's obviously a lot of focus on the merger and including your management team that you're putting together. Congratulations on bringing Kevin onboard. Is that -- I don't know how much you can say, but is there a hope that, that converts from a consultancy to an employeeship? And I'm just curious if he's still going to remain Chairman of Dazn, which I think at least in some regard, a competitor to you guys in Europe."

He's driven down all of these paths, and he's a great entrepreneur and he's got a number of really exciting things he's doing and working on. This is one of them, and I think it's going to be really helpful to JB and I and Bruce and he's having a great time doing what he's doing, but he's super excited about kind of really coming in and giving us the full scope of his experience and brain on everything he's seen and learned. 
And working with Len has been a good thing. I think he's seen and learned more about Europe and sports. And so I think that's exciting. The team at Warner and the way they're growing, the knowledge, the capability there, the attack plan that they have is really impressive. Andy Forssell is super strong. If this -- you look at the strength of that product. You look at the strength of our product. So I think we got a lot of really good people. You've seen through the -- for our history with Scripps that we're really about who are the best people. I think we're going to have to be able to build a really strong team and bring in some outside experience as well, but it's really encouraging how well they're doing and what we're learning along the way, and that's a big helper to us.
On the affiliate side, and Gunnar, you could fill in some more. But I think we reached deals that were very favorable for us. On the carriage side, very strong. And I think it's win-win. They want to commit to carry all of our channels. This whole idea that a bunch of our channels were going to get dropped, that never happened. They're good value. I don't say that with great glee. But when you look at the overall package and the viewership, we're a great value, and they're making a lot of money selling advertising on our services. So it went very well for us with meaningful increases and real security, and I think it went well for them and continuing to get really good products.
And in terms of how do we -- how does this align with Warner has nothing to do with it. We're operating as an independent company, and we're operating on the strength of the channels that Kathleen Finch and Nancy have been building here with Discovery and Oprah and Food and HG. And so it's -- we've been overdelivering. People love our stuff, and it's just a reinforcing of this narrative that, despite the fact that the world is changing, that we were able to get deals with some of the toughest and strongest and most knowledgeable distributors on very favorable terms with strong carriage commitments as we make this transition together. And so I think that's -- it's a very good sign for the 2 sides. Gunnar, anything to add?"
