Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because",1611,"Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because of the work we've done over the last 10 years, building the best-in-class portfolio that is critical to today's supply chain and centered on our customers. 
During the year, we closed on $17 billion of M&A, further fortified our balance sheet with lower rates and line of maturities, generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow after dividends and, importantly, continue to deliver sector-leading earnings growth. 
Since the merger in 2011, our earnings CAGR of 9.5% without promotes has outperformed the other logistics REIT by more than 350 basis points annually. This is the result of a unique business model, which has consistently outperformed year after year. 
Turning to our view of the operating environment. Our proprietary data shows that the strong demand we experienced in the third quarter has continued. Globally, lease assigned in the fourth quarter were a record 65 million square feet or more than 1 million square feet per business day. This was driven by new leasing, which rose 22% year-over-year on a size adjusted basis. A broad range of customers signed new leases in the fourth quarter, led by consumer Products, food and beverage, electronics and health care segments. E-commerce activity accounted for 19.8% of new leasing. 
The need for speed and flexibility is also reflected in elevated short term leasing, which was up 58% in the quarter as 3PL, retail and transportation customers raced to secure space ahead of the holidays. Lease proposals remain at healthy levels. In the U.S., fourth quarter net absorption was the highest on record at 100 million square feet and in excess of new supply of 90 million square feet. Rents in our markets grew by 3.2%, with all the growth coming in the back half of 2020. We anticipate rents to grow by approximately 5% in 2021. Houston is the only U.S. market on our watch list. As a reminder, we moved Atlanta and Central Pennsylvania from our list in the second quarter. 
In 2021, we expect supply to decline year-on-year, balanced with demand at 280 million square feet each. Conditions are also healthy in our other markets across the globe. In Europe, rents began to rise in the fourth quarter, and we expect 2.5% of additional growth in 2021, led by Northern Europe and the U.K. The implications of Brexit have been largely positive for us as we anticipated 4 years ago when Brexit was first announced, inventory disaggregation will eventually lead to higher inventory levels in both the U.K. and the continent. 
We're watching new supply in Poland and Spain. But for context, these 2 markets account for just 1.7% of our share of NOI. In Tokyo and Osaka, historic high levels of supplier being met with very strong demand. Over 2/3 of the development pipeline is already pre-leased, and we expect market vacancies to remain below 2%. For China, supply is moderating, even as the market remains soft. In our portfolio, we leased a record 10 million square feet in the second half of the year, a credit to the great work of our new China leadership team. 
Turning to valuations. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest sequential increase in a decade, rising 5% in the U.S. and globally, and are now nearly 6% above pre pandemic levels. Applying this increase to our $142 billion owned and managed portfolio, we estimate the value of our real estate rose by $7 billion in the fourth quarter. We expect continued fundamental improvement in 2021 and beyond based on 3 drivers. 
First, a powerful economic recovery, including the highest GDP growth in the U.S. in more than 2 decades, the combination of corporate and personal savings as well as significant governmental stimulus is a loaded spring, which will translate to significant economic growth in the back half as vaccines continue to roll out. 
Second, the pandemic accelerated the retail revolution. The e-commerce [indiscernible] rate jumped 480 basis points to 20% of goods sold in the U.S. in 2020. Based on early reports, e-commerce holiday sales grew by at least 30%. While we expect the share of goods purchased online to grow further, a pause later this year would not surprise us as consumers expand spending on services and experiences over goods. Our customers continue to plan for the long term. Retooling supply chains for increased e-fulfillment should generate cumulative incremental demand of 200 million square feet or more over the next several years. 
Third, we expect higher inventory levels. Inventory-to-sales ratios remain near all-time lows. We believe this had an impact on our customer space utilization as it ticked down to 83% in the fourth quarter. We see early signs of inventory restocking as containerized import volumes in the U.S. rose 24% in November and are on pace to set a quarterly record. Longer term, the need for more resilient supply chains will lead to higher inventory levels. We estimate that a 5% increase in inventory levels would produce incremental demand of nearly 300 million square feet in the U.S. alone. These changes will take years to play out, driving strong long-term demand. 
Turning to results. The work we've done to create the best-in-class portfolio of scale and lowest cost structure in the industry is delivering exceptional financial results. 2020 core FFO, excluding promotes, grew by 14% and came in at the high end of our range at $3.58 per share. We also recognized record net promote income of $0.22 per share. Net effective rent change on rollover in the fourth quarter was 28%, led by the U.S. at 32.1%, both high water marks for the year. Our in-place to market rent spread now stands at 12.8%, up about 60 basis points sequentially. Collections continue to outpace 2019 levels. And as of this morning, we collected over 99% of fourth quarter rents and over 95% of January. 
Bad debt was 42 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, both below our expectation. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 3% and led by the U.S. at 3.5%. We made meaningful progress on the sale of nonstrategic assets acquired from Liberty. We settled disputes related to the construction of the Philadelphia 4 Seasons Hotel and the Comcast Technology Center. We completed the disposition of our 20% ownership interest in the hotel and the previously announced portfolio in the U.K. To date, we have sold more than $600 million of former Liberty assets, exceeding our underwritten values by more than 18%. We now have less than $400 million of former Liberty non-logistics assets remaining, consisting primarily of our interest in the Comcast headquarters. For strategic capital, our team raised $3.1 billion in 2020, with 40% from new investors, we have yet to meet in person. Market and property tours as well as due diligence activities were all conducted virtually as our team capitalized on our early investments in digital infrastructure. Our balance sheet remains the best in the industry with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles of more than $13 billion. Our capital markets activity in the quarter brought our total average interest rate down to 2%. We will look for additional opportunities to refinance at attractive rates. In fact, at current interest rates in our mix of currencies, we could issue 10-year debt at a blended all-in rate of 1%. 
Turning to our guidance for 2021. Here are the key components on an our share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 3.5% to 4.5%. We're estimating bad debt expense to range between 20 and 40 basis points of gross revenues, and average occupancy for our operating portfolio to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect a seasonal occupancy drop in the first quarter then trend higher as the year progresses. For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to range between $435 million and $450 million. Promote revenue will be negligible in 2021. In fact, we'll have net promote expenses of $0.02 per share for the year, which relates to the amortization of costs from prior period promotes. Our historic net promote income an average approximately 20 basis points of third-party AUM, which would be $0.06 to $0.07 of earnings per share-based on current promotable AUM. 
Looking ahead, recent property appreciation leads us to expect net promote income per share in 2022 to be at or above this historic average. We expect to start between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in new development, with 45% build-to-suits and for stabilizations to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Dispositions will range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion, with the majority expected to close in the first half of 2021. We're forecasting net deployment uses of $350 million at the midpoint. And as a result, our leverage will remain effectively flat in 2021. 
Putting this all together, we expect core FFO, including the $0.02 of net promote expense to range between $3.88 to $3.98 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $3.90 and $4 per share, with year-over-year growth at the midpoint of more than 10%, delivering another year of exceptional growth. We enter 2021 with optimism and confidence. Our ability to deliver value for our customers beyond real estate, using our unmatched purchasing power and significant investments in technology, innovation and data are significant competitive advantages that will drive further outperformance.

But the rest of Europe is very well occupied. So it's really the volume of rollovers in Poland and Spain that drive that balance in occupancy on the margin. But throughout, our occupancies in Europe have been higher than the rest of our portfolio in the U.S. anyway."

A lot of these people have to build up their industrial capability and everybody is trying to get into that business because the other property types don't offer very many opportunities. So those kinds are just duking it out on price is not our business. So that means that building out our land bank, doing value-added acquisitions where we can bring our leasing and operational expertise to the table deals that are Harry, et cetera, et cetera. But general framework for looking at deals is returns. How we can differentiate and have a competitive advantage. And also in the case of portfolio deals, what the fit is, if we have to buy 100 buildings and sell 90 of them, that's probably not a very attractive transaction for us. So the other thing I would just mention is that you posed the question in a sense that we're only going after big deals. We do a lot of $5 million deals, too. They just don't show up. So we're there looking at pretty much everything that moves out there. And where there with offers on most, if not all of the ones that meet our quality standards.

But this year and the way they measure it, it's a June 30 year-end. But in the year ended June 30, you had 260,000 people moved out of California. That compares to the year before, like a more normal year, about 230,000 people. So there is always this churning that happens. But all of that is about 0.5% of the total population in California, and you still have internal growth. So California is still growing. It's just not growing at the same pace as it was before.

I mean, capital market returns are lower. So real estate returns are lower as well. What we really look at is relative value and in a lot of these situations, the weight of the money coming into the industrial sector has created the situation where good assets and bad assets or not so great assets, the yield is compressing between the 2. And people just want to tick that industrial box. So a lot of those people also tend to be leveraged buyers in which they can take better advantage of those lower rates. So -- but the way we underwrite the assets in terms of quality and the ability of those assets to compete in the marketplace, that has never changed, that's the primary filter. But obviously because of higher rents and lower cap rates, pricing has changed."

But I think your question was, is labor continuing to be a constraint. The answer is yes, pretty much everywhere. And so I was really surprised, frankly, when I heard from our large customers, I think, back in April and May and the early stages of COVID, relatively early stages of COVID, that labor continues to be their number one, #2 and #3 problem. I thought it would have moderated given the downturn and the unemployment rate. And the key in that calculus is quality of labor. So we've taken a lot of steps, as you know, with our community workforce initiative to try to address that to our customers. But no matter how hard we work or how large that initiative gets, it's not going to even begin to make a dent in the problem that we have. Are there geographical differences from place to place, for sure. But those geographical differences have already adjusted because people don't put their warehouses in places where there is no labor whatsoever. They put it in places where there is labor, but there's just not as much labor as they would like. So they're all competing with one another. And the turnover rate and that kind of labor is very high, it's about 40% a year. So people move for relatively small changes in compensation and environment and customers are paying more attention to environment and all those amenities that can really be more attractive to labor in addition to paying more."

A lot of customers are starting to reassess how they want to go-to-market with e-commerce in 2021 and beyond. And I think you're going to see a lot of diversity there.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because",1615,"Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because of the work we've done over the last 10 years building the best-in-class portfolio that is critical to today's supply chain and centered on our customers.  
During the year, we closed on $17 billion of M&A, further fortified our balance sheet with lower rates and line of maturities, generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow after dividends, and importantly, continue to deliver sector-leading earnings growth.  
Since the merger in 2011, our earnings CAGR of 9.5% without promotes has outperformed the other logistics REIT by more than 350 basis points annually. This is the result of the unique business model which has consistently outperformed year after year.  
Turning to our view of the operating environment. Our proprietary data shows that the strong demand we experienced in the third quarter has continued. Globally, leases assigned in the fourth quarter were a record 65 million square feet or more than 1 million square feet per business day. This was driven by new leasing, which rose 22% year-over-year on a size-adjusted basis. A broad range of customers signed new leases in the fourth quarter, led by consumer products, food and beverage, electronics and health care segments. E-commerce activity accounted for 19.8% of new leasing.  
The need for speed and flexibility is also reflected in elevated short term leasing, which was up 58% in the quarter as 3PL, retail and transportation customers raced to secure space ahead of the holidays. Lease proposals remain at healthy levels. In the U.S., fourth quarter net absorption was the highest on record at 100 million square feet and in excess of new supply of 90 million square feet. Rents in our markets grew by 3.2%, with all the growth coming in the back half of 2020. We anticipate rents to grow by approximately 5% in 2021. Houston is the only U.S. market on our watch list. As a reminder, we moved Atlanta and Central Pennsylvania from our list in the second quarter. 
In 2021, we expect supply to decline year-on-year, balanced with demand at 280 million square feet each. Conditions are also healthy in our other markets across the globe. In Europe, rents began to rise in the fourth quarter, and we expect 2.5% of additional growth in 2021, led by Northern Europe and the U.K. The implications of Brexit have been largely positive for us as we anticipated 4 years ago when Brexit was first announced, inventory disaggregation will eventually lead to higher inventory levels in both the U.K. and the continent.  
We're watching new supply in Poland and Spain. But for context, these 2 markets account for just 1.7% of our share of NOI. In Tokyo and Osaka, historic high levels of supply are being met with a very strong demand. Over 2/3 of the development pipeline is already pre-leased, and we expect market vacancies to remain below 2%. For China, supply is moderating, even as the market remains soft. In our portfolio, we leased a record 10 million square feet in the second half of the year, a credit to the great work of our new China leadership team.  
Turning to valuations. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest sequential increase in a decade, rising 5% in the U.S. and globally, and are now nearly 6% above prepandemic levels. Applying this increase to our $142 billion owned and managed portfolio, we estimate the value of our real estate rose by $7 billion in the fourth quarter. 
We expect continued fundamental improvement in 2021 and beyond based on 3 drivers. First, a powerful economic recovery, including the highest GDP growth in the U.S. in more than 2 decades, the combination of corporate and personal savings as well as significant governmental stimulus is a loaded spring, which will translate to significant economic growth in the back half as the vaccines continue to roll out. 
Second, the pandemic accelerated the retail revolution. The e-commerce penetration rate jumped 480 basis points to 20% of goods sold in the U.S. in 2020. Based on early reports, e-commerce holiday sales grew by at least 30%. While we expect the share of goods purchased online to grow further, a pause later this year would not surprise us as consumers expand spending on services and experiences over goods. Our customers continue to plan for the long term, retooling supply chains for increased e-fulfillment should generate cumulative incremental demand of 200 million square feet or more over the next several years.  
Third, we expect higher inventory levels. Inventory-to-sales ratios remain near all-time lows. We believe this had an impact on our customer space utilization as it ticked down to 83% in the fourth quarter. We see early signs of inventory restocking as containerized import volumes in the U.S. rose 24% in November and are on pace to set a quarterly record. Longer term, the need for more resilient supply chains will lead to higher inventory levels. We estimate that a 5% increase in inventory levels would produce incremental demand of nearly 300 million square feet in the U.S. alone. These changes will take years to play out, driving strong long-term demand.  
Turning to results. The work we've done to create the best-in-class portfolio of scale and lowest cost structure in the industry is delivering exceptional financial results. 2020 core FFO, excluding promotes, grew by 14% and came in at the high end of our range at $3.58 per share. We also recognized record net promote income of $0.22 per share. Net effective rent change on a rollover in the fourth quarter was 28%, led by the U.S. at 32.1%, both high water marks for the year. Our in-place to market rent spread now stands at 12.8%, up about 60 basis points sequentially. Collections continue to outpace 2019 levels. And as of this morning, we collected over 99% of fourth quarter rents and over 95% of January.  
Bad debt was 42 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, both below our expectation. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 3% and led by the U.S. at 3.5%. We made meaningful progress on the sale of nonstrategic assets acquired from Liberty. We settled disputes related to the construction of the Philadelphia Four Seasons Hotel and the Comcast Technology Center. We completed the disposition of our 20% ownership interest in the hotel and the previously announced portfolio in the U.K. 
To date, we have sold more than $600 million of former Liberty assets, exceeding our underwritten value by more than 18%. We now have less than $400 million of former Liberty non-logistics assets remaining, consisting primarily of our interest in the Comcast headquarters. For strategic capital, our team raised $3.1 billion in 2020, with 40% from new investors we have yet to meet in person. Market and property tours as well as due diligence activities were all conducted virtually as our team capitalized on our early investments in digital infrastructure.
Our balance sheet remains the best in the industry with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle of more than $13 billion. Our capital markets activity in the quarter brought our total average interest rate down to 2%. We will look for additional opportunities to refinance at attractive rates. In fact, at current interest rates in our mix of currencies, we could issue 10-year debt at a blended all-in rate of 1%.  
Turning to our guidance for 2021, here are the key components on an R share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 3.5% to 4.5%. We're estimating bad debt expense to range between 20 to 40 basis points of gross revenues, and average occupancy for our operating portfolio to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect a seasonal occupancy drop in the first quarter then trend higher as the year progresses. For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to range between $435 million and $450 million. Promote revenue will be negligible in 2021. In fact, we'll have net promote expenses of $0.02 per share for the year, which relates to the amortization of costs from prior period promotes. Our historic net promote income then averaged approximately 20 basis points of third-party AUM, which would be $0.06 to $0.07 of earnings per share based on current promotable AUM.  
Looking ahead, recent property appreciation leads us to expect net promote income per share in 2022 to be at or above this historic average. We expect to start between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in new development, with 45% build-to-suits and for stabilizations to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Dispositions will range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion, with the majority expected to close in the first half of 2021. We're forecasting net deployment uses of $350 million at the midpoint. And as a result, our leverage will remain effectively flat in 2021.  
Putting this all together, we expect core FFO, including the $0.02 of net promote expense to range between $3.88 to $3.98 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $3.90 and $4 per share, with the year-over-year growth at the midpoint of more than 10%, delivering another year of exceptional growth. We enter 2021 with optimism and confidence. Our ability to deliver value for our customers beyond real estate, using our unmatched purchasing power and significant investments in technology, innovation and data are significant competitive advantages that will drive further outperformance.  
With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Is it more of the geographic footprint that just doesn't overlap enough? Or maybe it's just your focus on, more on development at this point? Any color there would be helpful."

We are not good buyers of core, core real estate, auction by a brokerage house, where there are 55 people showing up at the margin. A lot of these people have to build up their industrial capability and everybody's trying to get into that business because the other property types don't offer very many opportunities. So those kinds are just duking it out on price is not our business. So that means that building out our land bank, doing value-added acquisitions where we can bring our leasing and operational expertise to the table, deals that are hairy, et cetera, et cetera. But general framework for looking at deals is returns. How we can differentiate and have a competitive advantage. And also in the case of portfolio deals, what the fit is, if we have to buy 100 buildings and sell 90 of them, that's probably not a very attractive transaction for us. 
So the other thing I would just mention is that you posed the question in the sense that we're only going after big deals. We do a lot of $5 million deals, too. They just don't show up. So we're there looking at pretty much everything that moves out there. And we're there with offers on most, if not all of the ones that meet our quality standards. But thankfully, in a lot of those core situations, we lose. So we're good with that. We're on the selling side of a lot of those transactions as well."

There is no question that the Bay Area, after almost a decade of straight run-up -- has gotten hit pretty hard in this downturn. So I would say it's softer than L.A. in a Big Way. But the good news is that there's been so much rental appreciation that even as these leases expire, you still, in many cases, rolling them up to market, but the market is just not as high as it would have been, say, a year ago."

No, I don't really think California's falling into the ocean. There are a lot of people in the middle of the country cheering for that, but it's not going to happen. I mean, just look at the last quarter, you've had -- look at the market cap that's been created in this area. It's probably more than it's been created in a decade in some of those markets. 
So no, I don't think -- so the numbers are actually pretty interesting. If you look at the overall California numbers, I don't have them specifically for the Bay Area. But this year and the way they measure it, it's a June 30 year-end. But in the year ended June 30, you had 260,000 people move out of California. That compares to the year before, like a more normal year, about 230,000 people. So there is always this churning that happens. 
But all of that is about 0.5% of the total population in California, and you still have internal growth. So California's still growing. It's just not growing at the same pace as it was before. And I think some of the outflows have to do with temporary work from home kind of situations. We don't expect all of those things to last forever. So you'll have some people coming back to California. I think housing prices have moderated, certainly on the rental side. So yes, I think California is softer than it's been, but it's been on such a tear that it would have had to come to some kind of a moderation, and it has."

But I think your question was, is labor continuing to be a constraint. The answer is yes, pretty much everywhere. And so I was really surprised, frankly, when I heard from our large customers, I think, back in April and May, in the early stages of COVID, relatively early stages of COVID, that labor continues to be their #1, #2 and #3 problem. I thought it would have moderated, given the downturn and the unemployment rate. And the key is that calculus is quality of labor. So we've taken a lot of steps, as you know, with our community workforce initiative to try to address that to our customers. But no matter how hard we work or how large that initiative gets, it's not going to even begin to make a dent in the problem that we have. Are there geographical differences from place to place, for sure. But those geographical differences have already been adjusted, because people don't put their warehouses in places where there is no labor whatsoever. They put it in places where there is labor, but there's just not as much labor as they would like. 
So they're all competing with one another. And the turnover rate and that kind of labor, it's very high, it's about 40% a year. So people move for relatively small changes in compensation and environment and customers are paying more attention to environment and all those amenities that can really be more attractive to labor in addition to paying more."

So the rest of the assets that are available for sale are just straight up industrial. And these assets would be considered in the top, I don't know, 25% of most portfolios out there. It's just that they don't quite meet our standards, but they're perfectly fine assets and they're appreciating. And as you heard, I think Tom mentioned that even on the nonindustrial ones, we picked up 18% more value than we underwrote. So on industrial, I think we're even going to do better than that. It's just no sense of -- we could settle that at a really high price right now, but if the capital is sitting around not doing anything, we'll give a bunch of it back in terms of dilution.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year.

I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because of the work we've done over the last 10 years building the best-in-class portfolio that is critical to today's supply chain and centered on our customers.  
During the year, we closed on $17 billion of M&A, further fortified our balance sheet with lower rates and line of maturities, generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow after dividends, and importantly, continue to deliver sector-leading earnings growth.  
Since the merger in 2011, our earnings CAGR of 9.5% without promotes has outperformed the other logistics REIT by more than 350 basis points annually. This is the result of the unique business model which has consistently outperformed year after year.  
Turning to our view of the operating environment. Our proprietary data shows that the strong demand we experienced in the third quarter has continued. Globally, leases assigned in the fourth quarter were a record 65 million square feet or more than 1 million square feet per business day. This was driven by new leasing, which rose 22% year-over-year on a size-adjusted basis. A broad range of customers signed new leases in the fourth quarter, led by consumer products, food and beverage, electronics and health care segments. E-commerce activity accounted for 19.8% of new leasing.  
The need for speed and flexibility is also reflected in elevated short term leasing, which was up 58% in the quarter as 3PL, retail and transportation customers raced to secure space ahead of the holidays. Lease proposals remain at healthy levels. In the U.S., fourth quarter net absorption was the highest on record at 100 million square feet and in excess of new supply of 90 million square feet. Rents in our markets grew by 3.2%, with all the growth coming in the back half of 2020. We anticipate rents to grow by approximately 5% in 2021. Houston is the only U.S. market on our watch list. As a reminder, we moved Atlanta and Central Pennsylvania from our list in the second quarter. 
In 2021, we expect supply to decline year-on-year, balanced with demand at 280 million square feet each. Conditions are also healthy in our other markets across the globe. In Europe, rents began to rise in the fourth quarter, and we expect 2.5% of additional growth in 2021, led by Northern Europe and the U.K. The implications of Brexit have been largely positive for us as we anticipated 4 years ago when Brexit was first announced, inventory disaggregation will eventually lead to higher inventory levels in both the U.K. and the continent.  
We're watching new supply in Poland and Spain. But for context, these 2 markets account for just 1.7% of our share of NOI. In Tokyo and Osaka, historic high levels of supply are being met with a very strong demand. Over 2/3 of the development pipeline is already pre-leased, and we expect market vacancies to remain below 2%. For China, supply is moderating, even as the market remains soft. In our portfolio, we leased a record 10 million square feet in the second half of the year, a credit to the great work of our new China leadership team.  
Turning to valuations. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest sequential increase in a decade, rising 5% in the U.S. and globally, and are now nearly 6% above prepandemic levels. Applying this increase to our $142 billion owned and managed portfolio, we estimate the value of our real estate rose by $7 billion in the fourth quarter. 
We expect continued fundamental improvement in 2021 and beyond based on 3 drivers. First, a powerful economic recovery, including the highest GDP growth in the U.S. in more than 2 decades, the combination of corporate and personal savings as well as significant governmental stimulus is a loaded spring, which will translate to significant economic growth in the back half as the vaccines continue to roll out. 
Second, the pandemic accelerated the retail revolution. The e-commerce penetration rate jumped 480 basis points to 20% of goods sold in the U.S. in 2020. Based on early reports, e-commerce holiday sales grew by at least 30%. While we expect the share of goods purchased online to grow further, a pause later this year would not surprise us as consumers expand spending on services and experiences over goods. Our customers continue to plan for the long term, retooling supply chains for increased e-fulfillment should generate cumulative incremental demand of 200 million square feet or more over the next several years.  
Third, we expect higher inventory levels. Inventory-to-sales ratios remain near all-time lows. We believe this had an impact on our customer space utilization as it ticked down to 83% in the fourth quarter. We see early signs of inventory restocking as containerized import volumes in the U.S. rose 24% in November and are on pace to set a quarterly record. Longer term, the need for more resilient supply chains will lead to higher inventory levels. We estimate that a 5% increase in inventory levels would produce incremental demand of nearly 300 million square feet in the U.S. alone. These changes will take years to play out, driving strong long-term demand.  
Turning to results. The work we've done to create the best-in-class portfolio of scale and lowest cost structure in the industry is delivering exceptional financial results. 2020 core FFO, excluding promotes, grew by 14% and came in at the high end of our range at $3.58 per share. We also recognized record net promote income of $0.22 per share. Net effective rent change on a rollover in the fourth quarter was 28%, led by the U.S. at 32.1%, both high water marks for the year. Our in-place to market rent spread now stands at 12.8%, up about 60 basis points sequentially. Collections continue to outpace 2019 levels. And as of this morning, we collected over 99% of fourth quarter rents and over 95% of January.  
Bad debt was 42 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, both below our expectation. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 3% and led by the U.S. at 3.5%. We made meaningful progress on the sale of nonstrategic assets acquired from Liberty. We settled disputes related to the construction of the Philadelphia Four Seasons Hotel and the Comcast Technology Center. We completed the disposition of our 20% ownership interest in the hotel and the previously announced portfolio in the U.K. 
To date, we have sold more than $600 million of former Liberty assets, exceeding our underwritten value by more than 18%. We now have less than $400 million of former Liberty non-logistics assets remaining, consisting primarily of our interest in the Comcast headquarters. For strategic capital, our team raised $3.1 billion in 2020, with 40% from new investors we have yet to meet in person. Market and property tours as well as due diligence activities were all conducted virtually as our team capitalized on our early investments in digital infrastructure.
Our balance sheet remains the best in the industry with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle of more than $13 billion. Our capital markets activity in the quarter brought our total average interest rate down to 2%. We will look for additional opportunities to refinance at attractive rates. In fact, at current interest rates in our mix of currencies, we could issue 10-year debt at a blended all-in rate of 1%.  
Turning to our guidance for 2021, here are the key components on an R share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 3.5% to 4.5%. We're estimating bad debt expense to range between 20 to 40 basis points of gross revenues, and average occupancy for our operating portfolio to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect a seasonal occupancy drop in the first quarter then trend higher as the year progresses. For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to range between $435 million and $450 million. Promote revenue will be negligible in 2021. In fact, we'll have net promote expenses of $0.02 per share for the year, which relates to the amortization of costs from prior period promotes. Our historic net promote income then averaged approximately 20 basis points of third-party AUM, which would be $0.06 to $0.07 of earnings per share based on current promotable AUM.  
Looking ahead, recent property appreciation leads us to expect net promote income per share in 2022 to be at or above this historic average. We expect to start between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in new development, with 45% build-to-suits and for stabilizations to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Dispositions will range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion, with the majority expected to close in the first half of 2021. We're forecasting net deployment uses of $350 million at the midpoint. And as a result, our leverage will remain effectively flat in 2021.  
Putting this all together, we expect core FFO, including the $0.02 of net promote expense to range between $3.88 to $3.98 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $3.90 and $4 per share, with the year-over-year growth at the midpoint of more than 10%, delivering another year of exceptional growth. We enter 2021 with optimism and confidence. Our ability to deliver value for our customers beyond real estate, using our unmatched purchasing power and significant investments in technology, innovation and data are significant competitive advantages that will drive further outperformance.

We are not good buyers of core, core real estate, auction by a brokerage house, where there are 55 people showing up at the margin. A lot of these people have to build up their industrial capability and everybody's trying to get into that business because the other property types don't offer very many opportunities. So those kinds are just duking it out on price is not our business. So that means that building out our land bank, doing value-added acquisitions where we can bring our leasing and operational expertise to the table, deals that are hairy, et cetera, et cetera. But general framework for looking at deals is returns. How we can differentiate and have a competitive advantage. And also in the case of portfolio deals, what the fit is, if we have to buy 100 buildings and sell 90 of them, that's probably not a very attractive transaction for us. 
So the other thing I would just mention is that you posed the question in the sense that we're only going after big deals. We do a lot of $5 million deals, too. They just don't show up. So we're there looking at pretty much everything that moves out there. And we're there with offers on most, if not all of the ones that meet our quality standards.

I'm just looking at your top 4 markets in the U.S., Southern California, New York, New Jersey, Bay Area and Chicago. Obviously, places that through the pandemic have seen decent outflows of people into the southeast. So I realize that supply is constrained in those markets. So I'm just thinking in terms of incremental investment going forward. I mean, do we expect more investment in places like Dallas and Atlanta and Florida, places that are benefiting demographically? Or do you think, you kind of expect things to go back to how they were?"

No, I don't really think California's falling into the ocean. There are a lot of people in the middle of the country cheering for that, but it's not going to happen. I mean, just look at the last quarter, you've had -- look at the market cap that's been created in this area. It's probably more than it's been created in a decade in some of those markets. 
So no, I don't think -- so the numbers are actually pretty interesting. If you look at the overall California numbers, I don't have them specifically for the Bay Area. But this year and the way they measure it, it's a June 30 year-end. But in the year ended June 30, you had 260,000 people move out of California. That compares to the year before, like a more normal year, about 230,000 people. So there is always this churning that happens. 
But all of that is about 0.5% of the total population in California, and you still have internal growth. So California's still growing. It's just not growing at the same pace as it was before. And I think some of the outflows have to do with temporary work from home kind of situations. We don't expect all of those things to last forever. So you'll have some people coming back to California. I think housing prices have moderated, certainly on the rental side. So yes, I think California is softer than it's been, but it's been on such a tear that it would have had to come to some kind of a moderation, and it has."

But I think your question was, is labor continuing to be a constraint. The answer is yes, pretty much everywhere. And so I was really surprised, frankly, when I heard from our large customers, I think, back in April and May, in the early stages of COVID, relatively early stages of COVID, that labor continues to be their #1, #2 and #3 problem. I thought it would have moderated, given the downturn and the unemployment rate. And the key is that calculus is quality of labor. So we've taken a lot of steps, as you know, with our community workforce initiative to try to address that to our customers. But no matter how hard we work or how large that initiative gets, it's not going to even begin to make a dent in the problem that we have. Are there geographical differences from place to place, for sure. But those geographical differences have already been adjusted, because people don't put their warehouses in places where there is no labor whatsoever. They put it in places where there is labor, but there's just not as much labor as they would like. 
So they're all competing with one another. And the turnover rate and that kind of labor, it's very high, it's about 40% a year. So people move for relatively small changes in compensation and environment and customers are paying more attention to environment and all those amenities that can really be more attractive to labor in addition to paying more."

I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because of the work we've done over the last 10 years building the best-in-class portfolio that is critical to today's supply chain and centered on our customers.  
During the year, we closed on $17 billion of M&A, further fortified our balance sheet with lower rates and line of maturities, generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow after dividends, and importantly, continue to deliver sector-leading earnings growth.  
Since the merger in 2011, our earnings CAGR of 9.5% without promotes has outperformed the other logistics REIT by more than 350 basis points annually. This is the result of the unique business model which has consistently outperformed year after year.  
Turning to our view of the operating environment. Our proprietary data shows that the strong demand we experienced in the third quarter has continued. Globally, leases assigned in the fourth quarter were a record 65 million square feet or more than 1 million square feet per business day. This was driven by new leasing, which rose 22% year-over-year on a size-adjusted basis. A broad range of customers signed new leases in the fourth quarter, led by consumer products, food and beverage, electronics and health care segments. E-commerce activity accounted for 19.8% of new leasing.  
The need for speed and flexibility is also reflected in elevated short term leasing, which was up 58% in the quarter as 3PL, retail and transportation customers raced to secure space ahead of the holidays. Lease proposals remain at healthy levels. In the U.S., fourth quarter net absorption was the highest on record at 100 million square feet and in excess of new supply of 90 million square feet. Rents in our markets grew by 3.2%, with all the growth coming in the back half of 2020. We anticipate rents to grow by approximately 5% in 2021. Houston is the only U.S. market on our watch list. As a reminder, we moved Atlanta and Central Pennsylvania from our list in the second quarter. 
In 2021, we expect supply to decline year-on-year, balanced with demand at 280 million square feet each. Conditions are also healthy in our other markets across the globe. In Europe, rents began to rise in the fourth quarter, and we expect 2.5% of additional growth in 2021, led by Northern Europe and the U.K. The implications of Brexit have been largely positive for us as we anticipated 4 years ago when Brexit was first announced, inventory disaggregation will eventually lead to higher inventory levels in both the U.K. and the continent.  
We're watching new supply in Poland and Spain. But for context, these 2 markets account for just 1.7% of our share of NOI. In Tokyo and Osaka, historic high levels of supply are being met with a very strong demand. Over 2/3 of the development pipeline is already pre-leased, and we expect market vacancies to remain below 2%. For China, supply is moderating, even as the market remains soft. In our portfolio, we leased a record 10 million square feet in the second half of the year, a credit to the great work of our new China leadership team.  
Turning to valuations. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest sequential increase in a decade, rising 5% in the U.S. and globally, and are now nearly 6% above prepandemic levels. Applying this increase to our $142 billion owned and managed portfolio, we estimate the value of our real estate rose by $7 billion in the fourth quarter. 
We expect continued fundamental improvement in 2021 and beyond based on 3 drivers. First, a powerful economic recovery, including the highest GDP growth in the U.S. in more than 2 decades, the combination of corporate and personal savings as well as significant governmental stimulus is a loaded spring, which will translate to significant economic growth in the back half as the vaccines continue to roll out. 
Second, the pandemic accelerated the retail revolution. The e-commerce penetration rate jumped 480 basis points to 20% of goods sold in the U.S. in 2020. Based on early reports, e-commerce holiday sales grew by at least 30%. While we expect the share of goods purchased online to grow further, a pause later this year would not surprise us as consumers expand spending on services and experiences over goods. Our customers continue to plan for the long term, retooling supply chains for increased e-fulfillment should generate cumulative incremental demand of 200 million square feet or more over the next several years.  
Third, we expect higher inventory levels. Inventory-to-sales ratios remain near all-time lows. We believe this had an impact on our customer space utilization as it ticked down to 83% in the fourth quarter. We see early signs of inventory restocking as containerized import volumes in the U.S. rose 24% in November and are on pace to set a quarterly record. Longer term, the need for more resilient supply chains will lead to higher inventory levels. We estimate that a 5% increase in inventory levels would produce incremental demand of nearly 300 million square feet in the U.S. alone. These changes will take years to play out, driving strong long-term demand.  
Turning to results. The work we've done to create the best-in-class portfolio of scale and lowest cost structure in the industry is delivering exceptional financial results. 2020 core FFO, excluding promotes, grew by 14% and came in at the high end of our range at $3.58 per share. We also recognized record net promote income of $0.22 per share. Net effective rent change on a rollover in the fourth quarter was 28%, led by the U.S. at 32.1%, both high water marks for the year. Our in-place to market rent spread now stands at 12.8%, up about 60 basis points sequentially. Collections continue to outpace 2019 levels. And as of this morning, we collected over 99% of fourth quarter rents and over 95% of January.  
Bad debt was 42 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, both below our expectation. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 3% and led by the U.S. at 3.5%. We made meaningful progress on the sale of nonstrategic assets acquired from Liberty. We settled disputes related to the construction of the Philadelphia Four Seasons Hotel and the Comcast Technology Center. We completed the disposition of our 20% ownership interest in the hotel and the previously announced portfolio in the U.K. 
To date, we have sold more than $600 million of former Liberty assets, exceeding our underwritten value by more than 18%. We now have less than $400 million of former Liberty non-logistics assets remaining, consisting primarily of our interest in the Comcast headquarters. For strategic capital, our team raised $3.1 billion in 2020, with 40% from new investors we have yet to meet in person. Market and property tours as well as due diligence activities were all conducted virtually as our team capitalized on our early investments in digital infrastructure.
Our balance sheet remains the best in the industry with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle of more than $13 billion. Our capital markets activity in the quarter brought our total average interest rate down to 2%. We will look for additional opportunities to refinance at attractive rates. In fact, at current interest rates in our mix of currencies, we could issue 10-year debt at a blended all-in rate of 1%.  
Turning to our guidance for 2021, here are the key components on an R share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 3.5% to 4.5%. We're estimating bad debt expense to range between 20 to 40 basis points of gross revenues, and average occupancy for our operating portfolio to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect a seasonal occupancy drop in the first quarter then trend higher as the year progresses. For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to range between $435 million and $450 million. Promote revenue will be negligible in 2021. In fact, we'll have net promote expenses of $0.02 per share for the year, which relates to the amortization of costs from prior period promotes. Our historic net promote income then averaged approximately 20 basis points of third-party AUM, which would be $0.06 to $0.07 of earnings per share based on current promotable AUM.  
Looking ahead, recent property appreciation leads us to expect net promote income per share in 2022 to be at or above this historic average. We expect to start between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in new development, with 45% build-to-suits and for stabilizations to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Dispositions will range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion, with the majority expected to close in the first half of 2021. We're forecasting net deployment uses of $350 million at the midpoint. And as a result, our leverage will remain effectively flat in 2021.  
Putting this all together, we expect core FFO, including the $0.02 of net promote expense to range between $3.88 to $3.98 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $3.90 and $4 per share, with the year-over-year growth at the midpoint of more than 10%, delivering another year of exceptional growth. We enter 2021 with optimism and confidence. Our ability to deliver value for our customers beyond real estate, using our unmatched purchasing power and significant investments in technology, innovation and data are significant competitive advantages that will drive further outperformance.  
With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

But I would say even more than our expectations at the beginning of the year -- beginning of last year prior to COVID."

Obviously, we understand the supply-constrained nature of industrial markets in major cities. But it seems like nowadays, every real estate developer is an industrial developer.

And the other thing you should take into account is that in these infill locations, you can have a lot of developers, but you're not going to have a lot more land or buildings that can be rehabilitated. So I think you'll see it in terms of pressure on pricing of those assets more than you would see it on absolute supply, because the supply is pretty inelastic, and it will show up in price."

We are not good buyers of core, core real estate, auction by a brokerage house, where there are 55 people showing up at the margin. A lot of these people have to build up their industrial capability and everybody's trying to get into that business because the other property types don't offer very many opportunities. So those kinds are just duking it out on price is not our business. So that means that building out our land bank, doing value-added acquisitions where we can bring our leasing and operational expertise to the table, deals that are hairy, et cetera, et cetera. But general framework for looking at deals is returns. How we can differentiate and have a competitive advantage. And also in the case of portfolio deals, what the fit is, if we have to buy 100 buildings and sell 90 of them, that's probably not a very attractive transaction for us. 
So the other thing I would just mention is that you posed the question in the sense that we're only going after big deals. We do a lot of $5 million deals, too. They just don't show up. So we're there looking at pretty much everything that moves out there. And we're there with offers on most, if not all of the ones that meet our quality standards.

I mean, just look at the last quarter, you've had -- look at the market cap that's been created in this area. It's probably more than it's been created in a decade in some of those markets. 
So no, I don't think -- so the numbers are actually pretty interesting. If you look at the overall California numbers, I don't have them specifically for the Bay Area. But this year and the way they measure it, it's a June 30 year-end. But in the year ended June 30, you had 260,000 people move out of California. That compares to the year before, like a more normal year, about 230,000 people. So there is always this churning that happens. 
But all of that is about 0.5% of the total population in California, and you still have internal growth. So California's still growing. It's just not growing at the same pace as it was before. And I think some of the outflows have to do with temporary work from home kind of situations. We don't expect all of those things to last forever. So you'll have some people coming back to California. I think housing prices have moderated, certainly on the rental side.

I thought it would have moderated, given the downturn and the unemployment rate. And the key is that calculus is quality of labor. So we've taken a lot of steps, as you know, with our community workforce initiative to try to address that to our customers. But no matter how hard we work or how large that initiative gets, it's not going to even begin to make a dent in the problem that we have. Are there geographical differences from place to place, for sure. But those geographical differences have already been adjusted, because people don't put their warehouses in places where there is no labor whatsoever. They put it in places where there is labor, but there's just not as much labor as they would like. 
So they're all competing with one another. And the turnover rate and that kind of labor, it's very high, it's about 40% a year.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Positive [indiscernible] net the fourth quarter has carried into 2021 as evidenced by our operating results, profitable deployment activities and strong outlook. Demand drive",1364,"Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Positive [indiscernible] net the fourth quarter has carried into 2021 as evidenced by our operating results, profitable deployment activities and strong outlook. Demand driven by the powerful economic recovery, retail revolution and higher inventory levels is unfolding more strongly than we expected. 
Headlines in the past 90 days has been a testament to the value of our Brazilian supply chains. Those who were prepared are now growing and taking market share. There is great momentum moving the supply chain as signaled by retail sales, import volume and rising inventory levels. This will continue as inventory and sales ratios have just begun to rise as companies race to keep pace with demand. 
Starting with our proprietary metrics in our new markets. Space utilization is [ 4.5% ], up 100 basis points from the last 90 days. Our customers tell us their activity levels are rising at the fastest pace since 2019. These proposals reached 93 million square feet in the first quarter, a new high watermark, and were up [ 13% ] from 2020 adjusted for the size of our portfolio. These signings were [ 60 ] million square feet, our second highest quarter on record. Much of these activities were in new leasing. And as a result, retention was [ 69% ] for the quarter as we're optimizing credit and rents. Given our high volume of lead signings, our portfolio -- operating portfolio was 96.4% based at quarter end. Our leasing mix continues to broaden with strong demand continuing from state sizes above 100,000 square feet, and solid states demand is improving. 
E-commerce demand remains elevated, representing 25% of new lease signings in the first quarter. The balance of leasing is diverse, with outsized growth among companies that provide food and consumer products as well as renewed momentum in the Construction segment as housing expand. 
In the U.S., we now expect net absorption of 300 million square feet in 2021, which will be the highest in history. This strong demand is being maxed by supply, and we expect 300 million square feet of delivery this year. However, supplier remains broadly disappointed. Years of historic low vacancy rates have constrained demand due to lack of available properties, particularly in the most viable markets. Many of our markets face shortages of land for logistics uses. 
In addition, obsolescence and convergence to higher better use of [indiscernible] broad-based scarcity. Vacancies are below 2% in many of our top markets, such as Southern California and Toronto, Germany's green markets in Tokyo. Our supply watch list continues to include just 4 markets: Houston, Madrid, Poland and West China, which, taken together, account for just over 5% of our NOI. 
More recently, we've begun to see a rapid acceleration in replacement costs. In the U.S., we expect replacement cost to increase 20% to 25% over the 2-year period through 2021, the fastest rate ever. Our procurement team is proactively mitigating it, increasing by securing favorable pricing and delivery schedules. 
For example, the team procured a [indiscernible] for 5.2 million square of starts and pricing roughly 5% low market and providing us with a 10- to 20-week schedule advantage. Strengthening demand in ultra-low vacancies are leading customers to increasingly compete for states, which is translating into pricing power. 
Rent growth for the quarter, which was up 2.4% in the U.S., outperformed our expectations. We are raising our 2021 rent forecast to 6.5% in the U.S. and 6% globally. Our in-place-to-market rent spread now stands at 13.6%, up 80 basis points sequentially. This represents future annual incremental organic kind of work and a wider growth potential of more than $600 million. 
Turning to valuation. Logistics assets values were up a record 7.5% over the last 2 quarters. A way to capital in emerge can be both from rising [indiscernible] allocation and investors strategically reassessing their property focus type. Applying the valuation uplift to our $148 billion loan-to-manage portfolio, we estimate that the value of our real estate rose by more than $10 billion over the past 2 quarters. 
Moving to results. The work we've done to position portfolio and optimize the balance sheet is continuing to deliver excellent financial results. For the quarter, core FFO was $0.97 per share, which includes net promote expense of $0.01. Net effective rent change on rollover was 27%, led by the U.S. at [ 32% ]. We are reaping rent or occupancy on substantially all of our markets. Occupancy at quarter end was 95.6%, down 60 basis points sequentially, in line with normal first quarter seasonality. Rent collections remain very strong, and we effectively had no bad debt expense in the quarter. 
Our share of cash same-store line growth was [ 4.5% ], driven by the U.S. at 4.8%. For strategic capital, our team raised $1.4 billion in the first quarter as investor demand remains robust. Equity [ teams ] for our open-ended vehicles are at an all-time high at more than [ $3 billion ] at quarter end. This level of interest is another indicator that valuations for high-quality logistics assets should continue to increase. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength, with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our operated vehicles now totaling $14 billion. We were able to get in front of a rent increase in interest rates and issued $3.5 billion of debt with a weighted average rate of 96 basis points and a [ turn ] of 11 years. This activity included the issuance of a senior U.S. seller bond with a spread of 55 basis points, below a 10-year REIT bond spread ever and the completion of our 15th REIT bond offering. The assets backing these bonds of a product of 2 decades of sustainable development. 
Our debt maturity stack is in excellent shape with minimal maturities until 2026. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on a green revolving credit facility, adding $500 million more capacity to our already exceptionally strong liquidity position. 
Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook is more positive across the board. Here are the update on a share basis. We are increasing our cash same-store NOI growth midpoint by 75 basis points and revenue range to 4.5% to 5%. We now expect that net expense to be in line with our historical average at approximately 20 basis points in gross revenues, down from our prior guidance midpoint of 30 basis points. We're increasing our average occupancy midpoint for our operating portfolio by 50 basis points to 96.5%. 
Strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, will now range between $450 million and $460 million, up $12.5 million at the midpoint. The increase is primarily due to higher asset management fees resulting from increased property values. Whether you look at public comps or recent transactions, both would indicate that our strategic capital business is significantly [indiscernible]. We are increasing development starts by $400 million and now expect a midpoint of $2.9 billion. [indiscernible] will comprise more than 40% of the volume. Our land portfolio today comprised of land options, and covered land place supports approximately [ $17 billion ] of future development. We are increasing the midpoint from recondition and contributions by $800 million in total. 
Consistent with the rise in asset value and higher contributions, we're increasing realized development gains by $200 million with a [ lending ] point of $750 million. Net fund uses are now expected to be $50 million with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021. 
Putting this all together, we're increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to [ $3.96 ] to $4.02 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $3.98 and [ $4.04 ] per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of 12%. Our efforts over the past [ 2 ] years to reposition the portfolio and balance sheet have set us up to outperform in 2021 and beyond. And you're probably tired by saying that it continues to be true, we believe the best years for the company are still ahead of us. 
With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

I guess from -- sitting on the other side, investors and The Street generally understand that things look really good. Fundamentals have improved, NOI is trending up. So I guess I'm just looking forward. What would you say are some of the areas of organic growth that could surprise us positively?

I think organic growth is -- the prospects are actually better than they've been in as far as I remember. Replacement costs are moving very quickly, and interest rates are moving up or generally up in the last 6 or 7 months. So both of those things argued for the need for higher rents to pencil out the development. 
Now lowering cap rates mitigate that a bit, but we don't -- we can't really count on that. So a prudent developer with more higher input costs and higher yield requirements would have to get higher rents to make that work. That just puts a pricing umbrella over our in-place rents and widens that in place to market spread, which gives us more pricing power going forward. And given our concentration and focus on the most desirable markets where the supply picture is the tightest, I think organic growth is always the engine that we count on for propelling our growth. 
All the other stuff is episodic, and it's basically a cap rate conversion between the private markets or the public markets or the public market valuation of 2 different companies in the case of M&A. Those are not things we control. But where we invest, how we invest, how we push rents, how we use our scale to drive value for our customers and how we extract that value in the form of higher rents and other fees for services is really where we add value. The external growth can come and grow -- come and go. 
Having said that, we have great external growth prospects, too, without having to do deals. We have a great land bank. They're well positioned. We have even greater shadow land bank and covered land place. You add it all up together, and we can probably grow the portfolio organically by the size of 1 of the top 3 companies in the sector just with the land that we already own. So I feel really good about both organic and external sources of growth for the company."

First of all, we can make the occupancy be whatever we want and retention to be whatever we want if we were more dovish on grants and what we can get. And I do think that we're actually leading the market in that direction. 
The other thing as you may remember from last year around this time, maybe it was the second quarter call. I don't remember. But we talked about we're taking very careful notes on who's behaving and who's not behaving when the markets really softened and there are people who are requesting deferrals and where we're really trying to take advantage of the situation where the businesses were not distressed. And those are the people that, given a flight between 2 tenants on a given space, are going to be on the losing end of that flight. So people's behavior does affect how we make these leasing decisions. And if Fed hurts a retention stat, so be it. We'll make more money, and we'll have a better portfolio of customers."

By the way, was this Ki bin because my earphone fell out? You know more about that venture capital portfolio based on the report that you wrote last week that I wrote that you can answer this question actually better than I can. But we've made roughly, as you pointed out, about 30 investments totaling about $100 million. I would -- look, if -- and I said this 5 years, 6 years ago when we started this activity. If those investments were 5x multiple, which is a good venture capital outcome, okay, it's great. We make $500 million. But across a company which has got an enterprise value of $100 billion, it's interesting, but it's not huge. It's not a game changer. But if we can change the effectiveness of our business, the value of our business to our customers by 5%. 
Now you're talking some serious, though. I mean that's $5 billion. So really, the way -- the reason we're doing all this stuff is not because we're great venture capitalists, but because we can actually assess the quality of an idea in this sector. We're not in other sectors, and we can actually affect the outcome probability by letting those companies get traction quickly, improve their product offering, et cetera, et cetera. So -- by the way, not all of them are going to be successful for sure. And we've had 1 that has not done a sale. so far, but that's actually a pretty good track record for a portfolio of those sites.

For sure, they're going to be up in my explanation for the foreseeable future. 
The first structural thing is that people are just carrying more safety stock because with all the fluctuations, COVID-induced and Suez Canal-induced and everything else induce, you just need to carry more inventory to buffer yourself from these risks because the cost of lost sales is much greater than the additional cost of carrying inventory. So across the board, we quantified that as 5% to 10% more inventory in a steady-state environment. I think you've seen Chris' paper on that. And if I were going to pick a number, it would be on the higher end of that range, more closer to the 10%. So that's a big driver. 
Secondly, inventory-to-sales ratios have been really stretched thing. I mean the starting point of where inventories are is very stretched. And it just has to normalize to its regular level. And then the third thing is that the transition to e-commerce as that percentage goes up, we'll drive that number up. So I think, yes, we're going to have more inventories at that system. 
By the way, there's a fourth thing I hadn't thought about first, but you have utilization rates that are 85%, 86%. So it's not like there's a lot of slack in the system. So that the mechanism for having more inventory will translate for demand -- to demand for more space pretty quickly because those are very high utilization rates."

What you're seeing on turnover costs is really a mix issue driven by more new leasing relative to renewals. And concessions are typically a bit higher on renewal leasing. So you're seeing that mix. 
Also the turnover costs, we're certainly seeing higher rents. And with turnover costs and including lease commissions, that will be a driver as well. When you think about short-term leasing -- or I'm sorry, leasing or smaller spaces, it is certainly improving this quarter, particularly when we look at proposal levels. Portfolio level by seem where I believe were the highest. The growth was the highest in the quarter almost all the segments. So proposal activity is good and rent change is accelerating. So I think we're going to see the smaller spaces to improve pretty well the balance of the year."

That's a reasonable amount of development to expect. And at that time, remember, everybody was scared that Prologis kind of numbers in $5 million -- $5 billion, and that holds the [ buck ]. So our number from literally 11 years ago is $2 billion to $3 billion. And that was with AMD, which at the time was about 250 million square feet. Today, the new Prologis is 1 billion square feet. That's 4x as big. So to normalize that number for today given the size of the base. That number would have to be $8 billion to $12 billion. So the fact that we're going 3 to 3.5 or whatever, it ends up being, is in the historical context. And the size of the company is much, much smaller than the numbers you used to see in the mid to late 80s. And the reason for that is that development is that much tougher to do, particularly in the market that people have figured out they want to be. At that time, people didn't have quite the same appreciation of the quality differences between markets that they do now. But -- so in a historical context, those are really small numbers. 
I mean, to get to their equivalent, you would have to take old Prologis' guidance, the old AMB guidance, the old Liberty guidance, the old DCP guidance and a couple of private things in between and add them all together. So I think there is a potential upside opportunity if we could get our hands on good land, and that is where the tools. That's why I think there's so much pressure on rents going forward."

And that compounded with the challenge of getting more land, I just think that those are going to be all tailwinds for rent growth into the foreseeable future. 
And going back to something that I think we shared extensively with you guys a couple of years ago, at the end of the day, rent is anywhere between 2% and 4% of supply chain costs. And people are just getting smarter about how to use well-located real estate to actually save cost on the other aspects of supply chain costs As they are pulling together their space buyers and their logistics and the people who set up inventory and people who do the demographic analysis of where they want to locate things. So I think all of that is going to translate into longer runway for rental growth compared to -- would have been. 
Of course, turnover costs are going to go up as well because you use steel and all that in building out the space. But I think rents, as a percentage of rents, which is the way we like to look at them, I don't think they're going to change that much because rents are going to be affected by the same factors, too."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Positive momentum from the fourth quarter has carried into 2021 as evidenced by our operating results, profitable deployment activities and strong outlook. Demand driven by the powerful economic recovery, retail revolution and higher inventory levels is unfolding more strongly than we expected. Headlines in the past 90 days has been a testament to the value of our Brazilian supply chains. Those who are prepared are now growing and taking market share. 
There is great momentum in improved supply chain as signaled by retail sales, import volumes and rising inventory levels. This will continue as inventory and sales ratios have just begun to rise as companies race to keep pace with demand. 
Starting with our proprietary metrics in our view of the markets, space utilization is 24.5%, up 100 basis points in the last 90 days. Our customers tell us their activity levels are rising at the fastest pace since 2019. These proposals reached 93 million square feet in the first quarter, a new high watermark and are up 13% from 2020, adjusted for the size of our portfolio.  
Lease signings were 60 million square feet, our second highest quarter on record. Much of this activity is in new leasing. And as a result, retention was [ 69% ] for the quarter as we're optimizing credit and rents, given our high volume of lease signings, our portfolio -- operating portfolio was 96.4% leased at quarter end.  
Our leasing needs continue to broaden with strong demand continuing from space sizes above 100,000 square feet and solid sales demand is improving. E-commerce demand remains elevated, representing 25% of the new lease signings in the first quarter. The balance of leasing is diverse with outsized growth among companies that provide food and consumer products as well as renewed momentum in the construction segment as housing expands.  
In the U.S., we now expect an absorption of 300 million square feet in 2021, which will be the highest in history. This strong demand has been maxed by supply as we expect 300 million square feet of deliveries this year. However, supplier remains broadly disciplined. Years of historic low vacancy rates have constrained demand due to the lack of available properties, particularly in the most desirable markets. Many of our markets face shortages of land or logistics uses. In addition, obsolescence and convergence to higher better use of added broad-based scarcity.  
Vacancies are below 2% in many of our top markets, such as something Southern California and Toronto, Germany's main markets and Tokyo. Our supply watch list continues to include just 4 markets: Houston, Madrid, Poland and West China, which, taken together, account for just over 5% of our NOI. More recently, we've begun to see a rapid acceleration in replacement costs. In the U.S., we expect replacement cost to increase 20% to 25% over the 2-year period through 2021, the fastest rate ever.  
Our procurement team is proactively mitigating these increases by securing favorable pricing and delivery schedules. For example, the team has procured steel for 5.2 million square feet of starts and pricing roughly 5% low market and providing us with a 10-to-20-week schedule advantage. 
Strengthening demand in ultra-low vacancies are leading customers to increasingly compete for space, which is translating into pricing power. Rent growth for the quarter, which was up 2.4% in the U.S., outperformed our expectations. We are raising our 2021 rent forecast to 6.5% in the U.S. and 6% globally. Our in-place to market rent spread now stands at 13.6%, up 80 basis points sequentially. This represents future annual incremental organic kind of work and a wide growth potential of more than $600 million. 
Turning to valuations. Logistics assets values were up a record 7.5% over the last 2 quarters. A weighted capital in reversed can be both from rising realty allocation and investors strategically reassessing their property focus type. Applying the valuation uplift to our $148 billion loan and managed portfolio, we estimate that the value of our real estate rose by more than $10 billion over the past 2 quarters. 
Moving to results. The work we've done to position the portfolio and optimize the balance sheet is continuing to deliver excellent financial results. For the quarter, core FFO was $0.97 per share, which includes net promote expense of $0.01. Net effective rent change on rollover was 27%, led by the U.S. at 32%. We are prioritizing rents forward occupancy to substantially all of our markets. Occupancy at quarter end was 95.6%, down 60 basis points sequentially, in line with normal first quarter seasonality. 
Rent collections remained very strong, and we effectively had no bad debt expense in the quarter. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.5%, driven by the U.S. at 4.8%. For strategic capital, our team raised $1.4 billion in the first quarter as investor demand remains robust. Equity teams for our open-ended vehicles are at an all-time high at more than $3 billion at quarter end. This level of interest is another indicator that valuations for high-quality logistics assets should continue to increase. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our operated vehicles, now totaling $14 billion. We were able to get in front of the recent increase in interest rates and issued $3.5 billion of debt of a weighted average rate of 96 basis points and a turn of 11 years. This activity included the issuance of a 10-year U.S. dollar bond with a spread of 55 basis points, the lowest 10-year green bond spread ever and the completion of our 15 green bond offering. The assets backing these bonds of a product of 2 decades of sustainable development. 
Our debt maturity stack is in excellent shape with minimal maturities until 2026. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed at a green revolving credit facility at a $500 million more capacity to our already exceptionally strong liquidity position. 
Moving to guidance for 2021, our outlook is more positive across the board. Here are the updates on an our share basis. We are increasing our cash same-store NOI growth midpoint by 75 basis points and narrowly the range of 4.5% to 5%. We now expect that net expense to be in line with our historical average at approximately 20 basis points of gross revenues, down from our prior guidance midpoint of 30 basis points. We're increasing our average occupancy midpoint for our operating portfolio by 50 basis points to 96.5%. 
Strategic capital revenue, excluding [indiscernible] promotes, will now raise between $450 million and $460 million, up $12.5 million at the midpoint. The increase is primarily due to higher asset management fees resulting from increased property volumes. Whether you look at public comps or recent transactions, both would indicate that our strategic capital business is significantly under guidance. We are increasing development starts by $400 million and now expect a midpoint of $2.9 billion. The [indiscernible] will comprise more than 40% of the volume. 
Our land portfolio today comprised of land options and covered land place supports approximately $17 billion of future development. We are increasing the midpoint from recondition and contributions by $800 million in total, consistent with the rise in asset values and higher contributions were increasing realized development gains by $200 million with a new midpoint of $750 million. Net flow leases are now expected to be $50 million with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021. 
Putting this all together, we're increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 in arrear range to $3.96 to $4.02 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $3.98 and $4.04 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of 12%. Our efforts over the past 10 years to reposition the portfolio and balance sheet have set us up to outperform in 2021 and beyond. And you're probably tired by saying that that it continues to be true. We believe the best years for the company are still ahead of us. 
With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

I guess from -- sitting on the other side, investors and the Street generally understand that things look really good. Fundamentals have improved, NOI is trending up. So I guess I'm just looking forward, what would you say are some of the areas of organic growth that could surprise us positively? 
And second, what does this mean for Prologis' ability to do external growth, be it development or even larger scale M&A?"
330123,709206653,2253301,"Prologis, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2021",2021-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Prologis, Inc.","Executives","Let me take a crack at that. I think organic growth is -- the prospects are actually better than they've been in -- as far as I remember, replacement costs are moving very quickly, and interest rates are moving up or generally up in the last 6 or 7 months",352,"Let me take a crack at that. I think organic growth is -- the prospects are actually better than they've been in -- as far as I remember, replacement costs are moving very quickly, and interest rates are moving up or generally up in the last 6 or 7 months. So both of those things argue for the need for higher rents to pencil at a development. 
Now lowering cap rates mitigate that a bit, but we don't -- we can't really count on that. So a prudent developer with more higher input costs and higher yield requirements would have to get higher rents to make that work. That just puts a pricing umbrella over our in-place rents and widens that in-place to market spread, which gives us more pricing power going forward. And given our concentration and focus on the most desirable markets where the supply picture is the tightest, I think, organic growth is always the engine that we count on for propelling our growth. 
All the other stuff is episodic, and it's basically a cap rate conversion between the private markets or the public markets or the public market valuation of 2 different companies in the case of M&A. Those are not the things we control. But where we invest, how we invest, how we push rents, how we use our scale to drive value for our customers and how we extract that value in the form of higher rents and other fees for services is really where we add value. Or the external growth can come and grow -- come and go. 
Having said that, we have great external growth prospects, too, without having to do deals. We have a great land bank. They're well positioned. We have even greater shadow land bank and covered land plays. You add it all up together, and we can probably grow the portfolio organically by the size of one of the top 3 companies in the sector just with the land that we already own. So I feel really good about both organic and external sources of growth for the company."

This is the first time, in my view, in the company's history that we've actually taken advantage of our scale in a way that I think is really meaningful. And you're starting to see it show up in development margins and operating margins. 
And both Tom and Hamid mentioned steel. It's not just about procuring a 5% to 10% cost savings on steel. It's about procuring those critical raw materials. Tom mentioned 10 to 20 weeks of schedule advantage. And when you're talking development and particularly build-to-suits, that is a game changer. So I think that the procurement organization has created a real competitive advantage for us, not only on the construction and cost side, but also on the essential side where we're now starting to deliver a different type of value proposition beyond the 4 walls in the roof."

And we're really trying to take advantage of the situation where the businesses were not distressed. And those are the people that given fight between 2 tenants on a given space, are going to be on the losing end of that fight. So people's behavior does affect how we make the exclusive decisions.

I'm -- for sure they're going to be up in my explanation for the foreseeable future. The first structural thing is that people are just carrying more safety stock because with all the fluctuations COVID induced and Suez Canal induced and everything else in this, you just need to carry more inventory to buffer yourself from these risks because the cost of lost sales is much greater than the additional cost of carrying inventory. 
So across the board, we quantified that as 5% to 10% more inventory in a steady space environment. I think you've seen Chris' paper on that. And if I were going to pick a number, it would be on the higher end of that range, more closer to the 10%. So that's a big driver. 
Secondly, inventory to sale ratios have been really stretched in. I mean we're -- the starting point of where inventories are is very stretched. And it just has to normalize to its regular level. And then the third thing is that the transition to e-commerce as that percentage goes up, we'll drive that number up. So I think, yes, we're going to have more inventories of those system. 
By the way, there's a fourth thing I hadn't thought about first, but you have utilization rates that are 85%, 86%. So it's not like there's a lot of slack in the system. So that -- the mechanism for having more inventory will translate for demand -- to demand for more space pretty quickly because those are very high utilization rates."

When you think about short-term leasing -- or I'm sorry, leasing for smaller spaces, it is certainly improving this quarter, particularly when we look at proposal levels, portfolio level by segment, where I believe we're the highest.

That's a reasonable amount of development to expect. And at that time, remember, everybody was scared that Prologis kind of numbers in $5 million -- $5 billion, and that holds the buck. 
So our number from literally 11 years ago is $2 billion to $3 billion. And that was with AMB, which at the time was about 250 million square feet. Today, the new Prologis is 1 billion square feet. That's 4x as big. So to normalize that number for today given the size of the base, that number would have to be $8 billion to $12 billion. So the fact that we're going 3 to 3.5 or whatever, it ends up being, is in the historical context. And the size of the company is much, much smaller than the numbers you used to see in the mid- to late 80s. And the reason for that is that development is that much tougher to do, particularly in the market that people have figured out they want to be. At that time, people didn't have quite the same appreciation of the quality differences between markets that they do now. 
But -- so in a historical context, those are really small numbers. I mean to get to their equivalent, you would have to take old Prologis' guidance, the old AMB guidance, the old Liberty guidance, the old DCP guidance and a couple of private things in between and add them all together.

And going back to something that I think we shared extensively with you guys a couple of years ago, at the end of the day, rent is anywhere between 2% and 4% of supply chain costs. And people are just getting smarter about how to use well-located real estate to actually save cost on the other aspects of supply chain costs as they are pulling together their space buyers and their logisticians and the people who set up inventory and the people who do the demographic analysis of where they want to locate things. So I think all of that is going to translate into longer runway for rental growth compared to -- would have been. 
Of course, turnover costs are going to go up as well because you use steel and all that in building out the space.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The second quarter exceeded our expectations, both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond. With our exceptional portfolio and team, we set high watermarks",1317,"Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The second quarter exceeded our expectations, both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond. With our exceptional portfolio and team, we set high watermarks across several measures this quarter. Demand for space is robust and diverse and market conditions remained the healthiest in our 38-year history. 
In the second quarter, lease signings were 64 million square feet and lease proposals were 84 million square feet. Both remain above average and were driven by new and development leasing. Likewise, the Prologis IBI Customer Activity Index reached a new high in the second quarter, an early indicator of strong future demand. Our leasing mix is broad. Currently, the greatest demand is for spaces above 100,000 square feet. For smaller spaces, activity is picking up. We signed 518 leases totaling 18 million square feet in the quarter, the highest volume in this segment in 3 years. 
For customer segments, e-commerce continues to lead the way, representing 30% of new lease signings in the second quarter. While Amazon remains steady at 6% of total new leasing, we have seen many more e-commerce players come to the table. For example, we signed 168 new e-commerce leases in the first half of 2021 versus 53 in the first half of last year. Supply chains are racing, beginning to restock and as they do, will create more demand going forward. 
Containerized imports are up 33% through May versus pre-pandemic levels as retailers replenish their supply chains. While inventories have risen 3% from their trough, they have struggled to grow this year as retail sales are up 19% from pre-pandemic levels. We see the current low level of inventories in our space utilization, which at 84.3% is below the long-term average of 85%. This is yet another sign that our customers are operating with suboptimal levels of inventory. 
Putting together recent outperformance and ongoing momentum, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 20% to 360 million square feet and deliveries by 8% to 325 million square feet. Looking forward, we foresee continued supply, balanced by demand, with historic low vacancy of 4.5% carrying into 2022. 
With balanced demand and supply, acute scarcity in our markets is driving record rent and value growth. Our operating portfolio lease percentage rose by 80 basis points to 97.2% at quarter end. Customers continue to compete for space and are making decisions faster with lease gestation in the quarter of just 44 days. When we look at the factors impacting supply, significant barriers exist in our markets and include a lack of viable land, increasingly difficult and expensive permitting and entitlement processes and rapidly escalating replacement costs. Our research team released an excellent paper on this last month, which you can find on our website. 
Our supply watch list remains quite small. [indiscernible] Houston in the quarter, leaving just Spain and Poland. Accelerating demand in the quarter, combined with ultra-low vacancies, translated to a very strong rent growth of 4.1% in our U.S. markets, exceeding our expectations. As a result, we are raising our 2021 rent forecast to an all-time high of 10.3% for the U.S., up approximately 40 basis points from our prior estimate and 8% globally, which is up 300 basis points. Our in-place to market rent spread is now the widest in our history at 16.9%, up 330 basis points sequentially. This represents future gas in the tank of nearly $700 million in NOI or $0.90 per share. 
Turning to valuations. Our assets have the strongest quarterly uplift in our history, rising 8% in the second quarter alone, with the U.S. up more than 10% and Europe up 5.6%. On the topic of valuation, I want to point out that we enhanced the NAV disclosure in our supplemental related to property management fees. Given the size and scale of our portfolio, we created substantial value through our operational advantages. As a result, we know that real estate is worth more in our hands. Accordingly, we are now including net property management fee income as a component of adjusted NOI in our NAV disclosure. 
Switching gears to results for the quarter. Our team and portfolio continued to deliver excellent financial results. Core FFO was $1.01 per share, with net promote earnings effectively 0, rent change on rollover was 32%. Occupancy at quarter end was 96.8%, up 110 basis points sequentially. Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 5.8%, [indiscernible] 290 basis points year-over-year. We tapped into favorable market conditions and disposed of $880 million of nonstrategic assets across our portfolio. 
In addition, just last week, we completed the sale of a $920 million owned and managed portfolio, including all of the nonstrategic IPT assets. It's worth noting that to date, we have sold $2 billion of nonstrategic assets from our IPT and LPT acquisitions at pricing more than 23% above underwriting. 
Turning to strategic capital, our team raised almost $600 million in the second quarter. Equity cues from our open-ended vehicles [indiscernible] [ billion ] at quarter end, hitting another all-time high. Robust investor interest has prompted private equity limited partners to shift away from diversified toward sector-specific funds, particularly for the logistics sector. In light of recent asset management transactions and public comps, the value being ascribed to our strategic capital business is meaningfully understated. For the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength, with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles totaling $14 billion. 
Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved, given higher rent growth, higher valuations and robust demand. Here are the key updates on our share basis. We're increasing our cash same-store NOI growth midpoint by 75 basis points to now range between 5.25% and 5.75%. We expect bad debt expense to be approximately 10 basis points of gross revenues, down from our prior guidance midpoint of 20 basis points and well below our historical average. We are increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes to $470 million, up $15 million from prior guidance. This upward revision is due to increased asset management fees resulting from higher property values. 
Faster development lease-up and higher asset values are also leading to an increase in promotes. We now expect net promote income of $0.02 for this year, an increase of $0.04 from our prior guidance. We're also increasing development starts by $300 million and now expect a midpoint of $3.2 billion. Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of development volume. Our owned and managed land portfolio, which is composed of land, options and covered land supports $18 billion of future development over the next several years. 
We are also increasing the midpoint for dispositions and contributions by $650 million in total. This increase will have roughly a $0.02 drag on earnings this year, given the timing to redeploy the incremental proceeds. We now expect to generate net deployment sources of $200 million at the midpoint, with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021. 
Taking these assumptions into account, we're increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.07 and narrowing the range to $4.04 to $4.08 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.02 and $4.06 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 13%. We continue to maintain exceptional dividend coverage, and our 2021 guidance implies a payout ratio in the low 60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1.3 billion. 
In closing, the first half of the year has been extraordinary and our outlook is equally promising. Visibility into our strong future organic earnings potential is very clear. We have a significant embedded in-place to market rent spread, a development-ready land portfolio, substantial balance sheet capacity and ability to create value for our customers beyond the real estate. With that, I'll turn it back to Holly for your questions."

I think there are several aspects of our development business that are quite unique. The first, I would just think, looking at the size of that portfolio, $18 billion of build-out, almost 20% of our market cap. And that portfolio is very focused in our high-barrier markets in which we operate. So we've got a land bank that we can build out a very, very high-quality portfolio that's in high demand. 
It's very diversified across 19 different countries, and it's a huge opportunity set that our development platform has to build out. Just having the menu to seek the best returns and to solve customers problems across all of those different markets is a huge advantage. And I think that leads to just the durability of those development gains. So if you look at our track record, we've got a track record of 20 years developing $37 billion of assets, 20% unlevered IRR. And we get those results verified externally by Duff & Phelps, by the way. But so an incredible track record of durability. So when you look at the $18 billion of build-out, our history of being able to continue to develop at very, very attractive rates, there's a very, very long runway of opportunity that's just presented in front of us. 
And then to your point on realized gains, I think that's another point that makes us quite unique that given our capital structure and how we're -- how we want to structure the vast majority of our assets outside the U.S. are held in funds but we're developing the vast majority of those assets on balance sheet in Europe, in Japan, Mexico. And those assets, with very few exceptions, are contributing into our funds, so there's a real crystallization of those gains. So when you think about the 20% unlevered IRRs, all that development, the vast majority of those gains were realized in cash, and that's a real cash flow that is part of your AFFO and should be embedded in your valuation. 
And I think when we look at valuation in particular for development, I think there's a very scattershot approach because there's a couple of different things you have to do. Obviously, you've got the CIP that's in front of you, you got to finish that and value that. You've got your land bank, in our case, $18 billion that you have to value. And there's also residual, for this platform, right? This platform has a history of $37 billion and 20% unlevered IRRs. There's a value here. So I think you can put those all together, there's different ways to do it, obviously. But I would just encourage you to take a look at the cash flows that this thing generates historically. And I think you're going to find the valuations for our development capabilities are, I would say, significantly undervalued."

If you look over the last 5 years, AUM and revenues of that business have grown 18% so an 18% CAGR. More importantly, the EBITDA or cash flow that, that business is generating is -- has grown by 26% CAGR. So incredible growth. 
As we look forward, just given what we're seeing, I think the opportunities are there for very strong continued EBITDA growth. So I think that's a baseline I would think about there, a highly, highly scalable business for what we do. And relative to valuation, there have been, I think, clarity around valuation in this business. It has never been better because there's been several transactions that have cleared the market lately, and you can certainly look at public comps. I think for us, you need to look at the alternative asset managers as the right place to start. 
And while there are a lot of different ways I think analysts and investors are looking at multiples, but when you pore through it all for the alternatives and the comps we're seeing, you're going to see multiples in the mid-20s on earnings and those include promotes. So when you strip out promotes, you're seeing, for the best alternative asset managers, a multiple of 30x or higher and they're getting [ 10x ] on promotes. So yes, that would tell you our business is, I would say, very undervalued because as you're thinking about how we compare to them, I think you need to think about the stickiness of our AUM. 90-plus percent of our AUM is in long-life or perpetual vehicles. 
We talked about the growth profile that we have. And then clearly, there's incredible investor demand for our product, which is also lining up to support growth. Our equity queue at quarter end was $3.3 billion, an all-time high. So happy to get into more discussions with you all on this going forward but a lot of good visibility out there on valuation."

First, the business's scale. It's a $60 billion-plus business. I mean, that puts us among the top real estate asset managers anywhere by any measure. And we're focused on 1 property type. So that's a pretty significant market share in the most desirable market. So that plays to the premium. 
And also, I would say we have the longest history of actually producing these returns. That goes back to AMD's early days in the mid-80s. So both in terms of longevity, the quality of the income stream, these are not a bunch of closed-end funds that expire. These are, as Tom pointed out, very sticky and long-life cash flow streams. I would argue that they have more leverage on the upside than the real estate cash flows that support that business because of the fee and promote structure. 
So for the life of me, I don't really understand why they're being valued the way they are, but we're going to do a better job of explaining that to people who follow this business because we're honestly getting a lot of receptivity from those investors that really understand the sector."

So I was hoping you guys could comment on how you see the fundraising environment kind of proceeding over the coming years. 
And then also maybe secondarily to that, it's really interesting. This is the first year that the net income, excluding promotes, kind of subsume your corporate G&A. So from a valuation perspective, how do you think about addressing that? It's obviously a huge benefit but a big change versus prior year."

At the time of the merger exactly 10 years ago, the merger closed on June 30, 2011, exactly 10 years ago, it was $14 billion. So you do the math as to what the growth rate has been. But I think 10 years, it's got to be a pretty representative period because we had some early not-so-great years in industrial and the past couple of years have been really good. 
But I haven't done the CAGR, but if you do the CAGR between $14 billion and whatever, $60 billion-plus, it's got to be pretty impressive. The guys are trying to do the math. Anyway, you can do the math. It's certainly higher than what any valuation model will suggest, and I bet you it's higher than a lot of public company asset managers. It's 16% annual growth rate in third-party funds under management.
And the limiter on that growth is not our ability to raise capital. We can go out there and raise gobs more capital than we have right now. It's just that we don't want to raise the capital if we think we don't have good deployment opportunities for it. So we don't want our Qs getting too long and investors to get frustrated, and we certainly don't want to have a big Q that forces dealmaking like we see in a lot of other places."

Hamid, just wanted to follow up on your comment on industrial development not penciling out.

As we sit today, what are your current thoughts as far as input costs and how they could continue to trend?

In terms of our pre-purchasing steel, I didn't want to create the false impression that we've got our entire development program hedged on steel costs. And we're pretty much working through the steel that's been hedged. So I don't think that's a big factor in forecasting margins going forward. 
My personal view is that some of the supply chain-related issues that have impacted material costs are going to subside. And there's a period out there, a year or 2 years out, where maybe the steel price escalation could reverse and get back on a sort of normal inflationary trend once all the plants are back up and producing. But the most important thing affecting margins is what Gene mentioned a little while ago, which is that cap rates are compressing and rents are growing faster than land cost and replacement costs are going up. So the margins, if anything, are going to expand unless something material changes that I can't think of right now, particularly given the outlook for demand. 
And when someone asked Chris about the different sectors and all that, notably absent in his sectors was housing. Housing is still not anywhere near its potential, and it's a big consumer of warehouse space that hasn't even kicked in. And you know how low the housing inventory is and how much prices are going up in the housing sector. So I expect actually that to be an additional engine of growth for demand."

Is it should demand feel good that you had to kind of secure market value land to put it to work relatively soon? Or is there a longer-term element to it that  you think the demand is long lasting and so good that you wanted to replenish the land inventory?

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The second quarter exceeded our expectations, both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond. With our exceptional portfolio and team, we set high watermarks",1316,"Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The second quarter exceeded our expectations, both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond. With our exceptional portfolio and team, we set high watermarks across several measures this quarter. Demand for space is robust and diverse and market conditions remained the healthiest in our 38-year history.  
In the second quarter, lease signings were 64 million square feet and lease proposals were 84 million square feet. Both remain above average and were driven by new and development leasing. Likewise, the Prologis IBI Customer Activity Index reached a new high in the second quarter, an early indicator of strong future demand. Our leasing mix is broad. Currently, the greatest demand is for spaces above 100,000 square feet. For smaller spaces, activity is picking up. We signed 518 leases totaling 18 million square feet in the quarter, the highest volume in this segment in 3 years.  
For customer segments, e-commerce continues to lead the way, representing 30% of new lease signings in the second quarter. While Amazon remains steady at 6% of total new leasing, we have seen many more e-commerce players come to the table. For example, we signed 168 new e-commerce leases in the first half of 2021 versus 53 in the first half of last year. Supply chains are racing, beginning to restock and as they do, will create more demand going forward.  
Containerized imports are up 33% through May versus pre-pandemic levels as retailers replenish their supply chains. While inventories have risen 3% from their trough, they have struggled to grow this year as retail sales are up 19% from pre-pandemic levels. We see the current low level of inventories in our space utilization, which at 84.3% is below the long-term average of 85%. This is yet another sign that our customers are operating with suboptimal levels of inventory.  
Putting together recent outperformance and ongoing momentum, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 20% to 360 million square feet and deliveries by 8% to 325 million square feet. Looking forward, we foresee continued supply, balanced by demand, with historic low vacancy of 4.5% carrying into 2022.  
With balanced demand and supply, acute scarcity in our markets is driving record rent and value growth. Our operating portfolio lease percentage rose by 80 basis points to 97.2% at quarter end. Customers continue to compete for space and are making decisions faster with lease gestation in the quarter of just 44 days. When we look at the factors impacting supply, significant barriers exist in our markets and include a lack of viable land, increasingly difficult and expensive permitting and entitlement processes and rapidly escalating replacement costs. Our research team released an excellent paper on this last month, which you can find on our website.  
Our supply watch list remains quite small. We removed Houston in the quarter, leaving just Spain and Poland. Accelerating demand in the quarter, combined with ultra-low vacancies, translated to a very strong rent growth of 4.1% in our U.S. markets, exceeding our expectations. As a result, we are raising our 2021 rent forecast to an all-time high of 10.3% for the U.S., up approximately 40 basis points from our prior estimate and 8% globally, which is up 300 basis points. Our in-place to market rent spread is now the widest in our history at 16.9%, up 330 basis points sequentially. This represents future gas in the tank of nearly $700 million in NOI or $0.90 per share.  
Turning to valuations. Our assets have the strongest quarterly uplift in our history, rising 8% in the second quarter alone, with the U.S. up more than 10% and Europe up 5.6%. On the topic of valuation, I want to point out that we enhanced the NAV disclosure in our supplemental related to property management fees. Given the size and scale of our portfolio, we created substantial value through our operational advantages. As a result, we know that real estate is worth more in our hands. Accordingly, we are now including net property management fee income as a component of adjusted NOI in our NAV disclosure.  
Switching gears to results for the quarter. Our team and portfolio continued to deliver excellent financial results. Core FFO was $1.01 per share, with net promote earnings effectively 0, rent change on rollover was 32%. Occupancy at quarter end was 96.8%, up 110 basis points sequentially. Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 5.8%, 290 basis points year-over-year. We tapped into favorable market conditions and disposed of $880 million of nonstrategic assets across our portfolio.  
In addition, just last week, we completed the sale of a $920 million owned and managed portfolio, including all of the nonstrategic IPT assets. It's worth noting that to date, we have sold $2 billion of nonstrategic assets from our IPT and LPT acquisitions at pricing more than 23% above underwriting.  
Turning to strategic capital, our team raised almost $600 million in the second quarter. Equity teams from our open-ended vehicles [indiscernible] at quarter end, hitting another all-time high. Robust investor interest has prompted private equity limited partners to shift away from diversified toward sector-specific funds, particularly for the logistics sector. In light of recent asset management transactions and public comps, the value being ascribed to our strategic capital business is meaningfully understated. For the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength, with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles totaling $14 billion.  
Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved, given higher rent growth, higher valuations and robust demand. Here are the key updates on our share basis. We're increasing our cash same-store NOI growth midpoint by 75 basis points to now range between 5.25% and 5.75%. We expect bad debt expense to be approximately 10 basis points of gross revenues, down from our prior guidance midpoint of 20 basis points and well below our historical average. We are increasing the midpoint of our strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes to $470 million, up $15 million from prior guidance. This upward revision is due to increased asset management fees resulting from higher property values.  
Faster development lease-up and higher asset values are also leading to an increase in promotes. We now expect net promote income of $0.02 for this year, an increase of $0.04 from our prior guidance. We're also increasing development starts by $300 million and now expect a midpoint of $3.2 billion. Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of development volume. Our owned and managed land portfolio, which is composed of land, options and covered land p;ace supports $18 billion of future development over the next several years.  
We are also increasing the midpoint for dispositions and contributions by $650 million in total. This increase will have roughly a $0.02 drag on earnings this year, given the timing to redeploy the incremental proceeds. We now expect to generate net deployment sources of $200 million at the midpoint, with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021.  
Taking these assumptions into account, we're increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.07 and narrowing the range to $4.04 to $4.08 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.02 and $4.06 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 13%. We continue to maintain exceptional dividend coverage, and our 2021 guidance implies a payout ratio in the low 60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1.3 billion.  
In closing, the first half of the year has been extraordinary and our outlook is equally promising. Visibility into our strong future organic earnings potential is very clear. We have a significant embedded in-place to market rent spread, a development-ready land portfolio, substantial balance sheet capacity and ability to create value for our customers beyond the real estate. With that, I'll turn it back to Holly for your questions."

This is Tom, I'll take the first shot at that. I think there are several aspects of our development business that are quite unique.

I think there are several aspects of our development business that are quite unique. The first, I would just think, looking at the size of that portfolio, $18 billion of build-out, almost 20% of our market cap. And that portfolio is very focused in our high-barrier markets in which we operate. So we've got a land bank that we can build out a very, very high-quality portfolio that's in high demand.  
It's very diversified across 19 different countries, and it's a huge opportunity set that our development platform has to build out. Just having the menu to seek the best returns and to solve customers' problems across all of those different markets is a huge advantage. And I think that leads to just the durability of those development gains. So if you look at our track record, we've got a track record of 20 years developing $37 billion of assets, 20% unlevered IRR. And we get those results verified externally by Duff & Phelps, by the way. But so an incredible track record of durability.  
So when you look at the $18 billion of build-out, our history of being able to continue to develop at very, very attractive rates, there's a very, very long runway of opportunity that's just presented in front of us.  
And then to your point on realized gains, I think that's another point that makes us quite unique that given our capital structure and how we're -- how we want to structure the vast majority of our assets outside the U.S. are held in funds but we're developing the vast majority of those assets on balance sheet in Europe, in Japan, Mexico. And those assets, with very few exceptions, are contributing into our funds, so there's a real crystallization of those gains. So when you think about the 20% unlevered IRRs, all that development, the vast majority of those gains were realized in cash, and that's a real cash flow that is part of your AFFO and should be embedded in your valuation.  
And I think when we look at valuation in particular for development, I think there's a very scattershot approach because there's a couple of different things you have to do. Obviously, you've got the CIP that's in front of you, you got to finish that and value that. You've got your land bank, in our case, $18 billion that you have to value. And there's also residual, for this platform, right? This platform has a history of $37 billion and 20% unlevered IRRs. There's a value here. So I think you can put those all together, there's different ways to do it, obviously. But I would just encourage you to take a look at the cash flows that this thing generates historically. And I think you're going to find the valuations for our development capabilities are, I would say, significantly undervalued."

If you look over the last 5 years, AUM and revenues of that business have grown 18% so an 18% CAGR. More importantly, the EBITDA or cash flow that, that business is generating is -- has grown by 26% CAGR. So incredible growth.  
As we look forward, just given what we're seeing, I think the opportunities are there for very strong continued EBITDA growth. So I think that's a baseline I would think about there, a highly, highly scalable business for what we do. And relative to valuation, there have been, I think, clarity around valuation in this business. It has never been better because there's been several transactions that have cleared the market lately, and you can certainly look at public comps. I think for us, you need to look at the alternative asset managers as the right place to start.  
And while there are a lot of different ways I think analysts and investors are looking at multiples, but when you pore through it all for the alternatives and with the comps we're seeing, you're going to see multiples in the mid-20s on earnings and those include promotes. So when you strip out promotes, you're seeing, for the best alternative asset managers, a multiple of 30x or higher and they're getting 10x on promotes. So yes, that would tell you our business is, I would say, very undervalued because as you're thinking about how we compare to them, I think you need to think about the stickiness of our AUM. 90-plus percent of our AUM is in long-life or perpetual vehicles.  
We talked about the growth profile that we have. And then clearly, there's incredible investor demand for our product, which is also lining up to support growth. Our equity queue at quarter end was $3.3 billion, an all-time high. So happy to get into more discussions with you all on this going forward but a lot of good visibility out there on valuation."

First, the business's scale. It's a $60 billion-plus business. I mean, that puts us among the top real estate asset managers anywhere by any measure. And we're focused on one property type. So that's a pretty significant market share in the most desirable market. So that plays to the premium.  
And also, I would say we have the longest history of actually producing these returns. That goes back to AMD's early days in the mid-80s. So both in terms of longevity, the quality of the income stream, these are not a bunch of closed-end funds that expire. These are, as Tom pointed out, very sticky and long-life cash flow streams. I would argue that they have more leverage on the upside than the real estate cash flows that support that business because of the fee and promote structure.  
So for the life of me, I don't really understand why they're being valued the way they are, but we're going to do a better job of explaining that to people who follow this business because we're honestly getting a lot of receptivity from those investors that really understand the sector."

What is driving that over the last 4 quarters and particularly in the second quarter is higher levels of new leasing. So new leasing in Q2 versus Q1 increased 40% sequentially. And new leases generally come with slightly higher concessions, slightly higher turnover costs as a result. And -- but the key is we're looking at long-term economics. So yes, there's a little bit of short-term pain with that, but we're getting in what we believe to be a better cash flow and higher rents.  
But I think that's the key. We're looking at the long-term economics here and we're doing that. I do think -- and clearly, over the last 4 quarters, we've seen much higher levels of new leasing than in the past. I think that's going to moderate a bit going forward. But we're looking at the long-term end game here and it's clearly the right economic decision to make."

Typically, these markets on an annual basis will outperform by 250 to 400 basis points. Last year, that compressed as there was less differentiation. That differentiation has returned.

But I think 10 years, it's got to be a pretty representative period because we had some early not-so-great years in industrial and the past couple of years have been really good.  
But I haven't done the CAGR, but if you do the CAGR between $14 billion and whatever, $60 billion-plus, it's got to be pretty impressive. The guys are trying to do the math. Anyway, you can do the math. It's certainly higher than what any valuation model will suggest, and I bet you it's higher than a lot of public company asset managers. It's 16% annual growth rate in third-party funds under management. 
And the limiter on that growth is not our ability to raise capital. We can go out there and raise gobs more capital than we have right now. It's just that we don't want to raise the capital if we think we don't have good deployment opportunities for it. So we don't want our Qs getting too long and investors to get frustrated, and we certainly don't want to have a big Q that forces dealmaking like we see in a lot of other places."

And we're pretty much working through the steel that's been hedged. So I don't think that's a big factor in forecasting margins going forward.  
My personal view is that some of the supply chain-related issues that have impacted material costs are going to subside. And there's a period out there a year or 2 years out, where maybe the steel price escalation could reverse and get back on a sort of normal inflationary trend once all the plants are back up and producing. But the most important thing affecting margins is what Gene mentioned a little while ago, which is that cap rates are compressing and rents are growing faster than land cost and replacement costs are going up. So the margins, if anything, are going to expand unless something material changes that I can't think of right now, particularly given the outlook for demand.  
And when someone asked Chris about the different sectors and all that, notably absent in his sectors was housing. Housing is still not anywhere near its potential, and it's a big consumer of warehouse space that hasn't even kicked in. And you know how low the housing inventory is and how much prices are going up in the housing sector. So I expect actually that to be an additional engine of growth for demand."

So I don't know the specifics for this quarter that you're looking at, but we can find that out. But it could be causing in options that we negotiated many, many moons ago. 
And finally, the infrastructure costs of improving land shows up as land. And it may not be actually new land, it may be just additional infrastructure on existing land. For example, in our Tracy Park, we're doing million-square-foot deals like they're going out of style. And along with that, we need to put the infrastructure in. And with that plan we bought in 2012, but that infrastructure shows up as a [ admissible ] land.
Finally, an increasing percentage of our land is covered land plays, and they have an income stream, and they pencil as investments even if we weren't going to scrape them and redevelop them down the road.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations.

Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations. Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces that continue to drive demand. At the same time, vacancies are at unprecedented lows. Space in our markets is effectively sold out. 
In the last 90 days, supply chain dislocations have become even more pronounced, with customers acting with a sense of urgency to secure the space they need. As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right locations has never been more mission critical to our customers. 
During the third quarter, we signed 56 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 84 million square feet. Spaces above 100,000 square feet are effectively fully leased. Our Last Touch segment continued to gain momentum, with new lease signings growing by 44%. E-commerce requirements continue to broaden across a range of industries, with this segment representing 1 quarter of new lease signings. The activity was down sequentially as anticipated, although remains above trend. 
Given the sharp ramp-up in demand, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 14% to a record 375 million square feet against deliveries of 285 million square feet, resulting in year-end vacancy reaching a new low of 4%. I want to point out that we revised our data set here this quarter to reflect only Prologis markets. 
As strong demand is being met with historic low vacancy, pre-leasing in the U.S. [ delivery ] pipeline has reached 70%, its highest level ever as customers continue to compete for space. 
Acute scarcity in our global markets is driving record rents and value growth. In the third quarter alone, rents grew 7.1% in our U.S. markets, far exceeding our expectations. We are increasing our 2021 market rent forecast significantly to an all-time high of 19% from the U.S. and 17% globally, both up approximately 700 basis points. 
Our in-place-to-market rent spread jumped 500 basis points in the quarter and is now approximately 22% with an upward bias. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI growth of more than $925 million or $1.25 per share. Record rent growth is translating to record valuation increases. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest quarterly increase in our history, rising 9.5% globally, bringing the year-to-date increase to an impressive 4% -- an impressive 24%. Sorry about that. 
We expect that the ongoing network reconfiguration and expansion required to meet consumer needs and minimize disruptions will fuel demand tailwinds over the next decade. 
Switching gears to results for the quarter. Core FFO was $1.04 per share with net promote earnings of $0.01. Rent change on rollover was strong at 27.9%, slightly lower sequentially due to mix. Average occupancy was 96.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially, and we reached 98% leased at quarter end. 
Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%, up 90 basis points sequentially. We had a very productive quarter on the deployment front. Margins on development stabilizations remain elevated, coming in at 47%. Our development starts were $1.4 billion, consisting of 31 projects across 21 markets with estimated value creation of more than $520 million. 
Turning to strategic capital. Our team raised almost $500 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Equity Qs for our open-ended vehicles were $3.4 billion at quarter end, another all-time high. 
Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved, and here are the key updates on an our share basis. We're tightening and increasing our cash same-store NOI growth to now range between 5.75% and 6%. We're increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, by $12.5 million and now range between $480 million and $485 million. We expect net promote income of $0.05 per share for the year, an increase of $0.03 from our prior guidance. 
In response to strong demand, we are increasing development starts by $450 million to a new midpoint of $3.7 billion. Our owned and managed land portfolio now supports 180 million square feet and more than $21 billion of future build-out potential, providing a clear runway for significant value creation over the next several years. We're also increasing the midpoint for acquisitions by $500 million. The increased pace of acquisitions relates to our focus on covered land plays and urban Last Touch opportunities. We now expect net deployment uses of $650 million at the midpoint. 
Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to $4.11 to $4.13 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.06 and $4.08 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 14% while deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. We expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow after dividends with a very conservative payout ratio in the low [ 60% ] range. 
While our year-to-date results have been extraordinary, most of the benefits from the current environment will accrue to the future. Our 22% in-place to market rent spread, the valuation impact on promotes, our leverage capacity, the $21 billion of development build-out, and most importantly, the vast opportunity set that our global footprint provides all paved the way for both significant and durable long-term growth. 
As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the disruptions within the supply chain won't be solved overnight. Prologis plays a unique role in the industry, and we're committed to helping find long-term solutions. That's why we're working closely with our customers, policymakers and community partners to help address the problems, which range from warehouse space to transport infrastructure to labor scarcity. 
In closing, I want to highlight 2 important upcoming Prologis events. First, this Monday, we'll be hosting a webinar that will dive into our development and strategic capital businesses. And second, on October 27, we're bringing together supply chain and community thought leaders to focus on some of the most pressing issues in logistics today, including workforce, energy and transportation. Please visit our website for more information and the registration links for both events. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Sarah for your questions."

So basically, what happened is think of it as a big long hose, and somebody turned off the water and the hose ran dry. And as the economies came back, that hose got open and production started, and it's now flowing through the supply chain. So it is not flowing smoothly, and the old models for predicting demand and carrying inventory are basically thrown out the window. So inventory, particularly mid-product inventory, not finished product inventory, sort of ends up piling up in different places because if there's one part missing into something, it's going to hold up the inventory. The other 99 parts have to be stored somewhere. So it's creating a pretty significant extra demand just to balance out the system given that the buffers are not predictable anymore. 
So the natural follow-up question from that, I would guess, would be, well, do you guys think about this being a onetime event or a sustainable event? And I would say this particular factor is likely to be a temporary, although probably do a 3-year type of process before everything straightens out. But right behind that are the 2 big structural drivers that on top of normal absorption, they include increased share of e-com and inventory levels being higher than the pandemic. And those 2 things people aren't even thinking about right now because they're struggling to keep their heads above water. 
So I think the short-term thing is really interesting. It's great for headlines and all that, but I think the much more interesting factor in terms of assessing the quality of our business is a long-term driver -- or the 2 long-term drivers of demand on top of the normal targets of the [indiscernible]."

But remember, cap rates are a function of 2 things. One is general returns available in other capital markets and the interest rates or risk-free rates. And more recently, the rent growth and the growth -- growing power of that initial yield is orders of magnitude higher than it's ever been. So I'm not smart enough to parse why cap rates are compressing. I suspect it has more to do with the embedded growth rate in the last 6 months than it does with interest rate picture. 
In fact, the interest rate picture, if anything, has increased. But the tremendous growth in rents, I think, has way exceeded the drag from slightly higher interest rates. Gene, what do you think?"

And that was underpinning what we said our GAAP same-store growth at that time was at 3.5% to 4.5%. Now here we are today at 22%, and when you think about that increase, that really takes the 3.5% to 4.5% to almost 4.5% to 5.5%. So that's the impact. We've really extended. 
Here we are almost 2 years later, and it's up dramatically, and our runway has arguably gotten even longer. So the underpinning of the organic growth potential that we have is sitting right there for you to see."

I'm not going to get into the details of what we've done with prebuying steel and other components on these projects, but I think we've mitigated quite a bit so far. We do see these markets kind of stabilizing at this point in time. 
And the other thing that we've done, which is really critical, is we've maintained our schedules. And I think today, I think we've picked up 30 days of schedule versus the market. And frankly, we build these buildings faster than the market anyway, but that's an incremental 30 days. So the supply chain disruptions aren't just cost. They're schedule. So I think your -- I mean, ultimately, you're getting to how much have we sort of mitigated. 
I've told you what we've done so far. We're probably out probably 6 months ahead of the curve, but you can't really get much further than that.

It's a very important business to us, and we'll continue to do that in a meaningful way. 
But the key to our growth is not external growth. Now we've done more external growth than anybody on the planet, but our key is not external growth. The key is internal growth. That comes from portfolio construction, and that comes from 20, 30, 40 years almost of meticulous steady work to build up these positions. And that's what's going to really in the long term drive earnings in this company and create value. 
The deployment is great. It's interesting. It enables us to get scale that drives down G&A ratios and creates value that way. It increases our liquidity, which reduces the cost of capital. It does all kinds of things. But at the end of the day, it's those location selections. 
Like look at all our 4, 5 M&A deals. Some of them probably -- between the 5 of them, we've sold probably 30%, maybe 35% of the assets because we just don't believe in those markets. We've kept the ones that we want. We could -- by the way, probably the right short-term decision with a band to keep those assets because cap rates have compressed [indiscernible].

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations. Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces",1031,"Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 
Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations. Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces that continue to drive demand. At the same time, vacancies are at unprecedented lows. Space in our markets is effectively sold out. 
In the last 90 days, supply chain dislocations have become even more pronounced, with customers acting with a sense of urgency to secure the space they need. As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right locations has never been more mission critical to our customers. 
During the third quarter, we signed 56 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 84 million square feet. Spaces above 100,000 square feet are effectively fully leased. Our Last Touch segment continued to gain momentum, with new lease signings growing by 44%. E-commerce requirements continue to broaden across a range of industries, with this segment representing 1 quarter of new lease signings. The activity was down sequentially as anticipated, although remains above trend. 
Given the sharp ramp-up in demand, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 14% to a record 375 million square feet against deliveries of 285 million square feet, resulting in year-end vacancy reaching a new low of 4%. I want to point out that we revised our data set here this quarter to reflect only Prologis markets. 
As strong demand is being met with historic low vacancy, pre-leasing in the U.S. delivery pipeline has reached 70%, its highest level ever as customers continue to compete for space. 
Acute scarcity in our global markets is driving record rents and value growth. In the third quarter alone, rents grew 7.1% in our U.S. markets, far exceeding our expectations. We are increasing our 2021 market rent forecast significantly to an all-time high of 19% from the U.S. and 17% globally, both up approximately 700 basis points. 
Our in-place-to-market rent spread jumped 500 basis points in the quarter and is now approximately 22% with an upward bias. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI growth of more than $925 million or $1.25 per share. Record rent growth is translating to record valuation increases. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest quarterly increase in our history, rising 9.5% globally, bringing the year-to-date increase to an impressive 4% -- an impressive 24%. Sorry about that. 
We expect that the ongoing network reconfiguration and expansion required to meet consumer needs and minimize disruptions will fuel demand tailwinds over the next decade. 
Switching gears to results for the quarter. Core FFO was $1.04 per share with net promote earnings of $0.01. Rent change on rollover was strong at 27.9%, slightly lower sequentially due to mix. Average occupancy was 96.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially, and we reached 98% leased at quarter end. 
Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%, up 90 basis points sequentially. We had a very productive quarter on the deployment front. Margins on development stabilizations remain elevated, coming in at 47%. Our development starts were $1.4 billion, consisting of 31 projects across 21 markets with estimated value creation of more than $520 million. 
Turning to strategic capital. Our team raised almost $500 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Equity [ cues ] for our open-ended vehicles were $3.4 billion at quarter end, another all-time high. 
Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved, and here are the key updates on an our share basis. We're tightening and increasing our cash same-store NOI growth to now range between 5.75% and 6%. We're increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, by $12.5 million and now range between $480 million and $485 million. We expect net promote income of $0.05 per share for the year, an increase of $0.03 from our prior guidance. 
In response to strong demand, we are increasing development starts by $450 million to a new midpoint of $3.7 billion. Our owned and managed land portfolio now supports 180 million square feet and more than $21 billion of future build-out potential, providing a clear runway for significant value creation over the next several years. We're also increasing the midpoint for acquisitions by $500 million. The increased pace of acquisitions relates to our focus on covered land plays and urban Last Touch opportunities. We now expect net deployment uses of $650 million at the midpoint. 
Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to $4.11 to $4.13 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.06 and $4.08 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 14% while deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. We expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow after dividends with a very conservative payout ratio in the low [ 60% ] range. 
While our year-to-date results have been extraordinary, most of the benefits from the current environment will accrue to the future. Our 22% in-place-to-market rent spread, the valuation impact on promotes, our leverage capacity, the $21 billion of development build-out, and most importantly, the vast opportunity set that our global footprint provides all paved the way for both significant and durable long-term growth. 
As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the disruptions within the supply chain won't be solved overnight. Prologis plays a unique role in the industry, and we're committed to helping find long-term solutions. That's why we're working closely with our customers, policymakers and community partners to help address the problems, which range from warehouse space to transport infrastructure to labor scarcity. 
In closing, I want to highlight 2 important upcoming Prologis events. First, this Monday, we'll be hosting a webinar that will dive into our development and strategic capital businesses. And second, on October 27, we're bringing together supply chain and community thought leaders to focus on some of the most pressing issues in logistics today, including workforce, energy and transportation. Please visit our website for more information and the registration links for both events. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Sarah for your questions."

So basically, what happened is think of it as a big long hose, and somebody turned off the water and the hose ran dry. And as the economies came back, that hose got opened and production started, and it's now flowing through the supply chain. So it is not flowing smoothly, and the old models for predicting demand and carrying inventory are basically thrown out the window. So inventory, particularly mid-product inventory, not finished product inventory, sort of ends up piling up in different places because if there's one part missing into something, it's going to hold up the inventory. The other 99 parts have to be stored somewhere. So it's creating a pretty significant extra demand just to balance out the system given that the buffers are not predictable anymore. 
So the natural follow-up question from that, I would guess, would be, well, do you guys think about this being a onetime event or a sustainable event? And I would say this particular factor is likely to be a temporary, although probably 2 or 3-year type of process before everything straightens out. But right behind that are the 2 big structural drivers that on top of normal absorption, they include increased share of e-com and inventory levels being higher than the pandemic. And those 2 things people aren't even thinking about right now because they're struggling to keep their heads above water. 
So I think the short-term thing is really interesting. It's great for headlines and all that, but I think the much more interesting factor in terms of assessing the quality of our business is a long-term driver -- or the 2 long-term drivers of demand on top of the normal targets of demand."

And Gene, I'm sure we'll have ideas about this. First of all, we're notoriously bad in predicting cap rates. We've been saying for about 5 years that they're too low, only to watch them go lower. But remember, cap rates are a function of 2 things. One is general returns available in other capital markets and the interest rates or risk-free rates. And more recently, the rent growth and the growth -- growing power of that initial yield is orders of magnitude higher than it's ever been. So I'm not smart enough to parse why cap rates are compressing. I suspect it has more to do with the embedded growth rate in the last 6 months than it does with interest rate picture. 
In fact, the interest rate picture, if anything, has increased. But the tremendous growth in rents, I think, has way exceeded the drag from slightly higher interest rates. Gene, what do you think?"

Even markets like Dallas that we historically would have discussed as -- or referred to as non-constrained in terms of land, believe it or not, are getting more constrained. I still [ don't count ] constrained, but they're more constrained certainly in the good locations. So I think the big driver is that it's just hard to come up with the land to build buildings on. 
I mean supply is responding to demand, but I will -- my gut feel -- and of course, you can't prove this one way or another, is that demand would be higher if supply were higher. I think people are just -- just based on the number of people competing for the same good spaces and all the inbound calls we get from all our good customers wanting to gain an advantage over another good customer, it is -- people are kind of in a panic mode almost when it comes to buying or committing to real estate.

It's leveraging the return on our capital, et cetera, et cetera. And we've got a good history and a good brand in that business. It's a very important business to us, and we'll continue to do that in a meaningful way. 
But the key to our growth is not external growth. Now we've done more external growth than anybody on the planet, but our key is not external growth. The key is internal growth. That comes from portfolio construction, and that comes from 20, 30, 40 years almost of meticulous steady work to build up these positions. And that's what's going to really in the long term drive earnings in this company and create value. 
The deployment is great. It's interesting. It enables us to get scale that drives down G&A ratios and creates value that way. It increases our liquidity, which reduces the cost of capital. It does all kinds of things. But at the end of the day, it's those location selections. 
Like look at all our 4, 5 M&A deals. Some of them probably -- between the 5 of them, we've sold probably 30%, maybe 35% of the assets because we just don't believe in those markets. We've kept the ones that we want. We could -- by the way, probably the right short-term decision would have been to keep those assets because cap rates have compressed. We -- Knowing what I know now, we should be more levered and have owned those assets. But frankly, that doesn't set us up as well for the long term. We'll make that up and then some in the long term by having the portfolio in the right place. So organic growth and the external growth is icing on the cake."

Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations. Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces that continue to drive demand. At the same time, vacancies are at unprecedented lows. 
Space in our markets is effectively sold out. In the last 90 days, supply chain dislocations have become even more pronounced, with customers acting with a sense of urgency to secure the space they need. As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right locations has never been more mission critical to our customers. 
During the third quarter, we signed 56 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 84 million square feet. Spaces above 100,000 square feet are effectively fully leased. Our Last Touch segment continued to gain momentum, with new lease signings growing by 44%. E-commerce requirements continue to broaden across a range of industries, with this segment representing 1 quarter of new lease signings. The activity was down sequentially as anticipated, although remains above trend. 
Given the sharp ramp-up in demand, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 14% to a record 375 million square feet against deliveries of 285 million square feet, resulting in year-end vacancy reaching a new low of 4%. I want to point out that we revised our data set here this quarter to reflect only Prologis markets. As strong demand is being met with historic low vacancy, pre-leasing in the U.S. delivery pipeline has reached 70%, its highest level ever as customers continue to compete for space. 
Acute scarcity in our global markets is driving record rents and value growth. In the third quarter alone, rents grew 7.1% in our U.S. markets, far exceeding our expectations. We are increasing our 2021 market rent forecast significantly to an all-time high of 19% from the U.S. and 17% globally, both up approximately 700 basis points. 
Our in-place-to-market rent spread jumped 500 basis points in the quarter and is now approximately 22% with an upward bias. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI growth of more than $925 million or $1.25 per share. Record rent growth is translating to record valuation increases. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest quarterly increase in our history, rising 9.5% globally, bringing the year-to-date increase to an impressive 4% -- an impressive 24%. Sorry about that. We expect that the ongoing network reconfiguration and expansion required to meet consumer needs and minimize disruptions will fuel demand tailwinds over the next decade. 
Switching gears to results for the quarter. Core FFO was $1.04 per share with net promote earnings of $0.01. Rent change on rollover was strong at 27.9%, slightly lower sequentially due to mix. Average occupancy was 96.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially, and we reached 98% leased at quarter end. Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%, up 90 basis points sequentially. 
We had a very productive quarter on the deployment front. Margins on development stabilizations remain elevated, coming in at 47%. Our development starts were $1.4 billion, consisting of 31 projects across 21 markets with estimated value creation of more than $520 million. 
Turning to strategic capital. Our team raised almost $500 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Equity [ cues ] for our open-ended vehicles were $3.4 billion at quarter end, another all-time high. 
Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved, and here are the key updates on an our share basis. We're tightening and increasing our cash same-store NOI growth to now range between 5.75% and 6%. We're increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, by $12.5 million and now range between $480 million and $485 million. We expect net promote income of $0.05 per share for the year, an increase of $0.03 from our prior guidance. 
In response to strong demand, we are increasing development starts by $450 million to a new midpoint of $3.7 billion. Our owned and managed land portfolio now supports 180 million square feet in more than $21 billion of future build-out potential, providing a clear runway for significant value creation over the next several years. We're also increasing the midpoint for acquisitions by $500 million. The increased pace of acquisitions relates to our focus on covered land plays and urban Last Touch opportunities. We now expect net deployment uses of $650 million at the midpoint. 
Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to $4.11 to $4.13 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.06 and $4.08 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 14% while deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. We expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow after dividends with a very conservative payout ratio below 60% range. 
While our year-to-date results have been extraordinary, most of the benefits from the current environment will accrue to the future. Our 22% in-place-to-market rent spread, the valuation impact on promotes, our leverage capacity, the $21 billion of development build-out, and most importantly, the vast opportunity set that our global footprint provides all paved the way for both significant and durable long-term growth. 
As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the disruptions within the supply chain won't be solved overnight. Prologis plays a unique role in the industry, and we're committed to helping find long-term solutions. That's why we're working closely with our customers, policymakers and community partners to help address the problems, which range from warehouse space to transport infrastructure to labor scarcity. 
In closing, I want to highlight 2 important upcoming Prologis events. First, this Monday, we'll be hosting a webinar that will dive into our development and strategic capital businesses. And second, on October 27, we're bringing together supply chain and community thought leaders to focus on some of the most pressing issues in logistics today, including workforce, energy and transportation. Please visit our website for more information and the registration links for both events. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Sarah for your questions."

So basically, what happened is think of it as a big long hose, and somebody turned off the water and the hose ran dry. And as the economies came back, that hose got opened and production started, and it's now flowing through the supply chain. 
So it is not flowing smoothly, and the old models for predicting demand and carrying inventory are basically thrown out the window. So inventory, particularly mid-product inventory, not finished product inventory, sort of ends up piling up in different places because if there's one part missing into something, it's going to hold up the inventory. The other 99 parts have to be stored somewhere. So it's creating a pretty significant extra demand just to balance out the system given that the buffers are not predictable anymore. 
So the natural follow-up question from that, I would guess, would be, well, do you guys think about this being a onetime event or a sustainable event? And I would say this particular factor is likely to be a temporary, although probably 2- or 3-year type of process before everything straightens out. But right behind that are the 2 big structural drivers that on top of normal absorption, they include increased share of e-com and inventory levels being higher than the [ pandemic ]. And those 2 things people aren't even thinking about right now because they're struggling to keep their heads above water. 
So I think the short-term thing is really interesting. It's great for headlines and all that, but I think the much more interesting factor in terms of assessing the quality of our business is a long-term driver -- or the 2 long-term drivers of demand on top of the normal targets of demand."

So I'm not smart enough to parse why cap rates are compressing. I suspect it has more to do with the embedded growth rate in the last 6 months than it does with interest rate picture. In fact, the interest rate picture, if anything, has increased. But the tremendous growth in rents, I think, has way exceeded the drag from slightly higher interest rates. Gene, what do you think?"

And you can have all the desire to bring on supply in L.A. or San Francisco or Seattle or even Inland Empire in -- certainly Inland Empire West or New Jersey, take all your good markets. If -- I mean how are you going to do it? There is no land, and their entitlement picture is getting to be harder and harder every day. Even markets like Dallas that we historically would have discussed as -- or referred to as nonconstrained in terms of land, believe it or not, are getting more constrained. I still wouldn't count them constrained, but they're more constrained certainly in the good locations. So I think the big driver is that it's just hard to come up with the land to build buildings on. 
I mean supply is responding to demand, but I will -- my gut feel -- and of course, you can't prove this one way or another, is that demand would be higher if supply were higher. I think people are just -- just based on the number of people competing for the same good spaces and all the inbound calls we get from all our good customers wanting to gain an advantage over another good customer, it is -- people are kind of in a panic mode almost when it comes to buying or committing to real estate.

Now here we are today at 22%, and when you think about that increase, that really takes the 3.5% to 4.5% to almost 4.5% to 5.5%. So that's the impact. We've really extended.

But the key to our growth is not external growth. Now we've done more external growth than anybody on the planet, but our key is not external growth. The key is internal growth.

And that's what's going to really in the long term drive earnings in this company and create value. 
The deployment is great. It's interesting. It enables us to get scale. That drives down G&A ratios and creates value that way. It increases our liquidity, which reduces the cost of capital. It does all kinds of things. But at the end of the day, it's those location selections. 
Like look at all our 4, 5 M&A deals. Some of them probably -- between the 5 of them, we've sold probably 30%, maybe 35% of the assets because we just don't believe in those markets. We've kept the ones that we want. We could have -- by the way, probably the right short-term decision would have been to keep those assets because cap rates have compressed.

Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations. Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces that continue to drive demand. At the same time, vacancies are at unprecedented lows. 
Space in our markets is effectively sold out. In the last 90 days, supply chain dislocations have become even more pronounced, with customers acting with a sense of urgency to secure the space they need. As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right locations has never been more mission critical to our customers. 
During the third quarter, we signed 56 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 84 million square feet. Spaces above 100,000 square feet are effectively fully leased. Our Last Touch segment continued to gain momentum, with new lease signings growing by 44%. E-commerce requirements continue to broaden across a range of industries, with this segment representing 1 quarter of new lease signings. The activity was down sequentially as anticipated, although remains above trend. 
Given the sharp ramp-up in demand, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 14% to a record 375 million square feet against deliveries of 285 million square feet, resulting in year-end vacancy reaching a new low of 4%. I want to point out that we revised our data set here this quarter to reflect only Prologis markets. As strong demand is being met with historic low vacancy, pre-leasing in the U.S. delivery pipeline has reached 70%, its highest level ever as customers continue to compete for space. 
Acute scarcity in our global markets is driving record rents and value growth. In the third quarter alone, rents grew 7.1% in our U.S. markets, far exceeding our expectations. We are increasing our 2021 market rent forecast significantly to an all-time high of 19% from the U.S. and 17% globally, both up approximately 700 basis points. 
Our in-place-to-market rent spread jumped 500 basis points in the quarter and is now approximately 22% with an upward bias. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI growth of more than $925 million or $1.25 per share. Record rent growth is translating to record valuation increases. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest quarterly increase in our history, rising 9.5% globally, bringing the year-to-date increase to an impressive 4% -- an impressive 24%. Sorry about that. We expect that the ongoing network reconfiguration and expansion required to meet consumer needs and minimize disruptions will fuel demand tailwinds over the next decade. 
Switching gears to results for the quarter. Core FFO was $1.04 per share with net promote earnings of $0.01. Rent change on rollover was strong at 27.9%, slightly lower sequentially due to mix. Average occupancy was 96.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially, and we reached 98% leased at quarter end. Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%, up 90 basis points sequentially. 
We had a very productive quarter on the deployment front. Margins on development stabilizations remain elevated, coming in at 47%. Our development starts were $1.4 billion, consisting of 31 projects across 21 markets with estimated value creation of more than $520 million. 
Turning to strategic capital. Our team raised almost $500 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Equity [ cues ] for our open-ended vehicles were $3.4 billion at quarter end, another all-time high. 
Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved, and here are the key updates on an our share basis. We're tightening and increasing our cash same-store NOI growth to now range between 5.75% and 6%. We're increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, by $12.5 million and now range between $480 million and $485 million. We expect net promote income of $0.05 per share for the year, an increase of $0.03 from our prior guidance. 
In response to strong demand, we are increasing development starts by $450 million to a new midpoint of $3.7 billion. Our owned and managed land portfolio now supports 180 million square feet in more than $21 billion of future build-out potential, providing a clear runway for significant value creation over the next several years. We're also increasing the midpoint for acquisitions by $500 million. The increased pace of acquisitions relates to our focus on covered land plays and urban Last Touch opportunities. We now expect net deployment uses of $650 million at the midpoint. 
Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to $4.11 to $4.13 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.06 and $4.08 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 14% while deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. We expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow after dividends with a very conservative payout ratio below 60% range. 
While our year-to-date results have been extraordinary, most of the benefits from the current environment will accrue to the future. Our 22% in-place-to-market rent spread, the valuation impact on promotes, our leverage capacity, the $21 billion of development build-out, and most importantly, the vast opportunity set that our global footprint provides all paved the way for both significant and durable long-term growth. 
As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the disruptions within the supply chain won't be solved overnight. Prologis plays a unique role in the industry, and we're committed to helping find long-term solutions. That's why we're working closely with our customers, policymakers and community partners to help address the problems, which range from warehouse space to transport infrastructure to labor scarcity. 
In closing, I want to highlight 2 important upcoming Prologis events. First, this Monday, we'll be hosting a webinar that will dive into our development and strategic capital businesses. And second, on October 27, we're bringing together supply chain and community thought leaders to focus on some of the most pressing issues in logistics today, including workforce, energy and transportation. Please visit our website for more information and the registration links for both events. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Sarah for your questions."

So basically, what happened is think of it as a big long hose, and somebody turned off the water and the hose ran dry. And as the economies came back, that hose got opened and production started, and it's now flowing through the supply chain. 
So it is not flowing smoothly, and the old models for predicting demand and carrying inventory are basically thrown out the window. So inventory, particularly mid-product inventory, not finished product inventory, sort of ends up piling up in different places because if there's one part missing into something, it's going to hold up the inventory. The other 99 parts have to be stored somewhere. So it's creating a pretty significant extra demand just to balance out the system given that the buffers are not predictable anymore. 
So the natural follow-up question from that, I would guess, would be, well, do you guys think about this being a onetime event or a sustainable event? And I would say this particular factor is likely to be a temporary, although probably 2- or 3-year type of process before everything straightens out. But right behind that are the 2 big structural drivers that on top of normal absorption, they include increased share of e-com and inventory levels being higher than the [ pandemic ]. And those 2 things people aren't even thinking about right now because they're struggling to keep their heads above water. 
So I think the short-term thing is really interesting. It's great for headlines and all that, but I think the much more interesting factor in terms of assessing the quality of our business is a long-term driver -- or the 2 long-term drivers of demand on top of the normal targets of demand."

First of all, we're notoriously bad in predicting cap rates. We've been saying for about 5 years that they're too low only to watch them go lower. But remember, cap rates are a function of 2 things. One is general returns available in other capital markets and the interest rates or risk-free rates. And more recently, the rent growth and the growth -- growing power of that initial yield is orders of magnitude higher than it's ever been. 
So I'm not smart enough to parse why cap rates are compressing. I suspect it has more to do with the embedded growth rate in the last 6 months than it does with interest rate picture. In fact, the interest rate picture, if anything, has increased. But the tremendous growth in rents, I think, has way exceeded the drag from slightly higher interest rates. Gene, what do you think?"

And you can have all the desire to bring on supply in L.A. or San Francisco or Seattle or even Inland Empire in -- certainly Inland Empire West or New Jersey, take all your good markets.

Even markets like Dallas that we historically would have discussed as -- or referred to as nonconstrained in terms of land, believe it or not, are getting more constrained. I still wouldn't count them constrained, but they're more constrained certainly in the good locations. So I think the big driver is that it's just hard to come up with the land to build buildings on. 
I mean supply is responding to demand, but I will -- my gut feel -- and of course, you can't prove this one way or another, is that demand would be higher if supply were higher. I think people are just -- just based on the number of people competing for the same good spaces and all the inbound calls we get from all our good customers wanting to gain an advantage over another good customer, it is -- people are kind of in a panic mode almost when it comes to buying or committing to real estate.

And frankly, we build these buildings faster than the market anyway, but that's an incremental 30 days. So the supply chain disruptions aren't just cost. They're schedule. 
So I think you're -- I mean, ultimately, you're getting to how much have we sort of mitigated. I've told you what we've done so far. We're probably out probably 6 months ahead of the curve, but you can't really get much further than that. So I feel really good about what we've done this year, and I feel like we're prepared really well going forward. So we feel good about the outlook. And obviously, we're raising guidance in our volumes."

And we've seen this -- really proud over the last several years where 3PLs might have viewed space as a bit of a commodity many years ago. Today, they are viewing it as an offensive weapon to help accommodate their customers, and we're seeing this play out in the form of them leasing more space than they have underlying customers lined up for because they need that space to attract the customers. And we are seeing them go for longer-term leases, both of which are good signs of the health of this business, and a whole lot of that is driven by the e-commerce segment, which continues to be very diversified way over and above just Amazon."

You guys were able to do just under $400 million at your share during the quarter at a 5% cap rate, and you increased guidance pretty significantly. Can you just talk about what caused that cap rate on deals during the quarter to be higher than we've seen in a while? Is that just a mix issue? Or are you guys finding more opportunities to maybe acquire off market?

With respect to the confidence in the future, I mean, frankly, as Hamid said earlier on, we're -- we had a $330 million quarter. We might have a $2 billion quarter. We may have a 0. It really depends on what's out there, what's available to us. And we have confidence because -- in the next quarter because we have a lot of irons already in the fire. But confidence long term, who knows? I mean if these returns begin to completely blow out over replacement cost, you're not going to see us as active. Yet if there's a strategic opportunity, we may have a quarter that's 10x the quarter we had this. So it's -- acquisitions are hard to forecast. They should be hard to forecast, frankly."

But there's also another 2, I think, important differences between us and others. First of all, our playing pen is the globe. And that's lots of different ways to deploy capital than just in the U.S. Now I'm not saying, by the way, Europe is any easier, but I'm just saying we have really multiple ways of deploying capital. 
And secondly, a lot of the incremental capital that's coming to the business is from allocators. It's from people that basically go and buy existing products. And we can buy substandard product that's well located and then fix it. And that -- even though there's competition in that too, but the number of players in that fix-it market hasn't grown as much as the number of market players in the -- I buy office buildings, some malls today and now I'm going to buy a warehouse because it's cool.

It's just that those populations are still growing.

I mean there's a lot of data on this. And maybe, Chris, you want to elaborate on this.

I think if we think about it, the reasons for being in the private capital business are beyond scale. I mean they're mitigating currency exposure. It's leveraging the return on our capital, et cetera, et cetera. And we've got a good history and a good brand in that business. It's a very important business to us, and we'll continue to do that in a meaningful way. 
But the key to our growth is not external growth. Now we've done more external growth than anybody on the planet, but our key is not external growth. The key is internal growth. That comes from portfolio construction, and that comes from 20, 30, 40 years almost of meticulous steady work to build up these positions. And that's what's going to really in the long term drive earnings in this company and create value. 
The deployment is great. It's interesting. It enables us to get scale. That drives down G&A ratios and creates value that way. It increases our liquidity, which reduces the cost of capital. It does all kinds of things. But at the end of the day, it's those location selections. 
Like look at all our 4, 5 M&A deals. Some of them probably -- between the 5 of them, we've sold probably 30%, maybe 35% of the assets because we just don't believe in those markets. We've kept the ones that we want. We could have -- by the way, probably the right short-term decision would have been to keep those assets because cap rates have compressed. We -- knowing what I know now, we should be more levered and have owned those assets. But frankly, that doesn't set us up as well for the long term. We'll make that up and then some in the long term by having the portfolio in the right place. So organic growth, and the external growth is icing on the cake."
